Importantly, hippocampal volumetry offers an attractive marker to quantify pathoanatomical changes and delineate functional changes across the continuum of AD progression (Dubois et al., 2007) . It has been proposed for use in putative AD-modifying therapeutic trials, as both an in vivo marker of disease progression and to select candidate patients for study enrichment (Hampel et al., 2010) . Moreover, radiological assessment of the hippocampus was recently endorsed by the new mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD diagnostic guidelines (McKhann et al., 2011) .\nRecent automated hipppocampal segmentation techniques are commonly based on a priori anatomical characteristics and encompass several strategies, which furnish volumetric and/or surface based information (Collins and Pruessner, 2010; Hu et al., 2011; Leung et al., 2010; Lotjonen et al., 2011; Patenaude et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011b) . In particular, techniques using multi-atlas registration and fusion strategies generate some of the best accuracies among automated methods to-date Collins and Pruessner, 2010; Leung et al., 2010; Lotjonen et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011b; Wolz et al., 2010a) Multi-atlas techniques use a series of structural MRIs that have been labeled by an expert operator (atlas library), which are then selectively registered to an unseen or query subject's MRI. The technique is based on three principal steps that include (1) atlas-to-target (query) MRI similarity matching, (2) image registration with binary label mapping to the target MRI and (3) label fusion. This framework requires only a single 3-dimensional high-resolution T1-weighted MRI acquisition, and is suitable for segmenting the hippocampus from large prospective studies and legacy MRI datasets. Template libraries can be customized for pathological studies in epilepsy (Hammers et al., 2007) and AD (Leung et al., 2010) , effectively capturing the significant morphological variation that occurs in both disease processes. Moreover, advances in diffeomorphic registration algorithms (Avants et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2009 ) may provide improved label mapping to target images compared to other registration techniques. Although multi-atlas fusion methods are computationally more expensive than some automated techniques, improvements in server memory and parallel processing can significantly expedite segmentation.\nThere are several degrees of freedom within a multi-template based approach, which may impact accuracy including atlas assembly, template-to-target matching scheme, registration parameters (affine + nonlinear), label hybridization and false positive minimization. A number of recent methods have focused on improving atlas selection, label fusion strategy and post-fusion modifications, showing equivocal outcomes. For example, (Leung et al., 2010) compared accuracy across label combination methods for the Multi-Atlas Propagation Segmentation (MAPS) tool including shape-based average (SBA) (Rohlfing and Maurer, 2007) , voxel-wise voting and Simultaneous Truths and Probability Label Estimation (STAPLE) (Warfield et al., 2004) , with STAPLE achieving the best performance, although (Robitaille and Duchesne, 2012) reported that SBA frequently outperformed both STAPLE and vote method. Techniques also use graph-cuts and morphological operations to improve label mapping (van der Lijn et al., 2008) . Other work has compared registration methods for subcortical segmentation, demonstrating that nonlinear label propagation methods furnish greater accuracy than rigid and affine normalization (Barnes et al., 2008; Leung et al., 2010) .\nDespite these advances, there remains significant variation in atlas construction among multi-template driven techniques, which are commonly developed and validated using in-house manual tracing datasets. The hippocampus has been historically defined using various cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and landmark-based boundaries, and can be labeled in various stereotactic spaces (e.g. normalization to brain templates and reorientation along either the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line or the long hippocampal axis) (Boccardi et al., 2011) . In fact a recent literature review by Konrad and colleagues identified 71 hippocampal tracing methods. Indeed, the absolute volume differences between certain protocols may vary by > 30% (Konrad et al., 2009) . Additionally, hippocampal atlas libraries use varying template numbers, combine tracings by multiple operators, include/exclude certain pathologiesall of which prevent direct performance assessments among protocols. In dementia the relative positions of anatomical landmarks can change in the atrophic subcortex, which may confound landmark driven delineation. When taken together, these issues complicate direct comparisons among techniques to determine an optimal definition for atlas-driven segmentation.\nAccordingly, to directly measure the performance of different anatomical definitions for atlas-based segmentation, a study design should satisfy certain minimum requirements. First, a common pipeline should be used for label generation. Second, hippocampal labels must be derived from a common dataset (library); third, a single expert operator should label all template MRIs for consistency, and finally, these atlases should be validated against common datasets. Only a few studies in AD have compared different automated hippocampal segmentation methods using a common dataset (Holland et al., 2011; Leung et al., 2010; Mouiha et al., 2011; Wolz et al., 2010b) , although these studies were usually based on numeric summary data, unique algorithms and various structural priors. In addition, previous direct volumetric-based comparisons of the hippocampus have been limited by sample size and/or survey only a few methods (Carmichael et al., 2005) .\nTo the authors' knowledge, there have been no head-to-head morphometric comparisons of template protocols for multi-template hippocampal segmentation techniques that satisfy all of the abovementioned criteria and therefore performance across template protocols remains unclear. Thus, the primary goal of the current study is to directly evaluate whether morphological variation among 5 structurally unique and commonly deployed hippocampal labeling protocols modulates the accuracy and sensitivity of automated multi-atlas segmentation in AD, using the entire baseline and 24-month Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) MRI database .\nTo investigate these relationships, we developed a fully automated multi-atlas segmentation technique that provides a robust platform to evaluate performance among anatomically unique labeling protocols. We refer to this method as the SunnyBrook Hippocampal Volumetry (SBHV) Tool. A single expert operator created 5 template libraries that were selected from 12 protocols investigated by the hippocampal harmonization initiative : Protocol 1 (P1) (Haller et al., 1997) ; Protocol 2 (P2) (Killiany et al., 1993) ; Protocol 3 (P3) (Malykhin et al., 2007) ; Protocol 4 (P4) (Pruessner et al., 2000) , and Protocol 5 (P5) (Pantel et al., 2000) . This is a large multi-national project sponsored by the ADNI, the European Alzheimer Disease Consortium (EADC), non-profit organizations and industry partners that are working towards a consensus definition to manually label the hippocampus in-vivo . A detailed description of the project methodology and results is available from www.hippocampalprotocol.net/SOPs. In the present study, all five template libraries were manually segmented from a set of 50 in-house acquired highresolution T1-weighted MRI scans that included normal elderly controls (NC), AD, AD with small vessel disease (AD + SVD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed dementia (VaD+ AD). All previously reported template libraries in AD are based on ADNI-1 data or other pure AD samples (Barnes et al., 2008; Leung et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011b; Wolz et al., 2010b) . The rationale for including several diagnostic groups was to include more representative morphological variation and improve generalizability to a tertiary memory clinic cohort. Indeed, population-based studies suggest that AD and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) together account for 80% of dementia cases, with mixed AD plus superimposed CVD accounting for 38% in a community autoposy study (Schneider et al., 2007) . Moreover, an ADNI-1 study by Carmichael and colleagues reported compelling evidence that white matter disease predicts 1-year cognitive decline in MCI and AD (Carmichael et al., 2010) .\nThe specific objectives were to directly compare 5 commonly used hippocampal segmentation protocols within an automated multitemplate fusion framework by (i) assessment of voxel-wise similarity to ground truth manual labels within and across diagnostic groups, (ii) compare differences in baseline volumes and baseline normalized atrophy rates, (iii) compare neurocognitive-anatomical correlations and (iv) compare differences among samples sizes required to detect a 25% reduction in the rate of MCI-and AD-type hippocampal atrophy in a hypothetical disease-modifying therapeutic trial. Voxel-wise accuracy was evaluated for each automated protocol using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) analysis on a large in-house dataset and further cross-validated using a random selection of 30 manual tracings derived from NC, patients with MCI and patients with AD that participated in the ADNI-1 study. Finally, all available baseline and 24-month ADNI-1 datasets were segmented using the 5 automated methods. We chose 24 months as our longitudinal interval, as this has been previously recommend for measuring disease progression in AD ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects Sunnybrook", "text": "A total of 50 subjects' 1.5 Tesla 3D high-resolution MRI scans were used to generate a library of MRI templates and were selected from over 1000 subjects participating in the longitudinal Sunnybrook Dementia Study (Pettersen et al., 2008) , here on referred to as the Sunnybrook dataset.

First, a detailed set of author endorsed standard operating procedures (SOPs) were downloaded from the harmonization project website: www. hippocampal-protocol.net. These procedures provided a detailed description and slice-by-slice delineation of the anatomical boundaries on a T1-weighted high resolution MRI of a normal elder and person with AD. All protocols in AC-PC space were selected to (1) control for potential confounds between different stereotactic orientations, (2) capture sufficient morphological variation between label methods and (3) reduce the number of manual tracings performed by a single operator (S.N.). For a detailed description of the five hippocampal SOPs refer to www.hippocampal-protocol.net/SOPs. The basic differences between protocols are summarized in Table 1 . To improve label accuracy, the (Duvernoy, 1998) hippocampal atlas was additionally used for neuroanatomical reference.\nThe hippocampal standardization project has harmonized semantic differences across methods and distilled the hippocampus into sub-compartments (Boccardi et al., 2011) . The current study does not attempt to parcellate the hippocampus. In contrast, we adhered to the author endorsed SOPs to provide accurate delineation and allow comparison to previous studies. However, there were a number of author-supported modifications to the original manual methods that were annotated in the harmonization project SOPs; these modifications were applied to assemble the 5 atlas libraries. Most notably the volumes based on the criteria (i.e. P4) (Pruessner et al., 2000) were not pre-normalized to Talairach space, enabling direct comparison between protocols. Further, the label sets based on (Pantel et al., 2000) (P5) excluded the alveus and fimbria as per the author endorsed SOP.\nThe 50 T1-weighted MRI atlases were constructed using ANALYZE software. The same window-leveling procedure was used to ensure consistent contrast for labeling. Specifically, for each image the window-level was set until the choroid-plexus within the lateral ventricles was just visible in coronal section. The tracings were viewed in three orthogonal viewports (sagittal, coronal, and axial) to improve segmentation accuracy, prevent partial volume effects and insure inter-slice consistency. However, each template was traced principally in the coronal orientation. The axial plane was also used to assess the amygdalar-hippocampal boundary, and the sagittal plane was also used to detect boundaries where appropriate.\nEach template MRI and associated binary hippocampal tracing was flipped along the x-coordinate so that a set of mirror image templates was produced according to previously published methods (Collins and Pruessner, 2010) .

The second labeler is an experienced neuroradiologist with over 20-years of experience with manual tracing procedures. All intra-and inter-rater reliability coefficients (ICCs) were computed using a random two-way mixed effects design (Fleiss, 1986) in SPSS 12.0 software, SPSS Incorporated.

Similarly, each query subject's T1-weighted MRI underwent an affine transformation and was interpolated into MNI 152 template space. A local template matching strategy was applied for assessing similarity between each template and the query image over a predefined right and left volume of interest (VOI). The VOIs encompassed the entire hippocampal formation and adjacent MTL anatomy. Crosscorrelation was used locally within the MTL VOIs to compare the voxel intensities of each template to the query image for similarity and ranking, which has been previously demonstrated as an appropriate similarity measure for the hippocampus and has been applied to ADNI-1 data (Leung et al., 2010) .

For the LOOCV experiment (Table 5) , the median DSCs (IQR) in order of protocol inclusivity (greatest to least inclusive) were P5 = 0.88 (0.02), P3 = 0.88 (0.02), P4= 0.88 (0.03), P1 = 0.86 (0.04) and P2 = 0.85 (0.04).

Median DSCs were modestly improved by approximately 1-3 percentage points across all protocols for all groups in comparison to the LOOCV (Table 6) . Moreover, ICC values were comparable to the LOOCV when volumes were pooled across groups (Table 6) , and ICCs were lower in both NC and MCI versus AD.

The average SBHV hippocampal volumes for P1-5 are reported in Table 7 , and when protocols were ordered from greatest to least, were ranked P5> P3> P4> P1> P2, which was congruous with the anatomical definitions described in Table 1 . The Bland-Altman plots in Fig. 2 show that there was a small volume-bias in the LOOCV across atlas protocols. Specifically, SBHV modestly underestimated the ground truth volume on average. Moreover, there appeared to be a small bias towards the mean, as the smaller hippocampi were consistently larger than the manual segmentations, with the exception of P4. Table 7 shows that the median NVD was low across all protocols for the LOOCV analysis (range: 5.05-7.96%). There was a trend towards lower NVDs as protocols integrated more hippocampal anatomy. Indeed, for the LOOCV dataset median (IQR) NVDs when ranked from the greatest to the least inclusive protocol were P5 =5.14 (7.58), P3=5.05 (6.96), P4= 6.43 (9.82), P1=6.23 (7.25) and P2= 7.96 (8.77).\nADNI-1 cross-validation dataset. The range of right hippocmapal volumes for the ADNI-1 validation was greater than the Sunnybrook LOOCV, which also included bilateral hippocampal labels. When all groups were pooled, the ADNI-1 NVD values were similar to the LOOCV dataset. For P1 and P4 the NVD values were lower in AD versus MCI and NC. However, volume differences were consistently greater for P2 across all groups. Further, the ADNI-1 SBHV segmentations demonstrated a similar pattern of protocol-wise bias to the LOOCV, as Fig. 3 shows Table 2 A basic outline of major anatomical hippocampal boundaries for 5/12 protocols surveyed by (Boccardi et al., 2011 ) and used to generate 5 SBHV multi-atlas libraries.

For the LOOCV study there was a greater proportion of FN (volume underestimation) versus FP (volume overestimation) labels.\ni) Caudal region: The most pronounced segmentation errors were localized to the caudal/posterior hippocampus. Caudal underestimation was most conspicuous for P2, which used the crus of the fornix as a boundary landmark (Fig. 4) , P1 also suffered from caudal underestimation in comparison to definitions which segmented the first ovoid mass of posterior grey matter (i.e. P3-P5). There was some overestimation of the superior-posterior hippocampus across protocols, which labeled portions of the crus of the fornix ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). For P4, the posterior medial compartment demonstrated greater FP and FN errors compared to P3 and P5. This error was attributable to the manually placed vertical line used to separate the gyrus fasciolaris and Andreas-Retzius gyrus. Moreover, this may partially explain the high variance in NVD realized for the P4 LOOCV analysis. ii) Anterior region: The anterior hippocampus suffered from moderate underestimation and overestimation equally across protocols.\niii) Dorsal border: Protocols 1 and P2 excised the alveus and fimbria located on the dorsal hippocampal surface. The greywhite matter interface for this compartment suffered from low contrast resolution and partial volume effects for both datasets at the acquired 1.5 Tesla in-plane resolutions. SBHV slightly overestimated the medial anterior-superior white matter compartment for P1 and P2, resulting in a modest volume underestimation (Fig. 5) ; whereas, SBHV overestimated this compartment for P1 and P2 throughout the body and tail to a greater extent than P3-P5 (Fig. 6 ). iv) Inferior border: All protocols showed some background labeling of the parahippocampal white matter, resulting in a slight overestimation of the inferior hippocampus (Fig. 7) . v) Medial region: In addition, the medial compartment was occasionally mislabeled by SBHV. Automatic segmentation modestly underestimated the posterior medial subiculum (i.e. excluding the presubiculum) among more medially inclusive protocols (i.e. P1 and P5). However, protocols that used an oblique line to separate the parahippocampal gyrus from the subiculum Table 4 Inter-(n=5) and intra-rater (n=10) Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) and interquartile ranges (IQR), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for bilateral manual hippocampal tracings on Sunnybrook 1.5 T MRI scans.

Specifically, there were fewer inferomedial errors observed for the AD group versus the MCI and NC group (Fig. 9 ).

What distinguishes this study from previous atlas comparisons in AD is the large number of unique hippocampal atlas libraries that were generated by the first author -5 hippocampal libraries totaling 500 manual hippocampal tracings. Moreover, this was the first atlas library in AD to include a more heterogeneous sample of AD pathologies including patients with VaD and SVD, which is important if an automated tool is to be applied clinically or to large cohort studies in AD. This automatic framework coupled with the entire ADNI-1 baseline and 24-month dataset, enabled the largest automated head-to-head comparison of hippocampal atlas protocols in AD to-date and the first of its kind to assess voxel-wise accuracy and voxel-wise error distributions among anatomically distinct multi-atlas libraries. Here we report a number of important biomarker performance-based findings among the 5 atlas protocols tested including: group-wise discrimination, differential accuracy and association with cognition. We also describe how both multi-template segmentation accuracy and inclusivity among the protocols sampled may influence hippocampal biomarker performance in MCI and AD. Fig. 5 .

All protocols demonstrated high accuracy in comparison to manual tracings across both the LOOCV and ADNI-1 datasets. One of the principal findings of this study was that the accuracy of automated hippocampal segmentation appears to be modulated by morphological definition. The most inclusive protocols (P3-P5) demonstrated the highest accuracies in the LOOCV (DSC = 0.88, 0.88 and 0.89 respectively), and were not significantly different. The DSC values were modestly improved across all protocols in the ADNI-1 validation over the LOOCV; however, there were differences between datasets, which may explain these findings. First, the LOOCV contained greater heterogeneity among disease profiles (i.e. VaD, AD, mixed AD, AD with SVD and NC) when compared to the ADNI-1 NC, MCI and AD participants. A recent study by (Scher et al., 2011) reported differential patterns of hippocampal atrophy across dementia subgroups (AD versus VaD), and this morphological heterogeneity may have contributed to the greater protocol-wise DSC measures observed in the ADNI-1 sample versus the LOOCV. Moreover, the diagnostic group was shown to modulate both DSC and NVD in our ADNI-1 validation. Second, the ADNI-1 validation only compared n = 30 right hippocampal volumes per protocol versus n = 70 right + left volumes for the LOOCV. Although not reported in the results, right hippocampal segmentations demonstrated a \u00bd percentage point improvement in median DSC over left labels for the LOOCV. Finally, the median volumes were slightly larger for the ADNI-1 NC and MCI validation groups compared to the LOOCV dataset, which may have biased the ADNI-1 DSC results. Despite these experimental differences, the ADNI-1 validation reflected the same rank order of protocol-wise DSC accuracy, comparable DSC variation within protocols and similar FP/FN error distributions to those observed in the Sunnybrook LOOCV.\nDefinition of the posterior border was most variable between protocols, and upon visual inspection of the FN/FP error maps, was frequently underestimated by SBHV, with occasional inclusion (overestimation) of the fornix. Certain hippocampal protocols use landmarks to determine the posterior border (Bartzokis et al., 1998; deToledo-Morrell et al., 2004; Jack, 1994; Killiany et al., 1993; Watson et al., 1992) . And although manually identified landmarks were designed to improve inter-and intra-labeler precision, automated reproducibility of these rule-based boundaries appears to be less accurate in heterogeneous cohorts (e.g. elders and AD). For example, P4 used an orthogonal pair of lines to manually define the hippocampal tail from the surrounding parenchyma, which SBHV failed to consistently reproduce. Moreover, protocols that truncated caudal regions of the hippocampus (P1 and P2) tended to suffer from greater posterior volume underestimation. The most extreme example was P2 (Killiany et al., 1993) , which excluded significant portions of the hippocampal tail posterior to where the crus of the fornix was visible in full profile. In dementia, there is frequently thalamic atrophy that can modulate where an operator defines the posterior boundary, often more rostral when atrophy is present, and a registration algorithm may not appropriately capture this boundary shift.\nStrengthening these observations, (Carmichael et al., 2005) found marked label error along the posterior hippocampus, and this finding was also observed using a multi-atlas based method in MCI and AD (Leung et al., 2010) . In a recent multi-atlas hippocampal segmentation study, which examined spatial bias in voting-based label fusion, the greatest error (automatic label underestimation) was realized for convex regions of the hippocampus, particularly in the posterior and anterior regions (Wang and Yushkevich, 2012) . However, the small bias towards the mean observed for atrophic hippocampi in the LOOCV and ADNI-1 study suggests that volume underestimation may be less pronounced in smaller hippocampi. We did not explicitly test the effect of registering small versus large templates to an atrophic hippocampus. Inclusion of a weighted voting strategy may also reduce averaging bias. Alternatively, a greater number of atrophic hippocampi may also reduce the affect of heterogeneous template fusion. The next most variable region among protocols was the dorsal hippocampal border (i.e. alveus and fimbria white matter compartment). Protocols that excluded the alveus and fimbria (P1 and P2) were significantly less accurate and had greater DSC variation than structures including these dorsal white matter compartments (P3-P5). Visual inspection of error distribution maps revealed a pattern of greater SBHV FP errors along the superior hippocampal body and FN errors at the anterior-superior pole for both P1 and P2, which were generated from the low contrast realized at this grey-white matter interface.\nFurther visual inspection of FN/FP error maps revealed that certain hippocampi were mislabeled along the inferomedial border, which has been previously reported in (van der Lijn et al., 2008) . A thin layer of white matter separates the hippocampus from the parahippocampl parenchyma, and occasionally, the SBHV tool segmented these background structures across protocols. However, intensity based thresholding reduced FP labels, and comparable accuracy was achieved among protocols that predominantly varied by medial definition (e.g. P3 versus P5).\nFor our ADNI-1 voxel-overlap comparisons, there were significant protocol-wise DSC differences within groups, but only the AD group showed significant differences among all protocols sampled. More inclusive protocols always outperformed less inclusive definitions in AD (P4 > P1 > P2). However, in MCI only the most inclusive protocol (P4) outperformed the least inclusive P2, while in NC, P2 was less accurate than the more inclusive P1 and P4. This suggests that more inclusive protocols (i.e. that include the alveus/fimbria and > hippocampal tail) provide superior accuracy across groups, and protocol accuracy as a function of structural assembly appears to matter most in AD. Indeed, our findings shown in Fig. 8 strengthen this notion, demonstrating greater voxel-wise error differences between protocols in AD versus MCI and NC.\nIt is important to note that FP/FN at the boundary of smaller volumes can have a larger impact on voxel-wise similarity metrics in comparison to more inclusive structures, and may partially explain the lower DSC values for P1 and P2 in comparison to P3-P5. Moreover, the ADNI-1 MCI and AD validation samples had a greater median Fig. 8 .

The color masks represent voxel-wise FN counts (underestimation) across P1, P2 and P4 (rows) and NC/MCI/AD ADNI-1 groups (columns), projected onto the Sunnybrook average elderly 100-brain template. Note, the P2 posterior border started more anterior to P1 and P4. Caudal FN error distributions for the ADNI-1 validation are similar to those observed in the LOOCV. Qualitatively, caudal FN distributions between protocols varied the most in AD, and within the AD sample all protocols showed significantly different median Dice similarity measures (P4> P1 > P2). Further, P2 demonstrated the greatest caudal error as a result of the landmark-based definition used to demarcate the posterior border. For within protocol comparisons, only P4 demonstrated significantly different voxel-wise accuracy measurements between groups (AD > NC). Fig. 9 .

The color masks represent voxel-wise FP counts (overestimation) projected onto the Sunnybrook average elderly 100-brain template. Note that the FP error count was greater along the inferomedial hippocampus in NC and MCI than AD, which may partially explain the lower Dice similarity results in NC and MCI versus AD. absolute volume in comparison to the median volume of the Sunnybrook LOOCV, which may have partially contributed to the higher DSC ADNI-1 validation results. Indeed, (Patenaude et al., 2011) reported lower DSC values for small structures such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus in comparison to larger subcortical compartments including the putamen, caudate and thalamus. However, the FP and FN error maps in the current study revealed greater absolute posterior and superior labeling errors for P1 and P2 than the more inclusive P3-P5, suggesting that lower DSC values are driven to a larger extent by protocol definition versus the well-known bias of measuring smaller structures.\nInterestingly, in the current study, persons with AD despite having significantly smaller hippocampi and greater surface-area-to-volume ratios than NC demonstrated comparable segmentation results to normal elders. One explanation for this inconsistent finding may be that the enlarged CSF compartment (cistern, choroid fissure and inferior horns) surrounding atrophic hippocampi improved delineation along the complete lateral extent, superior parenchymal surface, and amygdalar-hippocampal interface, facilitating more robust registration outcomes. Additionally, SBHV segmentation accuracy along the inferior border was improved in AD versus NC, which may also support these findings.\nADNI provides a platform for direct quantitative comparisons among segmentation methods in AD. Since its inception, there have been numerous head-to-head comparisons of hippocampal segmentation algorithms (see (Weiner et al., 2012) for a detailed review), and across these studies, much attention has been focused on algorithmic differences. As manual \"ground-truth\" labels are not widely available, definitive performance evaluation among atlas protocols and automated methods in general, is complicated without consistent manual labels for each protocol on the same MRI dataset. Thus, comparisons across previous validation studies should be interpreted cautiously. Here we compare our voxel-overlap results to multi-template studies based on similar manual protocols. In particular, we replicated DSC measures of a validation study in healthy adults by (Collins and Pruessner, 2010) , using a smaller atlas library with greater pathological heterogeneity. Moreover, this result was achieved with a modified version of the labeling criteria developed by (Pruessner et al., 2000) (P4), as our protocol defined the hippocampus along the AC-PC line without normalization to Talairach space. Additionally, we used the SyN nonlinear registration whereas Collins and Pruessner used an elastic registration method (Collins et al., 1995) .\nWe also demonstrated comparable results to previous studies of multi-atlas based segmentation that employ other anatomical definitions: Fig. 10 .

After semantic harmonization of current multi-atlas protocols in Table 11 , there are only a few widely used protocols for multi-atlas segmentation to-date. All methods include the alveus/fimbria and similarly define the anterior border. Protocols principally differ by inclusion/exclusion of the caudal pole and medial compartment. Unfortunately, there is no clear relationship between structural definition and voxel-overlap in the literature, partly owing to algorithmic and validation sample differences. Among state-of-the-art methods, DSCs ranged between 0.83-0.91, and (Wang et al., 2011b) demonstrated the highest accuracies to-date, also using the SyN registration tool. However, the investigators derived their gold standard labels from manually corrected automatic volumes and adjusted automated labels using a learning based wrapper. In summary, SBHV with the P3, P4 or P5 library achieves high voxel-overlap compared to manual labels both within a large multi-centre study and a diverse memory clinic cohort that is consistent with recent work in dementia."}, {"section_title": "Manual vs. automatic segmentation volume differences", "text": "We also tested volumetric differences between manual and automated labels, and our data show that all 5 automated protocols tended to underestimate absolute volumes for both the Sunnybrook LOOCV and the ADNI-1 derived manual volumes. Additionally, the error distribution maps revealed a similar pattern of FN labels compared to the LOOCV dataset. The higher variation in NVD for P4 in the LOOCV and ADNI-1 AD validation may be partially explained by the orthogonal lines used to demarcate the posterior compartment.\nIn certain subjects, this compartment was inconstantly labeled by SBHV, generating greater NVDs.\nOver all, automatic-manual volumetric similarity amongst the assessed protocols was congruous with previous multi-atlas work in healthy adults (Collins and Pruessner, 2010 ) (NVD= 4.9%), right temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (absolute volume = 3134 mm 3 manual vs. 3301 mm 3 automatic) and AD (Leung et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011b ) (absolute volume difference = 56-81 mm 3 ). When volumetric accuracies are taken together with voxel-wise overlap outcomes, these results suggest that more inclusive protocols furnish superior accuracy versus conservative atlas definitions, especially in AD and diagnostically heterogeneous samples. Our results also support the notion that SBHV voxel-wise segmentation accuracy is lower in more diagnostically heterogeneous samples (i.e. Sunnybrook versus ADNI-1). Finally, SBHV + a more anatomically inclusive template library provides high fidelity segmentation accuracy when compared to expert tracings and so is a suitable method to replace manual segmentation for both the analysis of large multi-centre AD studies and for use in a general memory clinic cohort, with the caveat that image quality must be sufficient to perform unbiased registration."}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal group-wise volumetric comparisons for the entire ADNI-1 dataset", "text": "Although an automated hippocampal volumetric technique may demonstrate high technical accuracy, it is equally important to assess its utility as a biomarker to measure disease progression, discriminate amongst clinical cohorts, prognosticate decline and serve as a useful Table 9 Protocol-specific standardized \u03b2 coefficients grouped by diagnosis for ADNI-1 participants' cognitive test performance versus hippocampal volumetry.

Here we report on the biomarker performance outcomes of the 5 different SBHV atlas-protocols. Baseline volumes ranged considerably between methods. In fact, mean P2 NC volumes were 32% smaller than corresponding P5 volumes. Nevertheless, all methods compare well with previous ADNI-1 crosssectional studies (Leung et al., 2010; Morra et al., 2009; Mouiha et al., 2011; Schuff et al., 2009; Wolz et al., 2010b) , distinguishing principal groups by baseline volume (NC > MCI > AD) and similarly discriminated across principal groups for 24-month atrophy measures (AD>MCI>NC). Consistent with previous studies, cMCI showed reduced baseline volume versus sMCI. However, the least inclusive protocol, P2, did not significantly differentiate cMCI from sMCI, whereas all other protocols showed cMCI rates to be greater than sMCI. This may suggest that definitions approaching the minimal hippocampal assembly are not sufficient to capture atrophic changes automatically in multi-centre studies of prodromal AD. Moreover, the absolute caudal segmentation error realized for P2 may reduce the signal-to-noise ratio necessary to detect group-wise separation. Our annualized mean longitudinal measures in AD, P1=4.12 %, P2= 4.07%, P3=4.13%, P4=4.52% and P5=4.16% and in NC, P1=1.11%, P2=1.04%, P3=1.22%, P4=1.43% and P5=1.27% compare favorably with a meta-analysis by (Barnes et al., 2009 ) of manually derived volumes in NC=1.41% and AD=4.66%. Our annualized rates based on independent measures are consistent with a 1-year ADNI-1 study evaluating automatically derived volumes: NC=1.40%, and AD=4.57% (Leung et al., 2011) . While our 24-month mean rates of change and variances are greater than an ADNI-1 study using multi-atlas segmentation with 4D graph cuts by (Wolz et al., 2010b) , who report markedly lower 24-month mean rates of change (\u00b1SD) for NC / MCI / AD of: 1.66%\u00b1 2.07 (n=114), 4.50%\u00b13.12 (n=157) and 6.74% \u00b1 2.89 (n=81) when compared to our results in Table 10 . These differences may in part be explained by differing sample sizes that do not represent the more complete 24-month ADNI-1 sample. Indeed, 12-month and 24-month annualized measures reported in (Wolz et al., 2010b) , notably underestimate the expected meta-analytically computed manual rate of change reported in (Barnes et al., 2009) . However, there are several sources of bias between serial acquisitions including intensity differences, Interpolation asymmetries, software upgrades and hardware drift , which can introduce morphometric variability. Thus, simultaneous hippocampal segmentation of aligned scan pairs (i.e. comparative analysis) using, for example, 4D graph cuts (Wolz et al., 2010b) or the Boundary Shift Integral (BSI) with bias field correction (Leung et al., 2011) has been shown to lower variance and improve sensitivity. Nevertheless, our goal was to directly compare different atlas protocols, not algorithms, and the direct nature of this study design ensured all protocols experienced identical algorithmic biases and very similar intensity inhomogeneity and resampling biases depending on subregions included/ excluded. Finally, our ADNI-1 results contrast with a recent study by (Mouiha et al., 2011) , who reported that both a semi-automated atlas-based registration method called SNT, Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (Louisville, CO) (Haller et al., 1997) and FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002) annualized automatic measurements appear to significantly overestimate the rate of meta-analytically measured mean atrophy in AD (7.75% and 10.09%) and in NC (2.95% and 1.67%). However, multi-atlas methods have previously demonstrated greater accuracy than both FreeSurfer (Wang et al., 2011b) and SNT (Leung et al., 2011) .

The hippocampus measured in vivo has been strongly implicated in memory networks, and has been associated with episodic memory impairment in AD. However, anatomical variability among atlas-protocols may attenuate hippocampal-neurocognitive correlations. Therefore we directly tested whether differences existed between template ROI configuration and episodic memory performance. Our findings showed that all protocols demonstrated comparable associations with AVLT and LM derived episodic memory performance. Concordant with previous ADNI-1 hippocampal studies (Apostolova et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010) baseline cognitive score was modestly associated with unadjusted total baseline hippocampal volume in both MCI and AD. Protocol 4 consistently demonstrated the highest association with memory measures among techniques whilst P2 (the least comprehensive definition) showed slightly lower associations with cognitive measures. A few studies have examined hippocampus sub-regional associations with episodic memory in AD (Costafreda et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2010) . H.K. Lim and colleagues used the FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) (Patenaude et al., 2011) , a shape based method, and demonstrated correlations in drug na\u00efve patients with AD. The authors report associations with verbal memory within the lateral subiculum and CA1 extending from the hippocampal head to tail. These results are strengthened by the findings of (Costafreda et al., 2011) who demonstrated more lateral and anterior localized hippocampal associations with memory performance in AD compared to persons with MCI. As all protocols (P1-P5) included similar anterior-lateral hippocampal anatomy, it is unsurprising that we found only minor variation between methods in relation to cognitive performance. Moreover, the majority of voxel-wise segmentation error differences among protocols were localized to the posterior and superior borders and not the lateral/anterior compartments, The small variation that did exist between protocols for MCI and AD associations may reflect the differential error realized at the posterior border shown in Fig. 8 of the ADNI-1 validation study."}, {"section_title": "Protocol-wise sample sizes in MCI and AD", "text": "Another important application of automated hippocampal volumetry is towards quantitative assessment of macroscopic brain changes to evaluate drug efficacy in MCI and the early stages of AD. Hippocampal imaging markers may have the potential to lower sample sizes, which can expedite trials of putative disease modifying therapies. While, we acknowledge that using comparative serial measurement methods such as the BSI would likely reduce sample sizes across protocols than to our independent serial measures (baseline -24 months), we showed comparable sample sizes to previous ADNI-1 multi-atlas studies (Leung et al., 2010) and other techniques reviewed in (Weiner et al., 2012) . Interestingly, our SBHV-P1 24-month MCI sample estimates (when adjusted for 90 percent power) based on the protocol of (Haller et al., 1997) , were 31% lower, N=489, than 1-year sample sizes reported in (Schuff et al., 2009 ), N=698, using SNT, two time-points and the same atlas protocol. A possible explanation for our superior results based on two time points, is that hippocampal atrophy in MCI may accelerate and provide a larger effect size at 2-years than 1-year serial measures. Indeed, Jack and colleagues found an accelerated trajectory of brain atrophy in amnestic MCI subjects (Jack et al., 2008a) , and (Schuff et al., 2009 ) also showed evidence for accelerated hippocampal change in ADNI-1 MCI over 1-year. However, as previously mentioned, bias within different techniques and between scan pairs can modulate longitudinal measures. While the trajectory of MCI atrophy is not entirely clear over 24 months, the superior performance of multi-atlas segmentation compared to SNT reported in (Leung et al., 2010) and our results, suggests that algorithmic differences and susceptibility to bias rather than pathogenesis, may be importantly implicated.\nSample size estimates globally increased after adjusting for the rate of change in normal aging, which detects the maximum potential treatment effect. Interestingly, adjusting for atrophy in normal aging appears to significantly improve the relative performance of P1 to detect changes in MCI, while no significant changes were realized among tracing methods in AD. The smaller adjusted sample size derived from P1 atlases is due to the lower rate of atrophy measured in the NC group. While P3 and P4 by definition excluded portions of the medial body including part of the medial subiculum, sample sizes were not remarkably different when compared to P1 and P5, which integrated more of this region. This may be ascribed to either registration errors along the medial boundary, which have been observed in the current study and by (van der Lijn et al., 2008) , or that atrophy of both the subiculum and adjacent parahippocmapal gyrus in AD, reduces medial volumetric differences amongst protocols. Thus, medial body definition across the protocols sampled does not appear to markedly alter sensitivity of multi-atlas segmentation to detect changes in disease progression in either MCI or AD. Another striking observation was that more inclusive protocols (P1 and P3-P5) consistently generated smaller sample sizes than the least inclusive protocol (P2) in both MCI and AD. It is tempting to speculate that the differential sensitivity to detect disease progression between the protocols surveyed is largely driven by atrophy within the hippocampal tail. Although we did not explicitly test this hypothesis, such findings make intuitive sense given emerging shape-based analyses in AD, which suggest there are significant atrophic changes present in the posterior hippocampus (Gerardin et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2012) . Specifically, (Shen et al., 2012) recently demonstrated in a subset of ADNI-1 participants that hippocampal atrophy in AD appears to involve the CA1, subiculum and regions of the hippocampal tail. More inclusive protocols would capture these putative changes and gain signal to detect volumetric differences between pathological and healthy hippocampi. However, the proportionally higher error distribution at the caudal and dorsal boundary of P2 and to a lesser extent P1 compared to P3-5 suggests that automatic label accuracy may partially modulate sample size differences among hippocampal protocols."}, {"section_title": "Protocols excluded from comparison", "text": "The widespread use of several hippocampal methods in the literature has generated interest to harmonize hippocampal protocols in AD, and The EADC-ADNI hippocampal initiative is currently working towards a unified protocol for the manual delineation of the hippocampus from 3D MRI. Briefly, the principal objectives of this initiative include reviewing the literature, generating a robust in vivo definition of the hippocampus, and finally validating and qualifying a single consensus protocol on pathologically confirmed samples. Although the current study compared a variety of different hippocampal assemblies, we did not include all 12 published morphological variations assessed by the harmonization initiative. To reduce the number of manual tracings by the first author and to facilitate manual labeling in a common orientation, we selected 5/12 protocols for comparison. There were, however, a few notable protocol exclusions that were based on the long axis orientation of the hippocampus. First, the protocol of (Bartzokis et al., 1998) was the most conservative anatomical definition among all 12 protocols, excluding the entire tail of the hippocampus and dorsal WM compartment. Second, (Convit et al., 1997) used the most restrictive definition at the level of the hippocampal body, which excluded the parahippocampal gyrus and large portions of the subiculum. Finally, we did not include the protocols of (Jack, 1994; deToledo-Morrell et al., 2004; Watson et al., 1992) , which excluded the tail of the hippocampus similar to (Killiany et al., 1993) (P2), but included notably more anatomy along the medial body similar to P5.
