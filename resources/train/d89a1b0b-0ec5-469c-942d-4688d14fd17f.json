[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Rationale: Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and TSPO PET imaging allows us to quantify this process. However, the binding of second generation TSPO tracers depends on the TSPO genotype coded by the rs6971 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), with 40-50% increase in BP in high affinity (HAB) compared to mixed affinity (MAB) binders; while low affinity binders (LAB) are unsuitable for evaluation. Hence several studies are either using HAB alone or HAB and MAB subjects. To translate the findings of neuroinflammation studies to the entire population, it is crucial to establish the influence of TSPO genotypes on AD. Here we investigated whether different TSPO genotypes influence their cognitive function, amyloid load and disease progression over time.\nWe evaluated 798 subjects (225 normal, 388 MCI and 185 AD subjects) at baseline and during follow-up from ADNI cohort. All subjects were screened for TSPO genotype and underwent detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments yearly for four years. 291255 subjects also hadT1, T2 MRI and amyloid PET with 11C-PIB or 18F-Florbetapir.\nWe have demonstrated that all TSPO binding groups (HAB, MAB, and LAB) have same level of amyloid load in AD and MCI subjects. We have also demonstrated that the prevalence of HAB is 50.3%, MAB is 41.2% and 8.5% for LAB, without statistical difference among AD, MCI and control groups. During longitudinal follow up, mean change of neuropsychometric test scores of MMSE, ADAS Cog 11, ADAS MOD, and GDS over time were similar in AD and MCI subjects among three TSPO binding groups. The analysis of the covariates showed that diagnostic group (normal, MCI, AD), ApoE4 status, and gender had a significant effect on ADAS MOD decline (>3 points of the scale) but not age or TSPO genotype.\nConclusion: This study suggests that information obtained from evaluating a subgroup of AD or MCI subject using second generation TSPO tracers could be translated to the entire AD and MCI population. This will allow us to study lower numbers of AD subjects in evaluating new antineuroinflammatory/anti-microglial agents in intervention studies, and in observational studies evaluating the role of neuroinflammation."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Studies are evaluating the influence of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration, and therapeutic agents against these targets are still under clinical evaluation to prevent neurodegeneration in AD 1 . Before commencing on a large phase 3 study, it is essential to determine whether these agents can suppress brain inflammation. Neuroinflammation is characterised by an increase of 18 kDatranslocator protein (TSPO) expression, and is assessed in vivo by the use of TSPO PET (Positron Emission Tomography). The TSPO overexpression following microglial activation 2 , can be imaged via binding of PET ligands such as 11 C-(R)-PK11195 (1-[2-chlorophenyl]-Nmethyl-N-[1-methyl-propyl]-3-isoquinoline carboxamide). It is shown that AD subjects and a proportion of MCI subjects show a 20-35% increase in microglial activation in frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and cingulate cortices (p<0.05) [3] [4] [5] [6] . Currently, several second generation of TSPO ligands ( 11 C-PBR28, 11 C-DPA713, and 18 F-GE180) [7] [8] [9] have been developed with the aim of achieving higher affinity and better signal-to-noise ratio than 11 C-(R)-PK11195 PET. However, their uptake is dependent on TSPO phenotypes: high affinity binders (HAB), low affinity binders (LAB) and mixed affinity binders (MAB) 10, 11 ; with 40-50% increase in binding potential in high affinity (HAB) compared to mixed affinity (MAB) binders, while low affinity binders (LAB) are unsuitable for evaluation. It is now clear that a non-synonymous polymorphism of TSPO, coded by the rs6971 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affects the binding affinity of these tracers 10, 11 . This SNP in exon 4 of the TSPO gene causes an alanine-to-threonine substitution in position 147. The Ala/Ala TSPO genotype (wild-type) results in HAB, while the Ala/Thr results in MAB, and Thr/Thr results in LAB. The MAB have 40-50% lower binding potential for TSPO than HAB [10] [11] [12] .\nDue to the lack of binding in LAB, they are unsuitable for evaluation. Hence, several studies are evaluating only HAB subjects in natural progression and intervention studies. Apart from the binding of the PET tracer, TSPO gene mutation has been previously associated to functional alteration resulting in the reduction of peripheral lymphocyte allopregnanolone production 13 . Given that neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone may play a role in neuronal survival, favouring neurogenesis and preventing apoptosis 14 , it is important to establish whether there is a link between 147/Thr TSPO genotype and AD development and progression, especially if TSPO genotypes will become a discriminating factor for selecting AD patients for neuroinflammation studies. To date, no study has evaluated the clinical impact of TSPO genotypes on AD. If the amyloid load and deterioration of cognitive function (clinical progression) were similar in the three TSPO subgroups of AD and MCI subjects, information obtained from HABs alone could then be generalised to all AD or MCI patients. Here we hypothesised that the distribution of amyloid deposition and the progression of disease would be the same in all TSPO subgroups within the same diagnostic group. In the present study, we investigated the influence of different TSPO genotypes on amyloid load and neuropsychometric performance at baseline and during follow-up in AD, MCI and healthy control subjects."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "by on November 4, 2016.

"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This is the first study to evaluate the influence of TSPO genotypes on the clinical phenotypes of AD and disease progression. Here we demonstrated for the first time that the pathological features, clinical phenotypes and rate of cognitive decline in AD and MCI are similar in three TSPO subgroups. This finding is of clinical relevance considering the increasing interest in the role of microglia/neuroinflammation in AD pathophysiology that has led to development of several novel TSPO radiotracers aimed at improving the understanding of the disease process, improving the diagnosis, and obtaining a marker of disease progression 5, 11, 22 . In order to make the assessments more robust, some studies have chosen only to use subjects who are high affinity TSPO binders, representing around 50% of Caucasians 12 . This approach will result in a selection bias of patients. Moreover, if changes in levels of microglial activation are to be used as a surrogate endpoint in future interventional AD trials, 50% of subjects could not be enrolled on the basis of their TSPO genotype. Our data suggest that evaluating a subgroup of AD subjects with HAB will still allow their clinical and amyloid PET results to be translated to the rest of the AD patients; andconsidering the sample size in this cohort we can conclude that this finding is robust. Amyloid burden, although measured with two different methods and multiple cameras, was prevalent in the three diagnostic groups at a level consistent with the literature 23 . Additionally, the prevalence of ApoE4 was the same among the three TSPO subgroups in AD, MCI and control subjects. The prevalence of three TSPO phenotypes in AD and MCI was consistent with the prevalence of the TSPO phenotypes in the general population: 49% for HAB, 9% for LAB, and 42% for MAB 10, 12 .\nLongitudinal analysis has been addressed with two different methods in order to improve the quality of the data. We firstly analysed the data using linear regression with mean decline over time of the cognitive test scores (MMSE and ADAS-Cog and ADAS-MOD) as the parameter estimates, and TSPO genotypes as the as dependent variable. We also performed a multiregression analysis with survival function using several independent variables to assess whether other factors (age, ApoE4, gender, diagnostic groups) could better explain cognitive decline. Consistent with baseline analysis, the regression analyses confirmed that the rate of cognitive decline was similar over time (up to 36 months) between genotypes and supported by similar mean annual decline in change of ADAS-Cog and ADAS-MOD score or MMSE. The multi-regression analysis showed similar results within diagnostic groups with different TSPO genotypes and, interestingly, for the ADAS-MOD, mean annual decline showed an inverse correlation with the age, as previous reported by Holland et al."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": ". The Kaplan-Mayer analysis confirmed baseline and linear regression analysis results. The covariate analysis revealed that a significant association existed only between ADAS-MOD increase (>3 points), diagnostic group (MCI, AD, control), ApoE4 status, and gender. There were inconsistencies in the literature regarding the gender differences and the annual rate of cognitive decline, but it has been suggested that men (with larger brain volume) have higher cognitive reserve to withstand more insult (pathological changes) compared to woman 25 , which is in agreement with our finding.The latter findings have already been published and were not the objective of this study [26] [27] [28] . Finally, even if underpowered, the sub-analysis of TSPO genotypes and the hazards of cognitive worsening in amyloid positive subject did not show any significant correlation also after adjusting for ApoE4 homozygotes presence thus suggesting that TSPO genotypes seems not to have any significant interaction with amyloid deposition."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "C-PBR28 has 80-fold higher affinity for TSPO than thefirst generation TSPO tracer, 11 C-PK11195.\nC-(R)-PK11195 has significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to 11 C-PBR28 29 . However, it was found that patients exhibited different binding affinities for TSPO, falling into high affinity, low affinity, or mixed affinity binder groups 29 . This variability in binding affects modelling of radioligand binding as a proxy for microglial activation, to the extent where some studies have chosen only to use high affinity binders to make their analysis more robust. Another second-generation ligand is 11 C-DAA1106, which has much higher affinity for TSPO than 11 C-(R)-PK11195, is also influenced by TSPO polymorphisms 30 . As more and more TSPO tracers are being used to evaluate neuroinflammation, our results demonstrating that TSPO genotype did not influence the amyloid pathology or disease progression in AD is very relevant in evaluating AD patients with second generation TSPO tracers.\nAt molecular level, the TSPO protein is involved in steroidogenic cells controlling the uptake of cholesterol and thus the synthesis of neuroactive steroids 31 . Allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid synthesised in the central and peripheral nervous systems in myelinating glial cells, astrocytes, and several neuronal cell types, declines with age and neurodegenerative disease 14 . Costa et al. demonstrated that the TSPO Ala147Thr spontaneous amino acid substitution within TSPO is able to affect pregnenolone production in a peripheral cell model, represented by circulating lymphomonocytes 13 . However, it is not known to what extent Thr 147 TSPO genotype could affect neurosteroidsynthetis such as allopregnanole at CNS level, and whether it could play a role in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Considering our data, it seems very unlikely that Thr 147 TSPO genotype could affect the course of AD.\nby on November 4, 2016. For personal use only. jnm.snmjournals.org Downloaded from Considering the number of subjects analysed in our study at baseline and during follow-up, it seems very unlikely that Thr 147 TSPO genotype could affect the course of the disease in AD. A possible limitation of our study is the limited time of follow-up. However, it is reasonably long given the AD patient life span (a mean of 10 years) and the annual rate of conversion of MCI to AD (10-15%). One could argue that, for novel therapeutic targets, the influence of genotype is still unknown. However, unless new potential treatments will interfere with TSPO genotypes and cholesterol metabolism, it is very unlikely this will have an effect. Even though we have not evaluated the influence of HAB, MAB, and LAB in other neurodegenerative diseases, it is unlikely that this difference in binding is going to be clinically significant in other conditions."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that all binding groups (HAB, MAB, and LAB) have the same level of amyloid deposition in AD and MCI subjects.
