Results: SCD increased odds of Ab1 by 1.58 relative to non-SCD. Female APOE\u03b54 carriers with SCD exhibited higher odds of Ab1 (OR 5 3.34), whereas male carriers with SCD showed a weaker, opposing effect (OR 5 0.37).

Current prevention efforts are predominantly focused on interrupting the pathological b-amyloid (Ab) cascade in its earliest stages [1] . As such, recruitment is predicated on identifying individuals with biomarker evidence of abnormal Ab using positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging [2] . Ab-PET imaging is expensive and invasive, and so to reduce cost and patient burden, prevention trials may harness easily accessible demographic factors to prescreen individuals before neuroimaging. Beyond gathering information about apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE\u03b54) status, which is closely associated with risk for abnormal Ab [3, 4] , and age [5, 6] , evidence also supports the inclusion of measures of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) for prescreening [7] [8] [9] .\nAs a quick and inexpensive marker, SCD has been repeatedly associated with Ab burden in clinically normal older adults [3, 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . When examining the predictive utility of SCD to identify high Ab, Mielke et al. [5] reported that SCD reduced the number of individuals needed to screen for high Ab burden by approximately 37% for clinically normal individuals between 70 and 79 years. Furthermore, a study from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging reported that SCD increased the odds of high Ab by 1.90 in clinically normal individuals, raising to an odds ratio (OR) of 4.58 in APOE\u03b54 carriers [17] . A current gap in the literature, however, is the reporting of risk estimates for high Ab using SCD across multiple independent cohorts. This is a salient issue for SCD, which is a multifaceted construct [18] that does not currently possess a standardized form of measurement [19] . As such, the aim of this study was to examine the generalizability and consistency of SCD to identify high Ab across three wellcharacterized cohorts, and in the context of demographic and genetic factors.\nHere, we examined the utility of SCD (as measured with a single question with a binary response) to identify high Ab in isolation and in combination with moderative effects of APOE\u03b54 status, age, and sex across 890 clinically normal older adults from three independent cohorts. We hypothesized that SCD would exert an independent effect on the identification of those with high Ab and that combinatorial relationships between SCD and demographic factors would significantly reduce the numbers to screen for high Ab."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Cohort-specific inclusion criteria for recruitment have been published previously in the following studies: Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS), Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and AIBL [20] [21] [22] .

In the present study, participants were required to be clinically normal (Global Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score 5 0), with ADNI's SCD group included, given that these participants attained a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.

To examine the ability of SCD to classify high/low Ab burden in clinically normal older adults, we ran a series of generalized linear mixed models including age, sex, APOE\u03b54, and education as fixed effect covariates and modeling cohort as a random effect. Our first model included demographics, followed by a second model which included SCD as a predictor of interest. The next model examined demographics and APOE\u03b54 status as a predictor of interest. Our examination of APOE\u03b54 status as the primary contrast against the effect of SCD on Ab status was motivated by the fact that APOE\u03b54 represents one of the strongest risk factors for high Ab [4, 29] . To examine the added effect of SCD beyond knowing APOE\u03b54 status, we examined the main effects of SCD and APOE\u03b54 within the same model. To examine interactive effects, we examined the combined effect of SCD and APOE\u03b54 status on Ab status. We also examined two additional models that included three-way interactions between (a) sex, SCD, and APOE\u03b54 status and (b) age, SCD, and APOE\u03b54 status on Ab status. We investigated the fit of these models with area under the curve (AUC) calculations. Although we proceeded with three-way interactions as we had .20 individuals in each cell for both Ab1 and Ab2 individuals (see Supplementary Table A) , we interpreted results within the context of reduced power. In addition, we calculated the numerical advantage to including SCD as a parameter when attempting to recruit 1000 Ab1 clinically normal individuals from the community. Here, we used the predictive models to calculate the percentage reduction in numbers needed to recruit 1000 Ab1 individuals by predicting the\u0177 from a reference version of the model (that is, all variables at \"zero\") and comparing it against the target version of the model (that is, with the variable of interest now set to be the indicator)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "Clinically normal older adults who had high Ab burden were older and had greater proportion of APOE\u03b54 and endorsement of SCD (see Table 1 ) across all cohorts.

As education level did not add significant explanatory variance to classifying Ab1, we removed it from subsequent models. When including SCD in the model, we found it elevated the odds of being Ab1 by 1.58 (P 5 .006, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-2.07) relative to non-SCD, with an AUC of 66.2% (see Table 2 for model estimates). This model was significantly better fitting than that including demographics alone (c 2 5 7.35, P , .001). In a model that included APOE\u03b54 status and demographics, being an APOE\u03b54 carrier increased the odds of being Ab1 by 4.94 (P , .001, 95% CI: 2.08-11.72) and the AUC was 74.8% model fitting against demographics alone (c 2 5 88.6, P , .001). Including the main effects of both SCD and APOE\u03b54 status, SCD maintained its significance (OR 5 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17-1.98, P 5 .01), with the AUC at 74.7% (see Fig. 1 ). This model fit better than that including only APOE\u03b54 status and demographics (c 2 5 6.03, P 5.01). We found no significant two-way interaction between SCD and APOE\u03b54 status to identify Ab1 (OR 5 0.95, 95% CI: 0.69-1.32, P 5 .89; AUC 5 74.8%) (see Fig. 1 ).\nFor the three-way interactions, there were none between age, SCD, and APOE\u03b54 status to identify Ab1 (OR 5 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13, P 5 .25; AUC 5 74.8%). A three-way interaction was found to exist, however, between sex, SCD, and APOE\u03b54 status (OR 5 6.60, 95% CI: 1.63-25.32, P 5 .007; AUC 5 75.7%). This model fit better than that of a main-effect-only model (c 2 5 13.05, P 5 .01). Stratified by APOE\u03b54 carriers, females had significantly greater odds of being Ab1 if they endorsed SCD (OR 5 3.34, 95% CI: 1.65-7.00, P 5 .001) (see Fig. 2 ). Unexpectedly, male APOE\u03b54 carriers exhibited trend-level lower odds of being Ab1 if they endorsed SCD (OR 5 0.37, 95% CI: 0.13-1.00, P 5 .05). A visual inspection of the three-way estimate across cohorts also suggests that they were largely aligned across cohorts (see Supplementary Figure A ). When examining the stratifications within each study, the ORs for female \u03b54 carriers were relatively similar across all studies (ADNI: 4.25 . Across the cohorts, there was some level of variability in the estimation of number of scans saved here; within AIBL, ADNI, and HABS, the number of scans estimated to be saved by knowing SCD above APOE\u03b54 and demographics was 4%, 2%, and 13%, respectively.\nIt is important to note here, however, that simply estimating the numbers needed to be scanned does not take into account the costs of genotyping and other issues that may be pertinent to decision-making with recruitment. The intent of these estimations is primarily to highlight the utility of including an SCD measure to increase the efficiency of preclinical recruitment (with the inclusion of CIs)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The field is currently focused on better, and more efficiently, identifying the most at-risk, yet clinically healthy, individuals who are \"trial ready.\" In the present study, we aimed to quantify the contribution of a relatively simple and cheap approach to classifying abnormal Ab, assessing SCD using a single item, across three independent observational cohorts. We found that SCD significantly predicted high Ab, and this effect remained after accounting for APOE\u03b54 status, although it was relatively small in comparison with the APOE effect. Including SCD in the identification of those with high Ab reduced the numbers needed to screen by 13% beyond solely knowing basic demographics, such as age and sex, and by 9% if APOE\u03b54 status was known. If one assumes the cost of an Ab PET scan is wUS $3500, recruitment strategies based on inclusion of SCD, over and above basic demographics, could boost economic efficiency by approximately $1,431,500 [95% CI $1,375,500-$1,697,500], estimated from the 409 scans saved. This may not be considered a large margin of reduction; however, the inclusion of an additional one question is both low in cost and time expenditure and would be of net benefit for screening procedures of those with high Ab. An important consideration, however, is the extent to which the endorsement of SCD differed in its predictive utility across the cohorts, suggesting that some items may be more sensitive to identifying high Ab. The issue of other idiosyncratic differences between the cohorts, however, cannot be discounted to explain this variation.\nTaken together, the literature supports our findings that SCD, age, and APOE\u03b54 can inform the likelihood of high Ab burden in community samples of clinically normal individuals. Elevated SCD, as a continuous measure, is associated with continuous measures of Ab [7, 8, 13, 30] . Our estimates of high Ab frequency in APOE\u03b54 carriers and noncarriers also align with those from an unrelated cohort [29] , and meta-analyses incorporating some of the cohorts used in the present study [4] , implying that our sample is representative. Similarly, we replicated findings from other independent cohorts of the relationship between higher Ab and increased age [5, 6] . Meta-analyses do not support a relationship between sex and high Ab [4, 31, 32] , although one observational study reported a female bias [33] . We extend these findings by reporting the magnitude of predictive utility that SCD measurement can provide about the likelihood of Ab positivity in combination with predominating factors (e.g., age, APOE).\nOur estimate of SCD to identify high Ab was lower than that presented by Mielke et al. (13% vs. 34% [5] ). One possibility for this discrepancy is the use of only a single binary SCD question in the present study, which may result in reduced sensitivity. In addition, the cohorts we examined displayed a trend-level protective effect of SCD in males, which may have obscured the impact of SCD in females. We also did not find interactions between SCD and age to predict high Ab, as per previous findings [5, 17] , suggesting that although age exerts a strong main effect, the effect of SCD is not more salient in certain age groups.\nThe highest explanatory power for identifying high Ab resulted from combinations of factors. We found the highest odds in female APOE\u03b54 carriers with SCD, with our findings showing a paradoxical protective effect in male carriers with SCD. SCD and sex have not traditionally been associated with one another in relation to Ab burden; however, some meta-analyses have suggested elevated SCD overall in females relative to males [34] . Medical-seeking behaviors are reported more strongly in females relative to males (in the present study, 51% of females endorsed SCD relative to 45% of males), supporting the notion that SCD may be more common in females. It remains unclear, however, why SCD in females may be more sensitive to high Ab. One possible rationale is a higher awareness for detecting cognitive changes [35] . Alternatively, a single binary outcome measure could be perceived differently by each sex, although this remains to be explored further.\nAs these cohorts are community based, it is unclear what the utility of SCD is for identifying Ab in clinical settings. Because memory-clinic groups with SCD are at greater risk for clinical progression to AD dementia than the general population [36] (with SCD potentially more informative for clinical progression [37] ), it is entirely possible that our estimates may be underestimating the risk for high Ab in this type of population. Alternatively, SCD endorsement likely underlies the presenting symptom to a memory clinic, thus reducing the utility of a single binary outcome of SCD in this type of population. An additional consideration is that a variety of methods of SCD measurement exist, from single binary outcome measures to longer Likert-scale questionnaires [19] ; we did not examine the sensitivity of different SCD measures to identify high Ab. Our aim was to examine the generalizability of SCD based on items that were most comparable across the three cohorts while still retaining face validity. It is important to note, however, that this approach to testing SCD may not be the most sensitive to detecting abnormal Ab in the community. Generalized SCD questions may promote reflection on a compilation of experiences related to SCD [38] and thus result in a heterogeneous association with AD pathophysiology. Arguably, however, all forms of SCD measurement are more feasible and cost-effective than attaining APOE genotype and, as such, should be considered for implementation as a recruitment and screening tool in the first instance [9] .\nStrengths of the present study include the consolidation of three independent cohorts to form a large sample of community-based older adults, as well as considering cohort variance. Some limitations exist in this study. First, we did not have the same measure of SCD across all three cohorts, which could lead to some level of measurement error and subsequent misestimation of risk. We did find our estimates of interest were largely aligned across cohorts, thus supporting the notion of generalizability of the SCD construct to identify high Ab. Some heterogeneity did exist in our models, however; in particular, ADNI seemed to exhibit the strongest effect of SCD on high Ab. We attempted to account for this by including cohort as a random effect; however, this limitation should be acknowledged. There are also previously acknowledged issues with these conveniencesample cohorts that reduce generalizability, such as high education, good physical health, low racial diversity, and in the case of the AIBL study, enrichment for APOE\u03b54 status [21] . An additional consideration is that each of these binary outcome questions asks about a slightly different component of SCD: one asks about concern, another about difficulties, whereas the last asks about experiencing change. All of these questions tap into different facets of SCD [19] , and so it remains unclear which elements may have the greatest sensitivity to high Ab or whether they are interchangeable. We did find a difference in the frequency of SCD endorsement across the cohorts, suggesting that they may not be entirely interchangeable. Regardless, asking a single question about SCD is time-efficient, cost-effective, and does not require training or clinical acumen to acquire, making this form of measurement an ideal addition to gathering simple demographic information in a first level of screening for recruitment [9] .\nIn this large, combined sample, we found a single, binary SCD question independently identified high Ab in clinically normal older adults. The predictive utility remained even after including APOE genotype in the model. Future aims will be to examine the predictive utility of SCD to identify groups according to the A/T/N model [39] . In addition, it will be necessary to examine the impact of screening questions for SCD that hone on different features that reflect elements in the new NIA-AA criteria [39] and/or SCD-plus criteria from the SCD-Initiative [18] .
