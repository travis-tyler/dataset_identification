The International Working Group and the American Alzheimer's Association have recently characterized preclinical AD as the presence of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau abnormalities in cognitively normal persons [1] . Although these individuals show greater rates of disease progression than cognitively normal biomarker-negative individuals, most of them remain stable over typical clinical trial periods [1, 3] . Therefore, a critical next step proposed by the working groups was to identify, from among individuals with preclinical AD, those with the highest likelihood of disease progression within time frames acceptable for clinical trial designs taking into account financial, medical, and ethical considerations [1] .\nIts slow rate of change makes the use of cognition as the primary outcome of clinical trials in individuals with preclinical AD difficult because it leads to prohibitively high sample sizes and long follow-up times [4] . Hence, surrogate measurements of disease progression using established biomarkers of neurodegeneration might provide a useful alternative for such trials [5] . In fact, few studies have tested changes in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a possible surrogate marker for preclinical AD clinical trials. For example, a recent study by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has suggested that to test for structural changes on MRI in a population of individuals with preclinical AD enriched on the basis of A\u03b2 and tau biomarker positivity, sample size estimates are prohibitively large [3] . In this regard, changes in [ \n]FDG) uptake have been suggested for following disease progression and monitoring therapeutic effects [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Indeed, [ F]FDG uptake could be argued as an interesting strategy for these trials, since such individuals have a higher probability of developing further neurodegeneration and cognitive symptoms [1] . However, it is reasonable to suggest that the absence of baseline neurodegeneration might offer a more favourable pathophysiological scenario for preventive therapies aiming to mitigate disease progression [2] .\nRecent literature indicates that A\u03b2 and tau pathologies may arise independently and, at some pathophysiological point, synergistically potentiate imminent neurodegeneration in preclinical AD [2, [12] [13] [14] . Notably, this framework infers the existence of thresholds for A\u03b2 and tau pathologies associated with the triggering of their deleterious synergy in potentiating neurodegeneration. However, the fact that the majority of A\u03b2-positive plus tau-positive individuals with preclinical AD remain pathophysiologically stable over long periods suggests that these thresholds are greater than their respective individual thresholds for abnormality [1] . Thus, determination of the A\u03b2 and tau biomarker thresholds associated with imminent neurodegeneration might provide complementary information in individuals with preclinical AD destined to develop AD-related progression.\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that the combination of optimized A\u03b2 and tau thresholds predictive of neurodegeneration might provide an alternative framework with a high statistical power for testing the efficacy of the emerging disease-modifying therapies. This framework has the potential to select preclinical individuals on the verge of AD-related progression, considering metabolic changes as indices of neurological decline."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

In addition, we showed that the use of these thresholds and the use of voxel-wise changes in [ 18 F]FDG uptake as a surrogate marker as inclusion criteria provide an alternative framework with a high statistical power for 2-year clinical trials in preclinical AD. Overall, we propose the new concept of A\u03b2 and tau thresholds for imminent neurodegeneration as a valuable approach to population enrichment in clinical trials in individuals with preclinical AD and a h i g h p r o b a b i l i t y o f d e v e l o p i n g A D -r e l a t e d neurodegeneration within a short time. Specifically, we demonstrated that a 2-year clinical trial in cognitively normal individuals using brain A\u03b2 plus CSF p-tau thresholds more than one SD higher than their standard values together with regional [\n18 F]FDG uptake as a surrogate marker would require as few as 100 individuals to test a hypothetical 25% drug effect. These results contrast with a recent study performed by ADNI in individuals with preclinical AD defined as those with A\u03b2 plus tau positivity which showed that a 2-year clinical trial measuring changes in cognition or structural MRI would require more than 2,000 individuals to test a hypothetical 25% drug effect with 80% power [3] .\nIt is important to emphasize that the thresholds proposed here are based on dynamic biomarker changes and indicate metabolic decline over short time frames, rather than the presence or absence of pathological proteinopathies, which are best assessed with post-mortem correlations [28] . It is also important to mention that in our understanding the term Bbiomarker abnormality^refers to the presence of brain pathology and should be defined by thresholds that are better associated with post-mortem studies. Within the biomarker abnormality spectrum, we suggest that the existence of thresholds for imminent disease progression will identify from among individuals with biomarker abnormalities those with the highest probability of progression to a given outcome. Since the proposed model optimizes neurodegeneration as a function of A\u03b2 and tau levels, we may argue that this model has immediate applicability to provide a framework with a high statistical power for use with the emerging anti-tau and anti-amyloid therapies. Interestingly, the highest rates of metabolic decline shown by individuals with preclinical AD were found in the limbic structures within the cingulate, orbitofrontal, and medial and basal temporal cortices. Importantly, this pattern of metabolic dysfunction is not considered part of normal ageing [29, 30] . In fact, metabolic decline in the limbic structures has been proposed as an early abnormality associated with AD [31, 32] . In addition, the fact that this brain circuit is affected by tangles or plaques [29, 30] , rather than by the normal ageing process [33] [34] [35] , further supports the notion that cognitively normal subjects with these baseline biomarker signatures are on the AD pathway. Interestingly, in contrast with [ 18 F]florbetapir, CSF A\u03b2 levels failed to model imminent metabolic decline in our population, which is in line with previous observations showing that A\u03b2 PET depicts metabolic decline better than CSF A\u03b2 in this preclinical AD population [13] . Although CSF A\u03b2 well-represents the disease status, brain fibrillar A\u03b2 deposition seems to be better associated with imminent disease progression [13, 36] .\nDeclines in [\n18 F]FDG uptake as a function of the hallmark AD proteins were best described by a sigmoidal rather than a linear association. This pattern of relationship is consistent with the most accepted models of AD progression [22] , which assume Bceiling effects^for A\u03b2 and tau. Therefore, our results further emphasize that this ceiling effect should be considered in studies testing the relationship between these proteinopathies and downstream neurodegeneration. For example, studies using linear functions for testing the association between proteins and brain hypometabolism in AD patients might not show any correlation [13] , since it is likely that most demented patients have already reached the plateau of the relationship.\nMethodological aspects limit the external validity of the present results. Our population was composed of self-selected individuals and might not represent the general elderly cognitively normal population. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to replicate our results in a larger population-based study. However, it is important to mention that the use of a conservative multiple comparison correction threshold of 0.001 helped to avoid false-positives results in our analysis. It is also important to emphasize that change in cognition is always the most desirable outcome for a therapeutic clinical trial aiming to mitigate AD progression. However, due to the methodological limitations in the use of cognition in individuals with preclinical AD and the advances in in vivo biomarkers, increasing our understanding of the use of brain imaging in the assessment of AD progression is of paramount importance. Importantly, individuals with preclinical AD in this study were considered those with normal cognition but A\u03b2 and tau abnormalities rather than those who would certainly have developed dementia over time. The 2-year follow-up was not sufficient to draw definite conclusions regarding clinical progression from cognitively normal to dementia.\nPartial volume correction did not translate into differences in our final results. Therefore, we present the PET data without corrections for volume effects. Biomarker thresholds are invariably subject to idiosyncrasies and as such might vary slightly depending on the analytical method used. However, in this study, biomarker levels predictive of rapid metabolic decline were at least one SD higher than the threshold for the Fig. 3 In our cognitively normal population of individuals with preclinical AD, those with A\u03b2 and tau above the optimized thresholds showed the highest rates of 2-year AD-related metabolic decline. ANCOVA confirmed that these individuals (with [ 18 F]florbetapir SUVR >1.23 and p-tau >45 pg/ml; n = 17, red) showed the highest 2-year rates of [ 18 F]FDG uptake decline in the mediobasal temporal, orbitofrontal, and cingulate cortices. It is important to emphasize that individuals with preclinical AD and at least one of the biomarkers below the proposed threshold (n = 16, blue) showed declines in [ 18 F]FDG uptake not different from biomarker-negative individuals (n = 24, green) and those at risk of AD (n = 63, yellow). The analysis was adjusted for age, gender and APOE-\u03b54 carrier status, with Bonferroni correction at a significance level of 0.05 presence of brain pathology in an elderly cognitively normal population. Notably, the thresholds associated with imminent disease progression would invariably be expected to be higher than those used to determine an abnormal biomarker status. It is important to mention that the use of a hypothetical drug effect of 25% used in our analysis was the same as that used in previous studies in AD [3, 24, 25, 27] . Although study population enrichment with two biomarker modalities might potentially have a high economic cost, it is important to emphasize that an increasingly large number of observational studies using multiple biomarkers for A\u03b2 and tau have indicated that this approach could serve as a screening tool to select individuals for therapeutic trials. Despite the current lack of an effective disease-modifying therapy for AD, the promising recent results with anti-A\u03b2 drugs such as aducanumab suggest the need for sensitive methods to detect disease progression.\nTo conclude, our results show that A\u03b2 and tau biomarker thresholds associated with imminent neurodegeneration are higher than their respective thresholds for abnormality. In addition, the determination of these thresholds may provide complementary information for selecting individuals with preclinical AD who will most likely show pathophysiological progression over time frames compatible with clinical trials.
