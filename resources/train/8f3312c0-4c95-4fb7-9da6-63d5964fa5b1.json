[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Advances in the field of biomarkers have pushed forward a redefinition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a biological construct. 1 Under this definition, the ATN classification system recognizes three general groups of biomarkers for AD: biomarkers of b-amyloid plaques (A), biomarkers of fibrillar tau (T) and biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury (N). 1 These categories can be assessed by using different modalities, but those that are more widely implemented are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and imaging techniques. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), CSF Ab1-42 and the ratio Ab1-42/ Ab1-40 correspond to the \"A\" category, Tau PET and CSF pTau to the \"T\" category, whereas 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, anatomical MRI and tTau are considered markers of the \"N\" category. 1 Within the \"A\" category, the concordance between CSF Ab1-42 and amyloid PET imaging is high, but not perfect. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] In fact, the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio has shown to have better agreement with amyloid PET imaging compared to levels of Ab1-42 alone. 4, [7] [8] [9] In recent years, fully automated platforms have been developed for the analysis of CSF biomarkers. Recently, four CSF analytes (Ab1-42, Ab1-40, tTau and pTau) have been implemented on the fully automated Lumipulse G System, but there are no validated cutoffs for these four AD CSF biomarkers using this platform. Our aims were to determine for the first time the cutoffs that optimized the agreement between 18 F-Florbetapir PET and Ab1-42, Ab1-40, tTau, pTau and their ratios measured in CSF on the LUMIPULSE G600II instrument, and to evaluate the concordance between markers of the amyloid category."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "We included 94 participants from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration (SPIN cohort) recruited between November 2013 and September 2017 who had available CSF samples and 18 F-Florbetapir PET imaging ( Table 1 ). The SPIN cohort is a multimodal research cohort for biomarker discovery and validation that includes participants with different neurodegenerative dementias, mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal controls. All participants receive an extensive neurological and neuropsychological evaluation and undergo structural 3T brain MRI, blood extraction, and lumbar puncture for CSF biomarkers. A subset of participants also receives molecular imaging such as 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, amyloid and/or Tau PET. More information on the SPIN cohort can be found at https://santpaumemoryunit.com/ \nWe included 94 participants in the study. Table 1 summarizes demographic characteristics and biomarker results.

After centrifugation (2000g 9 10 min, 4\u00b0C), volumes of 0.5 mL of CSF were aliquoted into polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Ref#72.694.007) and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C until analysis.\nOn the day of the analysis, samples were thawed at room temperature and the tubes were vortexed for 5-10 sec. To avoid the effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycles, aliquots used in this study had not been thawed before. Ab1-42, Ab1-40, tTau and pTau were quantified directly from the storage tubes containing 0.5 mL of CSF using the Lumipulse G b-Amyloid 1-42, b-Amyloid 1-40, Total Tau and pTau 181 assays on LUMIPULSE G600II automated platform (Fujirebio) and following the manufacturer's instructions. We used an adapter to fit the tubes in the equipment. We used the same batch of reagents for each biomarker throughout the study, and for each sample, we measured all four analytes from the same aliquot and in the same run. The platform was configured to start the analysis with Ab1-42, followed by Ab1-40, tTau and pTau. Buffer-based quality control testing was performed at the beginning of each test day to ensure that all measured values of each control level (low, medium and high) were within the target ranges.\nThe results of the Lumipulse G b-Amyloid 1-42 presented in this study have been standardized according to certified reference material developed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine as recommended by their working group for CSF proteins. 10 Briefly, values of the calibration standards of the LUMIPULSE G600II were adapted to the certified reference material resulting in an adjustment of concentrations that was linearly proportional throughout the range. The aim of standardization to certified reference material is to harmonize immunoassays of Ab1-42 to make results comparable across different platforms.\nAb1-42, Ab1-40, tTau and pTau levels in CSF from participants of this study had been measured previously using other immunoassays (INNOTEST b-AMYLOID , INNOTEST hTAU Ag, and INNOTEST PHOSPHO-TAU (181P) , Fujirebio Europe; and High Sensitivity Human Amyloid b40, Merck-Millipore), and these results were available in our database for their comparison with the LUMIPULSE analyses.

We studied the correlation between each CSF biomarker and global amyloid accumulation by fitting quadratic models. In these models, the adjusted coefficients of determination (R 2 ) were higher for all ratios compared to individual biomarkers. The combination of Ab1-42 with Ab1-40 increased the R 2 value to 0.44 (P < 0.001), indicating that this ratio reflects the amyloid deposition better than Ab1-42 alone. Stratified analysis by 18 F-Florbetapir visual status showed lower R 2 values for all biomarkers, which suggests that the correlation observed between CSF biomarkers and amyloid PET quantification is partially mediated by an amyloid-status effect. In this stratified analysis, the highest correlation of SUVR values was found with the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio in the amyloid-negative group (R 2 = 0.42; P < 0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In our study, we determined cutoffs for four CSF biomarkers for AD (Ab1-42, Ab1-40, tTau and pTau) and their ratios measured on the fully automated LUMI-PULSE G600II platform to optimize their concordance with 18 F-Florbetapir PET. We calibrated Ab1-42 levels to certified reference material, recently developed to harmonize immunoassays across different platforms, and found that the ratios Ab1-42/Ab1-40, tTau/Ab1-42 and pTau/ Ab1-42 had better diagnostic agreement with visual assessment of amyloid scans than single biomarkers. As a marker of amyloid pathology, the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio had higher agreement with amyloid PET visual status and showed better correlation with amyloid load quantification compared to Ab1-42 alone. The agreement between amyloid imaging and AD CSF biomarkers has previously been studied by using other automated immunoassays. 3, 4, 8 Our results are in line with previous studies showing a good overall agreement between amyloid imaging and AD CSF biomarkers, higher for ratios than for single analytes. 3, 4 However, specific cutoff points for CSF biomarkers differ between these studies, and several methodological differences can explain these discrepancies. First, preanalytical conditions, such as the type of collection and storage tubes, are different between studies, and these factors are known to have a great impact on the absolute values of CSF biomarkers, especially for Ab1-42. 18, 19 Second, some analytical particularities for each immunoassay and platform used in these studies (specificity of the antibodies, time of incubation) result in diverse CSF biomarker measures. Calibration of all automated platforms to certified reference material, currently underway, will minimize this issue in the future. Likewise, differences in the affinity of PET radiotracers ( 11 C-Pittsburg compound B, 18 8 Hansson et al. studied CSF of participants from ADNI and Bio-FINDER cohorts, that included cognitively normal volunteers, patients with mild cognitive impairment and patients with AD dementia. 3 In our study, we additionally included patients with other dementias or neurodegenerative diseases, which might reflect more realistically the application of biomarkers in daily clinical practice.\nAs in a number of other studies, the cutoffs in our study were selected by maximization of Youden J index. This approach balances sensitivity and specificity and is equivalent to maximize accuracy for a pre-test disease prevalence of 50%. 20 However, other strategies might be useful in certain clinical scenarios. 21 For instance, for screening purposes, it might be helpful to apply cutoffs with high sensitivity, even when their specificity is lower. For patients with clinically challenging diagnoses or in clinical trials, however, high specificity might be preferable. Other possible approaches include the sequential application of biomarker cutoffs.\nThe LUMIPULSE G600II has incorporated the possibility of measuring CSF levels of Ab1-40. In previous studies, and ours, this biomarker alone was not useful for the detection of brain amyloid. 4, 7, 9 Both Ab1-42 and the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio are included in the \"A\" category of the ATN classification system together with amyloid PET, but in line with other studies, 7, 9, 22, 23 we found that the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio had better agreement with visual amyloid status and higher correlation with brain amyloid quantification. Our results are in line with previous literature that suggests that the use of the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio could compensate individual differences in amyloid precursor protein processing that otherwise might lead to false positive or false negative Ab1-42 CSF levels. 24 information adds to the fact that using the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio has proven to partially mitigate the effect of some preanalytical confounders that have been described to alter the results of amyloid levels. [26] [27] [28] Altogether, our data suggest that the use of the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio would be more reliable in clinical practice than Ab1-42 alone as a marker of amyloidosis and that this combination should be used in routine.\nThe main strength of our study is that four AD CSF biomarkers (Ab1-42, Ab1-40, tTau and pTau) measured simultaneously with the automated Lumipulse G System were compared for the first time to 18 F-Florbetapir PET to calculate amyloid-based cutoffs. In addition, this is, to our knowledge, the first study to present Ab1-42 levels that have been standardized to certified reference material, recently developed to harmonize immunoassays across different platforms. Standardized values will make our study more easily comparable to future studies. Moreover, to avoid possible sources of variability, we followed homogeneous CSF preanalytical and analytical procedures and used the same batch of reagents for all measurements. Also, the inclusion of participants with neurodegenerative diseases outside the AD spectrum provides a more realistic application of biomarkers in daily clinical practice.\nHowever, we are aware of some limitations. We did not test the effect that deviations from our preanalytical protocol would have on the final cutoffs, and therefore, the cutoffs that we report should be taken cautiously under other operating procedures. Some of the clinical categories in our study included a small number of participants. Although we used amyloid positivity/negativity as the gold standard in our study, the composition of the sample in terms of clinical diagnosis might be relevant for the interpretation and applicability of our results. Additionally, only very few participants had additional Tau imaging and/or 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and we could not compare the agreement of CSF pTau and tTau with molecular imaging markers of the \"T\" and the \"N\" categories of the ATN classification. Likewise, as participants in this study are part of a living cohort, neuropathological confirmation is not available at this moment.\nIn this study, we found that the Ab1-42 ratios to Ab1-40, tTau and pTau in CSF show a good agreement with amyloid visual status and that the Ab1-42/Ab1-40 ratio had better correlation with the amount of amyloid burden compared to Ab1-42 alone. The understanding of the agreement between CSF biomarkers and amyloid imaging is crucial to identify situations in which these two modalities might not be interchangeable. This information has to be taken into consideration both in the diagnostic assessment in clinical practice and in the selection of participants in clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Supporting Information", "text": "Additional supporting information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article.
