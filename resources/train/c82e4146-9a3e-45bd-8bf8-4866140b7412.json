[{"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects statistics on the condition of education in the United States, analyzes and reports the meaning and significance of these statistics, and assists states, local education agencies, and postsecondary institutions in improving their statistical systems. NCES supports a wide range of activities, providing policy-relevant data on issues as diverse as enrollment trends, access of minorities to postsecondary education, the academic achievement of students, comparisons of the U.S. education system with education systems in other countries, and the effect of education on employment and economic productivity. NCES programs are directed toward maintaining and analyzing the following major cross-sectional databases: at the elementary/secondary levelthe Common Core of Data (CCD), the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), and the Private School Survey (PSS); and at the postsecondary levelthe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF), and the Survey of Earned Doctorates Awarded in the United States (SED). Together, these studies provide accurate, timely, and relevant data on the condition of American education, as well as how it has changed over time. In addition, NCES conducts a National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES) covering various educational topics such as early childhood and adult education, program participation, education-related home activities, and parental involvement in education. conducting surveys and analyzing data from the NCES Longitudinal Studies Programs: at the early childhood levelthe Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies (ECLS) with birth and kindergarten cohorts; at the secondary school levelthe National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (12th-grade cohort) (NLS:72), the High School and Beyond Study of 1980 (10th-and 12th-grade cohorts) (HS&B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (eighthgrade cohort) (NELS), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (10th-grade cohort) (ELS); and at the postsecondary levelthe Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B), which follow students attending or completing postsecondary institutions. These studies address a variety of important education issues from birth through postsecondary school, including differences in student achievement, effects of financial aid on access to postsecondary education, youth employment, high school dropouts, discipline and order in schools, and the quality of education in public and private schools.

NCES is engaged in a set of agency-wide activities that are intended to help attain these goals. First, with respect to high quality, the reputation of NCES as a statistical agency is dependent on the integrity and the relevance of the information it produces. Second, with respect to customer-driven products, the value of NCES to the education community is contingent upon a full understanding of the data needs and interests of our customers. Third, with respect to availability, the success of NCES in making as much information available as possible hinges upon the effective use of technological advances."}, {"section_title": "Statistics Standards and Technical Review", "text": "The NCES statistical standards provide the guiding principles for data collection, analysis, and reporting of education data. NCES staff and contractors use these standards in an ongoing effort to ensure the development of high-quality education data. From study design to final analysis, NCES products are subjected to a rigorous technical review process that involves statistical and subjectmatter experts from NCES and the broader education community. During study design and data collection, NCES uses a combination of internal work groups, external technical review groups, and contractors to design and collect data to meet the needs of the education community. Data collection and processing frequently involve the collaboration of NCES staff and several contractors configured in a manner designed to ensure checks and balances on quality control. Analyses are conducted only after analysis plans are developed and reviewed. Finally, the report review process usually involves a series of reviews by subject-matter and technical colleagues, culminating in a formal review by a combination of internal and external reviewers. NCES continually strives to increase the efficiency of the full review process, while at the same time maintaining high standards. Thus, in the fall of 2002, NCES released the 2002 revised statistical standards and guidelines in the 2002 NCES Statistical Standards. These standards and associated guidelines are intended to assist NCES in meeting its primary goal of providing high-quality, reliable, useful, and informative statistical information to public policy decisionmakers and the general public. In particular, the standards and guidelines are intended for use by NCES staff and contractors to guide them in their data collection, analysis, and dissemination activities. These standards and guidelines are also intended to present a clear statement to data users regarding how data should be collected in NCES surveys, and the limits of acceptable applications and use."}, {"section_title": "Quality Control and Statistical Standards Review", "text": "In the fall of 1996, the Commissioner convened the Task Force on Quality Systems to study NCES quality control procedures, with the goal of identifying ways to improve the current procedures. The work of this group was one starting point for some of the work involved in revising the NCES Statistical Standards. In addition to this work, NCES initiated agency-wide audits of survey methodology, imputation procedures, and response rates to inform the standards revisions. In the summer of 2000, NCES convened 15 working groups that included over one-half of the agency's staff to participate in the standards revisions. The working groups were coordinated by a steering committee that included representation from the Statistical Standards Program and each of the data collection and reporting divisions within NCES. The individual working groups met regularly over a 9-month period through the spring of 2001. During that time, an NCES seminar was held to give all NCES staff an opportunity to comment on proposed revisions. Throughout the summer and fall, the steering committee reviewed, and in some cases further revised, the drafts. As draft standards were completed, they were shared with NCES senior managers for further discussion and comments. During the spring of 2002, the steering committee convened a 2-day meeting, followed by a comment period for NCES contractors, to give them an opportunity to review and comment on the NCES draft standards. After responses to those comments were incorporated and reviewed by NCES senior managers, the NCES draft standards were posted on the NCES web site for a 45-day public comment period, as part of an OMB-initiated data quality activity. Comments received during the public comment period were incorporated by the steering committee and reviewed and approved by senior managers. Then, in July 2002, NCES submitted draft standards to OMB and to an independent commissioned expert panel convened by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS). NCES incorporated comments and suggestions from these groups before the final review and adoption of the revised standards by senior managers. Following the fall 2002 adoption of the standards, members of the steering committee held a series of internal training sessions on the standards."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "In an effort to document NCES data collection procedures, the Statistical Standards Program sponsored the development of a handbook of NCES data collections. The handbook documents key aspects of the design, collection, and processing of NCES surveys. A related report that summarizes the imputation procedures in NCES data collections is also under development. In a complementary project, the Statistical Standards Program conducted a review of the response rates in each NCES data collection. The results of this review will also be published in an NCES report. The Statistical Standards Program is currently conducting Center-wide reviews of two areas: the use of incentives in NCES data collections and the application of nonresponse bias analyses in the evaluation of NCES data collections. 1990 K Street NW Washington, DC 20006 Telephone number: (202) 502-7303 E-mail address: marilyn.seastrom@ed.gov"}, {"section_title": "Customer Service", "text": "NCES is committed to providing a range of customer-driven products that are tailored to the needs of different members of the education community. In an effort to meet this goal, data are made available in a variety of formatsfrom published statistical compendia and online data tools to microdata files for secondary analysis. NCES reports range from detailed technical, methodological, and analytic reports that provide an in-depth analysis of a particular topic or issue to Statistical Briefs and Issue Briefs that provide a short, focused analysis of a specific topic. In continuing the effort to make NCES statistics available to a broad audience, NCES launched the Education Statistics Quarterly, a periodical that includes findings from all NCES reports on a quarterly basis. All NCES publications are available online at the NCES web site (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch). NCES also continues to explore new and innovative ways to use the web to make education information available to as many data users as possible. (For more information, please see subsequent NCES \"Technology\" and \"Web Site\" descriptions in this chapter.)"}, {"section_title": "Customer Service Survey", "text": "The NCES Commissioner established a Customer Service Team to ensure that sufficient effort is devoted to the continual monitoring of our customers' information needs. As a part of an ongoing effort to better understand the data needs and interests of the education community, this team conducts a biennial customer service survey. The purpose of the survey is to assess customer satisfaction with NCES products and services, and to identify areas that need improvement. The last customer survey was conducted in 2001. The survey's respondents do not include all NCES customers; instead, the survey focuses on specific customer groups. The 2001 survey targeted several large groups of current and potential users: federal, state, and local policymakers; academic researchers; and journalists. The response rate to the 2001 survey was 79 percent. The survey results indicate strong satisfaction with NCES and its products. However, awareness of NCES varies considerably between respondent groups and products. NCES customers use data for many purposes. Three main uses cited in the survey were general information, research and analysis, and planning. The data also suggested that the more experienced the user, the higher the level of satisfaction. The survey also indicated less satisfaction with the timeliness of NCES publications and data files, and the need for NCES to increase awareness of agency products and services. These are areas that NCES managers are seeking to improve."}, {"section_title": "Outreach Partnerships", "text": "In an effort to improve dissemination and increase the use of NCES education statistics, NCES has developed \"partnerships\" with external organizations whose members are either interested in education data or could become potential users. With NCES acting as a data \"broker,\" these new collaborative relationships provide an excellent means for expanding the NCES customer base and learning more about the needs of specific data users. And by making use of existing communication channels in other organizations, NCES is also able to make contact with potential customers. Collaborative activities include providing information on NCES products in association newsletters and online services; developing links to web sites; providing training on NCES databases and other activities; developing individual workshops for specific data users; and identifying and assessing data needs. This two-way interaction with outside networks increases the utility of NCES products and services by more accurately reflecting the needs of various constituencies."}, {"section_title": "Practitioner's Web Page", "text": "Through focus groups and customer surveys, NCES has determined that local education practitioners (e.g., educators, administrators, counselors, librarians, and parents) are not adequately aware of NCES products and services. As a result, NCES developed a web page targeted to the data needs of these groups. This new online service, called \"The K-12 Practitioners' Circle\" (http://nces.ed.gov/practitioners), presents education data in a user-friendly manner and links to a wide range of NCES publications and other relevant resources. In addition to alerting users to NCES findings on both continuing and emerging education issues, it provides information on relevant research studies and other practical resource materials that local practitioners would find useful. The new web page will be updated regularly to respond to pressing education issues, and NCES will be encouraging feedback from its users."}, {"section_title": "Training", "text": "One way of ensuring that NCES staff members maintain state-of-the-art skills is through inhouse training seminars on new and emerging statistical techniques and practices. The NCES training program director plans and coordinates these seminars on an as-needed basis. For example, over the past few years, seminars have been held on such topics as variance estimation; imputation of missing data; statistical significance testing; multiple regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; path analysis; hierarchical linear modeling; and special software, such as SUDAAN and Wesvar PCcomputer programs, for handling survey data from complex sample designs. The seminars also cover such topics as contract management and emerging educational priorities, issues, and policies. Although these seminars are tailored to the needs of NCES staff, they are open to the general public. Any interested staff members from other government agencies, professional associations, private companies, or other organizations may attend. For the last several years, NCES has sponsored a series of advanced studies seminars in the Washington, D.C., area for external data users to promote and facilitate the effective use of NCES databases, such as the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, the National Household Education Surveys Program, the Schools and Staffing Survey, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, NAEP, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. These seminars are open to data users including faculty members and graduate students in higher education institutions, as well as researchers and data analysts at state and local education agencies, professional associations, and other federal 13 2 3 agencies. The lectures and hands-on computer seminars are designed to allow participants to conduct analyses on selected NCES databases. Applicants compete for a limited number of openings. Seminars are usually offered each summer and are about 3 to 4 days long. Participants also review certain statistical topics such as sample design, variance estimation, imputation, and sampling weights. To participate in these seminars, browse the NCES web site (http://nces.ed.gov/conferences) for seminar announcements and specifications for applying. Instructors for both in-house and external data user seminars are usually NCES staff members who have extensive knowledge and experience in the given subject matter.

NCES staff can conduct their work within the Center more efficiently and effectively, and the Center can collect, analyze, and disseminate more education data than ever before in a more flexible and easily accessible fashion. Programs and individual projects are designed to be consistent with an overall vision of expanding access to NCES data. Advances in computer and telecommunication technologies are making it easier for all members of the education communitylearners, parents, teachers, and administrators, as well as observers and policymakersto come directly to NCES for information. Recent technology tools developed by NCES reduce the burdens of data collection, enhance the accuracy and timeliness of analysis, and increase the ease of access to education statistics. A variety of plans are being implemented to fully incorporate current and emerging technologies into the NCES working environment, and to provide both internal and external customers with timely education statistics in useful formats. Internal activities include acquiring and supporting up-to-date desktop hardware and software to facilitate statistical analyses, developing integrated software solutions for program management, and leveraging local-and wide-area network resources to share information. NCES currently provides access to its databases through several mechanisms. These include the dissemination of data via CD-ROMs, and most importantly through the NCES web site. Current activities to enhance electronic access to NCES data include: dissemination of products and services via the NCES web site; 14 9 A improved data administration; development and support of improved CD-ROM products for NCES databases; fostering increased capabilities of data suppliers and users to submit and retrieve NCES data electronically through the NCES web site; and expanding customer options for retrieving timely education data."}, {"section_title": "Web Site", "text": "An essential component of the NCES Technology Program is the NCES web site (httpinces.ed.gov). The site contains an enormous amount of easily accessible education-related information, including research reports, data access tools, and raw data. It also provides links to additional information at the U.S. Department of Education web site (http://www.ed.gov), as well as assistance in obtaining CD-ROMs of restricted-use data and survey data sets too large to download from the web. The web site is the largest and most visible dissemination platform of NCES. Since the site's inception in May 1996, it has grown to include close to 30,000 pages, in addition to providing many online data access capabilities. Current usage statistics indicate that approximately 1,500,000 user sessions and over 7,000,000 page views take place on a monthly basis. NCES has a full-time webmaster and a web team consisting of liaisons from all divisions and the Commissioner's office. The web site has become the primary mode of communication for NCES and its varied constituencies. Features of the NCES web site include: a complete catalog (over 2,000 products) of NCES publications and data products with customized search capabilities, including searches by title, author, subject, survey or program area, and other criteria, at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch; product information pages containing brief descriptions, links to accessible formats of the desired products, ordering assistance, and other useful information; a staff directory, searchable by subject, topic specialty, or name; the Student's Classroom for school-age visitors, with \"find your school, library, or college\" features, quizzes, games, easy-to-use graphing and probability functions, and many more engaging and educational activities, at http://nces.ed.gov/nceskids; daily \"Did You Know\" education facts displayed on the site's home page; statistical tables and education indicators for quick answers to inquiries; the most recent data sets for downloading and analysis; descriptions of NCES programs (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys), including separate web sites for all surveys and program areas; a national locator (http://nces.ed.gov/globallocator) for searches of public schools, private schools, public libraries, and postsecondary institutions; and a \"Newsflash\" subscription service, organized by relevant topical areas of education research, about breaking NCES news (http://nces.ed.gov/newsflash). The NCES web site also provides a direct link to the extensive collection of education-related materials at the Department of Education web site that includes: A powerful function of the NCES web site is its ability to provide rich, flexible data access tools. NCES has developed searchable databases to facilitate the location of educational institutions and their characteristics. One example of a data access tool available through the site is the NCES Search for Public Schools (http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch). This feature allows customers to locate a school based on name, location, state, or other similar variables. Search for Public Schools includes statistics on individual school characteristics, such as teacher counts, number of students, student/teacher ratio, and school enrollment by race/ethnicity. Another popular search tool is College Opportunities Online (http://nces.ed.govlipeds/cool), an extensive searchable database of up-to-date information on over 9,000 U.S. colleges, universities, and technical institutions. Information featured in this program includes attendance charges and programs offered. Newer and more sophisticated data access tools recently made available through the NCES web site provide users opportunities to manipulate data in increasingly more informative ways. Peer comparison tools allow users to compare the various libraries, school districts, and postsecondary institutions located throughout the United States. Using an advanced mapping application, the School District Demographics tool allows users to view census data in a more informative and intuitive manner. The Data Analysis System allows users to perform useful analyses online without having to download and format raw data, and the Quick Figures and Tables function provides access to thousands of previously analyzed data in table and figure formats to provide quick answers to topical research questions. A complete listing of NCES data access tools is available at http://nces.ed.govlpubsearch/onlinedata.asp.

Web-based surveys offer many advantages over other forms of data collection and analysis. They save time and money by reducing the amount of mailing, programming, data entry and cleaning, and preparation for analysis. They also provide more flexibility for researchers working with the data and respondents filling out the forms. Overall, web-based surveys increase the timeliness and quality of data while minimizing respondent burden. NCES first used the web in this manner for data submissions in universe collections in the mid-1990s. Next, the Center developed an online system to collect survey data from sampled institutions. The 1999 pilot of this system in the Institutional Prices and Student Financial Aid survey was successful, leading to its implementation in collections of data in the administration of three other surveys: Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, State Library Agencies, and Academic Library Survey. After these successes, NCES broke new territory in education data collection by applying data encryption methods so that it was possible to securely collect confidential survey data not just from institutions, but also from individual survey respondents. This secure data collection system will be implemented beginning with the administration of the longitudinal Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) survey. In 2001, NCES began creating an interactive interface for the administration of the system that allows statisticians to maintain surveys without programmer support. These online survey collection initiatives helped to create uniformity and consistency across NCES surveys and to provide a foundation for an NCES comprehensive integrated database. NCES is working on a collaborative pilot project with four states to develop Extensible Markup Language (XML) technology for use in the collection of data from the universe of U.S. public elementary and secondary schools. NCES is also collaborating with the Planning and Performance Management Service in the Office of the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Education to evaluate the use of XML technology in support of the Performance-Based Data Base Management initiative. This technology is expected to form the foundation of the next generation of interactive data exchange. Eventually, schools and local and state education agencies will be able to use this XML technology to collect and share education-related and administrative data."}, {"section_title": "Building a Comprehensive, Integrated NCES Database", "text": "The concept of providing an integrated collection of related data from multiple sources in order to respond to complex inquiries has been around for some time. Integrating scattered resources into a central database is the next logical step in the expansion of automated information systems, enabling much more powerful and flexible analysis. With education statistics, analyses have often been constructed with specific survey data. Cross-survey or time-trend analyses frequently required long and expansive data massaging and custom analysis. A centralized database of education information will provide a rich, yet convenient resource for in-depth research. It will also provide a mechanism to respond to simple, but specific queries, such as: \"How do enrollment changes in my school district compare with those in other similar districts in another state?\" The objective is to build a new education information source within the web site that will provide integrated access to survey and linked survey data, metadata, survey instruments and documentation, and ultimately reports and other published analysis. The database will be distinguished from existing NCES products in three respects: It will be exclusively Web based; it will contain a growing repository of linked data from different surveys; and it will feature tools that will enable customers to easily find, extract, and analyze NCES data directly. The NCES centralized database will be designed to expand and improve as more data are uploaded and web tools become more powerful. From a customer perspective, the major benefit of the database will be more extensive web access to NCES survey data and documentation."}, {"section_title": "Technology Research", "text": "In addition to incorporating current technologies into its programs and operations, NCES helps sponsor a broad agenda to extend technological capabilities.

Other important issues addressed are school finance, school safety, teacher qualifications, school reform, teacher professional development, and the education of special-needs populations. The core program includes national, state, and local data collection systems on public elementary and secondary education (e.g., the Common Core of Data (CCD) Survey). Other key NCES data collection programs include the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), the Private School Survey (PSS), and the National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES). These surveys, along with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, High School and Beyond, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, supply a wealth of information about elementary and secondary education in the nation."}, {"section_title": "Data Uses", "text": "The statistics collected from state education agencies, other elementary/secondary institutions, staff, and students are used extensively by people outside of NCES. They are used for testimony before congressional committees, planning in various federal executive departments, and projects developed by professional organizations. They are used by state executive and legislative staff, state and local education agencies, and associations of local school systems. Other users are colleges, universities, education research facilities, businesses that work with educational institutions, and the media (for reporting on educational issues and events). Federal, state, and local governments make numerous requests for data. For example, representatives often request data on the demographic characteristics of school districts in their states; federal agencies request data on numbers of teachers and pupils by school level and type; state governments request data on high school dropouts and teacher attrition rates; and local governments request analyses of teacher demographics. In addition to federal, state, and local governmental requests for elementary and secondary information, foreign governments also request data on trends in American public schools. The media often need a great deal of data on elementary and secondary education for their reporting. For example, the media have used analyses of first-time teachers in the United States, characteristics of public schools, dropout rates, test scores, and urban school trends in their reporting. Colleges and universities request CD-ROMs of all of the elementary and secondary surveys. Some items of interest for college researchers have been teacher qualifications in mathematics and 30 20 science, poverty status of schools and school districts, free-lunch eligibility of students, dropout rates and high school completions, class size, crime and violence, and persistence and attainment. Business organizations, including marketing and survey firms, use demographic profiles of schools and districts in their research. Also, parents use data on elementary and secondary schools and school districts (such as per pupil expenditures and class size) when they are in the process of moving their families to a new location.\nThe NCES postsecondary education data systems provide information such as trends in enrollment and degree completion, patterns of expenditures and revenues of institutions, patterns of student financial aid, workload of faculty, and the relationship between educational experience and labor market outcomes. These data are used to describe the condition of postsecondary education and to monitor changes. Federal program staff have used IPEDS and student survey data to address policy issues on financial aid programs. Policymakers at the state and institutional levels have used IPEDS data for planning purposes. Government commissions have used these data to monitor compliance with federal legislation. Thousands of requests for information, based on IPEDS and other postsecondary surveys, are received by NCES each year. Those requesting data fall roughly into the following seven categories: Members of the executive branch, Congress and congressional committees, and a number of independent federal agencies use information from NCES on a regular basis. For example, an office of the legislative branch used IPEDS information to develop a profile of for-profit, less-than-2-year institutions. Several executive branch offices use the information to track baccalaureate and higher degree data by selected fields of study and minority status of degree recipients. An independent federal agency uses the information to track degree completions in engineering and scientific fields of study. State higher education agencies regularly use the data to help determine salary and fringe-benefit packages for their full-time instructional faculty. Other state agencies use the completions and institutional data on an annual basis to evaluate the availability of specific career training programs. Several state agencies have used the residence and migration data to determine where their high school graduates enroll in postsecondary education institutions. National and regional education associations annually request tabulations to determine enrollment patterns by racial/ethnic categories and fields of study, and finance data to review the economic health of postsecondary education institutions. Individual institutions use similar information at an institutional level for peer analyses and institutional planning purposes. These peer analyses range from comparing selected financial ratios to comparing proportions of minority student enrollments. The media, business community, and general public use postsecondary data in a variety of ways. For example, one newspaper developed a major article comparing public 4-year institutions across selected states. Members of the business community have used degree completion data to target minority recruitment efforts in selected fields of study. The general public regularly requests information on which institutions offer degrees in specific fields of study, and the new IPEDS College Opportunities On-Line (IPEDS COOL) is used regularly by students, parents, and guidance counselors to help prospective college applicants choose the right institution. Congress, states, colleges, higher education associations, and other researchers use the data to describe students and faculty, financial aid programs, persistence and completion, and outcomes after completion.\nNAEP data have been used frequently in numerous ways by researchers, educators, policymakers, and the general public. Researchers have used NAEP data to describe performance trends in many subject areas, such as learning reading and mathematics skills, achievement in the arts, teachers' instructional practices, and school contextual characteristics. Policymakers often cite NAEP data to illustrate the state of the American education system. Educators have used the results to develop standards for improving mathematics and science curriculums. State and local officials have used NAEP data to identify the need for education reform. State performance on NAEP reading and mathematics assessments will be a major tool for examining state success in the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).\nNCES receives many requests for information about education in other countries, such as school achievement levels, school completion rates, school expenditure levels, and higher education enrollment rates. Policymakers, such as chief state school officers, governors, and local school officials, also want to know the average level of achievement in various subject matters in other countries. Most requests are for data concerning highly developed countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, and Japan). This particular concern relates to maintaining a leading 129 position in the world economy. However, interest goes beyond how well the education systems do in preparing youth for the labor force, to questions of civic engagement and further participation in education. NCES also provides international data on instructional practices. These data are gathered through two vehicles: survey data gathered at the same time assessment data are collected and videotape data. Both vehicles allow researchers to examine and illustrate instructional practices around the world. Data from these international activities appear prominently in numerous publications produced not only in the United States, but also by international organizations. For example, the OECD publication, Education at a Glance, relies heavily on data gathered through NCES. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reports on literacy have begun to follow the conventions developed by the International Adult Literacy Study, which NCES helped to underwrite."}, {"section_title": "Studies Common Core of Data", "text": "The Common Core of Data (CCD) is the primary NCES database on public elementary and secondary education in the United States. The annual CCD is a comprehensive national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts that contains comparable data across all states. The objectives of the CCD are twofold. First, it is designed to provide an official listing of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the nation that can be used to select samples for other NCES surveys, and to provide directory information for a variety of users. Second, the CCD provides basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and secondary schools, students, and staff. The data sets within the CCD can be used separately or linked with one another to provide information on many topics of interest. For example, they can be used to analyze differences in expenditures for education across large and small, or urban, suburban, and rural school districts. The CCD can be used to produce dropout rates for different types ofschool districts_and track changes over time. It also can be used to measure changes in the racial/ethnic distribution of students in public schools. The school universe allows users to look at characteristics, such as pupil/teacher ratios at various instructional levels, or to use the addresses in the school locator to request records for transferring students. All of this information can be found on the CCD web site (http://nces.ed.gov/ccd). In addition, an annually produced CD-ROM links all of the CCD data, fiscal and nonfiscal, with school district-level data from the 1990 Decennial Census in an easy-to-use format. (Census 2000 data will be added in 2003.) The CCD is an important resource for policymakers at the state and local levels. The CCD provides basic statistics on schools, school districts, and states. Some examples of descriptive statistics available from CCD are student enrollment by race/ethnicity, the number and types of schools, revenues and expenditures of school districts, and the number of high school completers and dropouts."}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "The CCD survey collects data on all public elementary and secondary, schools, local education agencies, and state education agencies (SEAs) throughout the United States. The CCD contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on schools and school districts, data on 3 1 students and staff, and fiscal data. The general descriptive information includes school and district name, address, phone number, and type of locale (e.g., rural or urban), as well as some information about the type of school (e.g., magnet, Title I, charter) or district (e.g., regular, state operated). The data on students include demographic, enrollment, and outcome characteristics. The numbers and types of education staff are reported as well. The fiscal data cover revenues and expenditures by object and function. The CCD is made up of five surveys sent to state education departments. Most of the data are obtained from administrative records maintained by SEAs. Statistical information is collected annually from public elementary and secondary schools (approximately 94,000), public school districts (approximately 17,000), the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the U.S. Department of Defense dependents' schools, and the 5 outlying areas. The SEAs compile CCD data into prescribed formats and transmit the information to NCES.\nThe sample design for SASS is a stratified probability sample in which schools are selected first; then within schools, the principal and a sample of teachers are surveyed. The SASS sample has been designed to support the following types of estimates and comparisons: national and state estimates for public schools, teachers, and districts; national estimates for private schools and teachers by religious affiliation or type of school; national data on BIA schools; national data on public charter schools; and national comparisons of elementary, secondary, and combined schools and teachers. The teacher sample also supports comparisons of new versus experienced teachers, teachers by teaching assignment field, and many other characteristics of teachers. For the 1999-2000 administration of SASS, one major new component was added to the survey. SASS covered the entire population of public charter schools in the United States, as well as their principals, as of the 1998-99 school year. In addition, in the same manner as for traditional public and private schools, a sample of teachers within each charter school was surveyed.\nTwo questionnaires comprise the TFS: The Teacher Follow-up Survey Questionnaire for Former Teachers and the Teacher Follow-up Survey Questionnaire for Current Teachers (those who remained in the same school as well as those who moved to another school). These questionnaires ask teachers about their current status, occupational changes and plans, reasons for staying in (or leaving) teaching, and attitudes about the teaching profession. The first administration of the TFS was in the 1988-89 school year with a sample from the 1987 88 SASS of about 2,500 teachers who had left teaching and 5,000 who were still in teaching. The size of the sample is approximately the same for every cycle of the TFS. There have been three more administrations of the TFS, 1991TFS, -92, 1994TFS, -95, and 2000. Each collection of the TFS is a followup to the SASS sample of the previous year.\nThe School Crime Supplement is conducted from January through June of the collection year in all NCVS sample households. Within these households, eligible respondents for the School Crime Supplement are household members between the ages of 12 and 18 who attended school at any time in the previous 6 months. The school had to be one that would advance them toward the receipt of a high school diploma. Eligible individuals are administered the supplemental questions only after the entire NCVS interview is completed. Around 9,000 interviews of youth were obtained in the 2003 School Crime Supplement. A rotation scheme is used in order to reduce the burden on respondents that could result if they were permanently in the sample. The same rotation scheme employed for the NCVS survey design is used for the School Crime Supplement. The sample of households is divided into groups or rotations. One rotation group enters the sample every 6 months, and the corresponding rotation group from a previous sample is phased out. Households remain in the sample for 3 years, and each household is interviewed once every 6 months during that time. Households in the sample for the first time are in the incoming rotation and are interviewed in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone except the in-person fifth interview to reestablish personal contact. In 1995 and subsequent collections, about 30 percent of the households were interviewed by telephone from a centralized dialing facility using caller-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) techniques. Other telephone interviews were conducted by the same interviewer who conducted the personal interviews. The Census Bureau conducts the data collection. Reports released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics using NCES data can be found on the web (http:/www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs).\nSSOCS is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of about 2,500 public elementary and secondary schools. The survey sample is stratified so that it can provide separate estimates by instructional level, type of locale, and enrollment size. Data are collected through a self-administered questionnaire delivered by mail. Extensive telephone follow-up is used to achieve acceptable response rates. SSOCS was first administered in the spring and summer of 2000. It will be administered again in the spring of 2004. NCES plans to conduct SSOCS every 4 years in order to provide continued updates on crime and safety in U.S. schools. The National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES) is the only general-purpose survey conducted by NCES to collect education data through a household-based survey. Historically, NCES has collected data from teachers, students, and schools through school-based surveys and from administrative records through surveys of school districts and state education agencies. As a household-based survey, the NHES addresses many issues in education that had not been addressed previously by other NCES data collection activities, such as early childhood care arrangements and education, children's readiness for school, parent involvement in elementary and secondary education, and adult participation in education outside of traditional postsecondary institutions.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Households are selected using random-digit-dialing (RDD) methods, and data are collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATO procedures. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. For each NHES survey, between 45,000 and 60,000 households are screened, and individuals within households who meet predetermined criteria are sampled for more detailed or extended interviews. The data are weighted to permit estimates of the entire population that the sample is intended to represent. The NHES survey for a given year typically consists of a screener questionnaire that collects household composition and demographic data and two to three substantive surveys addressing education-related topics. Generally, between 10,000 and 20,000 interviews are obtained for each survey. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable national estimates of the characteristics of children's and adults' educational experiences for the targeted populations and for relevant subgroups defined by race and ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interest, especially for monitoring education trends over time. Therefore, the NHES design oversamples Black and Hispanic subgroups in order to increase the reliability of estimates for those groups.\nFRSS surveys collect and report data on key education issues at the elementary and secondary levels. A similar survey system, the Postsecondary Education Quick Information System (PEQIS), conducts time-sensitive surveys at the postsecondary level (see description in chapter 4). Data collected through FRSS surveys are representative at the national level, drawing from a universe that is appropriate for each study. The FRSS collects data from state education agencies and national samples of other educational organizations and participants, including: local education agencies; public and private elementary and secondary schools; elementary and secondary school teachers and principals; and public and school libraries. In order to present high-quality data quickly, the FRSS provides the following services: research on survey topics and questionnaire design, pretest of survey questionnaires, quality control of survey data, national estimates reported within 16 months of survey mail-out, guarantee of response rates of 90 percent or higher, tabulations and other analyses of data, and preparation of survey reports. The FRSS also has the capability to conduct brief surveys of households using random-digit-dialing telephone techniques.\nThe CPS is a nationally representative probability sample survey of households. A multistage stratified sampling scheme is used to select sample households. The survey is conducted in approximately 57,000 dwelling units monthly. Dwelling units are in sample for 4 successive months, out of sample for the next 8 months, and then returned to the sample for the following 4 months. An adult member of each household provides information for all members of the household.\nWithin IPEDS, postsecondary education is defined as \"the provision of a formal instructional program whose curriculum is designed primarily for students who are beyond the compulsory age for high school. This includes programs whose purpose is academic, vocational, and continuing professional education, and excludes avocational and adult basic education programs.\" Organizations that provide instructional programs as described in the definition above are considered institutions within the IPEDS universe if their primary purpose is the provision of postsecondary education. The size of the institution, diversity of program offerings, levels of awards, degree or certification curricula, type of accreditation, and other distinguishing criteria are considered characteristics of particular institutions. These criteria are not used to determine which institutions are included in or excluded from the IPEDS universe. This universe of postsecondaiy education institutions is divided into the following three categories based on the highest degree awarded or the length of the longest program: baccalaureate or higher institutions; 2-year award institutions (i.e., institutions must have at least a 2-year program, but less than a 4-year program); and less-than-2-year institutions. Each of these three categories is further disaggregated by type of financial control: public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit. The resulting nine institutional categories are called \"sectors\" within the IPEDS universe and are used, in conjunction with their Title IV eligibility status, to determine which data collection items institutions are asked to complete. Despite the diversity of institutions across these sectors, since institutions are the primary unit for data collection, institutional units must be defined as consistently as possible. IPEDS does not request separate reports from more than one component within an individual institution. However, separate branch campuses are asked to report as individual units; thus, each institution in a multiinstitutional system and each separate branch in a multi-campus system reports separately. IPEDS defines a branch institution as \"a campus or site that is not temporary, is located in a community beyond a reasonable commuting distance from its parent institution, and offers organized programs of study, not just courses.\" This last criterion is the most important. It means that at least one degree or award program can be completed entirely at the site, without requiring any attendance at the main campus or any other institution within the system. The IPEDS universe of postsecondary institutions includes only those institutions that are open to the general public. Therefore, training sites at prisons, military bases, and corporations are not considered separate institutions or branches in IPEDS, regardless of how the institutional system classifies such training sites. Data on enrollment, finance, and completions from such locations or training sites are to be incorporated into the data reported by the main campus or any other institution or branch campus in the system that is most appropriate.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a large sample of households in a timely fashion. Households are selected using random-digitdialing (RDD) methods, and data are collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATO procedures. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each NHES survey, between 45,000 and 60,000 households are screened, and individuals within households who meet predetermined criteria are sampled for more detailed or extended interviews. The data are weighted to permit estimates of the entire population that the sample is intended to represent. The NHES survey for a given year typically consists of a screener questionnaire that collects household composition and demographic data and two to three substantive surveys addressing education-related topics. Generally, between 10,000 and 20,000 interviews are obtained for each survey. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable national estimates of the characteristics of children's and adults' educational experiences for the targeted populations and for relevant subgroups defined by race and ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interest, 4 especially for monitoring education trends over time. Therefore, the NHES design oversamples Black and Hispanic subgroups in order to increase the reliability of estimates for those groups. Another goal of the NHES is to monitor educational activities over time. The NHES has collected data by repeating substantive surveys on a rotating basis in order to provide comparative data across survey years, with the exceptions of the School Safety and Discipline (SSD-NHES:1993) and Household and Library Use (HHL-NHES:1996) surveys. Each administration of the NHES has benefited from experience with previous cycles, resulting in enhancements to the survey procedures and content. Thus, while the NHES affords the opportunity for tracking phenomena over time, it is dynamic in addressing new issues and including conceptual and methodological refinements. A design feature that was unique to the 1996 administration was the collection of demographic and educational information on members of all households rather than just those households that were eligible for a topical survey. This expanded screening feature included a brief set of questions on the use of public libraries. The total household sample size was large enough to produce state estimates for these brief topical questions. In 1999, the NHES was designed as a special end-of-decade collection to measure key topics covered in previous NHES surveys. These topics included early childhood education and school readiness, parent and family involvement in education, civic involvement, and adult education and lifelong learning.\nWith the increased use of technology, the design for the NPSAS sample has changed over the years. The design no longer involves an initial sample of geographic areas and institutions within geographic areas. To be eligible for inclusion in the institutional sample, an institution must satisfy the following conditions: offer an education program designed for persons who have completed secondary education; offer an academic, occupational, or vocational program; offer access to persons other than those employed by the institution; offer more than just correspondence courses; offer at least one program lasting 3 months or longer; and be located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. Additional information on the sample design for each NPSAS is described in the Methodology Report for each cycle.\nThe first cycle of NSOPF was conducted by NCES with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1987-88 (NSOPF:88) with a sample of about 500 colleges and universities, over 3,000 department chairpersons, and over 11,000 instructional faculty. The second and third cycles of NSOPF were conducted by NCES with support from NEH and the National Science Foundation in 1992-93 (NSOPF:93) and 1998-99 (NSOPF:99), respectively. NSOPF:93 and NSOPF:99 were limited to surveys of institutions and faculty, but with substantially expanded samples of about 975 colleges and universities, and 30,000 faculty and instructional staff. NSOPF:88 was limited to faculty and staff who had some instructional responsibilities (e.g., teaching one or more courses for credit, supervising thesis or dissertation committees, individualized instruction), while NSOPF:93 and NSOPF:99 included these individuals, as well as faculty who had no instructional responsibilities (e.g., those engaged exclusively in research, administration, or public service). Faculty status was determined by each institution. A two-stage stratified random sample design was used for all three studies. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of a subset of postsecondary institutions drawn from the IPEDS universe. The subset of institutions included all public and private, not-for-profit U.S. postsecondary institutions that granted a 2-year or higher degree. A modified Carnegie classification was used to stratify institutions by type and control. The second-stage sampling frame consisted of a subset of faculty and instructional staff drawn from lists of faculty and instructional staff provided by the institutions selected in the first-stage sampling. This subset of faculty and instructional staff was surveyed by mail, with computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) nonresponse follow-up. In addition, web versions of the questionnaires were made available for NSOPF:99. All three studies gathered information regarding the backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, attitudes, and future plans of both full-and part-time faculty. In addition, information was gathered from institutional-and department-level respondents (department-level data collected in 1988 only) on such issues as faculty composition, turnover, recruitment, retention, and tenure policies. The next cycle of NSOPF is planned for 2003-04.\nSurvey forms are mailed to graduate deans each May for distribution to individuals receiving their doctorates between July 1 and June 30 of the next year. The data are collected, edited, and published by the National Opinion Research Corporation (NORC). Each year, NORC publishes general survey results in a summary report. NORC also provides detailed tabulations to each sponsoring agency.\nThe PEQIS employs a standing sample (panel) of approximately 1,600 postsecondary education institutions and a panel of 51 state higher education agencies. The PEQIS is designed to conduct brief surveys of postsecondary institutions or state higher education agencies on topics of national importance. Surveys are generally limited to two or three pages of questions, with a response burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. The sampling frame for the PEQIS panel recruited in 2002 was constructed from the 2000 IPEDS Institutional Characteristics file. The PEQIS frame included 2-and 4-year (including graduate-level) postsecondary education institutions located in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The PEQIS sampling frame was stratified by instructional level (4-year, 2year,), control (public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit), highest level of offering (doctor's/first-professional, master's, bachelor's, and less than bachelor's), and total enrollment. Within each of the strata, institutions were sorted by region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West) and minority enrollment. Each institution in the PEQIS panel was asked to identify a campus representative to serve as survey coordinator. The campus representative facilitates data collection by identifying the appropriate respondent for each survey and forwarding the questionnaire to that person. \nNAEP has evolved since 1969 through a number of stages. Since 1969, NAEP reported on the performance of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students representative of the nation and four geographic regions. Subjects assessed included reading, writing, mathematics, science, music, art, consumer skills, and energy awareness. Reporting consisted of the percentage of students correctly responding to test questions. A number of improvements were made to NAEP beginning in 1984. Performance of students began to be reported on a scale, rather than by individual item statistics. Samples representative of both grades (4th, 8th, and 12th) and ages (9, 13, and 17) were collected. Subjects assessed included reading, writing, history, geography, civics, computer competence, and literature. In 1988, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) was created to set policy for NAEP, in connection with its task to report academic performance on state representative samples. State NAEP assesses mathematics, reading, writing, and science. The assessments given in the states are exactly the same as those given nationally but, because the national NAEP samples were not designed to support the reporting of accurate and representative state-level results, separate 9 4 84 representative samples of students were selected for each participating jurisdiction/state. State NAEP assesses at grades 4 and 8, but not at grade 12. NAGB developed new frameworks for subjects assessed. For these newly specified test specifications, NAGB set achievement levels of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced for new subjects assessed, beginning in 1990. NAEP assessed mathematics, reading, writing, and science for both national and state representative samples. These NAEP assessments made it possible for the program to reflect current educational content and assessment methodology. Items for this version of NAEP (main NAEP) include both multiple-choice and constructed-response (requiring written answers) questions, and the content and nature of the instruments evolve to match instructional practice and incorporate the latest advances in assessment methodology. NAEP administers national main NAEP assessments according to the NAGB-adopted assessment schedule. For example, a national assessment of foreign language is planned for 2004, and assessments of U.S. history, civics, and economics are scheduled for 2006. National NAEP reports statistical information about student performance and factors related to educational performance for the nation and specific subgroups of the population. In 2002, NAEP began a Trial Urban District Assessment. In 2002, four additional districts participated in addition to the original five. The final component of NAEP is the long-term trend. This assessment used the same types of questions (mostly multiple-choice) and data collection procedures that were used in the early 1970s for assessing reading, mathematics, and science. Age-representative samples were used, and data from assessments prior to 1984 were placed on the same scale in order to measure academic change over the decades. The writing long-term trend began in 1984, reporting results for graderepresentative samples (4th, 8th, and llth grades). Because of technical problems, the last data point for the writing long-term trend was for 1996. The long-term trend is being revised to improve the quality of the assessment. The next long-term trend assessment in 2004 will report on the mathematics performance of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds relative to achievement in 1973, and 2004 reading achievement relative to 1971 performance. Results are reported for the nation, geographic regions of the nation, and various subgroups of the population such as racial and ethnic groups. Because the long-term trend assessment uses different instruments from those used in the main assessments and because students are sampled by age for the long-term trend assessment rather than by grade as in the main assessments, it is not possible to compare results from the two assessment programs. The existence of the two national assessment programslong-term trend and main makes it possible for NAEP to meet two important objectives: measuring educational progress over time and developing new assessment instruments that periodically reflect current educational content and assessment methodology. Since 1990, NAEP assessments in reading, mathematics, science, and writing have also been conducted for states and other jurisdictions that choose to participate. Beginning with the 2002 assessments, a combined sample of public schools was selected for both state and national NAEP. It was thought that drawing a subset of schools from all of the state samples to produce national estimates would reduce burden by decreasing the total number of schools participating in state and national NAEP. From this group of schools, representing 50 states, a subsample was identified as the national subset.\nThe HSTS is conducted with a nationally representative sample of students and schools. Beginning in the summer and continuing through the fall of the year, high school transcripts are collected for students who graduated from public and nonpublic high schools that were sampled for the NAEP assessments. The sample of schools is nationally representative of all schools in the United States, and the sample of students is representative of graduating seniors from each school. The transcript study includes only those students whose transcripts indicate that they graduated the year that the study was conducted. Most of the students sampled in the transcript study are in schools that participated in NAEP, and the remaining students were sampled specifically for the transcript study. The data collected from those students who participated in NAEP make it possible to associate course-taking patterns to academic performance, as measured by the NAEP assessment. To ensure maximum possible compatibility between the various transcript studies, similar procedures and formats used in previous studies for data editing, course coding, error resolution, and documentation have been used for each subsequent transcript study. This consistency enables users to compare cohorts of students with a minimum of effort. The HSTS database contains a variety of information on student and course-level characteristics. Some of the key variables are listed below. Data from the transcript studies are summarized in a set of reports: a summary report, a tabulations report, a technical report and user's guide, and a CD-ROM (restricted-use). The 2000 transcript study summary report, The High School Transcript Study: A Decade of Change in Curricula and Achievement, 1990-2000, focuses on the trends and changes in high school curriculum and student course-taking patterns for the past decade.\nThe 1992 NALS was administered in the summer of 1992 in person by trained interviewers to a nationally representative probability sample of about 13,000 individuals age 16 and older and to 1,100 adults incarcerated in federal and state prisons. In addition, 12 states funded sample supplements of 1,000 adults in order to obtain literacy estimates for their state populations. This was the first national study of literacy for all adults since the Adult Performance Level surveys, which were conducted in the early 1970s. The 2003 NAAL is a nationally representative and continuing assessment of the English language literacy skills of American adults age 16 and older. NAAL continues to use the definition of literacy underlying the 1992 assessment: using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential. Like the 1992 assessment, the 2003 NAAL focuses on a broad range of tasks that adults perform in order to function at work, at home, and in the community. The main data collection took place in 2003. Approximately 19,500 adults representing the household population from the 50 states and the District of Columbia were sampled. Black and Hispanic households were oversampled to ensure reliable estimates of their literacy proficiencies. In addition, about 1,200 inmates of federal and state prisons from across the country will be assessed in early 2004 in order to provide separate estimates of literacy levels for the incarcerated population.\nThe design of the ECLS-B is based on the assumption that children's preparation for school begins at (or before) birth and continues upon school entry. It is guided by a framework of children's development, care, and schooling that emphasizes the interaction among the child; the family; health care, child-care and education programs; and the community. The ECLS-B recognizes the importance and interrelatedness of factors that represent a child's health status and socioemotional and intellectual development. A nationally representative sample of approximately 13,500 children born during calendar year 2001 was selected for participation in the study. The sample consists of children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Asian and Pacific Islander, Chinese, and American Indian children; moderately low birthweight (1,500-2,500 grams) and very low birthweight (under 1,500 grams) children; and twins were oversampled. Children were selected at birth from birth certificates, the best and most affordable way of sampling newborns. The first data collection occurred when the children were approximately 9 months of age. Capturing data this soon after birth is important because much of the data collected at this time pertains to prenatal care and the health care of the mother and child during the first months of life. Data will be collected again when the children reach 2 and 4 years of age. Data will also be collected when the children enter kindergarten and first grade.\nThe design of the ECLS-K is guided by a framework of children's development and schooling that emphasizes the interaction between the child and family, the child and school, the family and school, and the family, school, and community. Thus, the ECLS-K recognizes the importance of factors that represent the child's health status and socioemotional and intellectual development, and incorporates factors from the child's family, community, and school and classroom environments. The study is particularly focused on the role that parents and families play in helping children adjust to formal school and in supporting their education through the primary and middle elementary grades. It also gathers information for understanding how schools prepare for and respond to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the children and families they serve.\nThe survey design provided for a highly stratified national probability sample of over 1,100 secondary schools as the first-stage units of selection. To make the study more useful for policy analyses, certain types of schools were oversampled: public schools with a high percentage of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority students, alternative public schools, and private schools with high-achieving students. The initial national sample for HS&B was considerably larger than that drawn in NLS:72. In this survey, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Parents of these students were also sampled. In schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were selected. The base year of this survey, which was conducted early in 1980, collected data from over 28,000 sophomores and 30,000 seniors. The longitudinal design of the study called for follow-up surveys of substantial subsets of the two cohorts at 2-year intervals. Data collection for the first follow-up was in spring 1982. Subsequent follow-ups were also undertaken in 1984 and 1986, and another follow-up of the sophomores was conducted in 1992. The first follow-up survey, conducted in 1982, sampled almost 40,000 students (12,000 seniors and 27,000 sophomores); the second, in 1984, sampled approximately 27,000 students (12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores); and the third, in 1986, sampled almost 27,000 students (also 12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores). The 1992 follow-up collected data from almost 15,000 sophomores. In 1993, a Postsecondaiy Education Transcript Study was conducted for the sophomore cohort. Data collection instruments in the base-year survey included: sophomore and senior student questionnaires with a series of cognitive tests; school questionnaires filled out by an official in each participating school; teacher comment checklists filled out by a teacher of the sampled student; second-language questionnaires; and parent questionnaires filled out by a sample of parents from both cohorts. The student questionnaires focused on individual and family background, high school experiences, work experiences, and future plans. Cognitive tests administered to students measured both verbal and quantitative abilities. Sophomore tests included brief achievement measures in science, writing, and civics, while seniors were asked to respond to tests measuring abstract and nonverbal abilities. The parent questionnaire elicited information about family attitudes, financial planning, and educational goals. The school questionnaire gathered information about enrollment, staff, educational programs, facilities and services, dropout rates, and special programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students. The teacher comment checklist provided teacher observations on students participating in the survey. The first follow-up of sophomores provided insights into the school dropout problem and the influence of the last 2 years of high school on student attitudes and aspirations. The second follow-up in 1984 included a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study of the senior cohort. The later followups of the sophomore cohort made it possible to trace the consequences of dropping out and the extent to which dropouts later return and complete high school. In brief, HS&B provides information on the educational, career, and personal development of young people as they move from high school into postsecondary education or the workforce and then into adult life. The initial study (NLS:72) 120 laid the groundwork for comparison with HS&B. It recorded the economic and social conditions surrounding high school seniors in that year and, within that context, their hopes and plans. It has since measured the outcomes, while also observing the intervening processes. HS&B allows researchers to monitor changes by retaining the same goals, measuring the economic returns of postsecondary education for minorities, and delineating the need for financial aid. By comparing the results of the two studies, researchers can determine how plans and outcomes differ in response to changing conditions or remain the same despite such changes. Additional concerns of HS&B encompass issues that surfaced since NLS:72 began: How did the availability (or lack thereof) of student financial aid alter student plans for further education? Did middle-income families alter their attitudes toward postsecondary education? These questions, as well as concerns about declining test scores, youth employment, and bilingual education, are addressed, along with a host of others.\nThe base-year sample of 1988 eighth-graders was designed to be representative at the national level. Two-stage probability sampling was used to select schools and students. The first stage involved stratified sampling of some 1,000 public and private schools from a universe of approximately 40,000 schools containing eighth-grade students. The second stage included random samples of approximately 24 to 26 students per school. Some 25,000 eighth-graders and their parents, teachers, and school principals were surveyed. When the student sample was selected, one parent and two teachers of each student were also selected. Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander students were oversampled to permit analysis of the performance of language-minority students. NELS:88 is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. It can complement and strengthen state and local efforts by furnishing new information on how school policies, teacher practices, and family involvement affect student educational outcomes (i.e., academic achievement, persistence in school, and participation in postsecondary education). In the base year, four cognitive tests (reading, science, history-government, and math) were administered in addition to the student questionnaire, a parent questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire. The design for the NELS:88 first follow-up survey included student, school administrator, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students took cognitive tests in reading, science, historygovernment, and math. The tests were designed to reflect 10th-grade coursework, but also had enough overlapping items with the 8th-and 12th-grade tests to permit measurement of academic growth. Selected teachers of each sampled student provided information about the student's study habits and performance, and about instructional practices in the student's classes. The NELS:88 first follow-up was conducted between February and May of 1990. During the spring of 1992, NCES surveyed this eighth-grade cohort again as part of the second follow-up. This second follow-up survey included student, school administrator, parent, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students and dropouts also took cognitive tests in reading, science, social science, and math. High school transcripts were also collected from second follow-up participants. During the spring of 1994, NCES surveyed this cohort again. The focus of the interviews was employment, education, and family formation experiences. The sampled population was interviewed using CATI in order to determine whether they completed high school, and, if so, by what means (e.g., regular completion, GED, or some other method). The interview also collected information about other activities since the last interview in 1992 (e.g., working, number of jobs, periods worked, description of work and education, postsecondary activities, field of study, and periods of time). Another follow-up was conducted in 2000, by which time many in this cohort had finished their postsecondary education and completed a transition into the labor force. Others had been in the labor force for about 8 years. Postsecondary transcripts were also collected in 2000.

In addition, the survey collects price information: tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses that a full-time, first-time degree-or certificate-seeking undergraduate student would expect to pay when entering the institution. This \"sticker price\" information is made available to prospective students, parents, counselors, and others on a user-friendly web siteCollege Opportunities On-Line (IPEDS COOL) (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool). CompletionsDegree completions by level (associate's, bachelor's, master's, doctor's, and firstprofessional) and other formal awards by length of program, race/ethnicity and gender of recipient, and 6-digit Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code. Completion data by race/ethnicity at the 2-digit CIP level became an annual collection in 1990; beginning in 1995, race/ethnicity data were collected at the 6-digit CIP level. Beginning with the 2001 collection, institutions were able to report the number of students with double majors by level of degree and 6-digit CIP code of the second major. EnrollmentFull-and part-time enrollment, in the fall, by level (undergraduate, first-professional, and graduate) and by race/ethnicity and gender of student. Beginning in 1990, race/ethnicity data were collected annually. (Prior to 1990, race/ethnicity data were collected in even-numbered years.) Age distributions are collected in odd-numbered years; data on state of residence of first-time freshmen (first-time, first-year students) are collected in even-numbered years. Four-year institutions are also required to complete enrollment data by level, race/ethnicity, and gender for nine selected fields of study in even-numbered years for OCR. In addition, the enrollment survey now collects the12-month instructional activity and unduplicated headcount data, which are needed to compute a standardized, full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment statistic for the entire academic year. FTE is useful for gauging the size of the educational enterprise at the institution. Institutions are also asked to provide the total number of first-time undergraduate students regardless of status (degree-or nondegree-seeking; first year or transfer in; full-or part-time). Beginning in 2003, the Enrollment survey will collect fall-to-fall retention data on first-year undergraduate students. Graduation RatesData on the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time degree-or certificate-seeking students in a particular year (cohort), by race/ethnicity and gender; number completing their program within 150 percent of normal time to completion; number transferred to other institutions; and number receiving athletically related student aid in the cohort and number completing within 150 percent of normal time to completion. Worksheets automatically calculate rates, including average rates over 4 years. This survey was developed to help institutions comply with requirements of the Student Right-to-Know Act. Student Financial AidNumber of full-time, first-time degree-and certificate-seeking undergraduate students, total number of these students receiving financial aid, and average amount of aid received by type of aid. Employees by Assigned PositionData on the number of full-and part-time employees by occupational category, faculty status, and tenure status (if applicable). Data on employees in medical schools are collected separately. This survey was first implemented in 2001.\u00b0P Fall StaffNumber of full-time faculty by race/ethnicity and gender, contract length, and salary class intervals; number of other persons employed full time by race/ethnicity and gender, primary occupational activity, and salary class intervals; number of part-time employees by primary occupational activity, race/ethnicity, and gender; and tenure of full-time faculty by academic rank and new hires by primary occupational activity, both by race/ethnicity and gender. Beginning with the 1993 survey year, Fall Staff replaced the EE0-6 survey conducted by the EEOC. SalariesNumber of full-time instructional faculty by rank, gender, and length of contract; total salary outlay; and fringe benefits and number of full-time instructional faculty covered by these benefits. The survey became annual in 1990, but data were not collected in 2000. Prior to 2001, data were collected by tenure status. FinanceRevenues by source (e.g., tuition and fees, government grants and contracts, private gifts); current fund expenditures by function (e.g., instruction, research, plant maintenance and operation); physical plant assets and indebtedness; and endowment investments. Survey forms differ substantially for public and private institutions because of differences in accounting standards.\nStudent Records (from institutional records) Year in school, major field of study, type and control of institution, attendance status, tuition and fees, admission test scores, financial aid received, price of attendance, student budget information and expected family contribution for aided students, grade point average, age, and date first enrolled.

Data are available on such student characteristics as gender, race and ethnicity, level of parents' education, eligibility for the free or reduced-price lunch program, participation in Title I to assist at-risk students, attendance at public or private schools, limited English proficiency, and presence of a disability. Characteristics of teachers include academic preparation and classroom practices. NAEP also reports on school characteristics, such as courses offered, availability of computers, participation of parents, and the existence of problems such as tardiness or violence. For the long-term trends, background information is collected from students and school administrators only. Elementary and Secondary School Students SurveyThe primary data collected by NAEP are about student performance and educational experience. Major current assessment areas include reading, writing, mathematics, science, civics, U.S. history, geography, foreign languages, and the arts. Data include overall performance, performance on specific content dimensions, demographic characteristics, classroom experiences, and aspirations for the future. School Characteristics and Policy SurveyIn conjunction with student performance surveys, NCES routinely collects important supplemental data about school characteristics and school policies, including enrollment, curriculum testing, and objective-setting practices; school administrative practices; school conditions and facilities; special services; and programs. Teacher SurveyNAEP also collects important supplemental data from teachers whose students are respondents of the assessment surveys. Teacher data include race/ethnicity, sex, field of study, teaching certification, professional development, full-time teaching experience, classroom instructional practices, and subject-matter specialization.\nIn addition to describing the status and progress of literacy in the nation and in each of the participating states, the 2003 NAAL will provide information about background factors associated with literacy, the skill levels of the least literate adults, and the application of literacy skills to healthrelated materials. The 2003 NAAL features two new components that enhance its ability to measure the literacy of the least literate adults: the Fluency Addition to NAAL (FAN) and the Adult Literacy Supplemental Assessment (ALSA). These components will provide important new data on the 92 literacy skills of those adults with the poorest text comprehension skills. Other enhancements to NAAL include a more extensive background questionnaire and the ability to provide a health literacy score. Fluency Addition to NAAL (FAN). FAN is completed by all NAAL participants. FAN uses speechrecognition software to assess the ability of adults to decode and recognize words and to read with fluency. FAN tasks include reading lists of words and numbers as well as text passages. Oral directions and questions are provided in English or Spanish, depending on each participant's choice. Words-per-minute and reading accuracy are recorded for analysis and scoring. Adult education providers, in particular, may use this information to offer appropriate instruction and courseware for literacy and professional training. Adult Literacy Supplemental Assessment (ALSA). ALSA participants are identified based on their performance on a set of core screening items; they complete ALSA instead of the main NAAL. ALSA assesses the ability of the least literate adults to identify letters and numbers and to comprehend simple prose and documents. A unique feature of ALSA is its use of highly familiar stimulus materials that can be manipulated (e.g., packaged food products) and contextualized (i.e., supported by visual information, logos, and sight words). As with FAN, oral directions and questions are provided in either English or Spanish. Unlike FAN, however, ALSA also allows participants to answer in either English or Spanish. Policymakers may use information about the skill levels of the least literate adults to create or improve programs that help their employment, health status, selfesteem, and ability to participate in a free society. Enhanced background questionnaire. The new background questionnaire developed for NAAL provides more information about the demographics and other factors associated with literacy. Federal and state policymakers may use this information to improve literacy services that close the gap between low-and high-performing groups, to inform workplace literacy programs, and to encourage further research on the factors associated with low literacy. NAAL health literacy score. The health literacy score is derived from 26 health-related questions embedded in the main NAAL, plus 10 health-related questions included in the enhanced background questionnaire. The health questions assess the ability of adults to apply literacy skills to understand health-related materials and forms. Health organizations can use the health literacy information to identify target audiences for specific types of health information, the literacy level at which materials for these audiences should be written, and the best ways of reaching them. The 2003 NAAL data will be used to produce a comprehensive survey report and a \"popular\" report designed for a more general audience, both of which will address the status of literacy among adults in the United States and literacy trends over time. In addition, NCES will produce data tables for reporting statewide results for each of the six participating states (Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, and Oklahoma). \nThe emphasis that is being placed on the different aspects of children's development and the different environments in which learning occurs is critically important for the design of the ECLS-B. While children's parents are the primary reporters throughout the life of the study, at varying points it is necessary to gather data from children's birth records, their care and early education providers, their schools and teachers, and from the children themselves. Children's Birth CertificatesA variety of useful data is captured in birth certificates. They provide information on the date of birth and children's gender. Information is also available on parents' education, parents' race and ethnicity (including Hispanic origin), and mother's marital status. Birth certificates provide information on the mother's pregnancy history, prenatal care, medical and other risk factors during this pregnancy, and complications during labor and birth. Health characteristics of children, such as congenital anomalies and abnormal conditions of the baby and the baby's APGAR score, are also provided.\nBecause numerous factors in schools, homes, and communities influence children's academic and social outcomes, data for the ECLS-K are collected not only from children, but also from their parents-guardians, teachers, and school administrators. Student AssessmentsSampled children participate in various activities that measure the extent to which they exhibit those abilities and skills deemed important for success in school. They are asked to participate in activities designed to measure important cognitive (e.g., general knowledge, literacy, and quantitative skills) and noncognitive (e.g., physical) outcomes. Measures of a child's cognitive skills are obtained through an untimed one-on-one assessment of the child. Measures of physical development include both height and weight measurements. Also, in the fall of kindergarten, a psychomotor assessment is administered to measure children's motor abilities, coordination, and visual motor skills. In the years when most of the children are in the third and fifth grades, they are asked to report on their perceptions of and interests in school and school subjects such as reading and mathematics. In the fifth grade, children are asked to report on the types of food and beverages they can purchase at school and that they consume at home. Parent-Guardian InterviewsParents and guardians are an important source of information about the families of the children selected for the study and about themselves. In telephone interviews (or in personal interviews for households without telephones), they provide key information about children's development and their experiences with family members, schools, and others. The parentguardian interviews of the ECLS-K cover family background, demographics, and home environment. The content includes family structure; nativity (i.e., country of origin); primary language spoken; parental involvement with the child's school; childcare; child's health and well-being; parental values, beliefs, and expectations; home environment, activities, and cognitive stimulation; parental monitoring; neighborhood; parent education; parent employment; parent income and assets; receipt of welfare and other public transfers; discipline, warmth, and emotional supportiveness; parents' psychological well-being and health; and critical family processes. In the kindergarten and first-grade data collections, parent-guardian interviews also include items asking parents-guardians to rate their child's social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches toward learning. Teacher QuestionnairesLike parents, teachers represent a valuable source of information on themselves and the children's learning environment (i.e., the classroom). In self-administered questionnaires, teachers are asked to provide information about their own backgrounds, teaching practices, and experiences, along with information on the classroom setting for the sampled children they teach. The content covered in the teacher questionnaires of the ECLS-K includes class type and composition, class organization, class activities, curricular focus and evaluation methods, parent involvement, views on readiness, professional development, and the teacher's professional background. Teacher RatingsTeachers are also asked to evaluate sampled children on a number of critical cognitive and behavioral dimensions. Teacher cognitive ratings measure teachers' perceptions of students' academic achievement and dispositions for learning in three domainslanguage/literacy, mathematics, and general knowledge (i.e., science and social studies). Ratings of children's socioemotional behaviors provide measures of children's prosocial and problem behaviors and their approaches toward learning. Teachers also complete checklists on the sampled children, reporting on such things as the children's language skills, special needs, program placements, attendance, and physical activity levels. Special Education Teacher QuestionnairesSpecial education teachers represent a valuable source of information on themselves and on the children's experience with special education services. In a self-administered questionnaire, they are asked to provide information about their background and experience and the instructional approaches used for the sampled children who receive these services. They also provide information on sampled children's disabilities, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and receipt of related services. School QuestionnairesIn a self-administered questionnaire, school administrators, principals, and headmasters provide information on the physical and organizational characteristics of their schools, and on the schools' learning environments and programs. Special attention is paid to the instructional philosophy of the school and its expectations for students. The content covered in the school questionnaires of the ECLS-K includes school characteristics, student characteristics, teaching staff characteristics, school policies and programs, principal characteristics, and school governance and climate. Additionally, field staff conduct an independent survey of the schools' physical facilities, atmosphere (e.g., fighting in hallways), and learning environments (e.g., student work displayed). Salary and Benefits QuestionnaireIn order to trace resources directly available to children, school district business offices or headmasters complete a self-administered questionnaire capturing information on salary, merit pay (e.g., education stipends), and benefits (e.g., payroll taxes, medical insurance) for sampled children's teachers and school administrators. It represents one of the first times that specific teacher salary data can be linked to outcomes of specific children. This information is collected during the kindergarten year. Student Records Abstract FormFor each sampled ECLS-K child, information is gathered from his/her school records. This form, completed by the school with information from its records, provides data on the child's attendance, the child's home language, whether the child has an IEP on record, and whether the child attended Head Start.\nBase Year SurveyAge, sex, racial/ethnic background, physical handicap, socioeconomic status of family and community, school characteristics, future education and work plans, test scores, school experience, school performance, work status, and work performance and satisfaction.

For further information on the CPS October Supplement, contact: In the 1990 Decennial Census, the Bureau of the Census developed the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System, in which 10,000,000 census block boundaries were digitally encoded (to 6 decimal places). The 51 boundaries of approximately 15,274 local education agencies, special education districts, Indian reservations, and military installations that have education activities within their boundaries were similarly digitized and encoded in the TIGER system, thus making it possible to convert the data from census blocks to education entities and produce tabulations. In 1992, under the sponsorship of NCES, the Census Bureau produced the 1990 Census School District Special Tabulation files using the basic record file of the 1990 Decennial Census data. These tabulations contain aggregate data describing attributes of groups of persons and households in school districts. With the exception of two data items (total population and total housing units), data were samplebased estimates. In many cases, the special tabulations were produced using a process of splitting census blocks to develop estimates for a school district. Files were used in combination with NCES data (i.e., CCD) and other Census Bureau data (i.e., School District Finance Survey [Form F-33]) to produce the School District Data Book. The School District Data Book is an electronic library containing social, economic, and administrative data for each of the 15,274 public school districts in the United States in 1990. The School District Data Book contains the most comprehensive demographic database ever developed for the nation's school system. The School District Data Book is contained on a set of 44 CD-ROMs. This large database of approximately 20 gigabytes of data (after reduction by data-compression techniques) provides up to 10,000 data items for each school district. The mapping features enable users to view maps of all individual school districts in the nation for the first time. The School District Data Book provides an effective way for the U.S. Department of Education and Congress to access, analyze, and interpret data from the 1990 Census School District Special Tabulations. Since this information can benefit state and local education agencies, as well as researchers, policy analysts, and administrators in a variety of other organizations, NCES implemented a program to meet these broader needs. The School District Data Book can be found on the web (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sdds/cl990.asp). \n\n\n\n\nPublic-use data from the NPSAS studies are available through the web and on CD-ROM.

By design, the NELS:88 sample contains an ample number of disadvantaged students to study this issue. School experiences and academic performance of language-minority studentsNELS:88 oversampled Hispanics, Asians, and Pacific Islanders to allow meaningful analyses of these subpopulations. Specifically, the data provide information on variation in achievement levels and bilingual education needs and experiences. Attracting students to the study of mathematics and scienceThe data can be used to examine the math and science preparation students receive nationwide and the degree to which their interest in these subjects is captured. Information is also available on whether they were encouraged by their teachers and school to study advanced mathematics and science. The transition from high school to college (postsecondary access and choice)NELS:88 included the planning and postsecondary education application behaviors of the high school class of 1992, as well as their subsequent enrollments in postsecondary institutions. The transition from high school and postsecondary education to the world of work and adult roles was also examined. During the fourth follow-up, NELS:88 respondents provided information on their current activities, including work and postsecondary education experiences.\nAre U.S. ninth-grade students more proficient in civic content or civic-related skills needed in daily life? Are there significant differences across race, gender, and socioeconomic background in the civic achievement of U.S. ninth-grade students? What is the school and classroom context for the civic achievement of U.S. ninthgrade students?\nThe Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). PISA is designed to monitor, on a regular 3-year cycle, the achievement of 15-year-old students in three subject areas: reading literacy, mathematical literacy, and scientific literacy. PISA assesses some of the knowledge and skills that enable students to participate fully in society and the economy, and to become lifelong learners. While some elements covered by PISA are likely to be part of the school curriculum, PISA goes beyond mastery of a defined body of school-based knowledge to include the knowledge and experiences gained outside of school. In each assessment cycle (assessment cycles began in 2000), PISA focuses on one of three subject areas, devoting approximately two-thirds of testing time to an in-depth assessment of the major domain and the remaining one-third of testing time to the other two minor domains. The subject areas of PISA are: reading literacyRequires students to perform a range of tasks with different kinds of texts. The tasks range from retrieving specific information to demonstrating a broad understanding, interpreting text, and reflecting on its content and features. Reading literacy was the major domain of focus in 2000. mathematical literacyEntails the use of mathematical competencies at several levels, ranging from performance of standard mathematical operations to mathematical thinking and reflection. Mathematical literacy is the major domain of focus in 2003. scientific literacyInvolves the use of key scientific concepts in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world. It involves being able to recognize scientific questions, use evidence, draw scientific conclusions, and communicate these conclusions. Scientific literacy will be the major domain of focus in 2006. On its regular 3-year cycle, PISA will provide trend data in a major subject area every 9 years. As PISA develops, it is expected that additional areas of crosscurricular or general competencies will be assessed. For example, in 2003 an assessment of problem solving will be piloted. Questions that PISA helps address include the following: How do U.S. 15-year-olds perform in the subject areas covered by PISA in comparison to their international counterparts? What are the strengths and weaknesses of U.S. 15-year-olds in reading literacy, mathematical literacy, and scientific literacy? Are there significant differences across race, gender, or socioeconomic background in reading literacy, mathematical literacy, and scientific literacy as measured by PISA?\nData About Public Library Service OutletsIncludes number and types of outlets, location of public library service outlets relative to a metropolitan area, number of books-by-mail outlets, number of bookmobiles by bookmobile outlet, and square footage of outlet. Web Data Search ToolsThe Public Library Locator tool (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/libraries/liblocator) is available on the Library Statistics Program web site. This tool enables users to locate the most recently available data about a library or public library service outlet in instances where they know some but not all the identifying information about the library. For example, if one knows the city the library is in, but not its name, one will still be able to locate the library and obtain most of the available FSCS data about it, including identifying information, organizational characteristics, services, staffing, size of collection, and income and expenditures.  1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Public Libraries General Publications of NCES The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) annually produces three major publications designed for general audiences: The Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics. In addition, NCES produces the Education Statistics Quarterly, which provides an overview of NCES work four times a year. These publications present statistics on a wide array of education topics. They are used in diverse ways by policymakers, researchers, and the general public. NCES produces other publications that draw upon a variety of data sources, such as Trends in Educational Equity of Girls and Women.\n\nDigest of Education Statistics, 2002(June 2003 Mini-Digest of Education Statistics, 2002(May 2003 Status and Trends in the Education of Hispanics (April 2003) Indicators of School Crime andSafety: 2002 (November 2002) Federal Support for Education to 2002(October 2002 Hispanic-Serving Institutions: Statistical Trends From 1990(September 2002 Trends in Educational Equity of Girls and Women April 2000Recent editions of the Digest of Education Statistics can be found on the web (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/AnnualReports/reports.asp?type=digest "}, {"section_title": "Private School Survey", "text": "With increasing concern about alternatives in education, the interest and need for data on private education have also increased.

The Bureau ofJustice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice supported the first School Crime Supplement in 1989. Subsequent School Crime Supplements, supported by NCES, were conducted in 1995, and 2001. It was fielded again in 2003 and is scheduled for every 2 years thereafter. The focus of the supplement is on crimes committed against 12-to 18-year-olds in elementary and secondary schools.

SSOCS collects information on school crime and safety from school principals in U.S. elementary and secondary schools. Safety and discipline are necessary for effective education in schools. In order to learn, students need a secure environment where they can concentrate on their studies. Further, school crime affects school resources, sometimes diverting funds from academic programs or decreasing the ability of schools to attract and retain qualified teachers. Measuring the extent of school crime is important. Accurate information about the nature and frequency of the problem serves as a foundation for policymakers and practitioners in the development of effective programs and policies to prevent, reduce, and cope with violence and crime in schools. Despite the need for information about school crime, most of the data about it are limited and anecdotal in nature. Schools and policymakers have difficulty knowing which media reports reflect problems that are nationwide and which are relevant only to some schools. Schools also need to know how they compare to other schools nationwide in their policies and programs. For example, there might appear to be a trend toward certain types of school policies (e.g., metal detectors); yet there is often little information about the prevalence of such policies. SSOCS addresses this need by collecting nationally representative data and providing measures of such topics as the following: frequency and types of crimes at schools, including homicide, rape, sexual battery, attacks with or without weapons, robbery, theft, and vandalism; frequency and types of disciplinary actions, such as expulsions, transfers, and suspensions for selected offenses; perceptions of other disciplinary problems, such as bullying, verbal abuse, and disorder in the classroom; descriptions of school policies and programs concerning crime and safety; and descriptions of the pervasiveness of student and teacher involvement in efforts that are intended to prevent or reduce school violence. The survey data also support analyses of how these topics are related to each other and to various school characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Major Publication", "text": "Full-scale NHES collections have been conducted in the spring of 1991, 1996, 2001.

It will be conducted again in 2005. The 1999 Parent Survey (Parent-NHES:1999) collected information on a limited set of issues covered in earlier early childhood program participation surveys. In the 1991 Early Childhood Education Survey, parents of 3-to 8-year-olds completed interviews about their children's early childhood education, including participation in nonparental care and education programs, characteristics of programs and care arrangements, and early school experiences, including delayed kindergarten entry and retention in grade. In addition, parents were asked about activities children engaged in with parents and other family members inside and outside the home. In the 1995 and 2001 Early Childhood Program Participation Surveys, parents of children from birth through 3rd grade were asked about their children's participation in nonparental care and education programs such as relative care, nonrelative care, Head Start programs, and center-based programs. Additional sections included information on early school experiences of school-age children, home literacy activities, health and disability status, and parent and family characteristics. In the 1999 Parent Survey, parents were asked about many of the nonparental care arrangements addressed in previous years. Sample sizes for Early Childhood Program Participation Surveys were: 13,892 for ECE-NHES:1991; 14,046 for ECPP-NHES:1995; 6,939 for Parent-NHES:1999; and 6,749 for ECPP-NHES:2001.

In the School Readiness Survey, parents of 3-to 7-year-olds completed interviews about their children's developmental characteristics, their center-based program 4 5 participation, home activities with family members, and health status. For children in elementary school, parents were also asked about school adjustment, teacher feedback, and early school experiences. The 1999 Parent Survey collected information on many of the issues studied in the 1993 collection, including emerging literacy and numeracy. Sample sizes for the School Readiness Surveys were: 10,888 for SR-NHES:1993 and 6,939 for Parent-NHES: 1999. School Safety and Discipline Survey (SSD-NHES:1993)In the School Safety and Discipline Survey (SSD-NHES:1993), interviews were conducted with parents of children in grades 3-12 and with youth in grades 6-12. Parents and youth were asked about the school learning environment, discipline policy, safety at school, victimization, the availability and use of alcohol and drugs, and alcohol and drug education. Youth were also asked about peer norms for behavior in school and substance use. Sample sizes for the School Safety and Discipline Survey were: 6,504 youth interviews and 12,680 parent interviews.

In 1996, parents answered questions about their children (age 3 through 12th grade). For school-age children, questions addressed family involvement, including the involvement of nonresidential parents in four areas: children's schooling, communication with teachers or other school personnel, children's homework, and activities with children outside of school. For children not yet in kindergarten; information was collected on center-based early childhood program participation and family activities with children outside of school. In PFI-NHES:2003, involvement questions were asked of parents of children in kindergarten through 12th grade. Portions of the survey were included for children in grades K-12 in the Parent Survey of 1999 (Parent-NHES:1999).

In the NHES:1999, civic involvement items were asked in the youth interview (Youth-NHES:1999). In the 1996 Civic Involvement Surveys, samples of adults, and children in grades 6-12 and their parents were asked about sources of information on government and national issues, civic participation, and knowledge and attitudes about government. In addition, the Youth and Parent Surveys asked about opportunities that youth have to develop personal responsibilities and civic involvement. The Youth-NHES:1999 repeated the YCI-NHES:1996 with some additional questions about community service activities. Sample sizes for the Civic Involvement Surveys were: 9,389 for PFI/CI-NHES:1996; 8,044 for YCI-NHES:1996; 2,250 for ACI-NHES:1996; and 7,913 for Youth-NHES:1999. Household Public Library Use Survey (HHL-NHES:1996)In the 1996 Household and Library Use Survey (HHL-NHES:1996), about 56,000 households were screened using an expanded screening procedure that collected demographic and educational information on all household members and included a limited set of items on household use of public libraries. Information about household use of public libraries included items regarding proximity to a public library, borrowing of materials, and use of the public library for schoolwork, children's activities, recreation, coursetaking, and job seeking. The sample size for the Household and Library Use Survey was 55,708.

Similar to the 1990 Census Mapping Project, the Decennial Census School District 2000 Project will provide social, economic, and demographic characteristics of children and public school districts in the United States by using the School District Special Tabulation files from the 2000 census, the 1999-2000 CCD, and the 2000 School District Finance Survey (Form F-33). These products will be used to support research and policy analysis at the national, state, and individual school district levels. The Census 2000 School District Special Tabulation contains summary statistical data for school districts, counties, states, and the United States developed through a special tabulation of the Census 2000 basic record file. One reason that the school district special tabulation is so important is that it is the only source of data on children's demographics and their living environment. Unlike all other Census 2000 data files developed by the Census Bureau, the school district special tabulation uniquely provides universe tabulations for parents with children, households with children, children's own characteristics, children's household characteristics, and parents' characteristics (as well as the total population). Most of the subject-matter items in this school district special tabulation correspond to tables and items contained in Summary File 3. These tables are augmented with specially defined tables relating to areas of analytical interest, including number of children at risk and K-12 education. The NCES School District Demographics web site (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sdds) provides access to information about the Decennial Census School District 2000 Project. This online interactive Geographic Information System will enable users to directly access school district geographic and demographic data.

EFSC projects explore definitional, measurement, collection, reporting, and analysis issues related to education finance. The EFSC web page provides an \"umbrella\" under which NCES publications related to education finance can be found. The EFSC is currently conducting the following research activities: examining whether at-risk, minority, and limited-English-proficient kindergartners have equal access to school and staff resources; assessing public kindergarten staff compensation; assessing public school beginning teacher compensation, including whether teachers from more competitive colleges earn more; exploring conceptual issues in measuring and reporting school district geographic cost differences; and creating a researchers' longitudinal file for school district finances for the decade 1990-2000. Among the projects NCES anticipates exploring in the next year are: How economic conditions influence school district revenuesIn partnership with The Condition of Education staff, this project seeks to develop an indicator that reflects the relationship between state economic conditions and school district revenues. States have generally increased state support for education, particularly for poor school districts. Poor school districts may be the most vulnerable to reductions or smaller increases in state funding when economic conditions become less favorable. Creation of pseudo-unified school districtsAnalyses of inequality in school district funding typically only examine those school districts that are \"unified\"; that is, are K-12. Some large states, such as Texas, California, and Illinois, have mixtures of elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. This project will attempt to match elementary and secondary school districts to create \"pseudo-unified\" school districts. If such districts can be created, analyses of the effect upon inequality measures will be undertaken.

Some topical supplements may be attached to these continuing surveys so that current data on key issues can be produced. The Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) collects additional topical data for policymakers within a short timeframe. Beginning with the 1998-99 school year, the CCD began collecting an expanded set of information intended to greatly enhance the survey's usefulness as a sampling frame and provide baseline statistics on several programs of interest. States were asked to identify charter and magnet schools, schools that participate in Title I programs, and the numbers of migrant and limited-Englishproficient students receiving special services. This additional information, coupled with the CCD's previous content and unique identifiers for every public school and agency, made it possible to 60 explore ways of merging information from different surveys and to reduce the chances that the same information is requested on more than one federal survey, thus reducing response burden.

Among the most critical are questions regarding access to postsecondary education for various populations, the effects of shifting enrollment patterns, the price of postsecondary education, student financing of postsecondary education, education outcomes, the long-range financial outlook for colleges and universities, -demand for and supply of qualified faculty and staff, and job opportunities for graduates. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) program in postsecondary education provides statistical information used by planners, policymakers, and educators in addressing these issues. One major source of this information is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), an annual series of surveys conducted by NCES that provides a variety of data on the nation's 9,800 public and private postsecondary institutions. Special studies of students, financial aid, postsecondary faculty, bachelor's degree recipients, and doctoral degree recipients complement IPEDS, as do surveys of the participation of the adult population in educational activities through the National Household Education Surveys Program. In addition, postsecondary education transcript studies have been conducted in conjunction with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, the High School and Beyond Study, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (see \"National Longitudinal Studies\" in chapter 6), and the Recent College Graduates Study. Another postsecondary longitudinal survey system, Beginning Postsecondary Students, also collects institutional and student data from postsecondary students over a period of several years (see \"National Longitudinal Studies\" in chapter 6)."}, {"section_title": "Studies", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System", "text": "IPEDS, established as the core postsecondary education data collection program for NCES, is a system of surveys designed to collect data from all primary providers of postsecondary education. IPEDS is a single, comprehensive system designed to encompass all institutions and educational organizations whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education. The IPEDS system is built around a series of interrelated surveys to collect institution-level data in such areas as Th) enrollments, program completions, faculty, staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid."}, {"section_title": "67", "text": "With respect to postsecondary education provided in conjunction with hospitals, the intent of IPEDS is to include only those hospitals that contain one or more separate entities whose primary purpose is the provision of postsecondary education; schools of nursing and radiology are two examples of such entities. Hospitals offering only internships or residency programs are not included, nor are hospitals that only offer training as part of a medical school program. Training conducted as part of a medical school program is included in the reports of the postsecondary institution offering the medical program. Hospitals operating more than one school are treated as a single postsecondary entity. This is consistent with the practice for other postsecondary institutions, where NCES only requests reports for the institution as a whole, not separate reports for each program within the institution. Since the definition of postsecondary education excludes noncredit continuing education programs and education units, organizational entities that provide only these educational services are not included as institutions. Schools whose only mission is to prepare students to take a particular test, such as the CPA examination or the bar examination, are not included in IPEDS. These programs are not considered academic, vocational, or continuing professional education. Organizations that offer training at many sites (such as H&R Block) may be consolidated into a single institutional unit when deemed appropriate by NCES. High schools with vocational programs are also excluded from IPEDS because their primary purpose is not postsecondary education."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Principles", "text": "The collection of IPEDS data from this diverse universe of institutions is based upon several principles. First, data elements identify characteristics common to all providers of postsecondary education. Within these data elements, specific values define characteristics of different types of providers of postsecondary education. Second, the data elements and the component surveys in IPEDS, through which they are collected, are interrelated to avoid duplicative reporting and to enhance the analytic potential of the database. For example, enrollment data from one survey can be used in conjunction with data on degrees granted, faculty, or financial resources from the other surveys. Third, the surveys are compatible, but are adapted to meet the needs and characteristics of different sectors of postsecondary education providers. In general, postsecondary institutions granting baccalaureate and higher degrees provide more detailed data, while less data are requested from other institutions. This feature accommodates the varied operating characteristics, program offerings, and reporting capabilities of postsecondary institutions, while yielding comparable statistics for all institutions. Prior to 1993, NCES sampled the private less-than-2-year sectors. However, the Higher Education Act of 1992 mandated the completion of IPEDS surveys in a timely and accurate manner for all institutions that participate, or are applicants for participation, in any federal student financial assistance program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)(17)). Thus, beginning in the 1993 survey year, NCES began to survey in detail all postsecondary institutions that met this mandate. Institutions that were not eligible to participate in federal student financial aid programs were asked to complete only the Institutional Characteristics survey. Between and 2000, NCES continually improved the IPEDS data collection instruments and the list of institutions (universe) surveyed. There was a concerted effort to match files with the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) to ensure full coverage of all institutions having Program Participation Agreements (PPAs) with the Department. Currently, IPEDS identifies and categorizes institutions according to whether or not they have a PPA with the Department of Education and their degree-granting status. The IPEDS program was completely redesigned for the 2000-01 academic year when the data collection converted from a paper-based data collection to a fully web-based data collection system. The universe of postsecondary institutions was divided into two basic groups: those institutions with PPAs and all others. Institutions that do not have PPAs may voluntarily complete the IPEDS online surveys, but there is no requirement to do so. Institutions with a PPA are required to complete IPEDS and are subject to extensive follow-up for nonresponse. Any institution that provides data is included on the IPEDS COOL web site. In the near future, institutions that do not have PPAs (also referred to as non-Title IV institutions) will be subject to a telephone survey to collect a minimum set of data items (Minimum Data Set [MDS]). The MDS study is designed, through the use of area sampling, to provide a national estimate of the number of non-Title IV postsecondary institutions that are open to the public, an estimate of the number of students enrolled and staff employed at these institutions, and an indication of the types of educational programs that are being provided by these institutions. The study will also examine the extent to which MDS institutions are willing and/or able to provide the data requested. The new web-based system tailors the forms (screens) and data items for each institution based on a series of screening questions or institutional characteristics. Thus, public institutions automatically receive a different finance form than private not-for-profit institutions; 4-year schools that have graduate programs are prompted for graduate-level enrollment; and institutions that do not enroll full-time, first-time undergraduate-level students are not asked to complete information for either the Student Financial Aid or Graduation Rate components. All survey data are now collected using a web-based system. Institutions may submit data in two ways: manual data entry or file upload. The survey data are requested at different times during the year. The schedule for the 2003-04 academic year is as follows: The data collection period extends from March 10 through April 21, 2004. IPEDS attempts to minimize institutional response burden by coordinating data collection with state education agencies (SEAs) and other federal offices and agencies that regularly collect data from institutions. These coordinating efforts include: State agenciesIn many states, IPEDS institutional data are provided by the state higher education agency from data collected on state surveys.

Regional workshopsThrough a grant to the Association for Institutional Research (AIR), IPEDS funds a series of regional workshops to provide institutional respondents with training on the new web-based data collection. These are generally held in conjunction with state or regional association meetings or in various key cities across the nation to allow respondents to attend one close to their institution's location. IPEDS COOLIn response to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, NCES developed a web site to provide up-to-date statistics on a broad range of postsecondary institutions for easy access by consumers. The site presents data on institution prices, financial aid, enrollment, degrees and awards conferred, accreditation, and types of programs that are offered by the institution. IPEDS COOL is designed to help college students, future students, and their parents understand the differences among colleges and how much it costs to attend college. The site also provides direct links to each institution's home page, campus crime statistics, student financial aid information, and various other postsecondary education web sites.

The user may create a group of peers or have the system create it. This system also includes file download capabilities. Graduate certificate programs in institutional researchThrough a contract with AIR, IPEDS helps fund a graduate certificate program in institutional research at five major universities. AIR, in turn, provides grants to the institutions to develop interdisciplinary graduate certificate programs in institutional research. These programs teach skills that are increasingly important to the practice and advancement of institutional research and the maintenance and use of national data sets. Senior fellowshipIPEDS, through a contract with AIR, accepts proposals for an annual senior fellowship project. The fellowship is awarded on the basis of proposals submitted and is usually in support of improvements to the IPEDS process, data collection, data dissemination, or data use. A maximum of $110,000 is available to the selected fellow for salary replacement, support, and travel expenses for projects that may span up to 1 calendar year. Grants programIPEDS/NCES and the National Science Foundation (NSF), through AIR, have developed a program entitled Improving Institutional Research in Postsecondary Educational Institutions. The goals of this program are to provide professional development opportunities to doctoral students, institutional researchers, educators, and administrators, and to foster the use of federal databases for institutional research in postsecondary education. The program has the following three major components: dissertation research fellowships for doctoral students for outstanding dissertation proposals; research grants for institutional researchers and faculty; and a Summer Data Policy Institute to study the national databases of NSF and NCES. Dissertation fellowshipsFunds of up to $15,000 to support 1 year of activity are available to assist the doctoral student in the acquisition, analysis, and reporting of data from the NCES and NSF data sets. Work will be conducted at the student's home institution, and fellowship funds are expected to cover budget items such as the costs of supplying data, dissemination of project results, travel, and salary support. Proposals are solicited from doctoral students beginning their dissertation work. Research grantsFunds of up to $30,000 annually are available. Grants are usually made for 1 year. It is expected that work will be conducted at the principal investigator's home institution and that grant funds will cover budget items such as the costs of supplying data, dissemination of project results, travel, and perhaps some salary replacement. The program provides grants to principal investigators to conduct institutional research on postsecondary education using the NCES and NSF national databases; conduct other institutional research that promises a significant contribution to the national knowledge of the nature and operation of postsecondary education; conduct other institutional research activities that will make a contribution to our knowledge of postsecondary education; or conduct institutional research activities that will contribute to the professional development of professional personnel working in postsecondary education. Summer Data Policy Institute fellowshipsForty fellowships for AIR's Summer Data Policy Institute are open to institutional research practitioners, faculty, graduate students, and educators affiliated with U.S. postsecondary institutions or governance agencies. To provide an international comparative perspective, one fellowship will be awarded through each of the five international affiliated AIR groups. The National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES) is the only general-purpose survey conducted by NCES to collect education data through a household-based survey. Historically, NCES has collected data from teachers, students, and schools through school-based surveys and from administrative records through surveys of school districts and state education agencies. As a household-based survey, the NHES addresses many issues in education that had not been addressed previously by other NCES data collection activities, such as early childhood care arrangements and education, children's readiness for school, parent involvement in elementary and secondary education, and adult participation in education outside of traditional postsecondary institutions. Fullscale NHES collections have been conducted in the spring of 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, and 2003. Topical surveys on adult education and lifelong learning were collected in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003. In addition, a survey about the civic involvement of adults, the Adult Civic Involvement survey, was conducted in 1996. Surveys covering topics related to children from birth through 12th grade have also been conducted. See chapter 3, \"Elementary and Secondary Education,\" for more details on these surveys. The NHES will be conducted again in the spring of 2005 and 2007, and periodically thereafter.

The Adult Education surveys ask persons 16 years of age and older about their participation in basic skills courses, English as a Second Language (ESL) courses, credential (degree or diploma) programs, apprenticeships, work-related courses, and personal development/interest courses. AELL-NHES:2001 also asked about less formal learning at work. The Adult Education for Work-Related Reasons Survey (AEWR-NHES:2003) asked adults about participation in credential (degree or diploma) programs, apprenticeships, and formal courses and informal activities for workrelated reasons. Adults participating in programs or courses provided information about those programs or courses, including subject matter, duration, cost, location and sponsorship, and employer support. In 1991, nonparticipants in selected types of adult education were asked about their interest in educational activities and their perceived barriers to participation in adult education. Extensive background, employment, and household information was collected for each adult. Sample sizes for the Adult Education surveys were: 14,892 for AE-NHES:1991; 19,722 for AE-NHES:1995; 6,697 for AE-NHES:1999; 10,873 for AELL-NHES:2001; and 12,725 for AEWR-NHES:2003.

In the NHES:1999, civic involvement items were asked in the Youth interview (Youth-NHES:1999). In the 1996 Civic Involvement surveys, samples of adults, and children in grades 6-12 and their parents were asked about sources of information on government and national issues, civic participation, and knowledge and attitudes about government. In addition, the Youth and Parent surveys asked about opportunities that youth have to develop personal responsibilities and civic involvement.

Undergraduate, graduate, and firstprofessional students who receive financial aid, as well as those who do not receive aid, participate in the NPSAS. The NPSAS collects information on student demographics, family income, education expenses, employment, education aspirations, parental demographic characteristics, parental support, and how students and their families meet the costs of postsecondary education. In addition to describing '1 6 characteristics of students enrolled in postsecondary education, the results are used in part to help determine future federal policy regarding student financial aid. The first NPSAS was conducted during the 1986-87 school year. Data were gathered from institutional records on about 60,000 students at 1,100 colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions. About 43,000 of these students and 13,000 parents also completed questionnaires. During 1989-90, information from institutional records on about 69,000 students at 1,130 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 51,400 students and 16,000 parents also completed computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATIs). During 1992-93, information from institutional records on about 77,000 students at 1,000 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 52,000 students and 12,500 parents were interviewed by telephone. The 1995-96 NPSAS had a smaller sample due to budget constraints. Institutional administrative records data were collected on about 60,000 students at 830 institutions. About 31,000 students were interviewed by telephone. In 1999 2000, institutional records data were collected on about 62,000 students (50,000 undergraduates and 12,000 graduate/first-professional students) at 1,000 institutions. About 44,500 students were interviewed by telephone. In 2004, NCES will combine the NPSAS and the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) into the National Study of Faculty and Students (NSoFaS). About 80,000 students and 24,000 faculty and instructional staff are expected to participate. Results should be available in late spring/early summer 2005. The data collected provide information on the price of postsecondary education, the distribution of financial aid, and the characteristics of both aided and nonaided students and their families. Following each survey, NCES publishes three major reports: Undergraduate Financing of Postsecondary Education, Student Financing of Graduate and First-Professional Education, and Profile of Undergraduates in American Postsecondary Institutions."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "NPSAS data come from multiple sources, including institutional records and student and parent interviews. Detailed data concerning participation in student financial aid programs are extracted from the U.S. Department of Education's financial aid application system, the National Student Loan Data System, and institutional records. In 1986-87, family circumstances, demographic data, and plans and aspirations were collected using student and parent questionnaires. Beginning with the 1989-90 NPSAS, student and parent data were collected using CATIs. Parent data were last collected with the 1992-93 NPSAS. The 1986-87 NPSAS sampled students enrolled in the fall of 1986. Beginning with the 1989-90 NPSAS, students enrolled at any time during the year were eligible for the study. This design change provided the data necessary to estimate full-year financial aid awards. Beginning with the 1989-90 survey, the NPSAS included two longitudinal studies called the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). For BPS, there were two cohorts of beginning students. These cohorts served to examine issues such as persistence and effects of financial aid on subsequent enrollment. One cohort included students who began their postsecondary education during 1989-90, were interviewed in 1992 (BPS:90/92), and were interviewed again in 1994 (BPS:90/94). Another cohort included students who began in 1995-96, and were interviewed in 1998 (BPS:96/98) and 2001 (BPS:96/01). For B&B, there were two cohorts of students who completed their undergraduate degrees. These cohorts served to examine issues such as the transition from college to work and access to graduate school. One cohort included students who graduated with a baccalaureate degree during 1992-93, were surveyed in 1994 (B&B:93/94), and were surveyed again in 1997 (B&B:93/97). These students will be surveyed again in 2003 as part of the BB:93/03 study. Another cohort included students who graduated with a baccalaureate degree in 1999-2000, and were surveyed again in 2001 (B&B:2000/01). Both BPS and B&B studies are described more thoroughly in chapter 6, \"National Longitudinal Studies.\" The NPSAS covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, the NPSAS analyzes the participation of students in financial aid programs. The goal is to identify institutional, student, family, and other characteristics related to program participation. Special population enrollment in postsecondary education is also analyzed. These populations include students with disabilities, racial/ethnic minorities, students taking remedial-developmental courses, students from families with low incomes, and older students. Another aspect of the NPSAS is the study of the distribution of students by major field of study. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, and engineering, as well as teacher preparation and health studies.

An institution's faculty often determine curriculum content, student performance standards, and the quality of students' preparation for careers. Through their research, development, and public service activities, faculty members make valuable contributions to society. For these reasons, it is essential to understand who they are; what they do; and whether, how, and why they are changing. The NSOPF was designed to provide data about faculty to postsecondary education researchers, planners, and policymakers. The NSOPF is currently the most comprehensive study of faculty in postsecondary education institutions. The NSOPF contains data that can be applied to policy and research issues related to postsecondary faculty. For example, the NSOPF can be used to analyze whether the size and composition of the postsecondary labor force is changing. NSOPF data can also be used to analyze faculty job satisfaction and how it correlates with an area of specialization, how background and specialization skills relate to present assignments, and the relationship between academic rank and outside employment.

The purpose of the Network is to represent states' mutual interest in postsecondary data selection, collection, analysis, and utilization, and to provide feedback to NCES about its plans for data collection and related activities through a single formal organization or network composed of representatives from all the states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Toward this effort, the Network facilitates cooperation and coordination between NCES and the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) and other state postsecondary entities regarding national postsecondary survey-related activities. The Network provides a vehicle through which NCES can disseminate information directly and quickly to the highest-level postsecondary education officials in the states, thereby facilitating the exchange of ideas and information on matters of mutual concern involving postsecondary education data collection and related activities. The Network also serves as an organization through which states and postsecondary institutions can exchange technological expertise and current information, and provide technical assistance regarding state-of the-art technologies for their own data collection and data exchange activities, as well as NCES data collection and data exchange efforts. Additionally, because of its relationship with the states, the Network is in a unique position to 1) work with NCES in the development, dissemination, and testing of standard data definitions in published and electronic formats; and 2) advise in the development and design of new surveys and data collection methodologies. The Network is also able to provide support for a partnership between states, postsecondary institutions, and the federal government in the implementation of the mission and activities of NCES. Project activities include meetings with the Network Steering Committee and an annual national meeting and IPEDS workshop with SHEEO Network representatives. The Network issues a quarterly technical report containing information about NCES and state activities, with a focus on selected issues of significance to the postsecondary community. It also provides an advisory service summarizing developing postsecondary education issues and related data needs. Additionally, the Network maintains a library service providing information about state and federal postsecondary education data collections.

Regional workshopsIPEDS staff conduct regional workshops on an as-needed basis. These are generally held when new surveys (such as the Graduation Rate Survey) are implemented or when significant changes are made to the survey forms that warrant training of institutional respondents. Workshops are held in various key cities across the nation to allow respondents to attend one close to their institution's location. Attendees are provided with materials such as new survey forms, Guidelines for Survey Respondents, and frequently asked questions and answers to help them understand the changes and the new requirements.

During their stay, Fellows take part in a series of planned activities, including presentations by NCES staff on NCES major data collections, reports, and dissemination practices; projects to automate state and local data systems; and efforts to integrate existing data collections. In addition, Fellows explore their own professional interests and objectives. During the week, mentors selected from NCES staff work with Fellows and lead discussions on various topics, answer questions, and offer guidance and advice.

This activity is an important part of NCES efforts to improve the quality and comparability of education data. Handbooks have been an integral part of the NCES postsecondary program since the late 1960s. In 1966, NCES established a common language that higher education institutions could use to record and report on major fields of study. This languagecodes from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS)evolved into the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) that encompasses not only the academic programs included in the HEGIS program codes, but vocational and occupational program codes as well. The CIP was implemented in 1986 with the beginning of IPEDS and revised in 1990. It forms the basis for the IPEDS \"Completions\" report. A revision of the 1990 CIP, CIP: 2000, has been available since May 2002. In 1973, NCES published the Higher Education Facilities Inventory and Classification Manual. This manual, initially developed by a group of facilities experts, evolved through several versions and was issued and used with the approval of professional groups, state agencies, and institutional associations. Last published in 1974, the manual was widely used and adapted. In recognition of the fact that planning for and use of facilities had changed significantly and many states and institutions were beginning to devise their own classification structures, SHEEO assembled a Working Group on College and University Facilities in 1989. The work of these groups resulted in the 1992 Postsecondary Education Facilities Inventory and Classification Manual (FICM). The 1992 FICM provides a common framework and coding structure for use in collecting and reporting inventory data on postsecondary institution buildings and on the space within those structures, primarily rooms. The manual also suggests to institutions a pattern for compiling essential data on their physical facilities, and provides a set of common building definitions and room codes so that reported data are reasonably consistent and comparable across institutions and states. Plans to update the 1992 manual are underway. NCES has published the first handbook on faculty and staff in postsecondary institutions. The 1998 Handbook on Human Resources: Recordkeeping and Analysis provides postsecondary institutions with coding structures, data element definitions, analytic conventions, and recommendations for developing and maintaining a central data file on the institution's faculty and staff that will be useful for resource and policy analysis and planning at the institutional level. This handbook, as with all other NCES handbooks and manuals, was developed in conjunction with a technical panel of experts in the field of faculty and human resource issues and problems. One objective in developing this handbook was to provide institutions with the necessary tools to report high-quality data to the IPEDS Staff and Salary surveys, and to facilitate their participation in the NSOPF. An update of the 1998 manual is currently underway. The development of the Postsecondary Student Handbook is a cooperative effort among NCES, SHEEO, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The primary objective of this handbook is to promote commonality and consistency in the data elements and definitions that are used to define, track, measure, and report postsecondary student data. The handbook identifies a comprehensive and uniform set of data elements, definitions, and coding descriptors to use in postsecondary student record-keeping systems. The handbook also provides recommendations for standardizing the methods and practices by which data on students are collected, reported, and exchanged; suggests a framework for developing or upgrading student tracking systems; and identifies and promotes sound practices for institutional reporting to state and federal agencies.

Changes in collection procedures, data elements, timing, and processing were phased in through the 2001-02 academic year. Part of the redesign focused on separate data collections for Title IV and non-Title IV institutions. The approximately 6,900 Title IV institutions are required to respond to the full set of IPEDS surveys according to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. However, the non-Title IV institutions have no similar requirement. NCES has already identified 2,700 non-Title IV institutions and is planning an 18-month study to estimate the number of these institutions and the characteristics of the students they serve. This will be done through an area search, followed by a telephone survey of the institutions identified through the area search. This study is called the IPEDS MDS (minimum data set) since institutions will be asked to provide a minimum number of data items. IPEDS will continue to provide a sampling frame for other postsecondary surveys, such as the ongoing NPSAS and NSOPF. PEQIS will be used to collect data for addressing emerging and focused issues that the ongoing data collection systems are unable to provide. PEQIS surveys being planned or implemented include Distance Education, Students with Disabilities in Postsecondary Education, Faculty Workload, and Noncredit Course Offerings. Some postsecondary institutions use an automated data system for a nationwide electronic records transfer system. The Standardization of Postsecondary Education Electronic Data Exchange developed a set of data elements and definitions in American National Standards Institute format to be used in the pilot electronic transfer of student records among postsecondary institutions. Data elements are included in five different areas: demographics, academic history, special programs and services, health, and test information. NCES is examining other applications for the electronic exchange of data among postsecondary institutions. The NHES has become a source of many key indicators of the educational status of children and adults. The 2001 NHES included the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Survey. This survey was largely a repeat of the Adult Education surveys done in detail in 1991 and 1995, and in brief in 1999. The 2003 NHES included a survey with more focus on work-related adult education. The last cycle of the NSOPF occurred in the 1998-99 academic year. NSOPF:99 was limited to surveys of institutions, faculty, and instructional staff. It allowed for comparisons to be made over time and expanded existing topics surrounding faculty and instructional staff that have developed as critical issues since the first two studies. Expansion topics included the increasing use of part-time instructional faculty and staff at higher education institutions and their credentials for teaching; the decline of full-time tenure-track appointments as institutions explore possible alternatives to tenure; faculty's allocation of time to teaching versus research; measures of faculty workload and productivity; the presence of women and minority faculty in higher education institutions; and the effects, if any, of the removal of mandatory retirement for faculty and instructional staff. NSOPF:99 was also collected over the web for the first time. The fourth cycle of NSOPF will be conducted in 2003-04 and will make even greater use of web technology. Meeting the challenges of maintaining current data and possibly establishing new data collection activities takes a cooperative effort among institutions, states, and NCES. As part of this effort, the NCES/State Postsecondary Education Coordination Network and NPEC will continue to facilitate coordination and the exchange of data, technology, and information between the states, postsecondary institutions, and NCES. Further, NPEC will continue to strive to identify new trends in postsecondary education and emerging issues that have implications for data collection, reporting, and dissemination in order to facilitate the production of better data for better decisions. Continuing activities will focus on NPEC's strategic areas: student success in postsecondary education and data infrastructure.  1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Integrated   1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 National  The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects and reports information on the academic performance of the nation's students and assesses the literacy level of the adult population. NCES also participates in international assessments (see chapter 7, \"International Statistics\"). The congressionally mandated National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the primary NCES assessment of what American elementary and secondary students know and can do in academic subjects. For more than 3 decades, NAEP has collected and reported information on the knowledge and skills of national and, since 1990, state samples of grade-representative populations in a variety of school subjects. In 2002, NAEP also began a multiyear study of the feasibility of assessing additional samples that would allow the reporting of student achievement in major urban school districts. Besides assessing student achievement, the educational assessment program at NCES also assesses the proficiency of adults in performing basic literacy and mathematical tasks through the National Assessment of Adult Literacy Survey. In 1992, NCES conducted the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS)a household-based literacy survey of adults age 16 and over. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) survey builds upon the 1992 NALS and will provide an accurate benchmark for measuring the literacy capabilities of adults. Both surveys include the general adult population as well as adults in institutional settings such as prisons. NCES also collects data from students' high school transcripts. These data include courses students have taken as well as the grades they attained. These studies are generally conducted in conjunction with NAEP and other major survey studies to facilitate the incorporation of achievement data. High school transcript data have been used for a variety of assessment purposes. Most notably, such data serve as a barometer for changes in high school student course-taking patterns. These data, in combination with school course offerings, provide valuable information about the rigor of high school curriculums across the nation. The 2000 High School Transcript Study examined the trends and changes in high school curriculum and student course-taking patterns over the past decade (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000). Together with performance results in subject areas, the basic descriptive information about students, teachers, administrators, and communities collected systematically by NAEP from its surveys has been used to address the following four educational policy issues that are of concern to educators, policymakers, and researchers: Instructional practices: What instructional methods are being used? Students at risk: How many students appear to be at risk, in terms of achievement, and what are their characteristics? Distribution of teacher qualities among different student populations: What are the characteristics of teachers of various subjects that students are exposed to? Education reform: What, if any, policy changes are being made by our nation's schools?"}, {"section_title": "Studies National Assessment of Educational Progress", "text": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is mandated by Congress (Elementary and Secondary Education Act [ESEA], Section 411, as amended by NCLB) to continuously monitor the knowledge, skills, and performance of the nation's children and youth.

A number of significant changes currently underway include the following: Beginning in 1996, NAEP returned to annual assessments. Beginning in 2000, NAEP began expanded state assessments to include both grades 4 and 8 in two subjects. Beginning in 2003, reading and mathematics will be assessed every 2 years, and science and writing every 4 years. States and local school districts receiving Title 1 funds are now required by the No Child Left Behind Act to participate in the biennial reading and mathematics assessments. In 2004, the long-term trends assessment will be updated while continuing to monitor trends from the past. New comprehensive assessments will be administered in foreign languages (2005) and economics (2006). These major changes are documented in a new calendar that identifies subjects to be tested from 2000 to 2012, available from the National Assessment Governing Board (http://www.nagb.org).

In this way, intervening processes can be studied. The program is comprised of three study areas: early childhood/elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. Together, these studies capture critical information across the lifespan of individuals' development and education. The early childhood longitudinal studies examine children's early home, child-care, and education experiences prior to formal schoolingthat is, birth through age fiveas well as during the early elementary years. These studies describe the influence of early experiences on children's success in school. The secondary and postsecondary longitudinal studies look at transitions and education experiences and their influence on educational and occupational attainment. These surveys provide for periodic examination of such attainment, as well as students' aspirations, attitudes, and motivations during the pivotal years before, during, and after middle school or junior high school, high school, and college. With extensive questioning over succeeding years, the longitudinal studies make it possible to make long-range comparisons between early learning environments and children's preparation for school, between early school experiences and later school success, and between what individuals expect and what actually occurs. Consequently, such studies are critical to understanding the processes by which early experiences influence education and, in turn, the processes by which education leads individuals to develop their abilities and roles in society. The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72) began with that year's high school senior class and followed them through 1986. The High School and Beyond (HS&B) Longitudinal Study began with both the sophomore and senior classes of 1980. Four other longitudinal studies have also been conducted: the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which began with the 8th-grade class of 1988 and followed them through 2000; the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Studies of 1990 and 1996, the most recent of which started with postsecondary students who began their postsecondary education in 1995-96 and were followed in 1998 and 2001, and the earlier cohort that began in 1989-90 with follow-ups in 1992 and 1994; the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Longitudinal Study that began with college seniors in 1992-93 who were followed in 1997 and will again be contacted in 2003, with a second cohort that graduated from college in 1999-2000 with a one-time follow-up in 2001; and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), which began following a cohort of kindergarten children in 1998-99 and completed five waves of data collection through 2002.

Together, these studies provide the range and breadth of data required to more fully describe children's early learning and education experiences. The birth cohort study (ECLS-B) is designed to study children's early learning and development from birth through first grade. It focuses on those characteristics of children, their families, and out-of-home experiences that influence children's first experiences with the demands of formal school (e.g., kindergarten and first grade), and provides important information about the way America raises, nurtures, cares for, and prepares its children for school. The kindergarten cohort (ECLS-K) measures aspects of children's development and their home, classroom, and school environments as they enter school for the first time, and examines how factors from these environments influence their academic achievement, social development, and school experiences through fifth grade."}, {"section_title": "Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort", "text": "Parents, educators, health practitioners, and policymakers are seeking effective ways for caring for and educating children throughout early childhood. Researchers and practitioners searching for answers are turning to the critical years before formal schooling as a source of information and a place to start. Several factors have contributed to this research and policy focus on children's early care and education experiences before entering school, including: new research, such as that on early brain development, highlighting the significant growth and development occurring in the first 3 years; public awareness of the importance of children's early experiences for later school success; large numbers of working mothers and dual-employed families, resulting in children entering childcare at earlier ages; and the increasingly diverse population of children entering school. Vital to any effort to improve the health, early care, and education for all of the nation's children is a research and data collection program that increases primary understanding of the dynamics that lead to differential school success. NCES, in collaboration with several health, education, and human services agencies, has embarked upon an ambitious new study on the early years before formal schooling. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) follows a national sample of children, born in the year 2001, from birth through first grade. The four key areas addressed by the ECLS-B are children's health status at birth and various points thereafter; children's growth and development in critical cognitive and noncognitive domains; children's transitions to child-care and early childhood education programs, kindergarten, and beyond; and children's preparation for school. First, the relationship of children's early health to their later growth and development is of special interest to the ECLS-B. The study provides information on prenatal care and children's health status at birth and across the early childhood years, covering basic topics such as health insurance, nutrition, doctor visits, hospitalizations, and chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma, ear infections). Over time, the study will be able to analyze the potential connections between young children's health and their growth and development. Second, the ECLS-B follows children's growth and development during the critical years before school. In these early years, children are quickly achieving developmental milestones that build upon one another. The ECLS-B seeks to accurately describe children's physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and language development in relation to important influences in their lives prior to school entry. It then follows their progress during the first 2 years of schoolkindergarten and first grade. Third, children and adults are continually making transitions from one status to anotherfor example, from home to childcare and to school. Most notably is the transition that occurs as young children go from being cared for exclusively by their parents to being cared for by other persons. For some children, this transition may occur shortly after birth; for others, their first significant experience with adults other than their parents in a regular care and educational setting may be when they enter school for the first time. The ECLS-B is especially focused on looking at these transitions and their impact on different groups of children and families defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, birthweight, language minority status, plurality (i.e., twins), and family structure (i.e., single-parent families and teenage mothers). Fourth, most children attend kindergarten before entering first grade. However, the nature of children's early experiences in and before kindergarten is quite variable, and the demands placed on children differ across programs. The ECLS-B examines children's preparation for school by prospectively studying the different characteristics of children, their families, and their out-of-home care and educational experiences leading up to and at school entry."}, {"section_title": "i l l", "text": "Parent-Guardian InterviewsParents and guardians are an important source of information about themselves, their children, and the home environment. A parent-guardian interview is conducted in the child's home at each data collection point using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and a self-administered questionnaire. Parent-guardian interviews capture information about children's early health and development and their experiences with family members and others. Parents report on children's development in such areas as children's temperament and developmental milestones (e.g., crawling). Parent-guardian interviews also capture detailed information on children's health (e.g., developmental difficulties, illness, ear infections) and access to health care (e.g., health insurance). Parents-guardians provide key information about themselves as caregivers, the home environment, and the neighborhood in which they live. Several aspects of the economic stability of the home environment are tracked (e.g., welfare receipt, household food sufficiency, employment situation). The parent-guardian interviewed is the individual who is the primary caregiver and the most knowledgeable about the care and education of the child. In most cases, this is the child's mother or female guardian. Father QuestionnairesThe ECLS-B collects information from fathers as well. Fathers complete a self-administered questionnaire regarding the particular role they play in the development of their children. The father questionnaire captures information about children's well-being and activities fathers engage in with their children. Fathers also provide key information about themselves as caregivers. Both resident fathers and nonresident biological fathers complete self-administered questionnaires designed to collect information about their roles in their children's lives. Direct Child AssessmentsChildren's participation in the study occurs with the full permission of their parents-guardians. Beginning at 9 months, children participate in activities designed to directly measure important developmental skills in the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical domains. The ECLS-B uses the Bayley Short FormResearch Edition. This instrument, designed specifically for the ECLS-B, is based on a smaller set of items from the Bayley Scales for Infant Development (BSID-II). It assesses children's gross and fine motor skills as well as their receptive and expressive language skills and emotion regulation. The Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) from the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST) assesses the parent-child interaction for early precursors of cognitive and social skills. These interactions are videotaped and coded along several dimensions (e.g., mother responsiveness, cognitive growth fostering), providing rich information on early parent-child interactions. At the 9-month home visit and again at age 2, height, weight, and middle upper arm circumference are measured for all children. In addition, head circumference is measured for very low birthweight infants. Early Care and Education ProvidersWith the permission of the child's parents, individuals and organizations that provide regular care and/or education for a child are interviewed. Care providers and preschool teachers, like parents, represent a significant source of information on themselves (their backgrounds, teaching practices, and experiences), the children in their care, and the children's learning environments. Much of the data needed to describe the structure of children's care arrangements and education programs, develop indicators of the quality of these arrangements and programs, and profile the background and experience of the persons caring for these children can only be reported accurately by the providers, teachers, and organizations themselves. Contacting children's care and education providers also opens up other data collection opportunities (e.g., collecting information about children's development from sources other than their parents). Children's child-care providers are interviewed using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). This information is collected when the children are 24 months of age and again at 48 months. Observations of children s child-care settings are conducted in a sample of the arrangements attended by ECLS-B children. Teacher QuestionnairesAs the ECLS-B cohort enters kindergarten and first grade, their school teachers become valuable sources of information on one of children's most immediate learning environmentsthe classroom. Teachers also represent important sources of information about themselves (e.g., their backgrounds, teaching practices, and experiences) and children's development, both cognitive and social. The plan is to use a subset of the ECLS-K teacher questionnaires (see http://nces.ed.gov/ecls). School QuestionnairesOnce the children enter formal schooling, school administrators provide information on the physical, fiscal, and organizational characteristics of their schools and on the schools' learning environments, educational philosophies, and programs. Again, the plan is to use a subset of the ECLS-K school questionnaires (see http://nces.ed.gov/ecls). Information about the ECLS-B can be found on the web (http://nces.ed.gov/ecls). For further information on the ECLS-B, contact: Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 In recent years, parents, educators, and policymakers have been reconsidering the ways young children are taught in schools and have been looking for more effective approaches to education. Several factors that have contributed to this research and policy focus on children's early school experiences include: an increased public awareness of the importance of children's early experiences; the changing nature of children's preschool and early school experiences; the increasingly diverse population of children entering school and the demands this places on schools; and the expanded role that schools are expected to play in supporting and nurturing development and learning. NCES has embarked on an ambitious study to provide a comprehensive and reliable data set that can be used to inform policies related to early and middle childhood education, defined as kindergarten through fifth grade. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), in which a cohort of kindergarten children is sampled and studied intensively over time, responds directly to the concerns decisionmakers, educational practitioners, researchers, and parents have about our nation's schools and American education. The three key issues to be addressed by the ECLS-K are children's transition to school, student performance in the early grades in literacy and numeracy, and the interaction of school, family, and community. First, the ECLS-K examines children's transition to school. Of particular interest to the study are the transitions that occur as young children go from being kindergartners to being first graders and as they move from first grade to the later elementary grades. These transitions are an ongoing process mutually influenced by a child's characteristics, the family and school environments, and the demands, resources, and responses within both family and school settings. Therefore, these transitions may be quite different for children depending upon the characteristics of the setting and their experience in each one. Second, a major goal of the ECLS-K is to describe student learning and academic progress during the early school years. It begins by focusing on children's characteristics and experiences as they enter school, and seeks to describe ways in which these are related to different aspects of children, their families, and the kindergarten programs they attend. Then by closely chronicling the relationship between children's kindergarten experience and their school performance in grades 1 through 5, the study provides useful information on achievement differences between boys and girls, among minority groups, and among members of different socioeconomic groups as children pass through school. The study also provides useful data on when children begin to experience problems with their schoolwork and the circumstances surrounding these difficulties. It provides data on the longevity of these problems and on the responses of the children's families, schools, and teachers. Third, numerous factors influence children's school and other life outcomes, including the school, family, and community. The ECLS-K examines how the educational system prepares for and responds to children. It gathers information on how schools and teachers respond to the diverse backgrounds and experiences that children bring with them as they enter school for the first time. The ECLS-K also looks outward to the family and community in which children live by focusing on the resources of the family, the home environment, and the community that have a profound impact on children's success in school and provide the context within which schools must operate. The ECLS-K provides critical information on the roles that parents and families play in preparing for and supporting their children's education, and how families, schools, and communities interact to support children's education."}, {"section_title": "114", "text": "A nationally representative sample of approximately 22,000 children enrolled in about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year was selected for participation in the ECLS-K.

Some cling to dependency; others move into self-determination smoothly. The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS:72) base-year study and its five follow-up surveys provide data to allow researchers to study how these transitions evolve. NLS:72 can provide information about quality, equity, and diversity of educational opportunity, and the effect of those factors on cognitive growth, individual development, and educational outcomes. It can also provide information about changes in educational and career outcomes and other transitions over time. The NLS:72 data cover the sampled cohort from 1972 to 1986. Design NLS:72 was designed to produce representative data at the national level on the cohort of students who were in the 12th grade in 1972. The sample for the base year of NLS:72 was a stratified, two-stage probability sample of 12th-grade students from all schools (public and private) in the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the 1971-72 school year. A sample of schools was selected in the first stage. In the second stage, a random sample of 18 high school seniors was selected within each participating school. Data were collected by mail, telephone, and personal interviews. In addition, the survey obtained high school transcript data on high school curriculum, credit hours in major courses, grade point average, standardized test scores, and related information for each senior. To conduct intensive studies of disadvantaged students, NCES oversampled schools in low-income areas and schools with significant minority enrollments. The size of the student sample was increased during the first follow-up survey because base-year nonrespondents were recontacted at that time. Those who provided base-year information during the first follow-up were retained and included in later follow-up efforts. Consequently, in 1972 there were 16,683 respondents, but in the first follow-up in 1973, the number increased to 21,350.

For example, declining test scores and minimum competency testing caused concern among parents and educators alike. The rate at which many students dropped out of high school before graduation was also a concern. Anxiety over access to postsecondary and vocational education sharpened the focus on the educational experiences of Hispanic and other minority youths. To examine these and other issues, NCES initiated a second longitudinal study, High School and Beyond (HS&B), to complement the first. HS&B studied the high school students of 1980, attempting to collect the same types of data gathered in NLS:72. However, the second study differed from the first in two significant ways. First, it addressed many newer issues of the educational process. Second, it included a sophomore cohort as well as a senior cohort. Adding the sophomore cohort made it possible to study high school dropouts and analyze changes and processes during high school. The base-year survey of HS&B and the follow-up surveys have addressed the issues of educational attainment, employment, family formation, personal values, and community activities since 1980. For example, a major study on high school dropouts used HS&B data to demonstrate that a large number of dropouts return to school and earn a high school diploma or an equivalency certificate. Other examples of issues and questions that can be addressed with HS&B data are: How, when, and why do students enroll in postsecondary education institutions? Did those who (while in high school) expected to complete the baccalaureate (BA) degree actually do so? How has the percentage of recent graduates from a given cohort who enter the workforce in their field changed over the past years? What are the medium-term effects of not completing high school in the traditional way? How do employment and earnings event histories of traditional high school graduates differ from those who did not finish high school in the traditional manner?

All four studies describe the transition of American youth from secondary schooling to subsequent education and work roles. The three studies that preceded ELS:2002 included NLS:72, HS&B:80/82, and NELS:88. ELS:2002 is designed to monitor the transition of a national sample of young people as they progress from 10th grade through high school and onto postsecondary education and/or the work world. In the first year of data collection (2002 base year), ELS:2002 measured students' tested achievement and obtained information from students about their school and out-of-school experiences. These same students will be surveyed again in a 2004 follow-up. Under current plans, cohort members will be followed through 2014 so that later outcomes, including access to and persistence in higher education or success in the labor market, can be examined in terms of students' earlier aspirations, achievement, and high school experiences. ELS:2002 gathers information at multiple levels. It obtains information from students and their school records, students' parents, their teachers, and the administrators (principals and library-media center directors) of their schools. Data from teachers will provide direct information not only about the student, but also about the specific mathematics and English classes in which the teachers and student interact. Additionally, teacher reports will provide information about the school as seen from the teacher's perspective. This multilevel focus will supply researchers with a comprehensive picture of the home, community, and school environments and their influences on students. Using this multilevel and longitudinal information, the base year (2002) and first follow-up (2004) of ELS:2002 will help researchers and policymakers at all governmental levels, and inform decisionmakers, educational practitioners, and parents about the changes in the educational system over time and the effects that these changes may have on students. The policy issues to be studied include school attributes associated with achievement; the influence of parent and community involvement on students' achievement and development; the dynamics and determinants of dropping out of the educational system; the transition of different groups; cognitive outcomes and the influence of different curriculum paths and special programs; and the effectiveness of different high schools, and whether their effectiveness varies with school size, organization, climate, curriculum, academic press, and other characteristics. These data will facilitate understanding of the impact of various instructional methods and curriculum content in bringing about educational growth and achievement. After the high school years, ELS:2002 will continue to follow its sample of students into postsecondary education or the labor market. For students who continue on to higher education, ELS:2002 will measure the effects of their high school careers on subsequent access to postsecondary institutions, their choices of institutions and programs, postsecondary persistence, attainment, and eventual entry into the labor force and adult roles. For students who go directly into the workforce either as dropouts or high school graduates, ELS:2002 will be able to help determine how well high schools have prepared these students for the labor market and how they fare within it. Basic elements that are encompassed in the ELS:2002 survey instruments can be classified into three broad categories: background information (normally collected in the base year only), process information (about dynamic influences on students, in the home, school, and community environments, as they move through secondary school and beyond into the world of postsecondary education and the adult workforce), and outcome information (the eventual outcomes of the transition process). Below are examples of the content of the ELS:2002 survey instruments: Social background variables, including sex, race, family income, family structure and composition, parent education and employment, languages spoken, parental aspirations for child, health history, and prior school experience. Home educational support system process variables, including involvement in education, cognitive stimulation, discipline, and monitoring.

Because older students, in addition to recent high school graduates, are increasingly included in postsecondary education, high school cohort studies are not representative of all postsecondary participants at a given point in time. BPS includes these \"nontraditional\" as well as \"traditional\" students and thus is more representative of all beginning students in postsecondary education. The BPS survey includes information regarding persistence, progress, and attainment from initial time of entry into postsecondary education through leaving and entering the workforce. By following a postsecondary education cohort (rather than a single-age elementary or secondary school cohort), BPS describes to what extent, if any, students who start postsecondary education later differ in their progress, persistence, and attainment. Because students who delay entry into postsecondary education have different experiences prior to entry than students who enter immediately after high school, their transitions between levels of education and work may also be different. In addition to issues related to persistence, progress, and attainment, BPS also directly addresses issues concerning entry into the workforce. Its unique contribution is the inclusion of nontraditional (or older) students. This provides the ability to analyze the differences between traditional (recent high school graduates) and nontraditional students in aspirations, progress, persistence, and attainment. With two cohorts of beginning students, differences and changes over time can begin to be tracked. Among the questions BPS addresses are: Do students who are part time or discontinuous attendees have the same educational goals as full-time, consistent attendees? Are they as likely to attain similar educational goals? Are students who change majors more or less likely to persist? The publication, Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students: 5 Years Later, presented rates of persistence and degree attainment. In addition, Nontraditional Undergraduates presented differences in persistence found for traditional and nontraditional students. The report, Descriptive Summary of 1995-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students: Six Years Later, described the attendance patterns and completion rates of the second BPS cohort.

It provides both cross-sectional information 1 year after bachelor's degree completion (comparable to the Recent College Graduate (RCG) Survey) and longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduate-level education and the workforce. A special emphasis of B&B is on those entering teaching. B&B provides information on entry into, persistence and progress through, and completion of graduate-level education. This information has not been available through follow-ups involving high school cohorts or even college-entry cohorts, both of which are restricted in the number who actually complete the bachelor's degree and continue their education. B&B:93/97 provided a unique 122 132 opportunity to gather information concerning delayed entry into graduate education, time to completion of graduate education, and the interaction between work and education beyond the bachelor's degree. B&B:9312003 will expand this opportunity and begin to provide information concerning graduate study and long-term employment experiences after degree completion. B&B is an expansion of the former RCG Survey. The RCG focused on the immediate postdegree employment and education experiences of people who completed a bachelor's or master's degree, and also estimated the potential supply of newly qualified teachers at the elementary and secondary levels. B&B builds upon and expands that effort to provide unique information on education and employment experiences at the undergraduate level, as well as extensive information on financing undergraduate education. In addition, B&B:93 provides that information over a longer period of time and addresses issues concerning delayed entry into graduate school, progress and completion of graduate-level education, and undergraduate and graduate debt and its impact on choices related to career and family. In addition, it provides new information on the career paths of new teachers and movement into and outside the education system. B&B:2000/0 l is comparable to previous RCG studies, with the addition of information about their undergraduate education from the NPSAS. B&B covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, B&B allows analysis of the participation and progress of recent bachelor's degree completers in the workforce, the relationship of employment to degree, the income and ability to repay debt, and the willingness to enter public service-related fields. B&B also allows analysis of issues related to access to and choice in graduate education programs. Here, the emphasis is on ability, ease, and timing of entrance into graduate school, and attendance-employment patterns, progress, and completion timing once entered. The unique features of B&B allow it to be used to address issues related to undergraduate education, as well as postbaccalaureate experiences. For instance, B&B allows the investigation of issues related to undergraduate course-taking patterns, progress, and time to degree. This can involve such things as course taking in the major area of study, as well as in areas other than the academic major; stopout and transfer behavior; credits and grades earned; financial aid and work experiences as an undergraduate and their relationship to postbaccalaureate education; and financial experiences. This information has been used to investigate the relationship between undergraduate debt burden and early labor force experiences, and between undergraduate academic experiences and entry into teaching. These and other relationships can be investigated both in the short term and over longer periods. Because B&B has a special emphasis on new teachers at the elementary and secondary levels, it can be used to address many issues related to teacher preparation, entry into the profession (e.g., timing and ease of entry), persistence in or defection from teaching, and career movement within the education system. Employment and enrollment patterns can also be examined for special baccalaureate degree populations. These populations include, but are not limited to, students with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students from families with low incomes, and older students. B&B also allows investigation of the experiences of students by major field of study at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, engineering, teacher preparation, and health studies. 3 3"}, {"section_title": "INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS", "text": "Insights into the educational practices and outcomes of the United States are obtained by comparing them with those of other countries. Congress, in authorizing the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), recognized the importance of crossnational information by including it in the agency's mission. NCES carries out a variety of activities to provide statistical information comparing the educational experiences and trends in other countries to those in the United States. Through comparisons with other countries, it is possible to learn more about the status of education in the United States and to generate new ideas for improving American education. NCES plays a central role among organizations involved in collecting and interpreting international data and has created an International Activities Program within the Early Childhood, International, and Crosscutting Studies Division to coordinate NCES efforts in international education studies. NCES is actively involved with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), based in Paris, France, and with the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. In addition, NCES works with the Office of the Under Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, on the statistics project for the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Education Forum. There is a great deal of interest in the findings of international student assessment studies and in the development of education indicators that facilitate comparisons among national systems of education. This interest has been spurred by increased concern about global economic competition and the role education plays in the economy. International assessment studies provide answers to questions of how other countries educate their children and with what success. Such comparisons can lead to reexamination of our own teaching practices and challenge the conventional wisdom underlying them. The assessments not only compare the performance of American students with those of their peers in other nations, but can also provide insights into the factors that influence performance. The work that NCES conducts within the International Activities Program is designed to provide comparable indicator data about the activities and outcomes of educational systems and institutions in other nations. Such data can lead to improvements in accountability and policymaking. These data are increasingly relevant to policy formulation as the political, economic, and cultural ties grow among countries."}, {"section_title": "Studies and Activities", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study", "text": "The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), sponsored by the IEA, is a study of students' mathematics and science achievement in the United States and other participating nations. Previously known as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, the study is on a 4-year cycle, with data collection having occurred at three points in time thus far: 1995, 1999, and 2003. Results from the 1995 and 1999 data collections have been released. Results for the 2003 data collection are scheduled for release in late 2004. In 1995, 42 nations, including the United States, participated in the study. Assessments were administered to students in both grades 4 and 8 and to students at the end of secondary school (grade 12 in the United States). In 1999, 38 nations participated. Unlike the 1995 data collection, in 1999 the assessments were administered to students in grade 8 only. In 2003, 50 nations or jurisdictions collected data from students in grades 4 and/or 8. The TIMSS assessments allow the United States to compare the achievement of its students to their peers around the world. In addition, TIMSS allows for comparisons among nations on education-related contextual factors collected from schools, teachers, and students. The United States has sponsored additional components of TIMSS to enhance the information gained through the assessments and questionnaires. The additional components are as follows: TIMSS 1995 Videotape Classroom StudyThis first-ever large-scale, international study of teaching in eighth-grade mathematics classrooms involved three nations: Germany, Japan, and the United States. The study videotaped nationally representative samples of eighth-grade mathematics teaching to provide detailed information on the practices that may contribute to the achievement of students in the three participating nations. TIMSS 1995 Curriculum StudyFifty nations provided information on the official curriculum and submitted representative samples of mathematics and science textbooks for this study. Through A analyses of the data, the original TIMSS curricular frameworks were developed and curricular factors that may influence student achievement were investigated. TIMSS 1995 Case StudiesThe project provided in-depth information on education in three nations: Germany, Japan, and the United States. Through interviews with administrators, teachers, parents, and students, the project investigated education standards, dealing with differences in ability; the place of school in adolescents' lives; and the training and working conditions of teachers. TIMSS 1995 Benchmarking ProjectFive states and one consortium of school districts in the United States voluntarily participated as their own \"nations,\" following the same guidelines as the participating nations. Participants were able to assess their comparative international standing and evaluate their mathematics and science programs in an international context. TIMSS 1999 Benchmarking ProjectModeled on the 1995 project, 13 states and 14 districts or consortia of districts throughout the United States voluntarily participated in the second administration of this project. TIMSS 1999 Videotape Classroom StudyBuilding on the work of the first TIMSS videotape study of mathematics, the TIMSS 1999 Videotape Classroom Study examines national samples of eighthgrade mathematics and science instructional practices in seven nations. The study is designed to reveal national-level portraits of mathematics and science teaching practices that can provide a more detailed context for understanding mathematics and science teaching and learning in the classroom. The Benchmarking Projects provide reliable data on how state and district students compare to \"world-class\" levels in mathematics and science. Results from the TIMSS Videotape Classroom Studies also add to our understanding of mathematics and science instructional practices in nations with high student achievement levels on assessments such as TIMSS. The TIMSS Curriculum Study and Case Studies richly detail how decisions about curriculum and some education policies may contribute to student achievement. Taken together, these components of TIMSS provide a rich source of data for better understanding the educational context in which mathematics and science teaching and learning takes place. Through TIMSS, the following questions, among others, can be addressed about mathematics and science learning: How does the mathematics and science knowledge of U.S. students compare to that of other nations? Has the mathematics and science knowledge level of students changed since 1995 and has the relative international standing of U.S. students changed since the original TIMSS? How do nations compare on education-related background factors studied in TIMSS? How do U.S. mathematics and science teachers compare to their international colleagues in their preparation for teaching? What instructional techniques do mathematics and science teachers in other nations employ in the classroom? How do the teaching skills of U.S. teachers compare to those of their international peers? 141 Design Depending on the year of data collection, TIMSS focuses on students at three different stages in their academic careers. TIMSS 1995 was designed to focus on students in the two adjacent grades containing the largest numbers of 9-and 13-year-olds, as well as students who were completing the compulsory portion of their education. In the United States and most nations, these students were in grades 3/4, 7/8, and 12. TIMSS 1999 focused only on those students in the upper of the two grades that contained the largest number of 13-year-olds. This corresponded to grade 8 in the United States and most nations. In 2003, TIMSS focused on students in grades 4 and 8. With the completion of data collection in 2003, TIMSS provides comparisons of the achievement of fourth-graders across two points in time (1995 and 2003) and eighth-graders across three points in time (1995, 1999, and 2003). The TIMSS assessment includes two parts: mathematics and science items in multiple-choice and free-response formats. In addition, TIMSS administers school, teacher, and student questionnaires that request information to help provide a context for the performance scores. An international panel of assessment and content experts developed the original assessment framework in 1995. For the 2003 administration of TIMSS, the framework was revised to include the latest developments in mathematics and science education and assessment. The 2003 framework provided the basis for the collection of data on the problem-solving and inquiry skills of students in mathematics and science, which is new to TIMSS. All participating nations were required to draw nationally representative samples of students and schools for the TIMSS studies. Both public and nonpublic school students in all participating nations received the TIMSS assessments and questionnaires, unless otherwise noted in the reports. Most nations, including the United States, conducted the assessment 2 to 3 months before the end of the school year. Students with special needs and disabilities that would make it difficult for them to take the test were excused from the assessment. Such exclusions were documented by each participating nation, including the United States. In each nation, the assessments and questionnaires were translated into the primary language or languages of instruction. In the United States, all testing was done in English. The student assessment portion required approximately 1 1/2 hours to complete.

CivEd includes the following two components: Student QuestionnaireConsists of three parts and contains cognitive items related to knowledge across the three domains of civic education, questions intended to provide background data on students used to interpret the assessment results, and questions intended to determine students' understandings and perceptions of issues in the three domains. School QuestionnaireDesigned to gather information on the school's general environment, how civic education is integrated into the school curriculum, how it is structured, and how many staff members are involved in civic education. Program for International Student Assessment\nPISA is designed to focus on 15-year-old students. In the United States, these are largely 9th-and 10th-graders. A nationally representative sample of 15-year-old students is asked to complete the PISA assessment and background questionnaires in each participating country. To assess the performance of students and to provide education-related contextual information to understand their performance, PISA includes the following three components: Assessment ItemsStudents are required to read passages; interpret charts, graphs, diagrams, or other documents; and answer questions related to them. Question types range from multiple choice to extended response. The objective of the assessment items is to determine whether students can reflect and think about the domain being assessed, rather than simply repeat knowledge they have learned. The focus of the assessment items will change with each cycle of PISA. Student QuestionnaireThe student questionnaire was developed to collect information on school and out-of-school experiences of students, their attitudes toward learning, and other basic information considered important to interpreting the assessment results. School QuestionnaireA school administrator or someone knowledgeable about the school is asked to complete a questionnaire about the staff and its policies.

PIRLS 2001 followed the last international study of reading literacy conducted 10 years ago, and was designed to allow for the measurement of changes in reading literacy over time. PIRLS will be conducted on a planned 5-year cycle, with the next data collection scheduled for spring 2006. PIRLS offered the possibility of making comparisons of student reading performance across nations and provided international benchmarks by focusing on the following three aspects of reading literacy: processes of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading behaviors and attitudes. PIRLS 2001 helped measure progress toward the national goal of promoting reading literacy for all students and allowed for comparisons among nations on important educational policy issues. PIRLS 2001addressed the following questions about reading literacy: How well do U.S. fourth-grade students read literary texts compared to students in other countries? How well do U.S. fourth-grade students read informational texts compared to students in other countries? What are students' reading habits and attitudes? What school factors relate to students' reading literacy achievement?

The Condition of Education presents statistical information, drawn from numerous data sources, in an indicator format that is designed to make such information meaningful and accessible for a general audience. An indicator format differs from traditional statistical tables in that the quantitative data presented are carefully selected to convey summary information (about conditions, functioning, performance, or trends) and to serve as diagnostic tools for policymakers. Similar to leading economic indicators (e.g., the gross national product or consumer price index) that track economic trends and signal weak or strong economic performance, The Condition of Education's indicators focus national attention on important aspects of the U.S. educational system. The web version of The Condition of Education allows readers to access all indicators published since 2000. Both versions include supplemental information (e.g., statistical tables, standard errors, and supplemental notes) when needed for indicators. In addition, both versions include introductions for each of these six areas and a special focus analysis. The 2003 special focus analysis examined young children's achievements and classroom experiences in reading. The Condition of Education 's indicators represent the most current and valid data available to quantify those aspects of the U.S. educational system that a consensus of professional judgment deems to be the most significant national measures of the condition and progress of education. Thus, the same indicators are not merely updated every year. A core set of indicators is repeated with updated information annually; however, new indicators are also developed regularly as more and better data become available. Moreover, some indicators, based on one-time studies, appear only for a few years. Other indicators, based on periodic surveys, are updated every few years as new data become available.

Most of the important data collected by the Office of Education was placed in this report, which was a resource used by researchers, planners, and others interested in the field of education statistics. The publication was discontinued in 1958, but the need for a document summarizing the various types of data collected by the Office of Education continued.
