[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus currently, in 2020, is the most threatening severe acute respiratory infection in the world. Many attempts to create an effective vaccine against this infection are still in the developing stages and challenging (Bar-Zeev and Inglesby, 2020, Logunov et al., 2020) .\nThe SARS-CoV-2 genome shares about 82% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and > 90% sequence identity for essential enzymes and structural proteins. This high level of the sequence identity suggests a common pathogenesis mechanism, thus, therapeutic targeting. Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins, that include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Naqvi et al., 2020) . The structure and the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are under extensive study and the results seem to be controversial. It was shown that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix (M) and envelope(E)) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes, but genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), regarded as important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster (Dilucca et al., 2020) . However, other studies showed that potential drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved (Naqvi et al., 2020) .\nThe genome of SARS-CoV-2 is comprised of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The newly sequenced genome of the SARS-CoV-2 was submitted in the NCBI genome database (NC_045512.2) ~30 Kb in size. The genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 is composed of 13-15 (12 functional) open reading frames (ORFs) containing ~30,000 nucleotides. The genome contains 38% of the GC content and 11 protein-coding genes, with 12 expressed proteins (Naqvi et al., 2020) .\nThe genomic characterization of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed three most common mutations that might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (Khailany et al., 2020) . Another study highlighted the crucial genomic features that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and two other deadly coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These features correlate with the high fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as their ability to switch hosts from animals to humans (Gussow et al., 2020) .\nThe SARS-CoV-2 affected almost every country in the world. COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic and as on 25 October 2020, over 40 million people had been infected and more than 0.934 million deaths.\nIt is tempting to speculate that the epidemiological and clinical features may differ among different countries or continents.\nGenomic comparison of 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 genomes has shown that the average number of mutations per sample was 7.23, and most SARS-CoV-2 strains belong to one of three clades characterized by geographic and genomic specificity: clade G (Europe), clade L (Asia) and G-derived clade (North America) (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020) .\nThe obtained results suggest custom-designed antiviral strategies based on the molecular specificities of SARS-CoV-2 in different patients and geographical locations (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020) . The early study also differentiated three variants according to the geographic location (East Asia, Europe and America) (Forster et al., 2020) . More recent genome-wide analysis revealed that frequency of aa mutations were relatively higher in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Europe (43.07%) followed by Asia (38.09%), and North America (29.64%) while case fatality rates remained higher in the European temperate countries, such as Italy, Spain, Netherlands, France, England and Belgium (Islam et al., 2020) .\nThe aim of study was to compare the set of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from viruses isolated from the countries in the same meridian (longitude): Italy, Sweden, Congo, but with different climate to reveal similar or different pattern of possible evolutionary pressure signatures in their genomes."}, {"section_title": "Sequence data", "text": "We obtained the data from the GISaid repository sampling all the genomes available to that date (May 5, 2020).

The \"transmembrane analysis\" of the protein has been calculated using the TMHHM server v.2.0, the MemBrain webserver (Yin et al., 2018) , the ProtScale (Wilkins et al., 1999) and TMpred (Hofmann, 1993 ) (scores have been normalized for comparison) on Expasy website (Gasteiger et al., 2003) .\nThe analysis of the protein conducted for finding its disordered region, turns out the positions from 41\nto 59 as the more stable, with the Glycine (G) amino-acid placed at the 50th. We gained the results by using three different software and considering the average value for the probability of disorder, as reported by the Table 2 and represented in the Figure 5 . Further analysis to locate the transmembrane region in the protein, revealed the locations from 54 to 67 as associated to this function. The analysis, conducted with the utilization of four distinct web applications and by evaluating their average values, puts the Glycine (G) amino-acid as fairly near to the transmembrane region to suppose its involvement. Table 3 reports some of the data showing the probabilities of acting as transmembrane for each aminoacidic position, while Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of the probabilities by remarking the region mentioned above.

In this context we use the term \"site\" as synonymous of codon, respecting the HyPhy terminology. The asymptotic p-value for episodic diversification at site 9628 results equal to zero in all cases and Figure   1 shows the distribution of the p-value over the sites for all countries.

According to the preliminary clue from the secondary structure prediction, the model of the mutated protein presents a slightly different structure around the aminoacidic residue changing from G to T. The Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the predicted two models showing as the mentioned mutation impacts the tertiary structure of the protein. In fact, the comparison between the residues 45-55 in MUT31136 and MOD30336 turns out that portion of the protein subject to the mutation stretches out with repercussions to the preceding helix. This result suggests that the mutation of the single amino-acid from G to T with the consecutive stretching upon the 3D structure of the protein tends to make the protein acquire new functions. "}, {"section_title": "Protein related ontologies prediction", "text": "The analysis of the protein ontologies established different functions to the protein structure depending on whether it has mutated or not. As the Table 4 points out, the unchanged protein results related to catalytic and transferase activities with high probability (0.978 \u2264 \u2264 1). The mutated version of the protein presents a remarkable changing of its functionalities trend: even if usually the scores below 0.5 are interpreted as negative predictions, in an evolutionary context the decreasing of the probability of the transferase activity (from 0.98 to 0.375) to advantage of the binding function (from 0.004 to 0.132) sounds like not negligible. The contextual inversion of tendency of transferase to binding activity hints that the episodic evolutionary mutation aims to improve the binding ability. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "The recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 disease is still ongoing and many researchers trying to make their input to the slowing down the spread of the disease as well as any other aspects such as study of epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention. The main target for research is the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, China. To date, much is known about the structure, genetics and virulence of this virus, but many important questions are still not clear.\nFrom the evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 now is known that the virus has the tendency to increasing mutation rate comparing to other Coronaviridae, such as SARS-COV, which has a moderate mutation rate (Zhao et al., 2004) . The prevalence of single nucleotide transitions as the major mutational type across the world has been shown for SAR-CoV-2 virus (Mercatelli and Giorgi, 2020 America (Pachetti et al., 2020) . Their findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North\nAmerican and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern.\nComparison of genomes from 13 countries also identified differences in protein coding sequences od SARS-CoV-2. For example, Indian strain showed mutation in spike glycoprotein at R408I and in replicase polyprotein at I671T, P2144S and A2798V, while the spike protein of Spain & South Korea carried F797C and S221W mutation, respectively (Khan et al., 2020) . Moreover, the recently conducted integrative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different geographical locations reveal unique features potentially consequential to host-virus interaction and pathogenesis (Sardar et al., 2020) .\nHowever, the most recent to date study of genomic diversity and hotspot mutations in 30,983 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicate that unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate which makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely (Alouane et al., 2020) . The study determined a number of hotspot mutations across the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome.\nFourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (>10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein, and one in each of three proteins:\nSpike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes (Alouane et al., 2020) .\nAll these findings highlighted the importance of studying the relationship of geography of the isolates and mutations in their genomes because it is also can be confirmed by inferring from phylogenomic trees allowing to elucidate lineages and clusters accordingly to the geographical locations.\nIn conclusion, although we did not found correlation between countries located at the same meridian, we revealed that codon 9628 is under episodic selective pressure for all four countries."}]
