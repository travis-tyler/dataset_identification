[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We use field-level data to estimate the response of corn and soybean acreage to price shocks. Our sample contains more than eight million observations derived from satellite imagery and includes every field in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. We estimate that aggregate crop acreage responds more to price shocks in the short run than in the long run, and we show theoretically how the benefits of crop rotation generate this response pattern. In essence, farmers who change crops due to a price shock have an incentive to switch back to the previous crop to capture the benefits of crop rotation. Our result contradicts the long-held belief that agricultural supply responds gradually to price shocks through partial adjustment. We would not have obtained this result had we used county-level panel data. Standard econometric methods applied to county-level data produce estimates consistent with partial adjustment. We show that this apparent partial adjustment is illusory, and we demonstrate how it arises from the fact that fields in the same county are more similar to each other than to fields in other counties. This result underscores the importance of using models with appropriate micro-foundations and cautions against inferring micro-level rigidities from inertia in aggregate panel data. Our preferred estimate of the own-price long-run elasticity of corn acreage is 0.29 and the cross-price elasticity is -0.22. The corresponding elasticities for soybean acreage are 0.26 and -0.33. Our estimated short-run elasticities are 37 percent larger than their long-run counterparts. 2 How much more land gets allocated to a crop when relative prices change? The answer to this question is the central parameter for understanding world food prospects, the impacts of farm subsidies, and the environmental consequences from land use change, among other public and policy issues (e.g., Roberts and Schlenker 2013; Lichtenberg and Zilberman 1986; Searchinger et al. 2008; Donner and Kucharik 2008) . We provide a new and better answer for an important set of commodities in the world food system. We use a conceptual approach that accounts for crop rotations, a massive sample of individual fields, and econometric methods that account for heterogeneous incentives to rotate crops and heterogeneous responses to prices. Moreover, we show that supply response is seriously misestimated when standard econometric methods are applied to county-level panel data. One consequence of this bias is a mistaken understanding of supply dynamics and, in particular, the relationship between short-run and long-run supply response.\nA typical agricultural field in the United States Corn Belt tends to alternate between growing corn in one year and soybeans the next. This pattern reflects a common agronomic feature of crop production: planting a crop on the same field in consecutive years decreases the productivity of the soil for growing that crop and increases pest populations. These features generate dynamic complementarity in crop production because the marginal value of planting a particular crop this year depends on what was planted on that field the previous year. In this article, we show theoretically and empirically that these field-level dynamics imply that aggregate acreage of a crop responds to price shocks more in the short run than in the long run (5-10 years).\n1 For corn and soybeans, we estimate that the short-run elasticity of planted-acreage with respect to price exceeds its long-run counterpart by 37 percent.\nIntuitively, the short-run response exceeds the long-run response in the Corn Belt because farmers who change crops due to a price shock have an incentive to switch back to the previous crop to capture the benefits of crop rotation. For example, if the price of corn increases permanently, some land previously planted to continuous soybeans would switch to a corn-soybean rotation and would plant corn first, then rotate to soybeans in the second 1 year. Thus, aggregate corn acreage would decrease in the second year, even if prices were to stay constant.\nOur results stand in contrast to the existing literature which, since the seminal work of Nerlove (1958) , has held that farmers respond gradually to price shocks over time. The partial-adjustment hypothesis has been reinforced by numerous empirical studies that estimate the short-run response is much smaller than the long-run response to price for crops. A typical such study estimates a regression model containing a lagged dependent variable and interprets a positive coefficient on the lag as a measure of the extent of partial adjustment. Askari and Cummings (1977) provide an early review of this literature, and a recent example is de Menezes and Piketty (2012).\nWe recognize that there are several important settings where adjustment requires substantial changes in physical and human capital and agricultural supply is likely to respond less to price shocks in the short run than in the long run. For example, response to price shocks in the long run may exceed response in the short run for perennial crops or when supply response involves the conversion of grasslands or wetlands. However, our results call into question standard methods used to quantify this adjustment process with aggregate panel data and overturn the conventional wisdom for an important set of commodities.\nUnlike prior studies of crop supply response, we use a novel set of field-level crop data derived from satellite imagery that includes every field in Iowa (2000Iowa ( -2010, Illinois (1999-2010), and Indiana (2000-2010 The illusion of partial adjustment stems not from aggregation per se, but from the fact that county-level data represent aggregates across similar fields. To illustrate this point with our data, we create pseudo-county data by randomly assigning fields to groups and aggregating within each group. Using this group-level data, we re-estimate our models and obtain similar estimates to those we obtain with our field-level data. This result arises because most of the heterogeneity is averaged out in the aggregation of groups that are randomly assigned. Similarly, aggregating to a national time series (if we had a long enough time series) might also mitigate the biases that arise in the county-level panel.\n3\nWe develop a stylized model of the aggregate long-run and short-run acreage response to price that incorporates heterogeneous incentives to rotate crops. To simplify the model, we consider the two commodities corn and soybeans. If the farmer rotates the crops, then fewer inputs are required to obtain a given yield and a greater yield is obtained for a given level of 3 inputs. To focus on the implications for supply response, we simplify the model by assuming a zero discount rate, risk neutrality, and no economies of scope or scale. 4 We assume that only the crop from the previous year affects the production of the current crop (i.e., one-year memory of the rotation). In the supplementary online appendix, we extend the results to the case of two-year memory.\nFirst, assume that prices are known with certainty and constant over time. 5 The farmer chooses a rotation of corn and soybeans that maximizes profits over the length of the rotation.\nHennessy (2006) \nmax\nwhere the rotations continually repeat (t = 0 \u21d2 t = 2). The farmer maximizes profits by choosing the crop to plant in both periods (denoted c i ) and the inputs to apply to each crop in both periods (denoted x i ).\nWe write the period-t profit from corn and soybeans as (2) and (3) assume that the reduction in inputs and the yield boost from rotating crops enter the production function additively as in Hennessy (2006).\nThe optimal crop rotation is given by the following set of conditions (Hennessy 2006): Now consider the effect on planting decisions of an immediate unanticipated permanent change in output prices. Assuming constant prices in future crop years, the optimal rotation in the current year is either cc , ss , or cs . The farmer will determine the optimal rotation at current prices and begin that rotation immediately, regardless of the previous crop. Even though the optimal rotation does not depend on the previous crop, the optimal crop decision does depend on the previous crop. If corn was planted the previous year, then corn is optimal in the current year only if the optimal rotation is cc at current-and 5 future-prices. However, if soybeans were planted the previous year, then corn is optimal in the current year if the optimal rotation is cc or cs at current prices-or conversely, if the optimal rotation is not ss . If the farmer planted corn in the previous year (c i,t\u22121 = 1), then she chooses to plant corn this year if\nHowever, if she planted soybeans in the previous year (c i,t\u22121 = 0), then she chooses to plant corn this year if\nConditions (7) and (8) provide the theoretical basis for specifying our econometric model. Next, we aggregate these field-level cropping decisions across heterogeneous fields to characterize the dynamics of the aggregate acreage response to price.\nTo simplify aggregation, assume that there is a single parameter, \u03b8, that represents the land type, and \u03b8 has a probability density function g (\u03b8) and cumulative distribution function G (\u03b8) (see Lichtenberg 2002) . The parameter \u03b8 represents a whole range of ways that fields may differ including soils and climate. Let \u03b8 be scaled such that for a given set of prices it is optimal for fields with \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8 L to plant continuous corn, with \u03b8 L < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8 H to plant corn-soybeans, with \u03b8 H < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8 * to plant continuous soybeans, and with \u03b8 * < \u03b8 to plant a crop other than corn or soybeans. This set of assumptions is illustrated in figure 1.\nDenote the aggregate share of all acres planted to corn asC. If all fields are in a steadystate, long-run equilibrium, then all of the continuous corn acres are planted to corn, half of the corn-soybean acres are planted to corn, and none of the continuous soybean acres are planted to corn. The long-run aggregate share of corn acres can be written as\nLet p = p c /p s denote the relative price of corn to soybeans. The differential of the long-run share of corn acres is\nH \u2202p dp .\nWe assume that continuous corn acres are increasing and continuous soybean acres are decreasing with respect to the relative price of corn to soybeans (i.e.,\nNow consider the change in the share of corn acres in the the short run from an increase in the relative price of corn (i.e., the change in the first year following a price shock) assuming that in the initial period acres are in long-run equilibrium. The change in price causes some land to switch from corn-soybeans to continuous corn and some land to switch from continuous soybeans to corn-soybeans. All of the fields that switch from corn-soybeans to continuous corn plant corn in the short run, so 1/2 of these fields plant corn that otherwise would have planted soybeans in the absence of a price shock. All of the fields that switch from continuous soybeans to corn-soybeans plant corn in the short run, so all of these fields plant corn that otherwise would have planted soybeans. Written in differential form, the short-run change in the share of acres planted to corn is\nH \u2202p dp if dp > 0.\nUsing similar reasoning, the short-run response to a decrease in the relative price is\nH \u2202p dp if dp < 0.\nSubtracting the long-run response in (10) from the short-run responses in (11) and (12) gives\nH \u2202\u03b8 H \u2202p dp if dp > 0\nL \u2202p dp if dp < 0 .\nThus, the short-run response to price is larger than the long-run response. The difference between the short-run and long-run response occurs due to the conversion from continuous cropping to a crop rotation. When the relative price increases, all of the fields that switch from continuous soybeans to corn-soybeans are planted to corn in the short run, but in the long run only half of these fields are planted to corn. Our model also implies that price shocks cause acreage to oscillate around the long-run equilibrium, so even a temporary price shock causes oscillations in future acreage. In the supplementary online appendix, we show that in the case of two-year memory the conceptual model still implies that the short-run response to price is larger than the long-run response.\nIf there is uncertainty about prices in future years, then the farmer accounts for an option value of changing crops in the future if prices are different than expected. For example, even though it may be more profitable to plant corn in the current year, a fully rational farmer may plant soybeans because of the possibility that higher than expected corn prices next year could yield even higher profits. Planting corn this year would preclude taking advantage of that opportunity because of the yield drag. While our stylized model ignores this option value, it allows us to conceptually characterize the dynamics of supply response without substantial complications. Livingston, Roberts, and Zhang (2013) formulate a stochasticdynamic programming model of rotating corn and soybeans that incorporates rational price expectations, but must solve the model numerically.\nThe features of acreage response to price from our model are similar to those described in Eckstein (1984) , who developed a land allocation model where the current productivity of one crop increases if the land allocated to the other crop was larger in the previous year.\nHowever, there has been little empirical support in the literature for the hypothesis that the short-run response to price is larger than the long-run response when crops are rotated.\nEven Eckstein (1984) estimated that the short-run response was smaller than the long-run response in an application to aggregate crop data from Egypt. The only exception we found is Tegene, Huffman, and Miranowski (1988) , who estimate a model of corn acreage in Iowa using aggregate time-series data for the period 1948-1980 and find that the short-run acreage elasticity is 0.236 and the long-run elasticity is 0.220. In contrast, we estimate that the shortrun response is substantially larger than the long-run response. We also show that estimates of the dynamics of supply are severely biased when using aggregate panel data.\nNext, we describe our methods in constructing the data for the empirical analysis. Descriptive statistics of our data are shown in table 1.\nOur crop data come from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), 12 which is produced by the Na- Our empirical analysis uses three crop classifications: corn, soybeans, and other crops (primarily alfalfa and wheat). According to accuracy assessments conducted by NASS, the probability that the CDL correctly classifies corn or soybeans is roughly 95% on average in these three states. The CDL is less accurate at distinguishing between other crops, so we merge them all into a single category. Our econometric model does not estimate changes in corn and soybean acres from transitions with noncrop land uses partly because the CDL is less accurate at classifying noncrop land uses and because noncrop land use, say for grazing livestock, is a small part of the land mix that is ever planted to crops in the central Corn\nBelt. In the supplementary online appendix, we use aggregate data on noncrop acreage to show that changes in corn and soybean acres due to transitions with noncrop land uses are likely to be negligible for these three states.\nIn our econometric model, the right-hand side regressor is the expected effective price prior to planting including per-unit government payments-for which we use the shorthand \"expected We use the basis in March, prior to planting, as the expectation for the harvest basis. The basis in March provides a reasonable expected basis prior to planting because storage bounds temporal-arbitrage opportunities. To measure the basis, we use spot prices in March for 93 market locations in the three states for corn and 90 locations for soybeans from GeoGrain.\nWe then interpolate to every point in the crop dataset using inverse distance weighting.\nThe U.S. government provides a subsidy for corn and soybeans when market prices are low-called loan deficiency payments-and had such a program throughout the data period.\nThe loan deficiency payment equals the difference between a county-specific loan rate and the posted county price-the government's measure of the local market price-times the farmer's production, but is only triggered when the posted county price falls below the county-specific loan rate. This program provides a payment to growers but does not create a floor price for buyers and the government acquires no commodities, so we assume the loan rate truncates the price distribution from below. We use the formula for a truncated mean to estimate an expected price that incorporates the possibility of a loan deficiency payment assuming that the harvest-price distribution has a lognormal conditional distribution where the standard deviation is the implied volatility of options contracts. We assume the expected loan deficiency payment is constant across counties and varies only by year. Implied volatility data are from the Commodity Research Bureau. Loan rate and posted county price data are from the Farm Service Agency. Further details about constructing expected prices are available in the supplementary online appendix.\nWe construct a Laspeyres index of expected corn and soybean prices and a Laspeyres index of expected alfalfa and wheat prices for the analysis of changes between corn and soybeans and other crops. We construct these indices at the county level using the expected crop yield times the crop acreage in 2000 as the weights for expected prices. Expected yield is the prediction from county-specific regressions with a linear trend using NASS county-level data from 1980 to 2010. The expected alfalfa price, for which no futures market exists, is the average January-March price in Iowa. 15 The expected wheat price is the sum of a futures price and an expected loan deficiency payment.\nWe collected data on soil texture (percent clay, percent silt, and percent sand) and slope from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database from NRCS. County-level data on the 11 share of cropland that is irrigated are from the 2007 Census of Agriculture. We obtained precipitation in April and May for each year from PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model). PRISM interpolates precipitation data to create a grid of monthly precipitation with a resolution of about 2.5 miles x 2.5 miles. Corn is typically planted earlier than soybeans, but heavy rainfall can sometimes prevent corn from being planted on time and thereby prompt substitution to another crop. To capture this possibility, we include a dummy variable in our regressions that indicates if April-May precipitation was greater than the 75th percentile in the three states during our sample period. Figure 3 shows aggregate data on relative prices, crop acreage, and crop transitions for Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana during our sample period. Although the large increase in food commodity prices-often referred to as the \"food price crisis\"-occurred in 2008, figure 3a shows that a large shock in the relative expected price for corn to soybeans occurred in 2007 as corn prices increased before soybean prices.\nThe shock in relative expected prices was accompanied by a sharp increase in corn acreage in 2007 that was almost completely offset by a decrease in soybean acreage (figure 3b). In 2008, corn acreage decreased sharply and this was offset by an increase in soybean acreage.\nThe decrease in corn acreage in 2008, after the price shock in 2007, supports the hypothesis that the response to a price shock is larger in the short run than in the long run, although this evidence is only suggestive because it relies on one observation and the relative price of corn also decreased in 2008.\nWe find stronger evidence to support the claim that the price response is larger in the short run than the long run by examining crop transitions from our field-level data (see figure 3c ). The shock in relative prices in 2007 was accompanied by a decrease in soybeans after soybeans and an increase in corn after soybeans, as well as a decrease in soybeans after corn and an increase in corn after corn. 16 The crop transitions were out of steady-state in 12 2007 (corn after soybean transitions were not equal to soybean after corn transitions). So in 2008, corn after soybean transitions decreased and soybean after corn transitions increased, leading to a decrease in corn acres. Thus, the data on crop transitions provides evidence to support our hypothesis of supply dynamics as can be seen from the oscillation in corn after soybeans and soybeans after corn following a price shock. Next, we provide a more formal evaluation by estimating an econometric model.\nThe preceding discussion emphasizes transitions between corn and soybeans, which fits our empirical setting well. Our estimation sample contains roughly 8.75 million observations, each one representing a crop planted in a particular field in a particular year. Of these observations, 98 percent are planted to either corn or soybeans; the other two percent are planted to other crops such as wheat or alfalfa. 17 In our econometric analysis, we separately estimate price responses along the \"rotational margin\" (transitions between corn and soybeans) and the \"extensive margin\" (transitions between corn or soybeans and other crops), and then add them together to obtain total elasticities. This model setup implies that farmers make sequential decisions, first deciding whether to plant one of the two main crops (corn and soybeans) or another crop and then deciding which crop to plant.\nOur conceptual model indicates that the planting decision at the rotational margin depends on the previous crop (see equations (7) and (8)). We set up a first-order Markov model with two states. Denote corn as state 1 and soybeans as state 2. We specify the following model for the transitions between the two states: We assume that expected price is exogenous. Hendricks, Janzen, and Smith (2013) find small differences between OLS estimates and IV estimates in regressions of aggregate acreage on price. They suggest that yield deviations from trend may serve as a proxy to control for anticipated supply shocks, but yield deviations from trend are likely endogenous in our study since changes in crop rotation affect yields. We omit input prices from our econometric model. We recognize that prices for inputs that differ in their intensity of use between corn and soybean production-most notably fertilizer-may affect decisions at the rotational margin. However, in the supplementary online appendix, we use University of Illinois crop budgets to show that changes in the price of fertilizer make a much smaller difference in the relative returns of crop rotations than changes in crop prices. We also show in the online appendix that our acreage elasticities are robust to controlling for the price of fertilizer in our regressions. Our preferred specification omits the price of fertilizer because we recognize the limitations of identifying the effect of the price of fertilizer separately from crop prices with only 11 years of data.\nWe can specify the econometric model with Markov transition probabilities that depend on expected prices only in the current crop year by assuming the expected price in the current year embodies all of the price information relevant for decisions in future crop years.\nIncorporating forward-looking price expectations into the econometric model would require a dynamic discrete choice model \u00e1 la Rust (1987) . A dynamic discrete choice model would substantially increase the computational burden and require a different set of identifying 14 assumptions. Forward-looking price expectations are likely to be more important in models of conversions between cropland and noncropland (e.g., Scott 2013) than for transitions between field crops.\nTo estimate the long-run marginal effect of expected price, it is useful to write the transition probabilities in matrix form as\nand let \u03be it denote a 2 \u00d7 1 vector that indicates the state of the process in year t. If the process is in state j, then \u03be it has the value one in the j th row and zero in the other row. We\ncan write E \u03be it |\u03be i,t\u22121 = \u03a6 it \u03be i,t\u22121 . Holding the explanatory variables fixed at their values in period t, the vector of long-run state probabilities satisfies the following relationships:\nwhere \u03a0 it is the vector of long-run state probabilities and 1 is a vector of ones. Solving the system of equations in (17) and (18), the long-run probability of corn can be written as follows:\nWe estimate the effect on region-wide acreage from changes in the expected corn price by aggregating marginal effects across fields. The aggregate acres of corn in year t is C t = i a i c it , where a i denotes the fixed land area of field i-measured in acres. The long-run 15 change in aggregate corn acres with respect to the expected price of corn is\nThe short-run change in aggregate corn acres with respect to the expected price of corn is\nTo estimate the short-run response to price from steady-state, we substitute \u03a0 (20) and (21). We report these estimated short-run effects in elasticity form by multiplying by the mean expected price relative to the mean corn acreage in our sample.\nAt the extensive margin, we also estimate first-order Markov transition probabilities where the two states are (i) corn or soybeans and (ii) other crops. The transition probabilities are estimated as a function of an index of expected corn and soybean prices, an index of expected wheat and alfalfa prices, field characteristics (x i excluding spring rainfall), and a linear trend. The marginal effect of the price of corn on the probability of planting corn at the extensive margin is obtained by multiplying three components: (i) the derivative of the price index with respect to the price of corn, (ii) the marginal effect of the price index on the probability of planting corn or soybeans, and (iii) the probability of planting corn given that the field is planted to corn or soybeans obtained as a prediction from the rotational margin estimates.\nOur transition probabilities in (14) and (15) \nOLS estimates of (22) are biased because the lagged dependent variable is correlated with the heterogeneous intercepts. Furthermore, when the coefficients are heterogeneous across fields, estimating a single coefficient for all fields (i.e., pooling) leads to biased estimates (Robertson and Symons 1992; Pesaran and Smith 1995) . The bias from heterogeneous coefficients occurs because the error term in the pooled model is autocorrelated since it contains the lagged dependent variable and autocorrelated prices. For example, consider a field in which the probability of planting corn is more responsive to price than the average field. Higher than normal corn prices this year will generate a larger deviation from the average probability of planting corn for this field. Because prices are positively autocorrelated, this field also likely had a larger deviation from the average probability of planting corn for the field last year.\nAutocorrelated deviations from the average probability of planting corn bias the estimated coefficient on the lagged dependent variable.\nIf we had a panel with large T , then we could estimate separate coefficients for each field and then average across these coefficients to obtain an aggregate response. This \"mean group estimator\" (Pesaran and Smith 1995) is biased in short panels because each fieldlevel regression has too few observations to overcome the small-sample biases inherent in estimating dynamic models in short samples (Hsiao, Pesaran, and Tahmiscioglu 1999) . Thus, we have a trade-off between allowing for heterogeneity but inducing the small-T bias and pooling to reduce the small-T problem but being left with the heterogeneity bias. We manage this trade-off by forming groups of similar fields and estimating separate coefficients for groups of similar fields (i.e., a \"grouped coefficients\" estimator). This approach reduces the small-T bias by estimating regressions for large groups of fields and reduces bias from coefficient heterogeneity by only including relatively homogeneous fields in each regression. groups. We show these groups in figure 4 overlayed on maps of corn after corn and soybeans after soybeans in 2010 (a color figure is available in the online version of this article). The maps indicate that crop dynamics vary spatially by MLRA.\nAt the rotational margin, about a third of the fields were never planted to monoculture;\nthey alternate between corn and soybeans throughout the sample period. At the extensive margin, about 90 percent of the fields are always planted to corn or soybeans. Such fields are unresponsive to prices in our sample period. To the extent that such fields are less responsive to price than other fields in the same MLRA, including them in a group-level regression induces a heterogeneity bias. Thus, at the rotational margin we divide the fields in each MLRA into two groups: (i) fields that were never planted to monoculture (i.e., always rotated between corn and soybeans) and (ii) fields that were planted to monoculture at least once. For fields that were never planted to monoculture, we impose the identifying restriction \u03a6 11 it = 0, \u03a6 21 it = 1. At the extensive margin we divide the fields into the following two groups: (i) fields that transitioned between corn or soybeans and other crops and (ii) fields that always planted corn or soybeans. For field that always planted corn or soybeans, we impose the identifying restriction that the probability of planting corn or soybeans is 1 regardless of the previous state.\nWe refer to our estimator as a \"conditional grouped coefficients\" estimator. It is a grouped coefficients estimator because our estimated coefficients are identical within 24 \u00d7 2 groups of similar fields as defined by 24 MLRAs and 2 transition groups. It is a conditional estimator because, within each MLRA, we estimate the model separately for two sets of fields. This conditional estimation approach is like the conditional likelihood approach used 18 in discrete-choice models in that the parameters are only identified for fields that changed states (Heckman 1981) . A similar estimation strategy was used by Bernard and Jensen (2004) .\nTo estimate standard errors, we use a cluster bootstrap with 500 replications, where we cluster by year. Clustering by year permits cross-sectional (i.e., spatial) dependence between all of the fields for a given year, but assumes independence between years. We use the wild bootstrap because bootstrap methods that resample the regressors can be problematic when there are few clusters (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008) . The wild bootstrap preserves the regressors but resamples the dependent variable using the OLS prediction and the residual with probability 0.5 and the negative of the residual with probability 0.5.\n19\nFirst, we present our preferred econometric results using the conditional grouped coefficients methodology. Then we show results with commonly-used pooled estimators, which we argue are biased. Table 2 reports results for the aggregate acreage elasticities at the rotational and extensive margins. We find a small price response at the extensive margin-a change in the expected price of corn or soybeans causes a small change in the number of acres planted to corn or soybeans in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. In the supplementary online appendix, we examine the extensive margin response in more detail and show that a small response is consistent with aggregate data.\nPanel A of table 2 reports corn acreage elasticities. Column (1) shows that, in the short run, a 10% increase in the price of corn results in a 4.0% increase in corn acreage, ceteris paribus. In the long run, a 10% increase in the price of corn results in a 2.9% increase in 19 corn acreage, ceteris paribus. The cross-price elasticity is negative and large relative to the own-price elasticity since most of the acreage response is at the rotational margin.\nPanel B of table 2 reports soybean acreage elasticities. We find that in the short run, a 10% increase in the price of soybeans results in a 3.6% increase in soybean acreage. In the long run, a 10% increase in the price of soybeans results in a 2.6% increase in soybean acreage. Note that the marginal effect for soybean acreage at the rotational margin is the negative of the marginal effect for corn acreage, but the elasticity differs in magnitude. The own-price elasticity is smaller than the cross-price elasticity for soybean acreage. Corn and soybean acreage may be more responsive to changes in the expected price of corn because in most regions corn is the more profitable crop in the rotation, 20 while soybeans are grown to capture rotational benefits. Estimates by Chavas and Holt (1996) also indicate that the own-price elasticity is smaller than the cross-price elasticity for soybean acreage.\nThe relative difference in the short-run (\u03b5 SR ) and long-run (\u03b5 LR ) elasticities is reported in the last row of table 2 as\n. This parameter is analogous to the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in a regression with a single lagged dependent variable and is a convenient way to compare results across specifications. The total acreage response to a price shock is 37% larger in the short run than the long run. This result is consistent with our conceptual model of aggregate acreage dynamics with crop rotations, but stands in contrast to the previous literature on agricultural supply dynamics. In the supplementary online appendix, we show that our main results are robust to allowing for two-year memory in the econometric model.\nOur regression estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in the price response and acreage dynamics. The histograms in figure 5 show the distribution of short-run marginal effects of the expected price of corn (figure 5a), short-run marginal effects of the expected price of soybeans (figure 5b), and the dynamics (figure 5c) for fields that were planted to monoculture at least once. estimates for the probability of planting corn given that the field was previously planted to corn. Column (2) reports estimates given that the field was previously planted to soybeans.\nThe models are estimated separately for every MLRA. The standard deviation of coefficients across MLRAs is in brackets and the bootstrap standard error of the average coefficient is in parentheses.\nComparing columns (1) and (2) in table 3, farmers are much more responsive to changes in expected prices when corn was previously planted. If a field was previously planted to soybeans, then farmers are likely to plant corn even when prices change. Most of their adjustment to prices occurs on fields that were previously planted to corn where they choose whether to plant corn after corn or rotate with soybeans. The difference in the intercepts in columns (1) and (2) indicates that on average corn is more likely to be planted if the field was previously planted to soybeans rather than corn.\nA large amount of rainfall in the spring tends to decrease the probability of planting corn-especially when soybeans were planted previously-because wet field conditions can delay corn planting. This partly explains the prevalence of soybeans after soybeans even though soybeans are generally considered less profitable than corn. The coefficients on the clay and silt content of the soil differ greatly between MLRAs (a large standard deviation), with the sign of the coefficient often differing between MLRAs. This result likely reflects nonlinear effects of the soil variables. For example, the effect of higher than average clay content in an MLRA with soils that have a large clay content may be different than the"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "How much more land gets allocated to a crop when relative prices change? The answer to this question is the central parameter for understanding world food prospects, the impacts of farm subsidies, and the environmental consequences from land use change, among other public and policy issues (e.g., Roberts and Schlenker 2013; Lichtenberg and Zilberman 1986; Searchinger et al. 2008; Donner and Kucharik 2008) . We provide a new and better answer for an important set of commodities in the world food system. We use a conceptual approach that accounts for crop rotations, a massive sample of individual fields, and econometric methods that account for heterogeneous incentives to rotate crops and heterogeneous responses to prices. Moreover, we show that supply response is seriously misestimated when standard econometric methods are applied to county-level panel data. One consequence of this bias is a mistaken understanding of supply dynamics and, in particular, the relationship between short-run and long-run supply response.\nA typical agricultural field in the United States Corn Belt tends to alternate between growing corn in one year and soybeans the next. This pattern reflects a common agronomic feature of crop production: planting a crop on the same field in consecutive years decreases the productivity of the soil for growing that crop and increases pest populations. These features generate dynamic complementarity in crop production because the marginal value of planting a particular crop this year depends on what was planted on that field the previous year. In this article, we show theoretically and empirically that these field-level dynamics imply that aggregate acreage of a crop responds to price shocks more in the short run than in the long run (5-10 years).\n1 For corn and soybeans, we estimate that the short-run elasticity of planted-acreage with respect to price exceeds its long-run counterpart by 37 percent.\nIntuitively, the short-run response exceeds the long-run response in the Corn Belt because farmers who change crops due to a price shock have an incentive to switch back to the previous crop to capture the benefits of crop rotation. For example, if the price of corn increases permanently, some land previously planted to continuous soybeans would switch to a corn-soybean rotation and would plant corn first, then rotate to soybeans in the second 1 year. Thus, aggregate corn acreage would decrease in the second year, even if prices were to stay constant.\nOur results stand in contrast to the existing literature which, since the seminal work of Nerlove (1958) , has held that farmers respond gradually to price shocks over time. The partial-adjustment hypothesis has been reinforced by numerous empirical studies that estimate the short-run response is much smaller than the long-run response to price for crops. A typical such study estimates a regression model containing a lagged dependent variable and interprets a positive coefficient on the lag as a measure of the extent of partial adjustment. Askari and Cummings (1977) provide an early review of this literature, and a recent example is de Menezes and Piketty (2012) .\nWe recognize that there are several important settings where adjustment requires substantial changes in physical and human capital and agricultural supply is likely to respond less to price shocks in the short run than in the long run. For example, response to price shocks in the long run may exceed response in the short run for perennial crops or when supply response involves the conversion of grasslands or wetlands. However, our results call into question standard methods used to quantify this adjustment process with aggregate panel data and overturn the conventional wisdom for an important set of commodities.\nUnlike prior studies of crop supply response, we use a novel set of field-level crop data derived from satellite imagery that includes every field in Iowa (2000 Iowa ( -2010 , Illinois (1999 -2010 ), and Indiana (2000 -2010 . Our sample accounts for roughly 15 percent of world corn and soybean production. To generate our estimated supply elasticities, we estimate firstorder Markov transition probabilities. 2 We separately estimate price responses along the rotational margin (transitions between corn and soybeans) and the extensive margin (transitions between corn or soybeans and other crops). Although we have more than 8 million observations, we only have roughly 11 years of data. In order to account for spatial de- pendence in the data, we cluster standard errors by year. In dynamic panel regression models of the type that we estimate, coefficient heterogeneity can induce potentially large 2 biases (Robertson and Symons 1992; Pesaran and Smith 1995) . We alleviate such biases by estimating separate econometric models for 24 regions with different soil and climate characteristics.\nTo show the value of using field-level data, we also estimate crop supply response by applying standard dynamic panel estimators to county-level data. This exercise produces a short-run response to price that is roughly 20 percent smaller than the long-run response.\nThis finding contradicts our result with field-level data that the short-run response is 37 percent larger than the long-run response. We show that the illusion of partial adjustment in county-level data arises because aggregating over similar micro units (i.e., fields in the same county) inflates the bias due to coefficients that differ across fields (Robertson and Symons 1992; Pesaran and Smith 1995) . Our results indicate that researchers should exercise caution in interpreting dynamic economic behavior from commonly used dynamic panel estimators, especially if the panels represent aggregates over similar micro units.\nThe illusion of partial adjustment stems not from aggregation per se, but from the fact that county-level data represent aggregates across similar fields. To illustrate this point with our data, we create pseudo-county data by randomly assigning fields to groups and aggregating within each group. Using this group-level data, we re-estimate our models and obtain similar estimates to those we obtain with our field-level data. This result arises because most of the heterogeneity is averaged out in the aggregation of groups that are randomly assigned. Similarly, aggregating to a national time series (if we had a long enough time series) might also mitigate the biases that arise in the county-level panel."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model of Aggregate Acreage Response to Price", "text": "We develop a stylized model of the aggregate long-run and short-run acreage response to price that incorporates heterogeneous incentives to rotate crops. To simplify the model, we consider the two commodities corn and soybeans. If the farmer rotates the crops, then fewer inputs are required to obtain a given yield and a greater yield is obtained for a given level of 3 inputs. To focus on the implications for supply response, we simplify the model by assuming a zero discount rate, risk neutrality, and no economies of scope or scale. 4 We assume that only the crop from the previous year affects the production of the current crop (i.e., one-year memory of the rotation). In the supplementary online appendix, we extend the results to the case of two-year memory.\nFirst, assume that prices are known with certainty and constant over time. 5 The farmer chooses a rotation of corn and soybeans that maximizes profits over the length of the rotation.\nHennessy (2006) \nmax\nwhere the rotations continually repeat (t = 0 \u21d2 t = 2).

The farmer will determine the optimal rotation at current prices and begin that rotation immediately, regardless of the previous crop. Even though the optimal rotation does not depend on the previous crop, the optimal crop decision does depend on the previous crop. If corn was planted the previous year, then corn is optimal in the current year only if the optimal rotation is cc at current-and 5 future-prices. However, if soybeans were planted the previous year, then corn is optimal in the current year if the optimal rotation is cc or cs at current prices-or conversely, if the optimal rotation is not ss .

Next, we aggregate these field-level cropping decisions across heterogeneous fields to characterize the dynamics of the aggregate acreage response to price.\nTo simplify aggregation, assume that there is a single parameter, \u03b8, that represents the land type, and \u03b8 has a probability density function g (\u03b8) and cumulative distribution function G (\u03b8) (see Lichtenberg 2002) . The parameter \u03b8 represents a whole range of ways that fields may differ including soils and climate. Let \u03b8 be scaled such that for a given set of prices it is optimal for fields with \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8 L to plant continuous corn, with \u03b8 L < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8 H to plant corn-soybeans, with \u03b8 H < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8 * to plant continuous soybeans, and with \u03b8 * < \u03b8 to plant a crop other than corn or soybeans. This set of assumptions is illustrated in figure 1.\nHowever, there has been little empirical support in the literature for the hypothesis that the short-run response to price is larger than the long-run response when crops are rotated.\nEven Eckstein (1984) estimated that the short-run response was smaller than the long-run response in an application to aggregate crop data from Egypt. The only exception we found is Tegene, Huffman, and Miranowski (1988) , who estimate a model of corn acreage in Iowa using aggregate time-series data for the period 1948-1980 and find that the short-run acreage elasticity is 0.236 and the long-run elasticity is 0.220. In contrast, we estimate that the shortrun response is substantially larger than the long-run response.

The change in price causes some land to switch from corn-soybeans to continuous corn and some land to switch from continuous soybeans to corn-soybeans. All of the fields that switch from corn-soybeans to continuous corn plant corn in the short run, so 1/2 of these fields plant corn that otherwise would have planted soybeans in the absence of a price shock. All of the fields that switch from continuous soybeans to corn-soybeans plant corn in the short run, so all of these fields plant corn that otherwise would have planted soybeans.

The difference between the short-run and long-run response occurs due to the conversion from continuous cropping to a crop rotation. When the relative price increases, all of the fields that switch from continuous soybeans to corn-soybeans are planted to corn in the short run, but in the long run only half of these fields are planted to corn. Our model also implies that price shocks cause acreage to oscillate around the long-run equilibrium, so even a temporary price shock causes oscillations in future acreage.

Planting corn this year would preclude taking advantage of that opportunity because of the yield drag. While our stylized model ignores this option value, it allows us to conceptually characterize the dynamics of supply response without substantial complications. Livingston, Roberts, and Zhang (2013) formulate a stochasticdynamic programming model of rotating corn and soybeans that incorporates rational price expectations, but must solve the model numerically.\nThe features of acreage response to price from our model are similar to those described in Eckstein (1984) , who developed a land allocation model where the current productivity of one crop increases if the land allocated to the other crop was larger in the previous year."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Next, we describe our methods in constructing the data for the empirical analysis.

For corn, the futures price is the average price in January- We use the basis in March, prior to planting, as the expectation for the harvest basis. The basis in March provides a reasonable expected basis prior to planting because storage bounds temporal-arbitrage opportunities. To measure the basis, we use spot prices in March for 93 market locations in the three states for corn and 90 locations for soybeans from GeoGrain.\nWe then interpolate to every point in the crop dataset using inverse distance weighting.\nThe U.S. government provides a subsidy for corn and soybeans when market prices are low-called loan deficiency payments-and had such a program throughout the data period.\nThe loan deficiency payment equals the difference between a county-specific loan rate and the posted county price-the government's measure of the local market price-times the farmer's production, but is only triggered when the posted county price falls below the county-specific loan rate. This program provides a payment to growers but does not create a floor price for buyers and the government acquires no commodities, so we assume the loan rate truncates the price distribution from below. We use the formula for a truncated mean to estimate an expected price that incorporates the possibility of a loan deficiency payment assuming that the harvest-price distribution has a lognormal conditional distribution where the standard deviation is the implied volatility of options contracts. We assume the expected loan deficiency payment is constant across counties and varies only by year. Implied volatility data are from the Commodity Research Bureau.

Expected yield is the prediction from county-specific regressions with a linear trend using NASS county-level data from 1980 to 2010.

Although the large increase in food commodity prices-often referred to as the \"food price crisis\"-occurred in 2008, figure 3a shows that a large shock in the relative expected price for corn to soybeans occurred in 2007 as corn prices increased before soybean prices.\nThe shock in relative expected prices was accompanied by a sharp increase in corn acreage in 2007 that was almost completely offset by a decrease in soybean acreage (figure 3b). In 2008, corn acreage decreased sharply and this was offset by an increase in soybean acreage.\nThe decrease in corn acreage in 2008, after the price shock in 2007, supports the hypothesis that the response to a price shock is larger in the short run than in the long run, although this evidence is only suggestive because it relies on one observation and the relative price of corn also decreased in 2008.\nWe find stronger evidence to support the claim that the price response is larger in the short run than the long run by examining crop transitions from our field-level data (see figure 3c ). The shock in relative prices in 2007 was accompanied by a decrease in soybeans after soybeans and an increase in corn after soybeans, as well as a decrease in soybeans after corn and an increase in corn after corn. 16 The crop transitions were out of steady-state in 12 2007 (corn after soybean transitions were not equal to soybean after corn transitions). So in 2008, corn after soybean transitions decreased and soybean after corn transitions increased, leading to a decrease in corn acres.

These two equations are sufficient to describe the system because \u03a6\nit . We write each coefficient with an i subscript to allow heterogeneity across fields.\nWe assume that expected price is exogenous. Hendricks, Janzen, and Smith (2013) find small differences between OLS estimates and IV estimates in regressions of aggregate acreage on price. They suggest that yield deviations from trend may serve as a proxy to control for anticipated supply shocks, but yield deviations from trend are likely endogenous in our study since changes in crop rotation affect yields. We omit input prices from our econometric model. We recognize that prices for inputs that differ in their intensity of use between corn and soybean production-most notably fertilizer-may affect decisions at the rotational margin. However, in the supplementary online appendix, we use University of Illinois crop budgets to show that changes in the price of fertilizer make a much smaller difference in the relative returns of crop rotations than changes in crop prices. We also show in the online appendix that our acreage elasticities are robust to controlling for the price of fertilizer in our regressions. Our preferred specification omits the price of fertilizer because we recognize the limitations of identifying the effect of the price of fertilizer separately from crop prices with only 11 years of data.\nWe can specify the econometric model with Markov transition probabilities that depend on expected prices only in the current crop year by assuming the expected price in the current year embodies all of the price information relevant for decisions in future crop years.\nIncorporating forward-looking price expectations into the econometric model would require a dynamic discrete choice model \u00e1 la Rust (1987) . A dynamic discrete choice model would substantially increase the computational burden and require a different set of identifying 14 assumptions. Forward-looking price expectations are likely to be more important in models of conversions between cropland and noncropland (e.g., Scott 2013) than for transitions between field crops.\nTo estimate the long-run marginal effect of expected price, it is useful to write the transition probabilities in matrix form as\nand let \u03be it denote a 2 \u00d7 1 vector that indicates the state of the process in year t.

Solving the system of equations in (17) and (18), the long-run probability of corn can be written as follows:\nWe estimate the effect on region-wide acreage from changes in the expected corn price by aggregating marginal effects across fields. The aggregate acres of corn in year t is C t = i a i c it , where a i denotes the fixed land area of field i-measured in acres. The long-run change in aggregate corn acres with respect to the expected price of corn is\nThe short-run change in aggregate corn acres with respect to the expected price of corn is\nTo estimate the short-run response to price from steady-state, we substitute \u03a0 (20) and (21). We report these estimated short-run effects in elasticity form by multiplying by the mean expected price relative to the mean corn acreage in our sample.\nAt the extensive margin, we also estimate first-order Markov transition probabilities where the two states are (i) corn or soybeans and (ii) other crops. The transition probabilities are estimated as a function of an index of expected corn and soybean prices, an index of expected wheat and alfalfa prices, field characteristics (x i excluding spring rainfall), and a linear trend. The marginal effect of the price of corn on the probability of planting corn at the extensive margin is obtained by multiplying three components: (i) the derivative of the price index with respect to the price of corn, (ii) the marginal effect of the price index on the probability of planting corn or soybeans, and (iii) the probability of planting corn given that the field is planted to corn or soybeans obtained as a prediction from the rotational margin estimates.\nOur transition probabilities in (14) and (15) \nOLS estimates of (22) are biased because the lagged dependent variable is correlated with the heterogeneous intercepts. Furthermore, when the coefficients are heterogeneous across fields, estimating a single coefficient for all fields (i.e., pooling) leads to biased estimates (Robertson and Symons 1992; Pesaran and Smith 1995) . The bias from heterogeneous coefficients occurs because the error term in the pooled model is autocorrelated since it contains the lagged dependent variable and autocorrelated prices. For example, consider a field in which the probability of planting corn is more responsive to price than the average field. Higher than normal corn prices this year will generate a larger deviation from the average probability of planting corn for this field. Because prices are positively autocorrelated, this field also likely had a larger deviation from the average probability of planting corn for the field last year.\nAutocorrelated deviations from the average probability of planting corn bias the estimated coefficient on the lagged dependent variable.\nIf we had a panel with large T , then we could estimate separate coefficients for each field and then average across these coefficients to obtain an aggregate response. This \"mean group estimator\" (Pesaran and Smith 1995) is biased in short panels because each fieldlevel regression has too few observations to overcome the small-sample biases inherent in estimating dynamic models in short samples (Hsiao, Pesaran, and Tahmiscioglu 1999) . Thus, we have a trade-off between allowing for heterogeneity but inducing the small-T bias and pooling to reduce the small-T problem but being left with the heterogeneity bias. We manage this trade-off by forming groups of similar fields and estimating separate coefficients for groups of similar fields (i.e., a \"grouped coefficients\" estimator). This approach reduces the small-T bias by estimating regressions for large groups of fields and reduces bias from coefficient heterogeneity by only including relatively homogeneous fields in each regression. At the rotational margin, about a third of the fields were never planted to monoculture;\nthey alternate between corn and soybeans throughout the sample period. At the extensive margin, about 90 percent of the fields are always planted to corn or soybeans. Such fields are unresponsive to prices in our sample period. To the extent that such fields are less responsive to price than other fields in the same MLRA, including them in a group-level regression induces a heterogeneity bias. Thus, at the rotational margin we divide the fields in each MLRA into two groups: (i) fields that were never planted to monoculture (i.e., always rotated between corn and soybeans) and (ii) fields that were planted to monoculture at least once. For fields that were never planted to monoculture, we impose the identifying restriction \u03a6 11 it = 0, \u03a6 21 it = 1. At the extensive margin we divide the fields into the following two groups: (i) fields that transitioned between corn or soybeans and other crops and (ii) fields that always planted corn or soybeans. For field that always planted corn or soybeans, we impose the identifying restriction that the probability of planting corn or soybeans is 1 regardless of the previous state.\nWe refer to our estimator as a \"conditional grouped coefficients\" estimator. It is a grouped coefficients estimator because our estimated coefficients are identical within 24 \u00d7 2 groups of similar fields as defined by 24 MLRAs and 2 transition groups. It is a conditional estimator because, within each MLRA, we estimate the model separately for two sets of fields. This conditional estimation approach is like the conditional likelihood approach used in discrete-choice models in that the parameters are only identified for fields that changed states (Heckman 1981) . A similar estimation strategy was used by Bernard and Jensen (2004) .\nTo estimate standard errors, we use a cluster bootstrap with 500 replications, where we cluster by year. Clustering by year permits cross-sectional (i.e., spatial) dependence between all of the fields for a given year, but assumes independence between years. We use the wild bootstrap because bootstrap methods that resample the regressors can be problematic when there are few clusters (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2008) . The wild bootstrap preserves the regressors but resamples the dependent variable using the OLS prediction and the residual with probability 0.5 and the negative of the residual with probability 0.5."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Econometric Results with Disaggregate Data", "text": "First, we present our preferred econometric results using the conditional grouped coefficients methodology.

Column (1) shows that, in the short run, a 10% increase in the price of corn results in a 4.0% increase in corn acreage, ceteris paribus. In the long run, a 10% increase in the price of corn results in a 2.9% increase in corn acreage, ceteris paribus. The cross-price elasticity is negative and large relative to the own-price elasticity since most of the acreage response is at the rotational margin.\nPanel B of table 2 reports soybean acreage elasticities. We find that in the short run, a 10% increase in the price of soybeans results in a 3.6% increase in soybean acreage. In the long run, a 10% increase in the price of soybeans results in a 2.6% increase in soybean acreage. Note that the marginal effect for soybean acreage at the rotational margin is the negative of the marginal effect for corn acreage, but the elasticity differs in magnitude. The own-price elasticity is smaller than the cross-price elasticity for soybean acreage. Corn and soybean acreage may be more responsive to changes in the expected price of corn because in most regions corn is the more profitable crop in the rotation, 20 while soybeans are grown to capture rotational benefits. Estimates by Chavas and Holt (1996) also indicate that the own-price elasticity is smaller than the cross-price elasticity for soybean acreage.\nThe relative difference in the short-run (\u03b5 SR ) and long-run (\u03b5 LR ) elasticities is reported in the last row of table 2 as\n. This parameter is analogous to the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in a regression with a single lagged dependent variable and is a convenient way to compare results across specifications. The total acreage response to a price shock is 37% larger in the short run than the long run. This result is consistent with our conceptual model of aggregate acreage dynamics with crop rotations, but stands in contrast to the previous literature on agricultural supply dynamics. In the supplementary online appendix, we show that our main results are robust to allowing for two-year memory in the econometric model.\nOur regression estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in the price response and acreage dynamics. The histograms in figure 5 show the distribution of short-run marginal effects of the expected price of corn (figure 5a), short-run marginal effects of the expected price of soybeans (figure 5b), and the dynamics (figure 5c) for fields that were planted to monoculture at least once. estimates for the probability of planting corn given that the field was previously planted to corn. Column (2) reports estimates given that the field was previously planted to soybeans.\nThe models are estimated separately for every MLRA. The standard deviation of coefficients across MLRAs is in brackets and the bootstrap standard error of the average coefficient is in parentheses.\nComparing columns (1) and (2) in table 3, farmers are much more responsive to changes in expected prices when corn was previously planted. If a field was previously planted to soybeans, then farmers are likely to plant corn even when prices change. Most of their adjustment to prices occurs on fields that were previously planted to corn where they choose whether to plant corn after corn or rotate with soybeans. The difference in the intercepts in columns (1) and (2) indicates that on average corn is more likely to be planted if the field was previously planted to soybeans rather than corn.\nA large amount of rainfall in the spring tends to decrease the probability of planting corn-especially when soybeans were planted previously-because wet field conditions can delay corn planting. This partly explains the prevalence of soybeans after soybeans even though soybeans are generally considered less profitable than corn. The coefficients on the clay and silt content of the soil differ greatly between MLRAs (a large standard deviation), with the sign of the coefficient often differing between MLRAs. This result likely reflects nonlinear effects of the soil variables. For example, the effect of higher than average clay content in an MLRA with soils that have a large clay content may be different than the effect of higher than average clay content in an MLRA with soils that have a small clay content. Fields with greater slope have a lower probability of planting corn. Fields in a county with more irrigation were more likely to plant corn. However, the average coefficients for irrigation have large standard errors, perhaps because most counties in this region have little irrigation. The coefficient on the trend indicates that the probability of planting corn is increasing over time, holding prices constant; but the trend differs across space. The positive trend in planting corn if the field was previously planted to corn is consistent with the evidence reported by Duffy (2011) that the yield advantage of rotating corn and soybeans has been diminishing over time. (14) and (15), but impose the same coefficients across all fields. Results in columns (2)- (4) are from a linear probability model with a single lagged dependent variable as in equation (22) Results in columns (1) and (2) are similar indicating that there is a small difference in aggregate results if we estimate transition probabilities or a model with a lagged dependent variable. However, the elasticities in columns (1) and (2) the difference in the short-run and long-run elasticity because they do not fully account for the correlation between the coefficient on price and the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable.

These two concepts differ when the coefficients are correlated. For example, fields that are likely to maintain a corn-soybean rotation would have a coefficient on the lagged dependent variable that is close to -1 and a coefficient on price that is close to zero, whereas fields that are more likely to switch to monoculture have a smaller coefficient on the lagged dependent variable and larger coefficient on price. If an estimator does not allow coefficients to differ between these two types of fields, then the estimator overstates the difference between the short-run and long-run effect."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with Aggregate Panel Data", "text": "Aggregation of heterogeneous dynamic micro units can produce macro data with more persistence than the persistence of the average micro unit. Granger (1980) shows that the sum of heterogeneous AR(1) processes can produce a series with long memory. Trivedi (1985) , Lewbel (1994), and Zaffaroni (2004) provide generalizations of this result. Empirically, this aggregation phenomenon has been used to explain univariate puzzles such as the persistent deviations of real exchange rates from purchasing power parity (Carvalho and Nechio 2011; Imbs et al. 2005 ) and the persistence of aggregate inflation (Altissimo, Mojon, and Zaffaroni 2009) .\nIn this section, we illustrate a different effect of aggregation-aggregation affects the bias of dynamic panel estimators due to coefficient heterogeneity. Pesaran and Smith (1995) show that the bias of pooled estimators in dynamic panels with heterogeneous coefficients depends on the degree of heterogeneity, the strength of the autocorrelation in the explanatory variables, and the variation of the explanatory variable relative to the variation of the noise (i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio). Aggregation will tend to reduce parameter heterogeneity, and thus reduce bias. However, aggregation will also increase the explanatory power of common factors (Granger 1987) , and thus increase the signal-to-noise ratio and the bias from heterogeneous coefficients. 22 Aggregation will tend to increase the bias from heterogeneous coefficients when the panels represent aggregates over similar micro units since aggregation has a minimal effect on reducing parameter heterogeneity, but increases the explanatory power of common factors.\nAggregation of corn and soybean acreage to the county level has a small effect on parameter heterogeneity due to the spatial autocorrelation of soils and climate. Aggregation does change the relative explanatory power of the variables. For example, the previous crop explains a large proportion of the variation in planting decisions at the field level. At the county level, the previous acreage planted to corn explains less of the variation in corn acreage while common factors, such as prices, explain a larger proportion of the variation in corn acreage. Thus, aggregation to the county level inflates the bias from coefficient heterogeneity since aggregation increases the explanatory power of autocorrelated common factors without substantially reducing parameter heterogeneity. The dependent variable is the acres planted to corn divided by the average number of acres planted to corn or soybeans for that county during the sample period. The normalization is needed since actual corn acreage depends largely on the size of the county. The dependent variable is a proportion, which is the aggregate analog of the linearly probability model. (3) and (4) are from the Arellano-Bond estimator (i.e., difference GMM) and results in column (5) are from the Blundell-Bond estimator (i.e., system GMM). In column (3) we use a maximum of 5 lags as instruments and in (4) and (5) we use all lags available as instruments. All of the results in table 5 are pooled estimates with a single lagged dependent variable, so the relative difference in the long-run and short-run\nis simply the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable.\nThe fixed effects result in column (1) of table 5 shows that the bias from ignoring coefficient heterogeneity is so large that pooled estimates indicate the response to a price shock is smaller in the short run than in the long run-thus, creating the illusion of partial adjustment. The fixed effects estimator gives a coefficient on the lagged dependent variable of 0.19 with county-level data. For comparison, the analogous estimate with field-level data using conditional grouped coefficients is \u22120.39. 24 Furthermore, standard theory that assumes only the intercept is heterogeneous would expect the positive coefficient in table 5 to underestimate the true coefficient, when it actually substantially overestimates the true coefficient.\nThe positive bias of the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable occurs because it captures positive autocorrelation in prices and the trend. For example, if price response is larger in a particular county, then that county is also likely to have had a larger corn acreage in the previous year since prices are positively autocorrelated. There are also likely to be other common factors that are omitted from our analysis. These omitted common factors will have a small effect on estimates with field-level data since they explain a small proportion of the variation in field-level planting decisions. However, omitted common factors will have a larger effect on estimates with county-level data because they explain a larger proportion of the variation in aggregate crop acreage and there may be substantial heterogeneity in the response to these common factors across counties. "}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "To reinforce our point that aggregation over similar fields is the cause of the bias in county-level estimates, we create pseudo counties by randomly assigning the fields in our sample to 100 different groups and aggregating within the groups. Because the groups are randomly assigned and include a large number of fields, the parameter heterogeneity is mostly removed by the aggregation. Pooled OLS estimates with this group-level data give a negative coefficient on the lagged dependent variable (column 6 of table 5). The elasticities are similar, but slightly smaller than our conditional grouped coefficient estimates with fieldlevel data in table 2. The results from the randomly grouped data provide evidence that the difference in estimates with county-level and field-level data is mostly due to the bias from heterogeneous responses to autocorrelated factors rather than the aggregation of dynamic processes per se."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This article provides estimates of short-run and long-run elasticities of supply for corn and soybeans, the crops with more acreage than any other in the United States. These supply elasticities are central for understanding world food prospects and the environmental consequences of land use change, which have garnered substantial attention recently due to expanding ethanol production. We use more than 8 million observations that include every field in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana over an 11 year period-these three states produce roughly 15% of the world's corn and soybeans. Our analysis of supply response exploits recent demand shocks in corn and soybean prices caused by strong global commodity demand and the U.S. policy to convert corn to ethanol for fuel use (Carter, Rausser, and Smith 2013) .\nWe show that field-level dynamics imply that aggregate acreage of a crop responds to price shocks more in the short run than in the long run when that crop is grown in rotation with another crop. For corn and soybeans, we estimate that the short-run elasticity of planted-acreage with respect to price exceeds its long-run counterpart by 37 percent. Our results differ from all previous estimates because we use a rich set of field-level data to appropriately model the dynamics of cropping decisions from crop rotations and account for coefficient heterogeneity across space.\nWe estimate an own-price elasticity of 0.29 and a cross-price elasticity of -0.22 for corn acreage in the long run. Our estimates for the Corn Belt indicate that almost all of the acreage response to price occurs through substitution between corn and soybeans, rather than changes in the total acreage planted to corn or soybeans. Roberts and Schlenker (2013) also estimate a small extensive margin response of corn, soybean, wheat, and rice acreage (taken together) to price in the United States as a whole. After accounting for set-aside programs, they find a statistically insignificant extensive margin response to price (see their   table 3) . Barr et al. (2011) also estimate a small price elasticity of the total acreage of major crops in the United States as a whole."}, {"section_title": "27", "text": "An important topic for future research is to extend our methods to understand supply response dynamics in other production regions of the United States and the world. Research using crop data from satellite imagery is rapidly becoming feasible for other regions.\nFor example, the Cropland Data Layer has been made available for the continental United\nStates since 2008. Future research could also analyze the dynamics of aggregate supply resulting from different dynamics in different regions. Another topic for future research is to incorporate forward-looking price expectations into the conceptual and econometric models.\nWe also illustrate that heterogeneity in the response to autocorrelated factors can create the illusion of partial adjustment or inertia in dynamic panel estimates. We obtain the expected result that the short-run response to price is larger than the long-run response using field-level data and accounting for coefficient heterogeneity using Major Land Resource Areas. Using county-level data, results from popular dynamic panel estimators support the partial adjustment model. The bias from coefficient heterogeneity is amplified with county-level data because prices explain a greater proportion of variation in corn acreage at the county level and parameter heterogeneity persists at the county level due to spatial autocorrelation. These results suggest that caution is warranted when inferring inertia from dynamic panel estimators, especially when panels represent aggregates across correlated micro units."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "1 We define the long run as 5-10 years. Given a sample period of 11 years, we do not claim to estimate responses with an even longer horizon.\n2 The planted acreage elasticity is not the same as the supply elasticity if average yields are affected by price, but Berry and Schlenker (2011) estimate yield-price elasticities near zero for the United States.\n3 A long time series of crop data is available for the United States, but acreage decisions were highly distorted by government policies prior to the 1996 Farm Bill, suggesting caution about estimating parameters useful for current applications from the long time series.\n4 These assumptions simplify the conceptual model so that (i) we can solve the model for an individual field rather than at the farm level and (ii) the optimal cropping decision is a repeating crop rotation.\n5 We could relax this assumption slightly by assuming that harvest-time prices are iid random and the planting-time expectation of harvest prices is constant across years. Introducing more general forms of price uncertainty creates an option value in the rotation decision that we ignore here for simplicity.\n6 Note that cs is equivalent to sc .\n7 We could instead conceptualize yield as containing an iid random component and define y j i (\u00b7) to be the expected yield functions. To retain the simplicity of our solution, this conceptualization would require yield to be independent of price or the covariance between yield and price to be constant. i is optimal input use when planting corn after corn. 10 The assumption in figure 1 is that if other land uses are converted to corn or soybeans, then these fields are planted to continuous soybeans. Of course, other land uses may also be converted to plant corn-soybeans or continuous corn. Our empirical results indicate that most of the changes in corn and soybean acreage occurs between corn and soybeans so that is the focus of the model here.\n11 In the case of two-year memory, the difference between the short-run and long-run response also occurs due to fields converting from a corn-soybean rotation to a corn-corn-soybean rotation. All fields that switch from corn-soybeans to corn-corn-soybeans due to an increase in the relative price are planted to corn in the short run, but in the long run only 2/3 of these fields are planted to corn.\n12 The Cropland Data Layer can be viewed and downloaded at http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/.\nFor details on the methodology of constructing the Cropland Data Layer see Boryan et al.

In this case, basis refers to the difference between the local price at harvest time and the expiring futures price, which typically represents a price along the Illinois River.\n15 Monthly price data for our sample period are only available for Iowa. We obtain these data from NASS. 16 In 2008, corn after corn increased again, not because more fields shifted to a continuous corn rotation, but because half of the fields that shifted from corn-soybeans to corn-corn-soybeans or continuous corn were soybeans in 2006 so they did not plant corn after corn until 2008. 17 Aggregating our field-level dataset-including CLUs less than 15 acres-we obtain corn and soybean acreage similar to official NASS data, but underestimate the acreage of other crops.\n18 Another method is to specify a dynamic nested logit model, but this specification is likely to unnecessarily complicate the estimation since the extensive margin response is small.\n19 At the extensive margin, some bootstrap replications indicate that the relative difference between the short-run and long-run elasticities,\n, is outside the unit circle. Thus, we report the standard error on the relative difference in elasticities at the extensive margin as the standard deviation of bootstrap replications after trimming those replications outside of the unit circle.\n20 According to crop budgets from University of Illinois extension services, the return from corn after soybeans was roughly $50-125 more per acre than soybeans after corn in 2012. The 2012 crop budgets are available at http://www.farmdoc.illinois.edu/manage/2012_crop_budgets.pdf.\n21 For those fields that were never planted to monoculture, the estimated short-run and long-run marginal effects are zero. 22 We replicate the bias formulas of Pesaran and Smith (1995) and formalize this intuition in the supplementary online appendix.\n23 There were 11 counties that only had data available for a portion of the sample period. If we include these counties in the analysis, then the fixed effects estimate of the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is biased upward even further.\n24 Pooled fixed effects with field-level data and a single lagged dependent variable gives a coefficient on the lagged dependent variable of \u22120.68 (table 4) . However, we argue that the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in pooled fixed effects is likely biased downward with field-level data. The histograms show how short-run marginal effects and dynamics vary across fields from estimates of the linear Markov transition probability models as specified in equations (14) and (15). The histograms show marginal effects across the Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) for those fields that were planted to monoculture at least once. For those fields that were never planted to monoculture, the estimated short-run and long-run marginal effects are zero. The histograms represent the distribution of field-specific marginal effects from equations (20) and (21) Notes: Panel A gives descriptive statistics for the rotational margin sample-observations (field-year pairs) that were classified as corn or soybeans in two consecutive years. A field was never planted to monoculture if corn after corn and soybeans after soybeans were never observed. Panel B gives descriptive statistics for the extensive margin sample-observations that were classified as a crop but where the field was classified as corn or soybeans at least once during the sample period and for which there is a crop observed in two consecutive years.

Results in column (1) are from linear Markov transition probability models as specified in equations (14) and (15).
