[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The accurate and timely diagnosis of infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, MERS, SARS, COVID-19, tuberculosis and influenza A is indispensable for controlling public health. Early and accurate diagnosis and control of these diseases are necessary to reduce mortality, morbidity and preventing their development into epidemics [1] .\nDespite the existence of numerous diagnostic systems, current technologies have failed to meet some needs like PoC clinical settings, high throughput screening, rapid tests and high-resolution detection of different pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and parasites). Additionally, most of the traditional well-established laboratory techniques require large volumes of input samples and biochemical reagents, high accurate biosensors and trained personnel performing assays. Furthermore, sample collection from patients, transferring them to centralized laboratories to be analyzed and sending the test results back to clinicians are sometimes so expensive and time-consuming procedures that patients might lose their opportunity for treatment [1] .\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for rapid and high precision devices to control infectious diseases and as seen in Table 1 , various groups made effort to meet these requirements using different technologies. Some groups [2, 3] took advantage of graphene field-effect transistors (Gr-FETs) such as the device shown in Figure 1a where the gates of the transistors are made up of graphene sheets. Cardean Bio Inc. has also announced its interest to extend its CRISPR chip for COVID-19 testings and target two genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (E gene and RdRP gene) simultaneously, utilizing a multiplexed microfluidic chip. Its CRISPR-chip is a nucleic acid amplification-free biosensing system which is developed with its proprietory graphene-based biology-gated transistor or Cardean transistor [4] [5] [6] [7] . A printed circuit board (PCB)-based electrochemical device is also reported by Mahari et al. [8] employing disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes. A nucleic acid amplification free optical biosensor is presented by Qui et al. [9, 10] combining localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect. Besides, MEMEMICS Biotechnologies Inc. declared the potential of its Bluetooth-connected PoC device to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated antibodies from nasal swabs or whole blood [11, 12] . Roswell Biotechnologies Inc. and Imec have also announced their partnership to develop a sensor for DNA sequencing which is compatible with modern CMOS chips [13] . In another effort, Cepheid which is well-known in the MEMS community developed a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test cartridge named Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [14, 15] . Jeong et al. [16, 17] claimed to make the first wearable device (illustrated in Figure 1b ) which can continuously track key symptoms of the disease such as cough frequency, sound or intensity as well as respiratory rate. Additionally, some smartphone-based devices [18] [19] [20] [21] have been designed for controlling this disease. Table 1 .

CMOS technology is a technology for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips which takes advantage of both n-type and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). This cutting-edge technology has attracted huge investments for efficient mass production of different platforms including microelectronic devices whose costs can be affordable for the end-users. As seen in Table 2 , CMOS technology has many advantages that can overshadow its demerits. High levels of integration with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) due to the reduced external noises and parasites, excellent temperature stability and extremely large fan-out capability are some of the benefits of this technology. Although it is slower than bipolar technology, its power consumption is lower and has a good speed to power ratio [22, 23] . Table 2 . Advantages and disadvantages of CMOS technology."}, {"section_title": "Advantages Disadvantages", "text": "-Very high levels of integration -Using both p-channel and n-channel devices -Low power -Good speed to power ratio -Fully restored logic levels -Rise and fall transition times of the same order -Very high noise-immunity and noise-margin -Extremely large fan-out capability -Excellent temperature stability and working over a wide temperature range -Low supply voltage ranges -Large logic swing -Susceptible to damage by static electricity(it can be rectified by built-in protective devices or circuits) -Slower than bipolar technology -Leading-edge processes are not characterized for analog circuit design -In the scaling process, some second-order device characteristics, such as subthreshold operation, are usually paid less attention -Relatively high mismatch in CMOS devices Furthermore, CMOS technology offers the striking features of high accuracy, short time workflow, multiplexing and parallel detection of a series of parameters as well as high throughput measurements of infectious agents. Also, a CMOS sensor with a micro-or nano-electrode array can detect pathogens with a low limit of detection (LoD) and paves the way for accurate diagnosis of diseases. For instance, an LoD of 10-100 colony-forming unit (CFU) is sometimes required for the diagnosis of infectious agents like dangerous bacteria and CMOS technology enables to implement microelectrodes with almost the same size as the agent, (for example 1\u00b5m for bacteria) which helps to detect or count it in an appropriate range of LoD [24] .\nA growing body of literature [25] [26] [27] [28] has studied the applications of CMOS technology to fight against infectious diseases. CMOS-based PoC devices are among the most useful platforms which can make testing procedures more patient-friendly, less expensive and even more efficient. Specifically, the PoC test platforms utilizing LoC technologies can measure various biomarkers automatically and even simultaneously in less time than laboratory-based tests [29] . Additionally, using CMOS technology along with microfluidics and MEMS allows for sample preparation, actuation, biosensing, data processing and control on a portable and fully automated platform. Furthermore, the required electronic instruments for PoC tests can be adapted to mobile or resource-limited settings and the health-related data obtained using such devices can be collected and sent to health centers through the internet.\nAfter the outbreak of some infectious diseases like SARS and COVID-19, border-control devices like infrared thermography (IRT) systems have also attracted the attention of some researchers to rapidly mass-screen febrile infected individuals without contact [30] . CMOS technology can help to increase the accuracy of these systems.\nSeveral molecular-and cellular-based assays have been developed for the detection of infectious agents. Popular techniques for detecting pathogens are culture and colony counting, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunological methods like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [31, 32] . Culturing is the oldest and most reliable technique which is time-consuming and requires trained personnel to complete the test procedures. Additionally, DNA detection is an important molecular method that has been widely used for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and PCR is a popular technique in this field which is based on the extraction of a very small sample of DNA strands and selective amplification of them using specific primers. This technique requires thermal cycling and annealing steps for pre-enrichment and manipulation of DNA [33] . The requirement of a trained person, non-portability, expensive device and difficulties in the quantification of products are some of the limitations of PCR technique which have led to the development of quantitative PCR (qPCR) and real-time PCR to both amplify and detect a DNA, simultaneously. These techniques have the advantages of minimal amount quantification, real-time amplification and rapid detection [27] .\nImmunological techniques are other biochemical tests useful for the measurement of the presence or concentration of a pathogen in a solution through the use of the selectivity of antibody-antigen interaction. The combination of these techniques and other sensory systems can provide a complete self-contained detection package [33] . For example, ELISA systems, which are widely used for bio-clinical applications, take advantage of the sensitivity of enzymatic detection and selectivity of antibodies [31] . A photospectrometric instrument in these systems enables to analyze the colorimetric change caused by the concentration of target bio-particles affected by the immune reaction. Despite its high sensitivity, specificity, multiplexed and high throughput properties, this technique is a step-by-step laborious procedure requiring expert knowledge and a significant amount of time for sample preparation and analysis. Alternatively, immunochromatography, as a combination of chromatography and immunoassay, is a rapid, one-step assay [34] . Some of these approaches can be miniaturized and even improved by using advanced CMOS-based sensors.\nThis paper is an overview of various CMOS-based devices reported for the diagnosis and control of various infectious diseases (arising from different air-, vector-, blood-, and food-borne infectious agents). Various types of biosensors have been developed for biological and chemical sensing which can be useful for the diagnosis of infectious agents. These biosensors might be based on optical [35, 36] , electrochemical [37, 38] , magnetic [39] or mechanical [40] sensing modalities which can be developed by CMOS technology.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section is dedicated to the applications of CMOS-based optical devices for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In the third section, different types of CMOS-based electrochemical biosensors reported for these applications are reviewed. The other biosensors like magnetic and mechanical biosensors implemented by using CMOS technology are discussed in the fourth section followed by a conclusion in the final section."}, {"section_title": "Optical Techniques", "text": "Optical sensing is the most popular technique for biosensing applications due to their reusability, rapid measurement and high sensitivity. As seen in Table 3 , various CMOS-based optical devices have been reported for the diagnosis of different infectious agents.\nDevelopment of CMOS image sensors (CISs) has led some authors like Wang et al. [41] , P\u00e9rez et al. [42] , Bishara et al. [43] , Moon et al. [44] , sun et al. [30] and many others to investigate the application of CMOS-based imaging techniques for detecting the agents or even the symptoms of infectious diseases. In comparison to other image sensors like charge-coupled devices (CCD), CISs can be integrated with other processing circuits, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and control systems. Although the quality of the image captured by CISs falls short of that by CCD sensors, some successful experimental results prove that CISs can provide high sensitivity, high specificity, low power dissipation, operational simplicity, short time to results and cost-effectiveness [45] . Additionally, CMOS technology allows substituting expensive laser sources with more economic light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\nIt is also noteworthy that smartphones are powerful platforms to develop portable, low-cost, and readily accessible alternatives to conduct a variety of detection tests [35, [46] [47] [48] [49] , especially due to their high-quality and multifunctional camera which can detect chemiluminometric, colorimetric or fluorometric signals produced from biosensors.\nHowever, most optical techniques require labeling processes that are cost-and time-consuming and in some cases might affect the interaction between target molecules and the probe [50] . Also, most optical biosensors need costly and bulky instruments such as optical scanner systems consisting of light sources, lenses and cameras hindering the miniaturization of the systems [40] .\nThe last few years have witnessed a huge growth in the development of various compact on-chip imaging approaches such as holographic microscopy, contact shadow imaging, fluorescent on-chip microscopy which can replace conventional lens-based microscopes and be more appropriate for LoC applications [51] . Some of the reported optical techniques have removed the need for labeling in in-vitro diagnosis.

Fluorescence-based biosensors work based on monitoring the frequency changes of this radiation [66] . There are three types of fluorescence sensing: (1) direct sensing in which specific target biospecies could be detected directly before and after a change or reaction without a labeling tag which requires a high-speed image sensor; (2) indirect biosensing in which an added dye (like green fluorescent protein) helps to transduce the presence of the target; (3) fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) in which two paired fluorophores with overlapped emission and excitation wavelengths are placed within about few Angstroms from each other and the excitation of one of them stimulates the fluorescence of the pairing one and a unique fluorescence signal is generated [66, 67] .\nAs shown in Figure 2a , a transducer such as a photo-detector transduces the emitted signal in fluorescence detection to an electrical signal like voltage or current.

For the integration of the fluorescence module into a CMOS chip, the metal layers above the photo-detector should not block the optical signal. Also, if the intensity of the excitation signal is stronger than the fluorescent signal, it can lead to the saturation of the photo-detector and malfunction of the system [67] . Jang et al.

[70] reported a fully integrated CMOS fluorescence biosensor with an on-chip nanophotonic filter. Ho et al. [53] developed a spectrally-multiplexed fluorescence contact imaging microsystem for DNA analysis. In this system, a CMOS color photogate sensor (see Figure 2b ) utilizing the polysilicon gate as an optical filter is integrated into the microsystem and detects and differentiates among multiple emission bands (green and red light) of fluorescent biomarkers without a bank of emission filters. The capability of multi-color imaging led to the simultaneous detection of two DNA targets with the LoD of 240 nM and 210 nM for the marker gene sequences of spinal muscular atrophy disease and Escherichia coli (E. coli), respectively (see Table 3 ). Ho et al. [53] developed a spectrally-multiplexed fluorescence contact imaging microsystem for DNA analysis.

The capability of multi-color imaging led to the simultaneous detection of two DNA targets with the LoD of 240 nM and 210 nM for the marker gene sequences of spinal muscular atrophy disease and Escherichia coli (E. coli), respectively (see Table 3 ).\nIn another effort, Song et al. [52] reported a field-usable biochip system as shown in Figure 2c which works based on a miniature CMOS sensor microarray by combining ELISA and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques to detect a single intact Bacillus globigii (B. globigii) spore.\nAn antibody-immobilized capillary reactor was used to detect bacteria. Enzymatic amplification following immunocomplex formation removed the need for a bulky optical system to achieve high sensitivity levels. As seen in Figure 2c , a diode laser beam that is focused onto the detection window of the antibody-immobilized capillary reactor by a lens, excites the enzymatic product. Multiplex antibody-immobilized capillary reactors increased the high throughput for B. globigii spores detection and a side-entry laser beam irradiation allows for the simultaneous excitation of four multiplex antibody-immobilized capillary reactors. The fluorescence emission from the reactor was collected at right angles by a microscope objective lens and focused onto a photodiode of the CMOS microchip. Optical mirrors helped to compact the collected fluorescence emission path and the bandpass filter removed the diode laser scattering.\nIn another work, Zeinhom et al. [35] proposed a smartphone-based fluorescence imager with a sandwich immunosensor for E. coli O157:H7 detection which could provide low-background noise image and good sensitivity. The imager utilized a long-pass thin-film interference filter, a compact laser-diode-based photo source, and high-quality insert lenses. The external lens collected the fluorescence emission from the sample and the CMOS sensor chip and the built-in lens on the cell phone recorded the magnified fluorescent images. Like other smartphone-based devices, this device also needs afterward image processing. The whole process could be completed within two hours and the experimental results demonstrated that this device could provide an LoD down to 1 CFU/mL (Table 3 ). In another effort, Natesan et al. [48] used a smartphone fluorescent reader and a flow cell assay cartridge for the telemonitoring of infections caused by Ebola and Marburg filoviruses. The reader was utilized to detect and analyze antibody binding to twelve essential antigens from the filoviruses arranged in a microarray on a microfluidic chip. An opto-electro-mechanical hardware attachment in the smartphone reader helped to handle the operation, collect test results and communicate with cloud service.\nLateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) is a simple technique useful for qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of various biomarkers such as antigens, antibodies and even the products of nucleic-acid-amplification tests. LFIA requires an electronic reader for the detection of low concentrations by reading the intensity of the color test line. The camera of a mobile phone is the most common electronic reader used for LFIA to take a photograph of the strip and the quantification of the analyte in the sample. Different camera specifications as well as standardization and regulatory issues cause some limitations in the use of mobile phone-based readers. Additionally, the transmission of the images captured by image sensors through a data cable results in a poor quality of the images due to being exposed to air.\nIn an effort, Zheng et al. [54] used a CMOS transistor as the image sensor and developed a portable test strip reader (see Figure 3a ) for quantum dot (Qdot)-labeled urea-enzyme antibody-based rapid immunochromatographic test strips to detect Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori). The reader is integrated with a Wi-Fi module and can be run on tablet PCs without the need for an AC power supply. The 3D printed cartridge of the LFIA was used for this reader. A barcode scanner loaded the barcode printed on the strip containing the patient information and the acquired images were processed by a Kmeans clustering algorithm. Another approach is using a single photodiode at the position of the test line. However, this approach is susceptible to displacement errors. Pilavaki et al. [56] reported a CIS for LFIA readers containing 4 \u00d7 64 pixels in contrast to a mobile phone image sensor with million pixels. This reader takes advantage of a single low power processing capacitive transimpedance amplifier with noise cancellation (Figure 3b ). Low power consumption (21 \u00b5W), low total output referred noise (1.9 mV rms ) and high SNR are some main features of this reader. Additionally, this system does not require any moving parts and optical accessories. Experiments showed that this LFIA system is able of detecting influenza A nucleoprotein with concentrations from 0.5 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL (see Table 3 ). In addition to some CMOS-compatible PCR chips reported in the literature [71, 72] , some scientists have focused on doing qPCR approach by using CMOS-based devices. For example, Norian et al. [28] used microfluidics and 0.35 \u00b5m high-voltage CMOS technology to perform all the functions required for qPCR including fluorescence detection, heating, temperature control and steering the fluid sample. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWoD)-based droplet transport, micron-scale polysilicon heaters and resistive aluminum (Al) temperature sensors were used instead of manual pipetting, Al heating block and a thermocouple, respectively. Additionally, integrated Geiger-mode single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) were utilized for the fluorescent detection of the PCR reaction. To perform qPCR, droplets of primers, DNA target and the PCR reagents (DNA polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and intercalator dye) were delivered to individual reservoirs (see Figure 4a ) and electrostatically drawn from each of them and mixed. The thermal cycling of the entire surface of the chip was based on a prescribed heating profile. For example, in the heating profile shown in Figure 4a , fluorescence reading after qPCR progression is taken using an integrated SPAD at Pixel (3, 7) . Figure 4b also shows the EWoD control circuitry. In this system, the temperature can be regulated to an accuracy of 0.45 \u00b0C and droplet generation and transport can be down to volumes less than 1.2 nanoliters. Dynamic range and sensitivity allow a single copy per droplet for the quantification of target DNA. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was used to demonstrate the performance of this device.\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as an alternative to the conventional PCR is suitable for the development of inexpensive, rapid, low power and portable systems with greater sensitivity and specificity for PoC diagnosis. Among various isothermal amplification methods, LAMP is a sequence-specific amplification technique that eliminates the need for the thermal cycler by utilizing a single displacing DNA polymerase enzyme. Shin et al. [46] combined different elements of the mobile phone hardware as well as droplet magnetofluidics for complete process integration of a sample-to-answer nucleic acid amplification testing assay from sample lysate to detection. They developed a magnetofluidics-assisted LAMP assay for nucleic acid target amplification and used magnetic particles as a mobile substrate to capture and transport nucleic acid. An embedded CMOS camera sensor is employed in this platform for optical signal acquisition, in which an LED illuminates the reaction chamber and the generated fluorescent signal by the reaction is relayed by a mirror and filtered and then magnified by a combination of an embedded camera lens on the phone and an external imaging lens before reaching the app-based user interface. Additionally, Bluetooth connectivity allows for wireless communication with the instrument's on-board microcontroller to automate and coordinate magnetofluidic actuation and thermal incubation.\nIn another effort, Priye et al.

This enabled manual control over the intensity of the collected signal. This chromaticity-luminance formulation was verified by simultaneous detection of chikungunya and Zika viral RNA via endpoint reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) as well as real-time LAMP detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) and demonstrated more reliability and accuracy than a conventional post-processed RGB (Red, green, and blue) analysis. In chemiluminescence, the chemiluminescent tags avert the external light source to excite the chemical reaction and prevent the saturation of the photodiode. So, a photodetector can detect the emitted chemiluminescent signals without an optical filter and the distance from the tag to the surface of the photodetector can be shortened enabling supercritical angle luminescence and efficient signal detection [67, 73] .

In this platform, the chemiluminescent signals were produced from the EoC and after being transferred into the image sensors, they were converted to electric signals on the detector. A traceable amount of the bacterium (4.22 \u00d7 10 3 CFU/mL) can be detected by this sensor. Furthermore, an immuno-magnetic separation device was introduced for the enrichment of the bacterium before the analysis which resulted in an additional 67-fold enhancement in the LoD (see Table 3 ).\nThe same group [49] used a CIS to fabricate a pocket-sized immunosensor for the detection of the Vibrio species, in a real sample. A smartphone was used to control and monitor the analysis and upload the results as data to the internet server.

[55] to create polysaccharide microarrays for analyzing antibodies with a CMOS-based electric signal readout process and using fluorescence or chemiluminescence based detection. This chip includes an array of silicon photodiodes. Unmodified pneumococcal polysaccharides from S. pneumonia are directly printed onto photodiode surfaces which is helpful for the measurement of anti-polysaccharide IgG antibodies in human blood serum.

The magnification caused by the diffraction effect of the shadow spreading is obvious in Figure 6b ,d. In comparison to shadow imaging in which the diffraction between the detector planes and the object is ignored or unprocessed, lens-free holographic devices used digital refocusing of object waves to image an object plane regardless of optical diffraction. The required lenses in traditional microscopy are actually replaced by a computer algorithm in holographic microscopy to reconstruct the original image from the recorded hologram [51] . Moon et al. [44] integrated microfluidics with a shadow imaging technique to target CD4 + T-lymphocyte counts for HIV PoC testing from whole blood (see Table 3 ). This platform can capture rare cells selectively by the immobilized anti-CD4 antibody on one side of the microfluidic chip, detect the captured cells rapidly by the imaging platform, and count cells automatically and enumerate CD4 + T-lymphocytes. Also, the same group [57] reported a lens-free imaging platform like Figure 6c to enumerate cell/E. coli to diagnose sepsis at resource-limited conditions. This platform can directly image the bottom surface of a microfluidic channel and shadow dots of Shadows of small objects are also used for holographic microscopy and on-chip shadow imaging [74] . In shadow imaging, any optically semi-transparent micro-object such as cells is directly placed on top of an optoelectronic image sensor and illuminated by an incoherently or partially coherent light source. The generated diffraction patterns give useful information about internal complexity, shape, refractive index or size of the targets. This technique provides the advantage of high throughput monitoring since it does not optically magnify the original optical plane where the target micro-objects are placed and can fully monitor the whole active imaging area [58] .

This platform can capture rare cells selectively by the immobilized anti-CD4 antibody on one side of the microfluidic chip, detect the captured cells rapidly by the imaging platform, and count cells automatically and enumerate CD4 + T-lymphocytes. Also, the same group [57] reported a lens-free imaging platform like Figure 6c to enumerate cell/E. coli to diagnose sepsis at resource-limited conditions. This platform can directly image the bottom surface of a microfluidic channel and shadow dots of captured cells are counted by automatic cell counting software. The smaller sizes of bacteria (diameter of 5 \u00b5m \u00d7 length of 2 \u00b5m for E. coli) make seeing their shadows more challenging than cells. The experiments showed the functionality of the platform to capture the target cells from 5 \u00b5l of blood by using specific antibodies and imaging E. coli by employing a 2.2 \u00b5m-pixel CMOS based imaging sensor (see Table 3 ).\nA lens-free CIS is proposed by Lee et al. [58] for the detection of pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) and S. typhimurium, which works based on shadow imaging and detects the colorimetric light signals in the ELISA process. It is a compact platform whose major components are an LED and a CIS. To achieve uniform illumination, a pinhole mask formed on a transparent plastic film is glued on top of the LED window. A commercial 96-well plate is located between the CIS and LED. A custom-made aperture cover with a 2 mm diameter hole array is located on top of the 96-well plate to minimize noise signal. Employing a multi-million-pixel photon collector led to a decrease in the noise signal from noise sources like light scattering through the transparent well plate walls, the dark current of the photon detector and unwanted particles in the sample solution.\nDevadhasan et al. [60] reported an immunodiagnostic system for detecting HIV which works based on HIV antigen-antibody reaction adsorbed on an indium nanoparticles (InNPs) substrate and photon counting using a CIS. The InNP substrate as a semi-transparent material can pass the photons consistently. The CIS captured the refracted photons by the InNP substrate while passing through it. This technique could overcome the non-specific interaction in label-free diagnostic systems. As seen in Table 3 , their sensor was capable of detecting HIV antigens less than 10 fg/mL. They used a similar approach in a CIS-based immunodetection system for HBV antigen-antibody reaction on InNP substrate [61] .\nIn another effort, the same group [27] presented a disposable CIS integrated with polypropylene wells to carry out LAMP assay for simultaneous and real-time amplification and detection of nucleic acid. The image sensor chip included 376 \u00d7 314 multi-pixel photon arrays with dual top headers and was connected to a 10-bit ADC. Two wells were fixed for the two sensor surfaces of the CMOS chip to carry out two parallel experiments which can help to reduce the reaction volume and cost. The image sensor captures the light passing through the sensor surface on top of which the LAMP reaction is carried out. Generally, when the photons are exposed to objects over the CMOS sensor, their number will be changed. The photodiodes in the image sensor capture and convert the photons into electrical energy via the photoelectric effect. The ADC converts the electrical energy to digital. During the LAMP reaction, magnesium pyrophosphate is generated and the LAMP sample color and the photon number are changed. During the amplification process, the photon number is reduced. During the LAMP reaction, the circuitry controller RS-232 provided an appropriate temperature for amplification and standard light intensity for photon detection. The analysis was carried out on the DNA of Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens), as the main pathogenic bacteria of enteric disease and gas gangrene ( Table 3 ). As mentioned in Table 3 , they achieved an LoD up to 1 fg/\u00b5L. In continuation of this work, the same group [41] used E. coli O157 (see Table 3 ) as their target to evaluate LoD and quantitative analysis of their system. Despite its good sensitivity and its potential for PoC assays, the system suffers from some shortcomings. The used red or blue LED as the light source affected the difference in the quantitative results. Additionally, some inconsistency was found with the detection of different analytes. Furthermore, every DNA sample requires a different reaction time [45] .\nInterferometer-based biosensors are among optical label-free biosensors measuring the change of the refractive index. By propagation of light through an optical waveguide, an evanescent field is created at the core/cladding interface extending into the surrounding area. If the waveguide surface is functionalized by biological recognition elements (REs), the sensing layer will change the refractive index profile [66] . Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) (see Figure 7) , Young's interferometer, Hartman interferometer and Backscattering interferometry are different types of such sensors [75] . For example, Ramirez-Priego et al. [65] used the first type to develop a nanophotonic PoC platform for noninvasive and direct detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in human urine samples for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. This sensor which is based on an MZI transducer is combined with an on-chip spectral filter. In a typical configuration of MZI transducer as depicted in Figure 7 , there are two branches one of which is functionalized and called the sensing arm and the other works as the reference arm. A Y-junction divides the guiding light into these two branches and another Y-junction recombines them. Then, the interference of the two branches with each other produces a sinusoidal change related to the refractive index variation of the surrounding medium. In the photonic sensor chip reported in [65] , a superluminescent diode (SLED) and a CMOS sensor were used as the light source and the signal readout device, respectively. Also, a graphical user interface and a pumping unit allow for real-time monitoring and controlling of fluid injection through the sensor cartridge. Monoclonal antibodies were functionalized against LAM to achieve suitable selectivity.\nMicromachines 2020, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 35 human urine samples for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons occurring on the surface of conducting material (like metal) at the interface of two media with dielectric constants of opposite signs which is illuminated by polarized light at a specific angle. This phenomenon generates surface plasmons and reduces the intensity of reflected light at a specific angle [75, 76] . The refractive index variation induced by molecular interactions is related to surface density or sample concentration which is useful for label-free detection [75] . If an RE is immobilized on conducting material surfaces to capture specific biospecies, the LoD of the system is influenced by the refractive index of the target, sample volume and transport properties, target immobilization method and practical device parameters [62] . There are four basic techniques to excite the SPR: (1) prism coupling, (2) waveguide coupling, (3) optical fiber coupling and (4) grating coupling [75] . For example, Tokel et al. [62] proposed an SPR platform using a rectangular prism (like Figure 8a ) which was integrated with microfluidics for the detection of E. coli and S. aureus. A CIS was used to capture the reflected light. In another effort, Wood et al.

Additionally, Soler et al.

This biosensor incorporates gold nanohole sensor arrays and works based on extraordinary optical transmission (EoT) which enables label-free and real-time detection and facilitates high-throughput analysis. Immobilization of specific antibodies on the individual arrays allows for selective detection of bacteria. EoT can be performed by using LEDs and CMOS imagers. Direct immunoassay of urine samples demonstrated an LoD of 1500 CFU/mL for N. gonorrhoeae and 300 CFU/mL for C. trachomatis.

[43] including a CMOS sensor, a color filter and 23 LEDs for the detection of malaria parasite infection in red blood cells (see Figure 9b) . A microcontroller controls the multiple fiber-optic waveguides, which are butt-coupled to LEDs, to sequentially illuminate the sample. Then, a digital sensor-array captures the holograms whose resolution will be improved by a pixel super-resolution algorithm.

As shown in Figure 9c , a programmable-array of LEDs coupled to optical fibers illuminates the substrate and a CIS records the hologram created due to the scattered optical wave from the viruses and the non-diffracted wave. Self-assembled polyethylene glycol based nanolenses around the viruses help to boost the optical signal from each virus particle and increase SNR. This platform is able to reconstruct both amplitude and phase information of the objects digitally from the diffraction patterns obtained by the image sensor chip.\nP\u00e9rez et al.

Figure 9d demonstrates the schematic of the system including an RGB fiber-coupled LED light source, a quartz flow cell, two ultrahigh contrast linear polarizers, an optical lens, a micro-lens array and a CMOS color image sensor. In this system, micro-lens arrays filtered the transmitted beam which led to the increased depth of field (DoF) and field of view (FoV). This system can retrieve sample information without complex digital transformations. A sensitivity of 50 cells/mL can be achieved. Pre-concentrating an initial sample volume of 500 mL with an ad-hoc fluidic system can increase the sensitivity to 0.2 cells/mL.

The gate electrodes of these kinds of FETs are covered with selective membranes (such as DNA-selective membranes, ion-selective, and enzyme-selective) which can modulate the gate voltage [33] . The traditional ISFETs, introduced by [94], did not have a poly-silicon gate which was not compatible with the standard CMOS process. Bausells et al.

The performance of this system is demonstrated by sequencing three bacterial genomes (Vibrio fischeri, E. coli and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (R. palustris)).\nIn ISFET based DNA sequencing, the unknown distribution of DNA-templated microbeads into microwell array can lead to false pH detection at empty microwells affected by the cross-talk from neighboring microbeads.

This biosensor demonstrated a short response time (~5 s), picomolar level-LoD (48.6 pM) in a broad dynamic range from 100 fM to 10 nM in diluted serum samples (Table 4 ).\nImpedimetric, conductometric and capacitive biosensors process the frequency-dependent parameters of analyte like impedance, conductance and capacitance, respectively [96] . Impedimetric technique offers real-time label-free detection by measuring the resistance, capacitance and inductance information in the sample at different frequencies. This technique is a powerful approach for the detection of some biospecies like virus DNA [79] and bacterial cell [97] by monitoring the impedance transformations that occur as a result of selective binding of the biospecies to REs. These systems need media calibration, washing steps and noble metal electrodes [33] . The interfacing of electrochemical biosensors, as shown by a general schematic in Figure 12a , require sensing electrodes which can be implemented on the top metal layer of CMOS technology.\nLai et al. [79] used non-faradaic impedimetric for the detection of pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV) oligonucleotides. In another effort, Couniot et al. [97] proposed a selectivity method by using lytic enzymes for impedimetric detection of whole-cell bacteria using atomic-layer-deposited (ALD)-Al 2 O 3 passivated microelectrodes. This group [38] developed a CMOS oscillator-based capacitance to frequency converter integrated with Al/Al 2 O 3 IDE which is suitable for whole bacterial cell detection in saline (high-conductive) buffers up to 575 MHz. Experiments by using Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) in physiological buffer verified the performance of this biosensor and after 20 min of bacterial incubation, it showed an LoD of 10 7 CFU/mL. The same group [80] reported a 16 \u00d7 16 capacitive biosensor whose readout interface which converted capacitance to voltage based on charge sharing. Real-time detection of S. epidermidis binding events using this sensor demonstrated sensitivity of 2.18 mV/bacterial cell and an LoD of 7 bacteria/pixel. A 16 \u00d7 20 array electrochemical biosensor was reported by Hsu et al. [87] in which a polar-mode measurement method, as depicted in Figure 12b , and in-pixel digitization and accumulation (averaging) was employed.\nmonitor the growth of bacteria in a medium. This sensor consists of a reference and a sensing IDE which are exposed to pure Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and E. coli suspended in the LB medium, respectively. They implemented the microfluidic channels using a direct-write fabrication process (DWFP) technique atop the electrodes. The experiments showed an LoD of 107 CFU/mL and a sensitivity of about 255 mV/fF (see Table 4 ). The same group [98] used bacteriophage as REs to detect Salmonella and E. coli and achieved a sensitivity of 29.3 mV/fF. In another effort, Yao et al. [88] used a conductometric approach for bacteriophage-based bacteria detection. In comparison to PCR and ELISA, the use of phages allows for a rapid and simple sensing scheme. Since no biochemical reaction is involved in bacteriophage-based bacteria detection Since the growth of bacteria forms capacitance variations in the proximity of the sensing electrodes, it can be monitored using a capacitive sensor. Ghafar-Zadeh et al. [26] proposed a core-CBCM (charge-based capacitance measurement) capacitive readout architecture technique to monitor the growth of bacteria in a medium. This sensor consists of a reference and a sensing IDE which are exposed to pure Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and E. coli suspended in the LB medium, respectively. They implemented the microfluidic channels using a direct-write fabrication process (DWFP) technique atop the electrodes.

[88] used a conductometric approach for bacteriophage-based bacteria detection. In comparison to PCR and ELISA, the use of phages allows for a rapid and simple sensing scheme. Since no biochemical reaction is involved in bacteriophage-based bacteria detection and no electrical charge is created, the amperometric method (explained in the next sub-section) is not suitable. On the other hand, the impedimetric method is complex. Conductometric method can be an alternative that only measures the resistance of the analyte between reference and working electrodes (RE and WE) and can be performed with DC stimulation. Yao et al. used T4 bacteriophages as REs to detect E. coli. Their sensor converts the sample resistance to frequency and a one-shot circuit is used to control the pulse-width of the output signal. This system is capable of monitoring bacteria with concentration ranging from 4 \u00d7 10 2 to 4 \u00d7 10 4 CFU/mL (see Table 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Other Electrochemical Techniques", "text": "Amperometric method measures the redox current generated during the reactions between the sample and the functionalized working electrode at a constant DC voltage. Similarly, a voltammetric sensor measures the current while the applied voltage is varied. The configuration of amperometric sensors is usually simpler to implement than impedimetric ones. However, this technique requires multiple steps to immobilize biological REs and provide redox currents as well as noble metals (like gold and platinum). Additionally, its specificity is affected by the interference from unknown chemicals [33] .\nNiitsu et al. [89] reported two types of electroless plated microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for direct bacteria and HeLa cell counting. A smaller size of these MEAs can make it possible to detect viruses (20-970 nm) . An amperometry circuit is also reported. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements by using the 4 \u00d7 4 array of 1.2 \u00d7 2.05 \u00b5m 2 -sized MEAs and the 16 \u00d7 16 array of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00b5m 2 -sized MEAs demonstrated the capability of these electroless-plated MEAs for the counting of bacterial-sized microbeads. For noise reduction, the same group [99] implemented a current integrator in conjunction with these bacterial-sized MEAs (see Figure 12c ). They demonstrated the performance of the 4 \u00d7 4 array of their amperometric CMOS-based sensor and achieved an SNR of 30.4 dB. Their sensor was suitable for the detection of a single bacterial cell and counting their number in the range of a single cell to approximately 10 6 cells. They developed their proposed sensor to a large-scale (1024 \u00d7 1024) array by employing two-2P3M 0.6 \u00b5m CMOS technology [24] . Nanowire (NW) biosensors have attracted the attention of some researchers due to their high sensitivity and fast responses [100] . For instance, Huang et al. [90] used poly-Si NW to implement a CMOS wireless biosensor system-on-chip (bio-SSoC) for biomolecular detection of both cTnI and HBV DNA. DNA hybridization on NW leads the electrons in n-type doped poly-Si NW to be repelled from the surface and consequently, the resistance of the NW reduces which can be used for quantification of the DNA in the sample.\nSun et al. [91] used a little-used technique called coulostatic discharge sensing for the detection of anti-Rubella and antiMumps antibodies in human serum and reported a 4096-pixel electrochemical biosensor array with IDEs surrounded by nanowells. The captured biospecies were transduced to a current and the sensor's innate double-layer capacitance was discharged and then the measurements were converted to a voltage signal by each pixel. The three-dimensional (3D) trenches formed by opening the passivation across the entire IDE between two electrodes amplified the signal and increased collection efficiency."}, {"section_title": "Other Techniques", "text": "There are also some other CMOS-based biosensors like mechanical (such as surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducer [101] and cantilever [40, 102] ) and NMR-based biosensors [103] , some of which are reported for the analysis of infectious diseases (as mentioned in Table 5 ). "}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Sensors", "text": "Magnetic biosensors detect the magnetism generated by the targets labeled with magnetic particles (see Figure 13a ). Since the magnetic field can penetrate the insulating layers, transducers and samples are not in direct contact. So, the hardware preparation of the chip would be simplified before the assay [67] . Magnetic-based platforms provide the advantages of high sensitivity and in contrast to electrochemical biosensors, there is no virtual background because most biological samples do not have strong magnetic properties. Additionally, the same magnetic labels can also be employed for magnetic manipulation during sample preparation in the integrated system [105] . Ease of manufacturing and a wide range of magnetic bead diameters (from 50 nm to 20 \u00b5m) pave the way for different assays [104] . While the smaller ones are useful for research immunology for cell separation, larger beads conjugated with antibodies can be used for the improvement of the performance of ELISA by the separation of target analytes. sound-card and a power amplifier, respectively, which induces the magnetic beads to produce local magnetic fields detectable by the sensor. In the DC washing mode, the electromagnet is powered by an adjustable power supply which can be used for removing specifically bound beads from the sensor surface. The experiments conducted on clinical serum samples verified the capability of this platform to capture the antigen of purified mouse IgG and detect human anti-dengue virus IgG. Mujika et al. [39] reported a magnetoresistive immunosensor integrated with microfluidics for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in food and clinical samples (see Figure 13b) . A giant magnetoresistive multilayer structure played the role of a sensing film. Silicon nitride was selected as the sensor surface coating for the immobilization of antibodies to react with target antigens. This sensor could sense the small magnetic field variations caused by the presence of superparamagnetic beads bound to the antigens. The microfluidic network was made of an SU-8 photoresist channel network and a stereolithographic-based technique was used for packaging. [39] , (c) Frequency-shift magnetic sensor sensing mechanism, (d) The disposable cartridge including an electrically connected magnetic-based biosensor chip inside a polypropylene well [105] .\nOne of the magnetic techniques reported for biosensing applications is CMOS frequency-shift based magnetic resonant sensing. These sensors include LC resonators. When a magnetic bead is close to the inductor of the resonator, the oscillation frequency is decreased which can be electronically measured by counting the number of cycles over a fixed time interval. Pai et al. [105] proposed a frequency-shift based magnetic sensor for the detection of antigen and nucleic acid (see Figure 13c ,d). The sensitivity of this sensor was increased by a noise reduction technique, CDS. They [39] , (c) Frequency-shift magnetic sensor sensing mechanism, (d) The disposable cartridge including an electrically connected magnetic-based biosensor chip inside a polypropylene well [105] .\nTo convert the sensed magnetism to an electrical signal, different transducers have been reported. Hall sensor as a fully CMOS-compatible device can be made of n-type silicon and convert the magnetic field to current or voltage signals. Based on Hall effect, the current carriers in a semiconductor can be deflected with the current flowing orthogonal to a magnetic field which applies a Lorentz force to the current carriers. So, charge deflection allows electronic detection [67] . A CMOS-based magnetic bead bioassay platform is reported by Aytur et al. [104] which is used for infectious disease diagnosis by immunological recognition similar to ELISA. The sensor chip contained a 1024-element array of Hall sensors which were bonded to a 25 \u00d7 15 mm 2 -PCB (see Table 5 ). A gold-plated 150-\u00b5L well on the PCB with a small hole at the bottom makes it possible to expose the sensor surface array to sample fluid. The biosensor is placed into the gap of a custom electromagnet core which can be operated in either an AC measurement mode or a DC washing mode. In the AC measurement mode, an excitation signal is generated and amplified by the laptop sound-card and a power amplifier, respectively, which induces the magnetic beads to produce local magnetic fields detectable by the sensor. In the DC washing mode, the electromagnet is powered by an adjustable power supply which can be used for removing specifically bound beads from the sensor surface.

Pai et al. [105] proposed a frequency-shift based magnetic sensor for the detection of antigen and nucleic acid (see Figure 13c ,d). The sensitivity of this sensor was increased by a noise reduction technique, CDS. They also proposed a magnetic freezing technique that neutralized the effect of magnetic beads on the sensor by saturating the magnetization of the beads with a small permanent magnet. By this technique, there was no need for a baseline measurement before the experimental assay, the SNR was enhanced, all the measurements could be done after the biological assay and the measurement time was reduced. The entire functionality of the sensor was integrated onto a reader PCB and a disposable open-well cartridge combined all sensor sites in a single reaction well without the need for microfluidic structure and pumps. The experiments showed this sensor can detect a 31 bp DNA oligomer with the concentration from 100 pM to 10 nM as well as an interferon-\u03b3 protein (relevant for tuberculosis diagnostics) with the concentration between 1 pM and 30 pM (see Table 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Mechanical Sensors", "text": "Surface-stress mechanical sensors are among the popular mechanical sensors used for biosensing. Binding of biomolecules to the functionalized surface of a miniature mechanical device, usually a cantilever, results in a measurable deflection of the device useful for sensing the concentration of the analyte (see Figure 14a ). The cantilever might be designed for a static or a dynamic mode. In the former, only one surface of the cantilever is functionalized and can bend statically in one direction. In the latter, the entire cantilever is utilized to capture the targets and the attached mass affects its resonant frequency. So, based on the type of the sensor, resonant frequency [101] , resistance [40] , or optical [107] deflection of the cantilever [67] can be used for the detection of the attached mass.\nHaung et al.
