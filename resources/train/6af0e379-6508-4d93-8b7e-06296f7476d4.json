Notwithstanding the contribution of these studies, there seems to be a scarcity of literature regarding the impact of the life cycle on the disparity in farm household wealth. Given the significance of wealth to economic well-being and to social welfare (see OECD 1998) , the main objective of this paper is to examine the wealth inequality of U.S. sole proprietor households -both farm and non-farm households--over the 2013 and 2016 time periods. The analysis, which allows for the measurement and for the partitioning of economic disparity and of social welfare function in the context of the life-cycle will be based on a method of decomposing welfare disparity as was initially developed by Podder (1993) and later applied, among others, by Mukhopadhaya (2002) , and by El-Osta and Morehart (2009) . Embedding social welfare function in the analysis builds upon the economic welfare literature (see Atkinson 1970; Dasgupta et al. 1973; Willig 1981; Shorrocks 1983 ) that assume that policy makers aim, depending on the chosen measure of wellbeing, for higher levels (efficiency preference) and for greater equality in the distribution of that measure (equity preference). The analysis will be based on pertinent demographic and financial information from two national databases: The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). In examining the distribution of wealth among farm and non-farm sole proprietor households in 2013 and 2016, this allows for the discernment if wealth disparity has widened over the short time-period considered.\nAmong the main characteristics that define households in general thus is that they tend to earn more and accumulate less in wealth in the early life-stages of heads of household, with the trend reversing in the later stages of the life cycle. 2 For example, and as in the case of total wealth (i.e., net worth) in the U.S., those households headed by adults under the age of 35 had a median wealth of about $11,000 in 2016; which was about 5 percent of the median wealth of about $236,000 for those households headed by adults aged 65 or older. 3 In terms of accumulated wealth, while the share of all the wealth held in the general population by households in the younger age group in 2016 was 2.3 percent, the share held by households in the older age group, in comparison, was at 39 percent. Similarly, farm households with operators aged 34 or younger tend to own significantly lower levels of wealth than their counterparts with operators aged 65 or older. For instance, in 2016, the median wealth of the younger-aged households was $246,000; which was about 27 percent of the median wealth of about $900,000 for those households with operators aged 65 or older. 4 For the younger-aged farm households, while their share of all of the accumulated wealth was under 2 percent, the share held by households in the older age group, in comparison, was at about 41 percent."}, {"section_title": "Data and Measurement", "text": "Data on household wealth from the SCF and the ARMS for 2013 and 2016 provided the samples needed in the analysis. 5 The SCF is a triennial cross-sectional survey of the finances of U.S. families that has been undertaken by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System since 1983 (Bricker et al. 2017) . Sample weights created for the SCF allow for the expansion of financial estimates to the U.S. household population level in a given survey year (see Lindamood et al. 2007 ).\nThe aim of the paper is to formulate comparable samples of farm and non-farm self-proprietor households. In the SCF, self-proprietorship status results from two questions that ask, respectively, whether the head of household is self-employed and is actively involved in the management of the business. Excluding households that operate farms along with those households where the heads have passive roles in the management of the selected businesses from the 2013 and 2016 SCF samples, and utilizing corresponding sample survey weights (W i ), the number of sole proprietor households stood at 7.9 million and 8.3 million, respectively. In 2016, the 8.3 million sole proprietor households, while they represented 6.6 percent of all non-farm U.S. households, they disproportionately held 32.2 percent of total net worth and earned 18.0 percent of total income. The ARMS is a national survey conducted annually by the Economic Research Service and the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The survey is the USDA\"s principal source of information on the farming practices, resource use, and economic well-being of farms and ranches in the U.S. In both 2013 and 2016, the expanded number of sole proprietor households totaled nearly 2.0 million. In comparison to non-farm sole proprietorship households, the nearly 2.0 million farm sole proprietor households in 2016 accounted for 89.5 percent of all farm households. The shares of their total owned net worth and total earned income relative to the shares held by all farm households were at 81.4 percent and 82.8 percent, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Social Welfare Function", "text": "The disparity in wealth (NW) among farm and non-farm households is assessed using the Gini index, G. The advantage of using G in this paper to assess the inequality in NW is that it allows for measuring and, consequently, for disaggregating the following \"Bergson-Samuelson\" social welfare function (W) by five age cohorts as in: 6\nwhere U(x i ) denotes the utility of the i th household (i=1, \u2026, n) from owning an x i amount of wealth, and where X and\uf071 are both functions of households\" wealth with each representing, respectively, a measure of efficiency and inequity [for in-depth detail, see Inada 1971; Samuelson 1977; Pollak 1979; Johansson 1991; Podder 1993; Mukhopadhaya (2001 Mukhopadhaya ( , 2002 Mukhopadhaya ( , and 2003 ; and Cowell 2007] .\nAside from the dependence of W as described in (1) on the utility (U i ) levels of households, and under the assumption of negatively sloping social indifference curves, it further assumes that social welfare is increasing in each household\"s utility. This second property enables W to satisfy the (strong) Pareto criterion of social ranking since a rise in the utility of the ith household, ceteris paribus, increases social welfare. 7 Yet another property is that the strength of any tradeoffs is expected to depend on the extent of inequality, and that social welfare is higher when inequality is lower. This property guarantees that the indifference curves of W are convex to the origin. Hence, the social welfare function W needs to satisfy:\nwhich signifies that an increase in efficiency will enhance social welfare while an increase in inequality will diminish social welfare (Mukhopadhaya, 2002) . Given that many social welfare functions satisfy (2), Sen (1997) underlined, based on the notion that social marginal utility is inversely related to the rank of the selected economic measure and based on widely-accepted inequality axioms, the advantage of employing a specialized form of the Bergson-Samuelson class of social welfare functions as in the following:\n(1 ),\n\uf06d , in the context of this paper, is mean wealth and G is the Gini index used to measure the level of inequality in the distribution of wealth among farm and non-farm sole proprietor households. The rate of substitution between \"equity\" and \"efficiency\" at a stationary social welfare level is obtained by equating the total differential of (3) to zero:\nAfter collecting terms, equation (4) produces the slope of an indifference curve of social welfare function (W) in a space that spans both inequality and mean level of NW: 8"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Figure 1 presents the 2013 and 2016 medians of net worth of sole proprietor farm and nonfarm households along with the corresponding changes in their levels by the age category of household head. As shown in the top portion of the figure, the overall median wealth of non-farm households between 2013 and 2016 declined by 8.2 percent. In comparison, and in the same timeframe, the median wealth of farm households, as shown in the lower charts, increased by 7.6 percent. While those non-farm households with household head aged 65 years or older exhibited the largest drop in median wealth (about 19%), those farm households with operators aged 34 years or younger exhibited the largest increase in median wealth (33%).\nThe inequality in the distribution of wealth among sole proprietor households is captured in table 1. While the results show that inequality in the distribution of NW, as measured by the Gini index, was much higher for non-farm households than for farm households in both 2013 (i.e., 0.774 vs. 0.515) and 2016 (i.e., 0.807 vs. 0.535), findings further point to an increase in inequality for both farm and non-farm households across these two time periods. 9 To demonstrate, between 2013 and 2016, the Gini index of NW for non-farm households has increased from 0.774 to 0.807, which indicates an increase in inequality by 4.3 percent. 10 Over the same two respective years, the increase in wealth inequality among sole proprietor farm households was much milder as the Gini index exhibited an increase by only 3.9%, although lacking statistical significance, from a value of 0.515 to 0.535. 11 The fact that the inequality in wealth among non-farm sole proprietor households was much higher than for farm households is explained by the larger shares of wealth captured by those households in the upper 20 percent of the distribution of NW; an economic outcome that persisted in each of the age categories considered in both 2013 and 2016 (table 1). 1 At 2016 price levels. Standard deviations for all estimates are in parentheses and are computed based on the delete-one Jackknife variance estimation method. Similar estimate values of standard deviations were obtained based on bootstrapping estimation method with 1,000 replicate samples. Table 2 presents the 2013 and 2016 summary statistics necessary for the allotment of social welfare by the age of the household head. For both farm and non-farm sole proprietor households, results indicate that the mean NW and the concentration coefficient in both years are highest when head of household is aged 65 years or older. The high average value of NW and the high concentration coefficients amongst sole proprietor households with older heads indicate, in comparison to the population at large of farm and non-farm households, that a large proportion of households in this age group are in the upper wealth brackets, a finding which is consistent with the evidence from both the SCF and ARMS datasets. For example, while under 20 percent of non-farm sole proprietor households in both 2013 and 2016 had household heads aged 65 or older, about 30 percent of all households with heads in this age group were located in the highest quantile of the wealth distribution. Similarly, while about one-third of all farm sole proprietor households in both 2013 and 2016 had household heads aged 65 or older, about 40 percent of households with heads in this age group were located in the highest quantile of the wealth distribution. Table 2 also demonstrates a higher share of accumulated wealth by older farm households than by their non-farm older counterparts. Specifically, while those non-farm households aged 65 or older captured in 2013 and 2016 about 29% and 32% of the wealth, respectively, those farm households in the same age group captured a corresponding 37% and 41% percent of the wealth. Table 2 . Averages and shares of wealth, shares of population, and concentration coefficients for farm and non-farm households by age categories: 2013 and 2016 1 1 At 2016 price levels. Standard deviations for all estimates are in parentheses and are computed based on the bootstrapping estimation method with 1,000 replicate samples. 2 These are the Gini coefficients of the wealth measure for the total population. Findings of the welfare decomposition based on five age groups are presented in table 3. For non-farm sole proprietor households, total social welfare has decreased by 4.1 percent, from $657,986 in 2013 to $631,011 in 2016. 12 In contrast, findings point to a statistically significant rise by 8.8 percent in total social welfare for farm sole proprietor households, from $604,553 in 2013 to $658,029 in 2016. 13 To the extent that the change in wealth inequality between 2013 and 2016 as measured by the Gini index (G) is found insignificant, which in turn alludes to an insignificant change in equity as indicated in equation 9 in the appendix, the increase in total social welfare among sole proprietor farm households is explained by the rise in efficiency in the distribution of wealth as shown by the rise in average wealth. 12 Based on overlapping confidence intervals of the total social welfare in 2013 and 2016, the decrease in social welfare for non-farm households was not statistically significant. 13 The statistical significance of the difference in total social welfare among farm households between 2013 and 2016 is based on non-overlapping confidence intervals. Note: Standard deviations for all estimates are in parentheses and are computed based on the bootstrapping estimation method with 1,000 replicate samples.\nFor those farm and non-farm sole proprietor households in 2013 and 2016 where the age of the head was in the \"55 to 64\" year old category, and as evident in table 3, both absolute and relative shares of total social welfare are highest in comparison to when the age of the head falls in the other age categories. This finding concerning the high level of social welfare for both types of households in the 55-to 64-year old age group is explained by their strong financial position relative to households in the other age groups. Specifically, and as evident in table 2, non-farm sole proprietor households in the \"55 to 64\" year old group captured nearly 30 percent of both the total population of non-farm households and the total amount of NW in both 2013 and 2016. Likewise, farm sole proprietor households in this age category accounted for over 35 percent of both the total population of farm households and the total amount of wealth in both years.\nThe efficacy of a dollar increase in wealth (NW) for any of the five age groups is asserted, as described in equation 11 in the appendix, by values of k \uf078 larger than unity. Results in table 3 show that such a rise in NW of farm and non-farm households whose head is younger than 55 in both 2013 and 2016, will generate more social welfare than the effect of such an increase being expended over the whole society. Of these three age groups, the group where the age of the head is younger than 35 years old has the highest level of k \uf078 . As shown in figure 2, the median income of the group of sole proprietor farm households with farmers aged 34 years or younger is lower than the median incomes of the other groups of households; except for the group of households with farmers aged 65 years or older. Accordingly, any improvement in the U.S. labor market conditions that would result in an increased access to higher paying jobs, particularly among these sole proprietors aged 34 years or younger, would also likely generate an improvement in the economic well-being Applied Economics and Finance Vol. 7, No. 1; 2020 9 of their households through the potential of income-based wealth creation, and consequently, to a higher level of social welfare. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "This paper has used data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey and the Survey of Consumer Finances to examine, respectively, the distribution of wealth among farm and non-farm sole proprietor households in 2013 and 2016. In addition, it has assessed and partitioned total social welfare of these two groups of households based on five age cohorts.\nFindings, based on Gini coefficient analysis of the distributions of the wealth measure (NW) for both farm and non-farm sole proprietor households, revealed an increasing inequality for both types of households between 2013 and 2016, although the increase was statistically significant only for non-farm households. In addition, findings have pointed to a much pronounced level of dispersion in these distributions for non-farm households in comparison to farm households.\nUsing Podder\"s method of welfare decomposition, findings alluded to a statistically insignificant slight decrease in total social welfare among non-farm sole proprietor household over the 2013 and 2016 time period. In contrast, and over the same time period, findings pointed to a statistically significant increase in total social welfare for farm sole proprietor households; an increase that was attributable to the rise in efficiency in the distribution of wealth as a result to the upswing in average wealth. Results further shown the significance of the \"55 to 64\" age group in terms of its contribution towards the total social welfare of both farm and non-farm households. A marginal one dollar increase in the total wealth of those farm or non-farm households whose head is younger than 35 is found to yield the maximum increase in social welfare than the effect of the same dollar increase being spread over the whole society. This finding is in accord with the result by El-Osta (2009) where an economic indicator of well-being based on a combined income and annuitized wealth measure was used, instead of just wealth, in the partitioning of total social welfare among farm households.\nConsidering the finding of a high impact on total social welfare resulting from a marginal increase in wealth among households of the youngest farm age cohort, any improvement in the farm incomes of beginning farmers who tend to be younger than established farmers, which in turn would allow for wealth formation through increased savings and investment, would likely have the largest benefit. 14 To the extent that beginning family farms tend to be smaller and more dependent on income from off-farm sources than established family farms, a healthy U.S. economic outlook that results in an enhanced access to off-farm labor markets and at improved off-farm wages would also likely to aid in wealth creation and in improved social welfare for these households. 15"}, {"section_title": "About the Author", "text": "Hisham El-Osta is a former agricultural economist with the Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture.
