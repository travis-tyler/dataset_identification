[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Pinelands Commission is responsible for the implementation of the Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP) for the Pinelands National Reserve. The CMP's regional planning and regulatory programs are intended to protect the essential character of the Pinelands, including the quality of surface and ground waters, promote compatible agriculture, and encourage appropriate development patterns. In the early 1990's, the Commission initiated a long-term environmental-monitoring program with the ultimate goal of evaluating the ecological consequences of the plan. The main objectives of the program were to characterize the effect of existing land-use patterns on aquatic and wetland resources and to monitor longterm changes in these resources. The Mullica River Basin has been the main focus of the monitoring program ( Figure 1). This watershed was selected because it is centrally located, consists of several large drainage basins that display a range of land-use and zoning characteristics, and includes large tracts of public land. Additionally, the water resources and general ecology of the basin have been extensively studied. The Commission's monitoring program employs a multifaceted-hierarchical approach involving several regional ecological indicators ( Figure 2). Various land-use activities affect the ecological integrity of the Pinelands by fragmenting the landscape, altering stream flows, and degrading surface and ground waters. The percentage of different land-use/landcover types in a basin represents a measure of these activities. Several water-quality attributes, such as pH, specific conductance, and nitrate-nitrogen concentration, are good indicators of land-use related Pinelands-watershed disturbances. In Pinelands streams, water quality that varies from the acid and low-nutrient conditions found in forested basins is frequently associated with changes in the composition of characteristic aquatic and wetland communities. Among these changes are the establishment of nonnative species and the loss of some native species. \nThe surface-water quality associated with undisturbed watersheds represents a major component of the essential character of the Pinelands region. Streams draining forested watersheds are typically acidic and nutrient-poor (Morgan andGood 1988, Zampella 1994). In contrast, streams draining upland agriculture and developed lands display elevated pH and dissolved-solid concentrations (Morgan and Good 1988, Watt and Johnson 1992, Zampella 1994, Johnson and Watt 1996. Invasion of the region's aquatic and wetland plant communities by nonnative species and the loss of native species are among the biological consequences of water-quality degradation (Morgan and Philipp 1986, Ehrenfeld and Schneider 1991, Patrick 1996. Furthermore, the acid waters that characterize streams in forested watersheds may prevent the invasion of native fish (Hastings 1979, 1984, Graham and Hastings 1984, Gonzalez and Dunson 1987, Graham 1993 and amphibian communities (Gosner and Black 1957, Freda and Dunson 1986) by nonnative species. Because of the primary importance of water quality to the ecological integrity of the Pinelands, water-quality investigations have been a major element of the Commission's long-term environmental-monitoring program. The main focus of these studies has been the association between landuse activities, nutrient enrichment, and changes in pH. In this chapter, previously published Commission studies are summarized and the results of an assessment of water-quality in the Mullica River Basin are presented."}, {"section_title": "PART 1 LANDSCAPES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mullica", "text": "Twp."}, {"section_title": "Woodland", "text": "Twp."}, {"section_title": "Galloway", "text": "Twp."}, {"section_title": "Shamong", "text": "Twp."}, {"section_title": "Waterford", "text": "Twp."}, {"section_title": "Tabernacle", "text": "Twp.

The unconfined Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system underlies the Mullica River Basin (Rhodehamel 1973, Zapecza 1989, Johnson and Watt 1996. The aquifer is composed of the Kirkwood Formation and the overlying Cohansey Sand, which is the dominant surficial deposit. Less-extensive deposits, including the Beacon Hill Gravel, Bridgeton Formation, and Cape May Formation, overly the Cohansey Sand. The Kirkwood Formation does not crop out within the basin. The Mullica River Basin displays a diverse range of natural and human-dominated landscapes. The major drainage basins are characterized by distinct land-use patterns that provide a study in contrast between heavily altered landscapes and extensive forest lands. In this chapter, the land-use characteristics of each major drainage basin and the management areas designated through the Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP) are summarized. The methods used to delineate drainage areas and prepare land-use and management-area profiles are also described."}, {"section_title": "THE MULLICA RIVER BASIN", "text": "The 1474-km 2 Mullica River Basin is dominated by undeveloped forest land (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). Stateowned forests and wildlife-management areas are important components of the landscape. Only 15% of the basin is developed or farmed. Most developed land and upland agriculture is found in the headwater areas of the Mullica River, Sleeper Branch, Nescochague Creek, Hammonton Creek, and Landing Creek drainage basins. Upland agriculture is also a dominant landscape feature in several Batsto River headwater basins. In the West Branch Wading River and Oswego River basins and in the headwaters of the Bass River basin, developed land and upland agriculture cover less than 10% of the basin area. Most of the wetland agriculture found in the Mullica River Basin is located within the West Branch Wading River and Oswego River basins. Preservation Area District, which is the dominant management area in the basin (Figures 1.3 and 1.6), includes large tracts of public land. Forest Areas are located along the southern and eastern borders of the basin. Special Agricultural Production Areas are concentrated in the center of the basin within the West Branch Wading River and Oswego River systems. Pinelands Villages are found throughout the basin. Agricultural Production Areas, Rural Development Areas, Pinelands Towns, and Regional Growth Areas are located primarily along the western and southern parts of the watershed."}, {"section_title": "Wading River (West Branch of the Wading River)", "text": "The 226-km 2 West Branch of the Wading River is located within Burlington County.

The basin is located in Burlington County with the headwaters of one tributary, Tommys Branch, extending into Ocean County. The two principal tributaries of the Bass River are the East Branch of the Bass River and the West Branch of the Bass River. The combined area of developed land, upland agriculture, and wetland agriculture represents less than five percent of the Bass River basin. The lower reaches of this stream are tidal."}, {"section_title": "Hammonton Creek and Lower Mullica River Tributaries", "text": "The Hammonton Creek basin is located entirely within Atlantic County. A majority of the 53.3-km 2 basin is forest land. Forest land covers more than 90% of the drainage system's three small tributary basins (Petties Branch, Nortons Branch, and Brockaways Branch). Above these tributaries, most of the basin is developed or farmed with upland agriculture representing the dominant land-use activity. Wetland agriculture covers less than five percent of the basin. Forest Area is the dominant management-area classification. In order of increasing area, the other principal management areas are Agricultural Production Area, Pinelands Town, and Pinelands Village. A municipal sewage-treatment plant discharges directly to Hammonton Creek \nThe composition of stream vegetation at most Lower Mullica River tributary sites differed from that found at sites at the undisturbed end of the vegetation gradient (Table 6.2, Figure 6.9). Clarks Mill Stream, which fell within the range of other stream sites characterized by a high percentage of Pine Barrens District species, was the only Lower Mullica River tributary with no disturbance-indicator species. Disturbance-indicator species were found at all five Landing Creek basin sites. Most of these sites were associated with the disturbed end of the community gradient. Union Creek harbored seven exotic species, the most found at any of the 72 survey sites. Although a high percentage of Pine Barrens District species were found at Indian Cabin Creek, this site occupied a transitional position along the community gradient. The Hammonton Creek site is shown at the extreme end of the community gradient. Sixteen disturbance-indicator species were found at this stream site. The vegetation in the Hammonton Creek was among the more highly altered in the Mullica River Basin. Microstegium vimineum was especially abundant at this site.\nMost Lower Mullica River tributary sites occupied a transitional position along the fish-community gradients (Tables 9.2 and 9.3, Figure 9.17). The tessellated darter was the most frequently encountered nonnative species found in these stream systems. Bluegills, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseeds were collected from Morses Mill Stream below Lake Fred, an impoundment that also supported a mixed assemblage of native and nonnative fish. In the Hammonton Creek basin, nonnative fish were collected from Hammonton Creek and Hammonton Lake. Both sites occupied an extreme position at the disturbed end of the fish-community gradients.\nIn contrast to the Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River basins, assemblages at sites in the Hammonton Creek and Lower Mullica River tributaries were among the most altered anuran communities found in the Mullica River Basin ( Figure  10.22). The majority of the sites in these basins were associated with the disturbed end of the community gradients ( Figure 10.23). Only one site lacked borderentrant species. Bullfrogs were present at most of the sites and at all of the impoundments surveyed in these basins. Border-entrant species were heard at all four Hammonton Creek sites. Pine Barrens species were absent from these four sites."}, {"section_title": "Nescochague Creek", "text": "The Nescochague Creek basin lies within the boundaries of Camden and Atlantic Counties. About half of the 114-km 2 basin is developed land and upland agriculture. One percent is wetland agriculture. Three-quarters of the Nescochague Creek basin is designated as either Agricultural Production Area, Regional Growth Area, Pinelands Town, Pinelands Village, or Rural Development Area. Nearly one-half of the Albertson Brook basin, a tributary system of Nescochague Creek, is developed land or upland agriculture. This profile reflects the makeup of the Blue Anchor Brook and Pump Branch basins, two tributary systems of the Albertson Brook. Domesticwastewater infiltration lagoons are located at one site in the Blue Anchor Brook basin. A majority of the Great Swamp Branch basin, which includes Cedar Brook, is farmed or developed, with upland agriculture as the dominant land-use activity. Wetland agriculture covers less than two percent of the Great Swamp Branch basin. Agricultural Production Area is the major management-area designation in this basin. Most of the remaining portions of this Nescochague Creek \nFive stations were monitored in the Nescochague Creek basin. Streams in this basin displayed a range of water-quality conditions (Table 4.1). Great Swamp Branch was clearly the most degraded stream sampled during the 3-yr period. The basin is heavily altered, with 50% of the area covered by upland agriculture. Median calcium, magnesium, sulfate, and nitrite plus nitrate concentrations were the highest reported for the Mullica River Basin (Table 4.1). Calcium and magnesium concentrations and specific conductance were generally elevated at the other four Nescochague Creek sites, and sulfate concentrations were variable. Elevated pH was reported for all five sites, ranging from a median of 5.7 at Nescochague Creek to 7.0 at Blue Anchor Brook. Median ammonia concentrations were below the detection limit at all sites except Great Swamp Branch where a median of 0.02 mg L -1 was reported. Nitrite plus nitrate concentrations were consistently high, ranging from 0.11 at Blue Anchor Brook to 2.25 at Great Swamp Branch. Compared to the four tributaries, water quality in the Nescochague Creek at Pleasant Mills appeared to show some recovery.\nMost of the Nescochague Creek sites were characterized by a high percentage of non-Pinelands species. These sites were associated with the more disturbed end of the stream-vegetation community gradient (Table 6 \nNonnative fish were collected from all 12 streams and impoundments surveyed in the Nescochague Creek basin. As indicated by their position on the fish-community gradients (Tables 9.2 and 9.3, Figure  9.17), stream and impoundment assemblages in this basin were among the most heavily modified communities found in the Mullica River Basin. The Nescochague Creek at Pleasant Mills, which was the only site in the Nescochague Creek basin where nonnative bass or sunfish were not collected, occupied a transitional position along the stream-fish community gradient.\nPine Barrens species were infrequently heard in the Nescochague Creek basin (Figure 10.22). Bullfrogs were present at most of the sites and at all of the impoundments surveyed in this basin. Although assemblages at a few sites were dominated by Pine Barrens species, most Nescochague Creek sites were associated with the disturbed end of the community gradients ( Figure 10.23). Several sites in Blue Anchor Brook and Great Swamp Branch drainages were among the most altered anuran assemblages surveyed in the Mullica River Basin."}, {"section_title": "LANDSCAPE CHANGES IN THE MULLICA RIVER BASIN INTRODUCTION", "text": "Human-induced landscape alterations can have a substantial impact on ecosystem structure and function (Turner 1987, Robinson et al. 1995, Roland and Taylor 1997, Dow and DeWalle 2000. In the Pinelands, unique acid-water plant and animal communities are vulnerable to changes associated with water-quality degradation from developed and agricultural landscapes , Zampella and Bunnell 2000. Because of the relationship between land-use patterns and Pinelands biota, monitoring landscape changes provides one of the most direct measures of the effect of Commission land-use policies on the Pinelands ecosystem. Two basic approaches can be used to describe a landscape. Land cover represents the actual biophysical material on the Earth's surface. Land use depicts the way that humans utilize a portion of land or body of water. Using detailed land-cover information, Commission scientists completed a study that quantified changes in the Mullica River Basin landscape between 1979 and 1991 (Bunnell et al. 2001). This period corresponds to the first twelve years of the Commission's planning effort. The methodology and results of the study are summarized in this chapter. Several questions were addressed in the landscape study. First, what were the major land-cover transitions and changes in landscape structure (i.e., land-cover patch sizes) that occurred in the basin between 1979 and 1991? Second, did land-cover transitions occur in accordance with the different landuse intensities permitted by the Pinelands Comprehensive Management Plan's management-area designations (Chapter 1)? Third, how did the landcover data created through this study compare to satellite-derived land-cover data generated by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and aerial-photograph based land-use data created by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)? The Landsat and NJDEP data are much less detailed than the Commission's land-cover data, but offer great promise for long-term monitoring of the Pinelands landscape."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "\nMean daily-discharge data collected at neighboring USGS continuously monitored discharge sites, called index sites, were used in the trend analysis to remove some of the background variability in the study site discharge data before performing the trend analysis. Seasonal and annual variations in stream discharge that are unrelated to external stresses imposed by water diversions are a source of background variability. In this step, simple linear regression is used to relate discharge at a study site to that measured at an index site. The resulting regression model is then used to predict daily study-site discharge based on the measured index-site value. The difference between the predicted study-site baseflows and the actual values are referred to as residuals. A change in the residuals through time indicates that a change in baseflow conditions has occurred. Several statistical tests can be used for the trend analysis (Helsel and Hirsch 1992). Monotonic-trend methods, including regression analysis and the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, are used to detect gradual and continuing changes in stream discharge over time. Step-trend tests, including the two sample t-test and the nonparametric rank-sum test, are used to compare stream flows from two separate time periods. The applicability and sensitivity of these methods were assessed in a previous Commission study (Dow 1999). In this investigation, a series of simulatedbaseflow reductions were imposed on McDonalds Branch in Lebanon State Forest and the East Branch Bass River in Bass River State Forest. Both sites were continuously monitored USGS stream-gaging stations. Several other continuously monitored USGS streams were used as index sites. The simulated-baseflow reductions were used to assess what minimum percentage change could be detected by the different trend tests and what factors affected the trenddetection sensitivity. The results of the McDonalds Branch and Bass River simulations indicated that a long period of study is needed to detect relatively small percentage reductions in baseflow. More than eight years of quarterly discharge data were needed to detect a 10 percent reduction in mean annual discharge. More than 16 years of quarterly discharge data were needed to detect a five percent reduction in mean annual discharge. Other factors that influenced the outcome of the trend analyses included the strength of the relationship between study-site baseflows and indexsite baseflows, the time intervals between samples, and missing data points.  Table 5.1 for site names. Results of the simulation study also indicated that monotonic-trend tests are superior to step-trend tests in the absence of a single, constant stress with a defined starting point. Based on this finding, regression analysis and the Mann-Kendall test were used to analyze the Mullica River Basin data set. An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all analyses."}, {"section_title": "Study Sites", "text": "Because of the photo interpretation effort required to map detailed land cover within the entire Mullica River Basin, a tessellated-stratified random design was used to generate a statistically based sample that included seventy-two 225-ha photoplots. (Stehman andOverton 1994, Lathrop et al. 1997). The sample of 72 photoplots covered 11% (16,200 ha) of the basin (Figure 2.1).\nSeventy-two Mullica River Basin stream sites were surveyed as part of the expanded stream-vegetation monitoring program. The major criteria used to select survey stations were drainage-area land-use characteristics, accessibility, and suitability as plant-survey sites. Most sites consisted of a 100-m length of stream divided into four 25-m sections. Eight sites were only 25-m long. The sampling area at each site included the channel and a two-meter wide belt transect along each bank. Due to access limitations, portions of the Wading River basin were not surveyed. The location of each sampling station was registered with a global positioning system (GPS).\nThe major criteria used to select survey stations were drainage-area land-use characteristics, accessibility, and suitability as fish survey sites. Sixty-four stream sites and 30 impoundments were surveyed throughout the Mullica River Basin. Due to access limitations, portions of the Wading River basin were not surveyed. The location of each sampling station was registered with a global positioning system.\nTwo-hundred forty-two sites were surveyed for vocalizing anurans in the Mullica River Basin (Appendix 6). These sites were selected based on land-use characteristics, accessibility, and suitability as survey sites. The location of each listening point was registered with a global positioning system (GPS). Two-hundred twenty-seven sites remained after deleting sites where no anurans were heard and combining the results of several adjacent sites that were monitored in different years. Several general habitat types, consisting of on-stream and off-stream sites with variable hydrology, were represented (Table 10.1). The habitat classifications and proportion of each habitat type surveyed were similar to those reported in the Commission's initial basinwide anuran study (Zampella and Bunnell 2000). Based on site visits conducted during vocalization surveys and dry periods in the fall of 1997 and 1998, along with eight years of observations during field work, the hydrology of each site was classified as either permanent, temporary, or unknown (unclassified) ( Figure 10.2). The habitat types included 67 stream impoundments, 52 nonforested-stream crossings, four forested-stream crossings, seven forested wetlands, 41 natural offstream ponds, 42 excavated off-stream ponds, six abandoned cranberry bogs, three active cranberry bogs, and five ditches. Impoundments were large, open-water habitats with a mean surface area (\u00b1 1 SD) of 67.1 \u00b1 83.7 ha. Forested and nonforested crossings were on-stream sites located at roads. Forested stream crossings were bordered by trees, and nonforested stream crossings were streams or small (< 0.5 ha) impoundments bordered by shrub or emergent vegetation communities. The mean area for excavated ponds, which included irrigation ponds, retention basins, and borrow pits, was 2.9 \u00b1 3.9 ha. The mean area for natural ponds was 7.6 \u00b1 16.4 ha. Abandoned bogs were former cranberry bogs or impoundments that succeeded to mixed shrub/emergent wetlands with open water. Ditch sites were roadside ditches. Several sites that were depicted by digitalhydrography data (Chapter 1) as being connected to a stream were classified as off-stream sites. These sites included ponds that were either the source of a stream or sites that were formerly connected to a stream by a ditch. Characterizing Survey-site Conditions Several site-specific, local, and regional environmental attributes were used to characterize each anuran-survey site. The attributes included latitude and longitude, land use, basin area, habitatpatch size, specific conductance, and pH. Land-use profiles were prepared using ArcView software and 1995/97 land-use data obtained from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP, Chapter 1). Drainage-basin land-use profiles were prepared for the on-stream sites. For off-stream sites, profiles were created based on land-uses found within a 1500-m diameter circle (177 ha) centered on the listening point of each site. A similar technique was used to characterize adjacent land use in the Commission's initial study of off-stream ponds . Specific conductance and pH were measured in the field under baseflow conditions (Chapter 4). For onstream impoundments, specific conductance and pH were measured in the stream below the outflow of the impoundment. Off-stream pond measurements were made near the center of the pond. Specific conductance and pH data were not available for all sites. Basin areas were measured using NJDEP digital-hydrography data (Chapter 1). For sites with a distinct boundary, habitat-patch size was measured using digital aerial photography from 1995/97 (National Aerial Photography Program for United States Geological Survey). The latitude and longitude of each site was determined from the GPS points.\nTwenty off-stream ponds were surveyed for vocalizing anurans in the Mullica River Basin (Table  10.7). These 20 ponds were selected as long-term monitoring stations because they are located on the western side of the basin along the interface between forest land and developed and farmed landscapes. Fourteen of the ponds were intensively surveyed for adult and larval anurans during a previous Commission study . The vegetation present at 13 of these ponds has also been described in detail (Chapter 8, . Eighteen of these ponds are breeding habitat for the state-endangered Pine Barrens treefrog. Anuran-vocalization Surveys Anuran-survey methods were similar to those used in earlier Commission studies (Chapter 10, Bunnell 2000). From 1996 through 1999, nighttime vocalization surveys were conducted from the beginning of the anuran-breeding season (late February/early March) through June. As part of the Commission's initial basin-wide anuran study (Zampella and Bunnell 2000), 10 of the 20 ponds were also surveyed monthly for calling adults in 1993. The number of calling individuals at each site was estimated within a fiveminute period using a ranking system where 0 = none, 1 = 1 calling, 2 = 2-5 calling, 3 = 6-10 calling, and 4 = >10 calling individuals."}, {"section_title": "Commission Land-cover Mapping", "text": "Land cover was mapped in the 72 photoplots using aerial photography from 1979 and 1991. The classification system was modified from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Change Analysis Program (NOAA, C-CAP, Dobson et al. 1995) (Table 2.1). The Commission's humanaltered land covers were somewhat more detailed and woody land covers less detailed compared to the C-CAP classification scheme. The Commission map also did not distinguish between upland and wetland covers. On the Commission maps, developed land was composed of several residential and nonresidential cover types, and consisted mostly of impervious covers such as structures and paved surfaces. Table 2.1. Commission land-cover types and related Landsat and NJDEP classes found within 72 photoplots in the Mullica River Basin. Commission and Landsat classifications were modified from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (Dobson et al. 1995). For Commission forest, scrub/shrub, herbaceous, barren-land, and water cover types, disturbances included development, agricultural activities, resource extraction, timber harvests, and fire. The NJDEP classification scheme follows Anderson et al. (1976). NJDEP land-use classes are referred to using the revised Pinelands terminology (Table  1 Salt marsh, including unconsolidated Tidal wetlands, including saline marshes shore and emergent wetlands Water, including tidal water, retention basins, Water, including unconsolidated shore Water and tidal waters impoundments, irrigation ponds, ditches/canals, and emergent wetlands and other disturbance-related water cover Agricultural land was separated into crop land, blueberry fields, cranberry bogs, orchards, and tree farms. Grassland cover included residential grass (lawn areas) and nonresidential grass, such as athletic and recreation fields, commercial lawns, pasture land (including corrals), and roadside vegetation. Roadside vegetation consisted of herbaceous areas along paved and sand roads. Management of this cover type varied widely. Other cover types, including water, barren land, herbaceous, and scrub/shrub covers, were only delineated on the Commission maps when clearly associated with recent fire or past and present humanrelated land-use disturbances. These disturbances were limited to development, agricultural activities, resource extraction, and timber harvesting. Resource extraction areas included small and large-scale sand developed land, managed grassland, and barren land, approximately 30% of the total were vegetated (forest, scrub/shrub, and herbaceous), and the remaining 10% were composed of agricultural land, salt marsh, and water. There was a significant difference in several cover types between 1979 and 1991 (Table 2.2). The total area and the number of developed-land, managedgrassland, and barren-land patches increased due to the increase in the residential and nonresidential cover types, fire breaks, and paved and sand roads ( Figure  2.4). Managed grassland displayed the greatest increase in total area due mostly to the relatively large increase in residential lawns. The loss in total agricultural area between periods was small. Crop land and orchards decreased and blueberry fields increased in area, but the differences were not significant ( Figure 2.4, Table 2.2). Of all twelve cover types, only crop land and orchards showed a decrease in the number of patches between the two years. The trend for crop land was significant (Table 2.2). Although the area and the number of patches increased for cranberry bogs, the statistical significance of this change could not be determined because the number of photoplot pairs was too low (n = 6) to complete the matched-pairs tests (Sokal and Rohlf 1987). Salt marsh cover was not tested because it did not change between periods (Figure 2.4). The change in forest land between 1979 and 1991 represented the largest overall decrease in area ( Figure  2.4). For this cover type, there was a significant increase in the number of patches and a significant decrease in total area and median and third quartile patch sizes (Table 2.2). Based on median photoplot values, there was a 19% increase in the number of patches and a 17% decrease in median forest-land  Table 2.2. Summary statistics and results of Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests for individual land-cover types and all types combined. Tests were completed on summary statistics in 72 photoplots (11% of the basin) between 1979 and 1991. An alpha level of 0.05 was used in all tests. Significant results are indicated with a box. The initial p-level, the number of site pairs in which the land cover was present (n), and the median attribute value for both periods are given. Land-cover area and the number of patches were projected as basin-wide values by dividing the site-based number by 0.11. Cranberry bogs and salt marsh covers were not included in the Wilcoxon tests because of the low n for cranberry bogs and lack of change between periods for salt marsh. patch size. For all patches regardless of cover type, there was a significant increase in the number of patches and a significant decrease in the median and third quartile patch-size values. Although not included in the statistical analysis, mean patch size also decreased between periods for forest land and all cover types combined. These results indicated that fragmentation of forest land and the landscape as a whole occurred during the period. Using Landsat satellite imagery, similar structural changes have been reported for forest land in other studies in the Pinelands (Luque et al. 1994, Luque 2000. Land-cover Transitions Retention values, which represent the amount of a land-cover type that did not change between 1979 and 1991, ranged from 49% -100% (Table 2.3). Based on the 72 photoplots, a total of 5.3% of the total basin area was estimated to have changed cover type between periods. These changes included several major basin-wide transitions. Orchard land was converted to crop land and blueberry fields. Barren land cover was also converted to blueberry fields. Crop land was converted to orchards and managed grassland, and some crop land succeeded to scrub/shrub cover. Herbaceous cover succeeded to scrub/shrub cover and forest cover. Scrub/shrub cover was converted to forest cover. A large percentage of the total area that succeeded from herbaceous to scrub/shrub cover, herbaceous to forest cover, and scrub/shrub to forest cover between periods occurred in abandoned agricultural fields and other fields. Table 2.3. Transition matrix for land-cover types between 1979 and 1991. The top number (bolded) is the percentage area (\u00b1 1 SD) and the bottom number is the total area (ha) for cover-type transitions and the basin totals. Data were generated from 72 photoplots (11% sample of the basin) and land-cover area totals were projected to the entire basin by dividing site-based values by 0.11. Retention values are on the diagonal and represent the percentage and area of a land-cover type that did not change between 1979 and 1991. 1991  (\u00b1 3.9) (\u00b1 5.2) (\u00b1 1.9) (\u00b1 6.7) (\u00b1 4.6) (\u00b1 10.5) (\u00b1 3.5) (\u00b1 1.4) (\u00b1 4.0) (\u00b1 26.5) (\u00b1 16.8) (\u00b1 5.1) Basin net total  2744  4076  3944  3356  1946  3839  1130  1226  3529  112366  6360  2797  1474 km 2 Between 1979 and 1991, the total amount of herbaceous and scrub/shrub cover that succeeded to forest cover was similar to the amount of forest cover that was converted to herbaceous and scrub/shrub cover. The vast majority of the latter transition occurred as a result of fire and timber harvests. There was an net decrease of forest land between 1979 and 1991 ( Figure 2.4). The majority of the developed land, managed grassland, and barren land created between 1979 and 1991 originated from forest land (Table 2.3). Conversion of various previously disturbed covers accounted for the additional increase in these three cover types. Compared to crop land, orchards, and blueberry fields, the percentage of new cranberry bogs created from forest land was high. All the new bogs were established in abandoned bogs that succeeded to forest cover prior to 1979."}, {"section_title": "Pinelands Management Area Analysis", "text": "The type of land-cover changes were consistent with the management areas in which the transitions occurred ( Figure 2.5). Although there were increases in developed land and managed grassland in all eight management areas, the largest gains occurred in Regional Growth and Rural Development Areas. Barren land increased in the Special Agricultural Production Areas and Preservation Area District due to agricultural activities and the expansion of resource extraction areas. The decrease in barren land in Agricultural Production Areas was due mostly to the creation of blueberry fields. Barren land decreased in Regional Growth Areas due to the development of land cleared prior to 1979. Major agricultural transitions were limited to Regional Growth Areas, Agricultural Production Areas, and Special Agricultural Production Areas. There was a conversion of crop land to orchards in Regional Growth Areas. An opposite trend was observed for these two cover types in Agricultural Production Areas. The creation of blueberry fields and cranberry bogs between 1979 and 1991 occurred in Agricultural Production Areas and Special Agricultural Production Areas. Herbaceous cover was lost in all management areas except the Special Agricultural Production Areas and Pinelands Villages. There were small increases in these two management areas. Scrub/shrub cover was lost to developed land, managed grassland, and crop land in Regional Growth Areas and succeeded to forest land in abandoned cranberry bogs and timber harvest areas in the Special Agricultural Production Areas. The relatively large gain in scrub/shrub in the Preservation Area was due to forest lost to fire and timber harvests. Forest was lost to developed land and managed grassland in Rural Development Areas and increased in Pinelands Towns due to succession of herbaceous and scrub/shrub cover in abandoned fields."}, {"section_title": "NJDEP Land-use Map Comparison", "text": "The comparison of the Commission land-cover types and NJDEP land-use classes showed that the composition of the NJDEP land-use classes that were analyzed was similar in 1986 and 1995 (Bunnell et al. 2001). All the NJDEP land-use classes were composed of several Commission land-cover types (Figure 2.6). The comparison confirmed the high, medium, low, and rural density classifications assigned to residential land use by the NJDEP. All four NJDEP residential land-use subclasses included some nonresidential developed cover, which was mostly structures (with associated impervious areas) and paved roads. The amount of total managed grassland cover delineated on the Commission map was fairly constant among the four NJDEP residential land-use subclasses. About two-thirds of the NJDEP nonresidential-developed land-use subclass area was classified as nonresidential development and managed grassland cover on the Commission map. Twentythree percent of the total area designated as developed land by NJDEP was classified as developed-land cover on the Commission map. The NJDEP recreation land, athletic field, and managed wetland land-use subclasses were composed mostly of managed grassland, developed land, and barren land cover. These three Commission cover types were primarily associated with recreation areas such as athletic fields, campgrounds, and parks. Approximately two-thirds of the NJDEP uplandagriculture land-use class, excluding orchards, was classified as blueberry fields, orchards, and crop land on the Commission map (Figure 2.6). About one-half of the NJDEP wetland-agriculture land-use subclass Figure 2.6. Land-cover composition of 1995 NJDEP land-use classes and subclasses in 72 photoplots in the Mullica River Basin. Refer to Table 1.1 (Chapter 1) and Table 2.1 for details regarding NJDEP land-use classes. The upland-agriculture class includes upland agriculture and excludes orchards, vineyards, nurseries, and horticultural areas. The orchard subclass includes only orchards, vineyards, nurseries, and horticultural areas. Recreation land includes recreation land, athletic fields, and managed wetlands. Forest includes upland forest and wetlands and excludes scrub/shrub subclasses, and tidal, herbaceous, disturbed, and managed wetlands. Scrub/shrub includes upland forest and wetlands composed of scrub/shrub subclasses and excludes tidal, herbaceous, disturbed, and managed wetlands. was composed of blueberry fields and one-quarter was cranberry bogs. The NJDEP orchard subclass was also about one-half blueberry field cover. The inclusion of blueberry fields in both the NJDEP wetland-agriculture and orchard subclasses was due to the integration of a wetland coverage into the original 1986 NJDEP land-use map (Chapter 1). Based on the Commission map, the NJDEP barren land class was composed primarily of barren land, forest, scrub/shrub, and water covers. These Commission cover types were generally associated with resource-extraction activities. The NJDEP herbaceous-wetland subclass and the total area covered by upland-forest scrub/shrub and wetland scrub/shrub subclasses were characterized as being dominated by forest cover because all undeveloped vegetated land was classified as forest land on the Commission map. The NJDEP old-field subclass was predominantly herbaceous, scrub/shrub, and forest cover. Although this land-use was defined as being <25% brush cover in the Anderson et al. (1976) classification scheme, it was dominated by scrub/shrub cover. There was good correspondence between areas classified by the Commission as forest and areas mapped by NJDEP as upland forest and wetlands, excluding scrub/shrub cover. Areas designated as water by the Commission corresponded to areas mapped as water and tidal waters by the NJDEP. As mentioned previously, the 1986 NJDEP Freshwater Wetland data were used as a guide for the delineation of salt marsh on the 1991 Commission map. The cranberry-bog cover included in the NJDEP water and tidal waters class was due to the classification of cranberry reservoirs and bogs as cranberry bogs on the Commission map (Table 2.1). There was a strong positive relationship between the amount of developed land depicted by the Commission map and the amount of impervioussurface cover in the NJDEP map for each impervioussurface estimate interval (r = 0.99, p < 0.05) ( Figure  2.7). Although this indicated that the visual estimates of impervious surface in the NJDEP map were accurate, there were small differences between the two maps for each estimate interval. Compared to developed land in the Commission map, impervioussurface estimates tended to be lower in NJDEP polygons that were classified as 5% to 50% impervious cover and higher in those estimated at 55% to 100% impervious cover (Figure 2.7). For the whole basin, 23% of the 1995 NJDEP developed-land use area was designated as impervious surface by the NJDEP. As mentioned previously, the comparison of the Commission map to the NJDEP map in the 72 photoplots indicated that 23% of the NJDEP developed-land use was actually developed cover. These results strongly suggest that the impervious surface estimates accurately represented developed land throughout the basin and that the 72photoplot sample adequately characterized the NJDEP developed-land use. Table 2.4. Transition matrix for major NJDEP land-use classes between 1986 and 1995 in the Pinelands National Reserve portion of the Mullica River Basin. NJDEP land-use classes are referred to using the revised Pinelands terminology (Table 1.   amount of impervious and barren-land cover present (Table 2.1). The comparison with the Commission map showed that the amount of developed cover in each of the four TM developed types was only slightly underestimated. Grassland was significantly lower in the TM map compared to the Commission map because herbaceous and managed grassland together comprised a relatively small proportion of the TM grassland type and the majority of the managedgrassland cover in the Commission map was included in the TM developed types. The TM agricultural type included almost all of the crop-land and orchard cover present in the Commission map. However, agricultural land was significantly higher in the TM map compared to the Commission map because three-quarters of all blueberry-field cover from the Commission map was included as agricultural land rather than vines/bushes in the TM map (Figure 2.8). The majority of these blueberry fields were from the west-central part of the basin near Hammonton. Although the TM vines/bushes type included most of the remaining blueberry-field cover and two-thirds of the cranberrybog cover present on the Commission map, vines/bushes cover was lower in the TM map versus the Commission map due to the exclusion of that large amount of blueberry-field cover from the TM vines/bushes type. The lack of significance for the difference in vines/bushes cover between the two maps may have been due to the low number of photoplot pairs (n = 7) with this cover combination in common. Barren land was significantly lower in the TM map compared to the Commission map because barrenland cover from the Commission map was present in several other TM cover types (Figure 2.8). Most of the barren-land cover that was included in TM types other than the TM barren-land type was cleared lots, sand roads, and fire breaks, which may be too small or  Table 2.1 for details regarding TM land-cover types. narrow to be adequately captured by the 30 x 30-m TM pixel. Only one-third of the TM barren-land type was classified as barren-land cover in the Commission map. The composition of the TM barren-land type was similar to that for the NJDEP barren-land class (Figures 2.6 and 2.8). As with the NJDEP barren-land class, the majority of the Commission cover types present in the TM barren-land type was associated with resource-extraction activities. Total woody land was significantly lower in the TM map versus the Commission map due to the amount of forest cover included in other TM cover types (Figure 2.8). Based on the Commission map, TM forest and scrub/shrub types were both characterized as being predominantly forest land. The scrub/shrub type was characterized as forest cover mostly due to large areas in three photoplots being classified as forest in the Commission map and as scrub/shrub in the TM map. One area that appeared as mixed tree and scrub/shrub cover was harvested prior to 1979 and the other two areas were located in upland portions of the Pine Plains. The Pine Plains are dominated by short-stature pine and oak species. Although there was no significant difference in water cover between the two maps, about one-half of the TM water type was composed of forest cover and other covers combined. The presence of forest cover in the TM water type is at least partly due to the sinuosity of water-body shorelines and narrowness of small impoundments. There was good agreement for salt marsh cover between the TM and Commission maps. This is important for C-CAP because one of the primary objectives is to monitor changes in wetland land-cover in coastal regions of the United States (Dobson et al. 1995)."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study indicated that the major land-cover transitions between 1979 and 1991 were the loss of forest land to development and associated cover types and the conversion of one agricultural type to another. These landscape changes were consistent with those permitted in Commission management areas. The larger increases in development-related covers were limited to management areas where growth is encouraged. Agricultural transitions occurred in Regional Growth Areas, Agricultural Production Areas, and Special Agricultural Production Areas. Resource extraction and timber harvest operations were concentrated in the Special Agricultural Production Areas and the Preservation Area District. The verification of the accuracy of the NJDEP impervious-surface estimates and the characterization of the land-cover composition of individual land uses is important because the NJDEP map is a statewide coverage that has many applications. Impervious land cover has been recently recognized as a major indicator of the status of environmental conditions. The land-cover composition of individual NJDEP land uses can be used to create models that better quantify the impacts of developed land-use disturbance on ecosystem function. Although some cover types were classified more accurately than others in the TM map, the results of the TM map characterization indicated that satellite imagery has potential for landscape monitoring in the Pinelands.\nThe Commission study did not reveal any significant difference in the percentage of plants from surrounding biogeographic regions or the percentage of upland species between low-disturbance and highdisturbance sites. Although both of these community attributes were higher in high-disturbance sites than in moderate-disturbance sites, the differences were relatively minor. Virginia creeper was the only Middle District species that occurred more frequently in high-disturbance swamp sites. No exotic species were encountered during the study. None of the community attributes distinguished low-disturbance swamp sites from moderate-disturbance sites. The observation that reduced Sphagnum cover was associated with disturbance was confounded by the lack of significant differences in overall seedbed conditions or seedling density. Because there were no significant site-specific differences in soil, topographic, or hydrologic characteristics among the three disturbance classes, differences in understory-species composition between the high-disturbance class and the other two classes may be related to a higher percentage of maple in the canopy and greater canopy closure rather than the effect of watershed disturbance. This possibility was supported by the observation that the understoryspecies composition of low-disturbance and moderatedisturbance swamp sites with and without maple in the canopy were significantly different. Biogeographic differences between site classes was also partly attributed to location within the region. The differences between the results of this study and those of Ehrenfeld and Schneider (1990, 1991, 1993 reflects the effects of local versus regional land-use disturbances on Atlantic white cedar swamps. The contrast between the results of this investigation and Pinelands stream-vegetation studies (Morgan andPhillip 1986, Zampella andLaidig 1997, Chapter 8) also indicates that distant, upstream land-use disturbances have different effects on aquatic communities and the wetlands that border Pinelands streams. Unlike in-stream communities, Atlantic white cedar swamps in state-owned lands appear to be buffered from the effects of regional land-use related watershed disturbances."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE CITED", "text": "\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "ATLANTIC WHITE CEDAR SWAMP LANDSCAPES INTRODUCTION", "text": "Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps are valued for their ecological, cultural, and economic qualities (Little 1951, McCormick 1979, Wander 1981, Reinert and Zappalorti 1988, Roman et al. 1990, Craig and Dobkin 1993, Mylecraine and Zimmermann 2000. Various estimates of the extent of Pinelands cedar swamps indicate that these wetlands have declined since European colonization (Mylecraine and Zimmermann 2000). This decline has been attributed to conversion to other wetland vegetation types, due primarily to disturbances such as timber harvesting and fire (Little 1950, Roman et al. 1990, or gradual replacement by hardwoods in the absence of disturbance (Little 1950). To assess the status of Atlantic white cedar swamps in the Mullica River Basin, Commission and Rutgers University scientists used recent satellite imagery, aerial photography, and a geographic information system to detect landscape changes in these wetlands from 1930 through 1991 (Zampella and Lathrop 1997). A parallel study analyzed the size-class structure of swamps included in the landscape survey to determine if there is any evidence that cedarswamp succession is controlled by hardwood replacement (Zampella et al. 1999). The results of both studies are summarized in this chapter."}, {"section_title": "LANDSCAPE CHANGES IN CEDAR SWAMPS", "text": "Landsat Thematic Mapper digital imagery from 1991 was used to create an initial cedar inventory for the landscape-change study (Zampella and Lathrop 1997). A total of 1286 separate cedar swamp complexes covering 7058 ha were mapped. Thirty-two sites were chosen from this pool by randomly selecting complexes representing a range of swamp size classes. A 61-year (1930-1991) trend analysis of the selected cedar-swamp complexes was completed using aerial photography from seven periods (Table 3.1). For each period, homogenous patches were delineated and classified using several cover types, including cedar, swamp hardwoods, lowland pine (Pinus rigida), shrub wetlands (evergreen and deciduous), emergent wetlands, and water. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was generally the dominant tree in the swamp-hardwoods cover type. The abundance of each cover type was estimated using a cover scale where 0 = < 5%, 1 = 5-25%, 2 = 25-50%, 3 = 50-75%, and 4 > 75%. For example, a patch with 50-75% cedar cover (C), 25-50% swamphardwood cover (H), and 5-25% shrub cover (S) was classified as C3-H2-S1. A total of 981 cedar patches covering 1417 ha were followed throughout the 61-year period. A cedar patch was defined as a patch with cedar present during at least one of the seven time periods. Cedar patches represented 40% of the 3500 ha of vegetation mapped during the study. Disturbances associated with timber harvesting, wildfire, and flooding were also recorded for each patch. The Role of Disturbance Over the 61-year period, the composition of individual cedar patches in the Mullica River Basin changed in response to varying disturbance regimes (Table 3.1). Although less than 10% of the total cedar-patch area was disturbed during a single period, most cedar loss observed between 1930 and 1991 was associated with disturbance. Cedar harvesting was extensive before 1930, but most of the swamps harvested during that period regenerated. In later years, timber harvesting increased the likelihood that a cedar swamp would be converted to another wetland type.

Most flooding was associated with beaver activity, and a single wildfire was responsible for the loss of 59.8 ha of cedar. Only one small patch was lost to development, and no cedar loss was associated with agricultural activities."}, {"section_title": "Landscape Trends", "text": "There was a small but consistent increase in Atlantic white cedar cover from 1930 -1991 ( Figure  3.1). This increase was associated with a decrease in shrub cover and an increase in swamp-hardwood cover. Flooding during the latter part of the study period resulted in a small increase in water and emergent-wetland cover. The total area composed of cedar patches with > 75% cedar cover (C4 patches) remained relatively constant from 1930 to 1991 (Figure 3.2). A pronounced decrease in the total area of cedar patches with < 5% cover (C0 patches) was observed. Although the general trends in cedar-dominated patches suggested a relatively static cedar inventory, changes in the composition of individual cedar patches indicated a dynamic landscape. For individual patches, the cedar cover observed in two adjacent time periods was similar but this similarity decreased with time. The patch composition observed in 1930 was significantly different in 1991. The dominant between-period transitions were conversion of cedar to shrub cover and succession from shrub to cedar. Between 1930 and 1991, the net gains and net losses in cedar cover for the total cedar-patch area (1417 ha) was 39% and 24%, respectively. These long-term changes were also most closely related to changes in shrub cover. Replacement of cedar by hardwoods was not a major transition. The transition from the 1930 landscape to the 1991 landscape was dominated by changes in cedar patches that displayed < 5% or > 75 % cedar cover in 1930. In 1930, the area of patches with < 5% cedar cover was dominated by shrubs, and a majority of the patches were the result of timber harvesting. The dominant trend for patches with < 5% cedar in 1930 was succession to wetlands with either 5-25% or >75% cedar cover in 1991. Patches that succeeded to wetlands with 5-25% or 25-50% cedar were dominated by hardwood, pine, and shrub cover. These patches may not have originated from disturbed cedar-dominated wetlands. There was a net loss of cedar in patches that displayed > 75% cedar cover in 1930. Most of this loss was associated with a disturbance. For these original C4 patches, the dominant transition was to shrub cover. Replacement by swamp hardwoods, which was comparatively minor, was associated with the conversion of cedar-dominated swamps to swamps with 25-50% cedar in 1991. regimes and flooding associated with beaver activity are impossible to predict. The successful regeneration of swamps harvested before 1930 suggests that timber harvesting and maintaining a dynamic cedar inventory are not incompatible. During the 61-year period, net cedar losses were balanced primarily by regeneration of areas that were disturbed before 1930. However, due to the lack of successful regeneration of more recently harvested swamps, the possibility that future disturbances may result in a net loss of cedar swamps must be recognized and the post-harvest management of swamps, including deer exclusion and control of competing vegetation, should be emphasized. Replacement of cedar by hardwoods in undisturbed cedar swamps was not as common as generally considered, which indicates that cedar harvesting to rejuvenate stands is not necessary to maintain these wetlands. Finally, restoration of cedar in emergent or shrub wetlands previously dominated by cedar was proposed as a management strategy with both economic and ecological advantages."}, {"section_title": "HARDWOOD RECRUITMENT IN ATLANTIC WHITE CEDAR SWAMPS", "text": "A widely cited assumption is that in the absence of disturbances, Atlantic white cedar is eventually replaced by hardwoods as individual cedar trees die (Buell and Cain 1943, Little 1950, Motzkin et al. 1993). However, the landscape-level study of Mullica River Basin cedar swamps (Zampella and Lathrop 1997) indicated that replacement of cedar by hardwoods did not generally occur in the absence of large-scale disturbances. To determine if on-site conditions supported these findings, Commission and Rutgers scientists analyzed the size-class structure of 39 cedar patches selected from the landscape-level inventory (Zampella et al. 1999). In the absence of disturbance, analysis of size-class data can provide an indication of the potential contribution of a tree species to the next generation of canopy species (Harper 1977, Veblen 1992. All 39 patches chosen for study displayed > 75% cedar-canopy cover in 1991 and were established before 1930 as determined by inspection of aerial photography. Two to twelve 100-m 2 plots were established in each patch and the diameters of all tree stems greater than 1-m tall were measured. These data were used to determine the mean size-class distribution, mean stem density, and mean basal area of each tree species for each patch. The study addressed two related questions. First, is cedar or any of the associated hardwoods able to reproduce in these patches? Second, is the overall abundance of associated tree species in these patches and their potential to replace cedar related to cedar size-class structure? Patch Structure More than 90% of the total basal area in all 39 patches was composed of Atlantic white cedar. Standing-dead cedar trees were found in all patches. Hardwood species, which included red maple, blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and grey birch (Betula populifolia), occurred at low densities and contributed little to total basal area. Red maple was the most common hardwood species. Small-diameter stems (<10 cm) of all tree species, which represent potential canopy recruits, occurred at low frequencies. Stems with a diameter of 2.5-4.9 cm represented the majority of cedar and maple stems that were < 5 cm in diameter. For red maple, relative basal area, canopy cover, the density of large-diameter ($10 cm) stems, and the relative density of small (< 10 cm) and large ($10 cm) diameter stems (expressed as a percentage of total small-diameter and large-diameter cedar and maple stems) increased in relation to increasing cedar-stem size and decreasing cedar-stem density."}, {"section_title": "Cedar Succession", "text": "For most patches, the cedar size-class distribution patterns were characteristic of self-thinning, even-aged stands. Indications that the cedar swamps were senescent were generally lacking. Although several red maple structural attributes increased in relation to increasing cedar-stem size and decreasing cedar-stem density, the absolute density of 5-9.9 cm diameter cedar was greater than that of red maple, and the difference in the absolute density of < 5 cm diameter maple and cedar stems was not significant. Of greater importance was the observation that red maple was not common in the understory and was a minor component of all 39 cedar stands. None of the hardwood species occurred at densities that would permit it to quickly exploit canopy gaps created by the death of cedar. A conclusion of the study was that hardwood replacement of cedar in swamps is not a certain outcome of cedar-swamp succession. If it does occur, it may take centuries and only result in conversion to mixed stands dominated by cedar."}, {"section_title": "PINELANDS WATER-QUALITY GRADIENTS", "text": "An initial Commission study (Zampella 1994) demonstrated that land-use related watershed disturbance can have a substantial effect on the natural water chemistry of Pinelands streams. The study was based on United States Geological Survey (USGS) water-quality data collected at 14 stream sites located throughout the Pinelands, including five sites within the Mullica River Basin. Analysis of the waterquality data revealed a gradient of increasing pH, specific conductance, and concentrations of dissolved calcium, dissolved magnesium, total nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen, total ammonia as nitrogen, and total phosphorus that paralleled a watersheddisturbance gradient of increasing urban and agricultural land-use intensity and wastewater flow (Figure 4.1). Correlations among all seven waterquality attributes were high. Very low pH and nitrite plus nitrate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations distinguished water quality in the four least-disturbed streams from all other stream stations. Ammonia and total phosphorus concentrations were low at all but the most highly disturbed stream stations. The high ammonia and total phosphorus concentrations at these stations were attributed to sewage discharges. Although seasonal effects were observed for pH, calcium, magnesium, and specific conductance, the water-quality characteristics of streams located at opposite ends of the watershed-disturbance gradient remained relatively distinct regardless of the season. The study provided a regional context in which to assess the status of Mullica River streams. The five Mullica River sites displayed a range of water quality and watershed conditions. Water quality in the East Branch Bass River near New Gretna (Stage Road), the Oswego River at Harrisville, and the West Branch Wading River at Maxwell was comparable to that of McDonalds Branch. As a USGS Hydrologic Benchmark station, McDonalds Branch in Lebanon State Forest served as a reference for water quality in undisturbed Pinelands watersheds. The high percentage of agricultural land in the Wading River (9.5%) was attributed to extensive cranberry and blueberry lands rather than upland agriculture which dominated land cover in the other basins with high agricultural-land cover. The Batsto River at Batsto and the Mullica River at the outlet of Atsion Lake displayed land-use related watershed-disturbance and water-quality characteristics intermediate between the four least-disturbed streams and the eight other sites. The Hammonton Creek at Wescoatville was the most highly disturbed of the 14 stream sites studied.   4.1. Pinelands surface-water quality gradients.

Simple linear regression was used to relate specific conductance and pH, measured at 45 Pinelands stream sites over a twoyear period (September 1992 through August 1994), to the percentage of altered land (developed land and upland agriculture) in a watershed. Developed land included all urban and residential areas. Agricultural land was limited to upland agriculture. Cranberry farms were not included in the alteredland class because lime and fertilizer applications were considered to be low compared to those of most upland-agricultural uses. In the separate regression models, altered land explained 56% of the variability in specific conductance and 48% of the variability in pH. Accounting for the dominant altered land-use type (developed land versus upland agriculture) did not significantly alter the relationships between median pH and specific conductance values and the percentage of altered land for a site. Furthermore, the waterquality/altered-land relationships did not vary significantly across subregions represented by major drainage basins (Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor, Great Bay, and Great Egg Harbor Bay). The relationships obtained using median values for the two-year period were similar to those developed using data from any single-sample period within the entire study period. Multiple regression was used to simultaneously relate specific conductance and pH to land use in a basin. This approach greatly improved the relationship between the water-quality variables and altered land in a drainage basin. The joint use of pH and specific conductance explained 79% of the variability in altered land. The results of the multiple regression analysis were used to develop a model-response plot that allows for an inverse prediction of pH and specific conductance based on the percentage of altered land in a basin ( Figure  4.2)."}, {"section_title": "COOPERATIVE PINELANDS COUNTY PROGRAM", "text": "As part of a cooperative monitoring program with the Burlington County Health Department and the Atlantic County Utilities Authority, Commission scientists collected water-quality data at 32 sites within the Mullica River Basin.

Although sampling frequency and period of record varied among sites, there was no systematic seasonal bias in the sampling frequency. Water-quality parameters measured at all 32 sites included pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen, and ammonia as nitrogen. Total phosphorus was measured as phosphate at 26 sites and as phosphorus at the remaining six sites. Dissolved calcium and dissolved magnesium were also measured at 26 sites. A limitation of the cooperative Pinelands waterquality monitoring program was the use of different protocols by the county laboratories. For example, detection limits for the different forms of nitrogen varied between laboratories. Such differences prevented the comparison of water quality in streams located within the different counties.

The five most heavily altered watersheds, excluding Hammonton Creek, were selected to represent degraded-stream sites. These sites included the Mullica River near Atco, Hays Mills Creek at Atco, Indian Mills Brook, Blue Anchor Brook, and Great Swamp Branch. Upland agriculture and developed land in these five basins ranged from 49% to 62% and 13% to 42%, respectively. Wetland-agriculture cover was less than two percent. The Hammonton Creek basin was also heavily altered and was the only drainage with a point-source wastewater discharge. Above the Hammonton Creek monitoring site, 56% of the land use in the basin was developed land and upland agriculture. An additional 6.2% of the drainage was wetland agriculture."}, {"section_title": "Stream Station", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "First, second (median), and third quartiles and the 10 th and 90 th percentiles were calculated for specific conductance, pH, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulfate, nitrite plus nitrate, ammonia, dissolved orthophosphorus, and total phosphorus. Censored values (values that are below laboratory detection limits) were reported for calcium, nitrite plus nitrate, ammonia, and total phosphorus. Calcium was reported as below detection limit (< 0.10 mg L -1 ) at only two sites on a single date. The detection limit for nitrite plus nitrate was 0.05 mg L -1 . Although the ammonia detection limit for the 18 Commission-USGS stations was reported by the USGS as either 0.01, 0.015 or 0.02 mg L -1 , the actual detection-limit value was constant at 0.02 mg L -1 over the three-year period (Jacob Gibs, personal communication). The ammonia detection limit for the eight NJDEP-USGS stations was 0.03 mg L -1 . The detection limit for orthophosphorus was 0.01 L -1 . A detection limit of 0.01 mg L -1 was used for total phosphorus on all but one date when a limit of 0.05 mg L -1 was used at six sites. These six phosphorus values were deleted when calculating the statistics for those sites. All other censored values were equated to zero when calculating the summary statistics, but detection limits were used when reporting the results. Forward stepwise regression was used to relate median pH, specific conductance, calcium, magnesium, sulfate, and chloride values to the percentage of developed land, upland agriculture, and wetland agriculture in each drainage basin. Land-use profiles were prepared using the NJDEP 1995/1997 land-use/land cover data (Chapter 1). Nitrite plus nitrate, ammonia, and total phosphorus were not included in the regression analyses due to the high frequency of censored values. Correlation analysis was used to evaluate associations between the different water-quality attributes included in the regression analyses.\nAnnual median and maximum vocalization ranks were calculated for each species heard at each site. For each species, the frequency of occurrence at the 20 ponds was determined for each year. These attributes represent regional measures of the distribution and abundance of calling individuals for the species heard. Species were classified as Pine Barrens species, wideranging species, or border-entrant species according to Conant (1979). The frequency of occurrence was also calculated for these three groups of species to assess changes in native Pinelands versus non-Pinelands species. All results were analyzed graphically."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Water-quality conditions recorded for the 26 stream sites were clearly related to watershed conditions ( Figure 4.4, Table 4.1). Except for ammonia, the water-quality attributes increased along the watersheddisturbance gradient characterized by increasing developed-land and upland-agriculture cover. As suggested by the individual water-quality/land-use relationships, most variables were intercorrelated. The strikingly different characteristics of the reference-stream sites and the degraded-stream sites illustrate the effect of land-use patterns on Pinelands water-quality (Table 4.2). The multiple regression analyses confirmed the trends indicated by the graphical analysis. The analysis revealed strong relationships between developed land and upland agriculture in a drainage basin and pH, specific conductance, calcium, magnesium, and chloride  Total phosphorus (mg L -1 ) <0.01 <0.01 0.13 (Table 4.3), explaining from 84% to 89% of the variability in the water-quality variables. Compared to developed land, agricultural land accounted for a greater percentage of the variation in calcium and magnesium concentrations. Conversely, developed land explained a greater percentage of the variability in pH and specific conductance. Developed land explained 84% of the variability in chloride concentrations. The contribution of upland agriculture to the chloride model was negligible. Upland agriculture alone accounted for 53% of the variability in sulfate concentration. Wetland agriculture was not retained in any of the models. The percentage of wetland agriculture in the drainage basins that were monitored did not exceed the level above which developed land or upland agriculture would be expected to have an effect. The change in specific conductance, which increased from a median of 39 FS cm -1 for the reference-site streams to a median of 104 FS cm -1 for the degradedstream sites, reflected the increases in the concentrations of major ions along the Mullica River Basin watershed-disturbance gradient. Specific conductance, which is expressed in microsiemens per centimeter (FS cm -1 ) at 25 o C, is a measure of the ability of water to conduct an electrical current. It is related to the type and concentration of ions present.

Mullica River Basin surface-water quality gradients. Sites are ordered along the watershed-disturbance gradient by increasing percentage of altered-land cover (developed land and upland agriculture). Water-quality values are medians, quartiles, and 10 th and 90 th percentiles. Values below detection limit for ammonia -N (0.02 or 0.03 mg L -1 ), nitrate + nitrite -N (0.05 mg L -1 ) and total phosphorus (0.01 mg L -1 ) are shown as open squares. All values except pH and specific conductance (\u00b5S cm -1 ) are in mg L -1 . Stream-station names are given in Table 4.1.  (Morgan and Good 1988). Yuretich et al. (1981) attributed elevated calcium and magnesium levels in the Mullica River and the Batsto River to possible deep ground-water contributions. Morgan and Good (1988), who more accurately characterized the extent of agricultural and developed land in the headwaters of these two streams, associated the elevated levels of calcium and magnesium with land-use related watershed disturbance. The same pattern has been observed along a wide range of Pinelands watershed conditions (Zampella 1994). Liming is one potential source of these two base cations (Johnson and Watt 1996). Marine aerosols are a source of sodium and chloride in both disturbed and undisturbed Pinelands streams (Morgan andGood 1988, Yuretich et al. 1981), but the increase in chloride along the watershed disturbance gradient probably reflects land-use patterns. Hay and Campbell (1990) and Robinson et al. (1996) reported a state-wide increase in chloride in New Jersey streams, including several Mullica River sites, from 1976 through 1986. Trends in concentrations of both sodium and chloride were associated with application rates of road-deicing salts (Robinson et al. 1996). The Pinelands support an acid-water flora and fauna which suggests that undisturbed Pinelands waters have always been acidic (Kaufman et al. 1988, Morgan 1991. Due to acid deposition, current acidity is controlled primarily by sulfate, with naturally occurring dissolved organic carbon playing an important role (Morgan 1991). The inverse relationship between sulfate concentrations and pH suggests that other processes are influencing pH in basins disturbed by developed land and upland agriculture. Elevated pH in degraded streams appears to be related to increases in base cations and alkalinity. Enhanced primary productivity associated with nutrient enrichment may also play a role (Morgan 1985). Although orthophosphorus was detected at all 18 Commission monitoring sites on at least one occasion, median concentrations did not exceed the 0.01 mg L -1 detection limit at any site. Median total phosphorus concentrations equaled or exceeded the 0.01 mg L -1 detection limit in six streams. Three of these streams, which included Hammonton Creek, Indian Mills Brook, and Blue Anchor Brook, drained watersheds with more than 50% altered land in the drainage basin. The three other stream sites are the two Wading River stations and the Oswego River at Harrisville. The Oswego River is one of the five reference-stream sites. Total altered land in the two Wading River drainage basins is about 7.5%, with wetland agriculture representing the dominant altered-land use. Median ammonia values were below detection limit at all but three stream sites where the median concentration was 0.02 mg L -1 . No clear relationship between this form of nitrogen and land-use was apparent. In the Pinelands, elevated phosphorus and ammonia levels have usually been associated with direct sewage discharges (Fusillo 1981, Schornick and Ram 1978, Zampella 1994). The low ammonia levels observed across the nonpoint source land-use disturbance gradient are consistent with Morgan and Good's (1988) conclusion that watershed disturbance had no effect on this nutrient. Carter (1998) estimated nonpoint source phosphorus and nitrogen loads for five New Jersey Coastal Plain drainage basins, including the Mullica River Basin. With the exception of the Mullica River Basin, urban land use was the most significant contributor to nonpoint nitrogen and phosphorus loads. For the Mullica River Basin, the modeling exercise indicated that agricultural lands were a significant source of these two nutrients. Howes and Teal (1995) reported that a 15 ha cranberry bog in Massachusetts was a net source of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to an outflowing stream. Ammonia accounted for most of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen exported from the bogs. Concentrations of ammonia and acid-leachable phosphate in outflowing waters were about four times the inflowing concentrations. With one exception, the Oswego River at Harrisville, nitrite plus nitrate was below the 0.05 mg L -1 detection limit at the five reference-stream sites. A median value of 0.07 mg L -1 was recorded for the Oswego River. Nitrite plus nitrate was detected in most streams with more than 10% altered land in the basin. The highest median concentrations were reported from Great Swamp Branch (2.25 mg L -1 ) and Hammonton Creek (1.27 mg L -1 ), the two most heavily degraded stream sites. Nonpoint sources of nitrites and nitrates include fertilizers and septic tanks. Stackelberg et al. (2000) reported that nitrate concentrations in water samples drawn from shallow Kirkwood-Cohansey monitoring wells in undeveloped areas were less than 1.0 mg L -1 compared to median concentrations of 3.0 mg L -1 and 13 mg L -1 for urban and agricultural land, respectively. Szabo et al. (1997) also found elevated nitrate concentrations in Kirkwood-Cohansey wells associated with agricultural land. The effect of nonpoint sources of nitrite plus nitrate on Hammonton Creek is complicated by the existence of a direct sewage discharge.\nThe relationship between stream pH and specific conductance and land-use followed the typical watershed-disturbance pattern. Both water-quality variables increased as the percentage of developed land and upland agriculture in a drainage basin increased (Figures 4.5 and 4.6). The wide range in median specific conductance values observed at sites in basins with less than 10% altered land was probably due to the very low median pH (< 4.5) found at these stream sites. The contribution of hydrogen ions to specific conductance increases exponentially in these highly acid waters, resulting in a dramatic increase in specific conductance (Figure 4.7). Specific conductance and pH were higher on the more heavily developed and farmed western side of the Mullica River Basin (  Specific Conductance 3-Year Period (1995 -1998) 4-Month Period (1999) Specific Conductance Figure 4.10.

This coverage is below the level at which an effect would be expected from upland agriculture or developed land. However, two streams that drained basins with 25% to 34% wetland agriculture displayed pH and specific conductance values characteristic of Pinelands reference sites. For the 26 USGS stream sites, the relationships obtained using median values for the four-month period were similar to those developed using data for the three-year (1995 -1998) period. Median values for these two different periods were correlated ( Figure  4.10), indicating that the 1999 data provide a good relative comparison of stream sites. Compared to the longer-term data set, specific conductance values for the four-month period were generally lower and pH values were higher. These differences probably reflect the seasonal bias of the 1999 data set, which was collected during a growing season characterized by extreme low-flow conditions.  \n\n\n\nA total of 11 species were heard calling at the 20 ponds, including both Pine Barrens species, four of the wide-ranging species, and five of the border-entrant species (Figure 10.24). Species richness for all ponds combined ranged from 8 species in 1993 and 1997 to 11 species in 1996 ( Figure 10.25). Variation in annual species richness was primarily due to differences in the frequency of occurrence of border-entrant species (Figure 10.25). These trends were associated with the mean number of visits to each site ( Figure 10.25). The overall mean (\u00b1 1 SD) number of annual visits to each site was 5.6 \u00b1 2.0. Over the five years, Pine Barrens treefrogs, carpenter frogs, spring peepers, leopard frogs, and green frogs were more frequently encountered than Fowler's toads or any of the five border-entrant species (Figure 10.24). The chorus frog was the only border entrant heard during all five years. A single cricket frog was heard at one pond on one occasion. Of the five most frequently encountered species, Pine Barrens treefrogs and spring peepers were the most stable with respect to the number of ponds occupied from year to year (Figure 10.24). Spring peepers were the only species to vocalize from the same number of ponds in 1993 as in 1999. Except for wood frogs, the frequency of occurrence for all species decreased between 1996 and 1999. Many species were encountered less frequently in 1997.   Green frogs showed the most pronounced decline during the study period. There was an overall decrease in the frequency of occurrence of Pine Barrens, wide-ranging, and border-entrant species between 1998 and 1999 ( Figure 10.25). Pond hydroperiod has been identified as a keystone factor in regulating amphibian populations (Wilbur 1987, Rowe and Dunson 1995, Skelly et al. 1999. Compared to 1996, pond water levels were lower in 1997 and 1998  due to climatic variation. Based on regional vocalization ranks, Pine Barrens treefrogs and spring peepers were typically the most abundant species calling each year ( Figure 10.26). Spring peeper ranks were generally the highest. Although the frequency of occurrence of green frogs decreased substantially during the study period, the annual median and maximum number of calling individuals remained relatively constant. This indicated that the number of vocalizing green frogs may have increased in abundance at the ponds where they were present. Calling ranks also did not vary much over the five years for spring peepers, leopard frogs, or bullfrogs ( Figure 10.26). The trend for the number of calling Fowler's toads and gray treefrogs during the survey period mirrors that found for the frequency of occurrence of these two species. For wood frogs, there was an increase in both vocalization ranks and the frequency of occurrence over the survey period. The absence of this species from all ponds in 1993 was probably due to the late start for surveys that year. Surveys were initiated on March 31 in 1993, and wood frogs may have finished breeding by that time (Figure 10.4)."}, {"section_title": "Drainage-basin Characterizations Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River", "text": "The six monitoring stations in the Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River consistently displayed low pH and low ion concentrations (Table 4.1). Dissolved calcium and magnesium concentrations ranged from 0.42 to 0.66 mg L -1 and 0.27 to 0.51 mg L -1 , respectively. Median chloride concentrations ranged from 2.9 to 6.0 mg L -1 , with the highest value reported for the East Branch Bass River. Median sulfate concentrations were variable, ranging from 2.7 to 7.1 mg L -1 . The sulfate concentrations for the two Wading River stations and the Oswego River at Harrisville were within the range reported for sites in the more heavily impacted western drainage basins. Both specific conductance and pH reflected characteristic Pinelands values. Median pH ranged from 4.2 to 4.6. The highest median specific conductance value was 51 FS cm -1 . Nitrite plus nitrate concentrations were below the 0.05 mg L -1 detection limit at all sites except Oswego River at Harrisville. A median value of 0.07 mg L -1 reported for this station represented five measurements made over a one-year period. The detection limit for this nitrogen species was exceeded on four of the five dates. Median ammonia levels were below the detection limits at all but Tulpehocken Creek where the median values was 0.02 mg L -1 . This basin is entirely within Wharton State Forest. Median total phosphorus concentrations equaled or exceeded the 0.01 mg L -1 detection limit at the Wading River above Tulpehocken Creek and the Oswego River at Harrisville stations. The median total phosphorus value for the Wading River at Maxwell also exceeded the detection limit. However, this median was based on only four samples which included two below detection limit values. Except for the elevated phosphorus and ammonia concentrations, water quality at the stream stations within the Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River was characteristic of undisturbed Pinelands waters.\nA high percentage of Pine Barrens District plants characterized the Wading River and Oswego River stream sites. All 18 sites in these basins were associated with the undisturbed end of the streamvegetation community gradient (Table 6.2, Figure  6.9). With one exception, all sites lacked disturbanceindicator species. The one exception was the occurrence of a single specimen of Dioscorea villosa (common wild yam) at Papoose Branch. Two sites, Little Hauken Run and Hospitality Brook, occupied a transitional position along the stream-vegetation gradient that was similar to Mullica River Basin sites that were characterized by a high percentage of Pine Barrens District species, but also supported indicator species. Typical Pinelands species found in the Wading River and Oswego River basins included Scirpus subterminalis, Potamogeton confervoides, Orontium aquaticum, Eriocaulon aquaticum, Sagittaria engelmanniana, Utricularia fibrosa (fibrous bladderwort), and Juncus pelocarpus (brown-fruited rush). Study sites in the Bass River watershed also supported a typical Pinelands flora as depicted by the position of West Branch and East Branch sites on the stream-vegetation community gradient ( Figure 6.9). The occurrence of two disturbance-indicator species, Panicum clandestinum (deertongue grass) and Polygonum hydropiperoides (mild water pepper), at the West Branch Bass River site appeared to be related to a localized disturbance.\nFish assemblages in the Oswego River and Wading River basins were characterized by the absence of nonnative fish. All stream and impoundment sites in these two basins supported native-fish assemblages and occupied a position at the undisturbed end of the fish-community gradient (Tables 9.2 and 9.3, Figure  9.17). Except for the West Branch of the Bass River, nonnative fish were absent from all the Bass River basin sites. Pumpkinseeds were collected at the West Branch site on a single sampling date. This peripheral species placed the West Branch at a transitional position along the stream-fish community gradient. The absence of pumpkinseed from an impoundment located immediately upstream from the collection site suggested that this peripheral species may have entered the acid-water stream from tidal areas where it is known to occur (Hastings 1984)."}, {"section_title": "Hammonton Creek", "text": "Of the streams sampled, Hammonton Creek was the only one receiving a direct wastewater discharge. Developed land and upland agriculture covered more than one-half of this basin. Overall, the water quality reported for this stream was among the most degraded of all streams in the Mullica River Basin. The concentrations of all chemical constituents were elevated at this site (Table 4.1). Median pH and specific conductance values were 6.5 and 118 FS cm -1 . The median total phosphorus level of 0.13 mg L -1 was the highest reported for the Mullica River Basin. Median nitrite plus nitrate concentrations were also high at 1.27 mg L -1 . The median ammonia concentration did not exceed the 0.03 mg L -1 detection limit."}, {"section_title": "Sleeper Branch", "text": "Water quality at the four Sleeper Branch basin stations deviated from reference-site conditions (Table  4.1). Calcium, magnesium, chloride, and nitrite plus nitrate concentrations, pH, and specific conductance were high at the two Hays Mills Creek stations. The elevated chloride concentrations may reflect the more highly urbanized character of this basin. Waterquality conditions generally improved downstream at the main-stem Sleeper Branch station, although nitrite plus nitrate remained elevated. Clark Branch represented the least disturbed stream among the Sleeper Branch basin sites. Specific conductance and pH at this site approached reference-site values. Neither ammonia nor total phosphorus exceeded detection limits at any of the Sleeper Branch basin sites.\nA range of conditions was encountered among the ten Sleeper Branch basin sites (Table 6.2, Figure 6.9). A number of disturbance-indicator species, including Ludwigia palustris, Callitriche heterophylla, Mikania scandens, and Impatiens capensis (spotted touch-me-not), were found at stream sites that supported a high percentage of non-Pinelands species. These sites were located on Hays Mill Creek, Wildcat Branch, Price Branch, and the uppermost Sleeper Branch site at Maple Island. A single disturbanceindicator plant was found at three sites with a high percentage of Pine Barrens District species. These included sites along Cooper Branch, Sleeper Branch at Parkdale, and Saltars Ditch. All three sites occupied a transitional position along the streamvegetation community gradient. The integrity of stream vegetation continued to improve along the main stem of the Sleeper Branch. The vegetation found at the Sleeper Branch above its confluence with the Mullica River reflected undisturbed conditions.\nFish assemblages in the Sleeper Branch basin reflected a range of conditions (Tables 9.2 \nAnuran assemblages at sites in the Sleeper Branch basin varied. The majority of these sites occupied a transitional position along the community gradients ( Figure 10.23). Many of these sites were off-stream ponds. Although Pine Barrens species were heard at about half of the Sleeper Branch sites, border-entrant species were present at 85% of the sites in this basin (Figure 10.22). This drainage is the only basin where border-entrant species were found at more sites than wide-ranging species. Carpenter frogs were heard at a third of the sites and bullfrogs were present at about half of the sites. The most modified assemblages occurred at four impoundments on Hays Mill Creek and Wildcat Branch. Pine Barrens species were absent, but bullfrogs were heard calling at all four impoundments."}, {"section_title": "Upper Mullica River", "text": "Overall water quality at all but one of the four Upper Mullica River stations approached reference-site conditions (Table 4.1). All four stations were located along the main-stem of the river. Degraded water quality at the Atco site reflected the high percentage of developed land in the headwaters of the basin. Except for ammonia and total phosphorus, median values for all water quality attributes were elevated at this site. Water quality improves dramatically at the Jackson Road site which is located below the confluence of the Alquatka Branch. Elevated nitrite plus nitrate concentrations at the Atsion Lake and Constable Bridge sites distinguished these two sites from Mullica River Basin reference sites. Flows from Saltars Ditch, Wesickaman Creek, and a Springers Brook diversion may have contributed to these elevated concentrations. Total phosphorus concentrations were below detection limits at all four Upper Mullica River sites.\nThe stream vegetation found at sites in the Upper Mullica River reflected a range of conditions (Table  6.2, Figure 6.9). The Wesickaman Creek and the uppermost Mullica River site at Jackson-Medford Road occupied a position at the disturbed end of the vegetation-community gradient. Both sites were characterized by a high percentage of non-Pinelands species and supported a high number of disturbanceindicator species. A high percentage of Pine Barrens District species characterized the other six Upper Mullica River sites. Three of these sites occupied a transitional position along the stream-vegetation gradient and three fell within the range of undisturbed sites. Several disturbance-indicator species were found at two of the transitional sites, including the main stem below Atsion Lake and an unnamed tributary that flows to the main stem at Quaker Bridge Road. In both cases, degraded streams may be the source of the disturbance-indicator species. The mainstem site is located immediately below the confluence of the Wesickaman Creek, and the unnamed tributary pirates water from the Springers Brook in the Batsto River basin.\nConditions in the Upper Mullica River varied along its length (Tables 9.2 and 9.3, Figure 9.17). Stream and impoundment assemblages found upstream from the Alquatka Branch confluence were composed of native and nonnative species. Only native species were collected at sites between the confluence of the Alquatka Branch and Atsion Lake. Pumpkinseeds were collected at Atsion Lake and at a main-stem site located downstream from the lake. Both bluegills and largemouth bass were collected from the Wesickaman Creek, which flows to the Upper Mullica River below Atsion Lake. With the exception of tessellated darters collected above the mouth of the Sleeper Branch, no nonnative species were found in the three remaining sites along the main stem of the Upper Mullica River.\nUpper Mullica River basin survey sites were distributed throughout the community gradients ( Figure 10.23). This range in anuran-assemblage composition occurred because border-entrant species and Pine Barrens species were heard at a similar number of sites in this basin ( Figure 10.22). However, carpenter frogs were present at almost twice as many sites as bullfrogs, and Pine Barrens treefrogs were calling from half of the sites in this drainage. Anuran assemblages differed at sites along the main stem of the Mullica River and the Wesickaman Creek, one of its tributary systems. A degraded headwater impoundment on the Upper Mullica River supported bullfrogs and no Pine Barrens species, whereas Goshen Pond, an acidwater impoundment located between the mouth of Alquatka Branch and Atsion Lake, was dominated by native species. Although one bullfrog was heard calling during one visit at an Alquatka Branch impoundment, sites in this relatively undisturbed tributary system supported native-anuran assemblages. In contrast to the difference in assemblages found in the Mullica River, the opposite was found for Wesickaman Creek "}, {"section_title": "Batsto River", "text": "Water quality was monitored at six Batsto River basin sites (Table 4.1). Conditions at these sites ranged from those found at reference sites to those associated with streams at the disturbed end of the land-use related watershed-disturbance gradient. Water quality at the Skit Branch site represented reference-site conditions. This site was characterized by low pH, specific conductance, and dissolved solid concentrations. Neither ammonia, nitrite plus nitrate, nor phosphorus exceeded detection limits at Skit Branch. Conditions found at the Indian Mills Brook and Springers Brook sites contrasted sharply with those of Skit Branch. The degraded water quality at these sites reflected the heavily altered lands in their drainage basins. Water quality reported for the three main-stem Batsto River sites was intermediate between the extremes displayed by Skit Branch and Indian Mills Brook. Median nitrite plus nitrate concentrations were elevated at all three sites, with the highest concentrations found at the Hampton Road site located above the confluence of Springers Brook and Skit Branch. Ammonia was below the detection limit at all Batsto River basin sites. Overall, water quality along the main stem of the Batsto River was comparable to that found at the Jackson Road, Atsion Lake, and Constable Bridge sites in the Upper Mullica River basin. In both basins, headwater land-use patterns continued to influence water quality at downstream sites located within extensive forested     landscapes.\nThe Batsto River system provides a case study of the effect of land-use related watershed disturbance of stream communities. There was a distinct difference in the vegetation found in streams draining forest land and streams draining basins with a high percentage of developed land and upland agriculture (Table 6 Ehrenfeld and Schneider (1990, 1991, 1993) demonstrated that adjacent residential development and stormwater runoff compromised the ecological integrity of Pinelands Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps. Ecological changes associated with these local land-use impacts included the loss of native Pinelands plant species, an increase in the occurrence of nonnative and uplandplant species, increased species richness, reduced Sphagnum cover, and low cedar-seedling germination. To assess the effect of regional watershed disturbance on the same community attributes, Commission scientists completed a study of cedar swamps found throughout the Mullica River Basin . The study addressed three main questions. First, do species richness and native, nonnative, and upland plant-species composition vary in relation to watershed disturbance. Second, is there a difference in Sphagnum cover and seedling germination between cedar swamps in disturbed and undisturbed watersheds? Finally, do site-specific environmental conditions vary in relation to watershed disturbance? The results of the published Commission study are summarized in this chapter.\nThe widest range of conditions were found in the Batsto River basin (Tables 9.2 and 9.3, Figure 9.17). Streams and impoundments in the tributaries of the heavily altered Springers Brook system supported fish assemblages with a high percentage of nonnative species, while only native fish were found in the forested Skit Branch system. The only nonnative species found along the length of the Batsto River above Batsto Lake was the tessellated darter. Largemouth bass and a single golden shiner were collected from Batsto Lake.\nThe effect of watershed disturbance on Pinelands anuran communities was especially obvious in the Batsto River basin. The number of sites with Pine Barrens species was greater than the number of sites with border-entrant species (Figure 10.22). Although several sites in this basin were located at the disturbed end of the community gradients, assemblages at many sites were characteristic Pinelands communities ( Figure 10.23). Sites within the heavily degraded stream systems on the western side of this basin had a high percentage of border-entrant species. Bullfrogs were present at almost all of these sites and carpenter frogs were completely absent. Sites within the forested stream systems that drain the eastern portion of the basin were dominated by native assemblages.

In it, he described the flora of the Pine Barrens (Pinelands) and adjacent biogeographic regions, which he called the Coast Strip, the Cape May District, and the Middle District. The Middle District is a broad region of the Coastal Plain that lies west and north of the Pine Barrens. Stone (1911) indicated that species typically found in the Middle District intruded well within the region \"where extensive clearings have been effected and maintained for long periods of years...\"(page 74). He also wrote that \"In extensive Pine Barren settlements of long standing, as Vineland, Landisville, Hammonton, etc., a good many native plants of the Middle district have followed the weeds and become established where richer soil has been developed, and, while they are listed in the following pages [of his report], the fact of their origin should be borne in mind, and their presence at these stations should not be regarded as evidence that these species were originally found in the Pine Barrens\"(page 101). More recent Pinelands studies have shown that landuse related disturbances are associated with changes in the composition of characteristic aquatic and wetland plant communities. Based on a study of Pinelands swamps, Ehrenfeld (1983) suggested that nutrient enrichment was the most important environmental change associated with increasing landuse intensity in Pinelands watersheds. Swamp sites in developed or agricultural drainage areas lost characteristic Pinelands species and were invaded by exotic species, cosmopolitan species, and species from adjacent regions. Morgan and Philipp (1986) reported that many plant species were confined to either polluted (elevated pH and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations) or unpolluted (low pH and nitratenitrogen concentrations) Pinelands streams. In polluted streams, characteristic Pinelands plant species were replaced by peripheral or nonnative species. Both Ehrenfeld (1983) and Morgan and Philipp (1986) used Stone's (1911) species accounts to provide a general reference point for assessing floristic changes associated with watershed disturbances that have occurred since the earlier part of this century. Besides documenting the effect of watershed disturbance on native Pinelands flora, the studies conducted by Ehrenfeld (1983) and Morgan and Philipp (1986) demonstrated the potential value of plant species as indicators of environmental conditions. To further evaluate the use of plants as indicators of watershed disturbance in Pinelands streams, Commission scientists completed an initial study relating stream vegetation to watershed conditions ."}, {"section_title": "STREAM VEGETATION AS AN INDICATOR OF WATERSHED CONDITIONS", "text": "The Commission's initial stream-vegetation study  related the composition of channel and bank vegetation found at twenty Pinelands stream sites to eighteen regional and sitespecific environmental variables. The stream sites, which included eighteen sites in the Mullica River Basin, displayed a wide range of water-quality conditions and drainage-basin characteristics. A total of 240 plant species were found at these sites. The complete plant-species inventory and detailed descriptions of station dimensions and locations are given in Laidig and Zampella (1996). In this initial study, ordination techniques were used to explore stream-vegetation patterns and to relate these patterns to environmental conditions. Ordination is a term used to describe multivariate analysis methods that arrange sites along axes based on species-composition data. Species and samples (sites) are ordered along a few axes with each axis explaining some of the variation in the speciescomposition data. When the arrangement of sites along two axes (represented by sample scores) are plotted as a two-dimensional diagram, sites that display similar species composition generally appear close together. Thus, ordination provides an objective means of comparing species composition among sites. Two ordination methods, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA, Hill 1979a, Hill andGauch 1980) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA, ter Braak 1986), were used to relate the species composition of the twenty sites to environmental gradients represented by several factors. The factors were the percentage of developed land and upland agriculture within a drainage area, specific conductance, pH, stream discharge, mean channel-water depth, mean channel width, overbank flooding, channel and bank substrate, bank tree and shrub cover, adjacent tree cover, latitude, and longitude. With DCA, an indirect gradient analysis method, the ordination axes represent species-composition gradients. Environmental gradients are inferred from these patterns. If available, environmental data can be correlated with the sample scores for each axis. CCA represents a constrained ordination technique. It is a direct gradient analysis method that immediately relates species composition to environmental factors. The sample scores derived with CCA represent linear combinations of environmental variables that explain the greatest amount of variation in the species data. TWINSPAN (Hill 1979b) is a classification technique that complements ordination. This widely used method partitions the points in an ordination diagram, grouping sites with similar species composition. The results of the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and the detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were similar. In both analyses, the major patterns in the plant-species composition for the twenty stream sites were related to a watersheddisturbance gradient characterized by increasing upland-agriculture and developed-land use in a drainage area, pH, specific conductance, and channel sediment. The similarity in results between DCA and CCA indicated that the environmental variables included in the CCA adequately described the main variation in the species composition revealed by DCA. A clear difference in species composition existed between sites located in forested watersheds and those in highly developed or farmed basins. The percentage of plant species classified by Stone (1911) as Pine Barrens District species decreased along the watershed-disturbance gradient, while the percentage of Middle District species increased. Identification of sensitive species, or species found only at undisturbed sites, was complicated by high species variability among relatively undisturbed sites and the persistence of some species at more recently disturbed sites. However, stream sites in the more heavily impacted watersheds supported a unique group of peripheral or exotic plant species, comprising 29 species and referred to as disturbance-indicator species, that replaced characteristic Pine Barrens species (Table 6.1). The Commission's initial stream-vegetation study demonstrated that the presence of disturbanceindicator species and the ranking of stream sites based on an ordination of plant-species data using DCA provide relatively good measures of land-use related watershed disturbance in Pinelands streams. These findings provided the basis and methods for a full assessment of the status of stream vegetation in the Mullica River Basin."}, {"section_title": "THE STATUS OF STREAM VEGETATION IN THE MULLICA RIVER BASIN", "text": "The Commission's initial study of Mullica River stream vegetation  established the rationale and the methods needed to conduct a comprehensive survey of the basin.

These six sites were among the 20 ponds that were surveyed annually for vocalizing anurans. Adult frogs (mostly vocalizing males) were captured and examined at all six ponds during nighttime surveys in late April or early May. Two of the six ponds were also surveyed in late-June for metamorphosing individuals. Metamorphs were surveyed because physical deformities can also occur in larval anurans (Laposata andDunson 1998, Rowe et al. 1998). Metamorphs were collected with dipnets during the daytime and examined for deformities. The list of physical attributes that were examined (Table 10.8) were adopted from the USGS North American Reporting Center for Amphibian Malformations (NARCAM, http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/narcam). Results A total of 95 frogs were collected during the surveys, including 60 spring peepers, 9 Pine Barrens treefrogs, 4 carpenter frogs, and 22 leopard frogs (Table 10.9). The number of individuals of each species collected at a site varied. Except for one adult leopard frog, none of the individuals exhibited any obvious external abnormalities. The leopard frog was missing a portion of its right hind limb, which was severed and healed over at mid-thigh. Of the 95 frogs examined, 56 individuals were adult frogs and 39 were in various stages of metamorphosis. All metamorphosing frogs had four legs and some amount of tail. Depending on the stage of metamorphosis, mouth shape ranged from that of a tadpole to that of an adult frog. These features are common to larvae at or beyond Gosner (1960) stage 42. The results of the survey of six ponds suggest that the occurrence of anuran malformations may not be a widespread phenomenon in Mullica River Basin ponds.

Bankfullchannel width, dominant channel-bed substrate, stream-bank forest type, and adjacent-forest types were determined for each 25-m section. The dominant channel-bed substrate found within one meter of the left and right banks and in the center of the channel was subjectively characterized as gravel, sand, or muck (silt, clay, detritus, and muck). The forest type in the 2-m wide belt transect located along each stream bank was classified as hardwood swamp, Atlantic white cedar swamp, scrub cedar, pitch pine lowland, upland pine or oak forest, deciduous shrub wetland, evergreen shrub wetland, or emergent wetland. The same approach was used to categorize the adjacent-forest type located beyond the 2-m wide belt transect. For each stream site, the median bankfull-channel width was calculated and frequency of occurrence values were determined for the dominant channel-bed substrate, stream-bank forest types, and adjacent-forest types.\nMajor drainage-basin and local-habitat attributes were characterized at each site in conjunction with the stream-vegetation surveys (Chapter 6).

At each site, channel and bank plants were surveyed on a single occasion during each of three time periods (May-June, July-August, and September-October) covering a single growing season. All surveys were conducted from 1996 through 1999. The eighteen Mullica River Basin sites sampled during the Commission's initial streamvegetation study were surveyed again during this period. Separate presence/absence tallies were completed for each 25-m stream section, resulting in four sampling areas for each 100-m stream station. All plants were classified as either Pine Barrens District species, Middle District species, or species found in both the Pine Barrens District and the Middle District following Stone (1911). Southern New Jersey plants not included in Stone's biogeographic lists, but described in his individual species accounts as uncharacteristic of the Pine Barrens District, were assigned to the Middle District category. Using Gleason and Cronquist (1991), species that are not native to North America were classified as exotic. Both Middle District and exotic species represent non-Pinelands species.

Both scientific and common names are given in the appendix. The appendix also describes the location of each site, including latitude and longitude, the sampling dates, and the individuals who conducted the surveys. The Commission maintains a herbarium collection that includes at least one voucher specimen for each plant species collected from each of the major Mullica River Basin tributary systems.\nA total of 305 vascular plants, including 232 herbaceous and 73 woody species, were found at the 72 stream sites. Total and herbaceous plant-species richness ranged from 21 to 90 and 10 to 69, respectively. The mean (\u00b1 1 SD) number of species found at the 72 sites was 50 \u00b1 14. Median species richness was also 50. Eighty species were represented by a single occurrence. Sixteen stream sites accounted for more than three-quarters of these single-occurrence plant species. The other 225 species included 170 herbaceous plants and 55 woody plants. A small number of woody and herbaceous plants were frequently encountered at the 72 stream sites. Several woody species occurred at more than half of the study sites. Among these were Acer rubrum (red maple), Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic white cedar), and Nyssa sylvatica (black gum). Common shrubs, listed in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence, included Clethra alnifolia (sweet pepperbush), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush blueberry), Eubotrys racemosa (fetterbush), Rhododendron viscosum (swamp azalea), Chamaedaphne calyculata (leatherleaf), and Ilex glabra (inkberry). Smilax rotundifolia (common greenbrier) and Vaccinium macrocarpon (large cranberry) were also found at a majority of the stream sites. Aquatic macrophytes that occurred in the stream channel at more that 20% of the sites and that are considered typical of the Pine Barrens included Sparganium americanum (slender bur-reed), Scirpus subterminalis (swaying bulrush or water club-rush), Sagittaria engelmanniana (Engelmann's arrowhead), Juncus militaris (bayonet rush), Eleocharis robbinsii (Robbin's spike-rush), Nuphar variegata (bullhead lily), Orontium aquaticum (golden club), Eriocaulon aquaticum (seven-angled pipewort), and Potamogeton confervoides (alga-like pondweed). Frequently encountered wetland species, found primarily on the stream banks, included Leersia oryzoides (rice cut-grass), Triadenum virginicum (marsh Saint John's-wort), Dulichium arundinaceum (dulichium or three-way sedge), Glyceria obtusa (blunt manna-grass), Lysimachia terrestris (swamp loosestrife), and Aster novi-belgii (New York aster). Disturbance-indicator species were found at 36 stream sites ( Figure 6.1). The most commonly encountered indicator plants were, in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence, Ludwigia palustris (water purslane), Galium tinctorium (stiff marsh bedstraw), Mikania scandens (climbing hempweed), Callitriche heterophylla (larger water starwort), Polygonum sagittatum (arrow-leaved tearthumb), Impatiens capensis (spotted touch-me-not), Polygonum hydropiperoides (mild water pepper), Polygonum punctatum (dotted smartweed), Bidens frondosa (beggar ticks), Boehmeria cylindrica (false nettle), Eupatorium dubium (eastern joe-pye weed), and Panicum clandestinum (deertongue grass). The number of plant species classified by Stone (1911) as being characteristic of either the Pine Barrens District, the Middle District, or both districts were nearly equally represented.

To limit the effect of rare species on the ordination, only species occurring at two or more sites were included in the analysis. Spearman rank correlation and graphical analysis were used to determine if species composition, represented by the DCA axes, varied in relation to environmental factors. The environmental factors included the percentage of upland agriculture, wetland agriculture, and developed land in a basin, pH, specific conductance, longitude, and channel muck. Selection of these variables was based on the results of the initial stream-vegetation study ). An alpha level of 0.05 was used to identify important relationships revealed by the correlation analysis. Because the high density of sampling sites in the basin may influence the outcome of the correlation analyses, these tests were performed primarily to evaluate general trends and the relative strength of the relationships between community gradients and environmental factors.\nThe first DCA axis contrasted stream sites with a high percentage of species restricted to the Pine Barrens District with those sites supporting a high percentage of non-Pinelands species ( Figure 6.3, Table 6.2). The percentage of Pine Barrens District species decreased along this stream-vegetation community gradient while the percentage of non-Pinelands species and the percentage and absolute number of disturbance-indicator plant species increased (Figures 6.4 and 6.5). These contrasts were related to differences in the range of watershed conditions associated with each plant species ( Figure  6.6, Table 6.3).  Figure 6.6.

DCA Axis 1 represents a stream-vegetation community gradient. Refer to Table 6.2 for site names ordered by DCA axis 1 scores. The order of stream sites along the first axis of the DCA site-ordination diagram was associated with increasing pH (r = 0.73), specific conductance (r = 0.68), and the percentage of developed land (r = 0.72) and upland agriculture (r = 0.70) in the basin ( Figure  6.7). Stream sites on the right side of the diagram displayed higher pH and specific conductance and a higher percentage of developed land and upland agriculture in the drainage basin than those on the left side of the diagram. Although the relationship was not as strong, this first axis was also correlated with geographic position represented by longitude (r = -0.52). Because most developed lands and upland farms are found on the western side of the basin, this last association is probably related to land-use patterns, although the possible influence of biogeography on species composition cannot be   discounted. The p level for all five relationships was < 0.001. Neither wetland agriculture nor channel muck were correlated with the first DCA axis. The order of stream sites along the second DCA axis did not reflect differences in the distribution of Pine Barrens District, non-Pinelands, or disturbanceindicator plant species and was not related to differences in water quality or land use. The TWINSPAN classification revealed similar differences among the stream stations. The first TWINSPAN division separated a group of 47 sites with a higher percentage of Pine Barrens District plant species (Pinelands site class) from 25 sites characterized by a high percentage of non-Pinelands plants and disturbance-indicator species (non-Pinelands site class) ( Figure 6.8). Disturbanceindicator species were found at some sites included in the Pine Barrens class, suggesting that this class included some moderately disturbed streams. The two major site classes were also distinguished by contrasting pH, specific conductance, and land-use ( Figure 6.8). A second division of the non-Pinelands site class separated eight sites which, as a group, displayed the highest pH and specific conductance values and the highest percentage of upland agriculture or developed land. This group of sites also supported the highest mean number of disturbanceindicator plants at 15 \u00b1 4.6. Differences in adjacentforest type between the two TWINSPAN groups suggested that canopy cover may influence species composition. Hardwood-swamp cover was the dominant cover at 38% of the sites in the Pinelands site class, compared to 92% of the sites in the non-Pinelands site class.

Like the cedar swamps studied by the Commission (Laidig and Zampella 1999, Chapter 7), the acid-water ponds are not in direct contact with streams and appear to be buffered from upstream landuse disturbances that influence in-stream conditions."}, {"section_title": "FISH ASSEMBLAGES INTRODUCTION", "text": "Streams and impoundments in relatively unaltered Pinelands watersheds support a characteristic acidwater fish fauna comprising fourteen species (Hastings 1979, Hastings 1984. Hastings (1984) categorized the native Pinelands fish as restrictedcharacteristic or widespread-characteristic species. Within New Jersey, restricted-characteristic species are mostly limited to the Pinelands. This group of native fish includes the yellow bullhead (Ameiurus natalis), pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus), banded sunfish (Enneacanthus obesus), blackbanded sunfish (Enneacanthus chaetodon), mud sunfish (Acantharchus pomotis), and swamp darter (Etheostoma fusiforme). Widespread-characteristic fish species, which are found in other parts of the state, include the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), eastern mudminnow (Umbra pygmaea), redfin pickerel (Esox americanus), chain pickerel (Esox niger), ironcolor shiner (Notropis chalybaeus), creek chubsucker (Erimyzon oblongus), tadpole madtom (Noturus gyrinus), and bluespotted sunfish (Enneacanthus gloriosus). The ironcolor shiner is rare in most of New Jersey and may no longer occur in the Mullica River Basin (Hastings 1984). The general absence of nonnative fish in unmodified Pinelands waters is attributed to the physiological effect of low pH or the absence of a suitable food source due to the low productivity that typifies the region (Hastings 1979, Graham 1993, Graham and Hastings 1984, Gonzalez and Dunson 1987. Hastings (1979Hastings ( , 1984 classified the nonindigenous fish found in the Pinelands as either peripheral or introduced species. Peripheral species are native to other parts of New Jersey and are found in waters along the boundaries of the Pinelands. Introduced species are not native to the state. The golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) are among the peripheral species found in the region. The bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) are the most widespread of the introduced species. Fish communities are generally useful indicators of aquatic degradation (Karr et al. 1985, Berkman et al. 1986, Steedman 1988, Fausch et al. 1990, Karr 1991. Based on studies indicating that changes in Pinelands fish assemblages are associated with water-quality degradation (Hastings 1979, 1984, Graham 1993, Graham and Hastings 1984, Commission scientists began surveying fish assemblages in the Mullica River Basin. The results of an initial study  provided the basis for a comprehensive survey of the watershed. This initial study addressed two main questions. First, do fish community attributes (species composition, relative abundance, and species richness) of reference-sites (sites that are minimally impacted by land-use related disturbances) vary along watershed-disturbance gradients? Second, which fish community attributes distinguish referencesite fish assemblages from those found at modified sites? The ultimate goal of the investigation was to assess the utility of fish assemblages as indicators of watershed conditions."}, {"section_title": "FISH ASSEMBLAGES AS INDICATORS OF WATERSHED CONDITIONS", "text": "The Commission's initial stream-assemblage study (Zampella and Bunnell 1998) compared acid-water fish assemblages found at five Pinelands referencesites to assemblages at 12 other stream sites displaying a range of pH and specific conductance values and upstream land-use characteristics. Nineteen fish species were collected at the 17 Mullica River Basin sites during surveys conducted between 1992 and 1995. These species included six nonnative fish and all thirteen native fish reported to occur in the Mullica River Basin by Hastings (1984). The number of species (species richness) found at a site ranged from 8 to 15 species. Species richness did not clearly distinguish reference-sites from degraded sites. The total number of individuals collected was greater at sites with high plant cover compared to sites with low plant cover, but there was no difference in species richness between these two site types. Native species occurred across a range of conditions and dominated the assemblages of all 17 sites. Among the 13 native Pinelands species, the creek chubsucker was most closely associated with high-pH stream sites. The six nonnative fish species included four peripheral species and two introduced species. These species were less abundant than native species and most site occurrences were represented by a single individual. All were limited to sites where the pH was greater than 5.5 and, except for the tessellated darter, were found only at stream sites with median conductance values greater than 60 FS cm -1 . The tessellated darter is the only nonnative species considered characteristic of stream habitats. The other nonnative species encountered in the study are more typical of Pinelands lakes and ponds (Hastings 1984), which are primarily on-stream impoundments. This habitat association probably accounted for the general rarity of nonnative species in the disturbed streams. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA, Chapter 6) was used to order fish species and stream sites based on presence/absence data. A second ordination was produced using relative-abundance data. The results of these separate analyses were similar. In both, the first DCA axis contrasted the occurrence of native fish species with the occurrence of nonnative fish. The order of sites along the first axis of both DCA ordinations, which represents a fish-community gradient, was correlated with a complex watersheddisturbance gradient characterized by increasing pH, specific conductance, and the percentage of developed land and upland agriculture in a drainage basin. These fish-community gradients were also correlated with native and restricted-characteristic species richness and the percentage of native and restrictedcharacteristic species. The study demonstrated several major points regarding the use of fish assemblages as indicators of Pinelands watershed conditions. First, the presence of nonnative species is a useful indicator of aquatic degradation represented by elevated pH and specific conductance values and a high percentage of developed land or upland agriculture in a basin. Second, a ranking of stream sites based on an ordination of species data (presence/absence or relative abundance) provides a good estimate of watershed conditions. Finally, the contrast between reference-site assemblages and assemblages found at degraded-stream sites was more pronounced when presence/absence data were analyzed. These conclusions were applied directly to a full assessment of the status of fish assemblages in the Mullica River Basin."}, {"section_title": "THE STATUS OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN THE MULLICA RIVER BASIN", "text": "The Commission's initial study of Mullica River Basin fish assemblages  provided the basis for an expanded fish-sampling program that was carried out between 1995 and 1999. The expanded fish-monitoring program allowed the Commission to increase the baseline inventory of Mullica River Basin fish assemblages and to more fully characterize the status of fish communities within the tributary systems of the basin. Because the nonnative fish encountered during the initial study are typically associated with lakes and ponds, the expanded monitoring program included both streams and impoundments in each of the major Mullica River drainage basins."}, {"section_title": "Fish Surveys", "text": "Fish sampling methods were similar to those used by .

Four sites were not included in the ordinations. These included two unnamed Batsto River tributaries where less than a 100-m section was sampled and two sites (Wading River at Tumbling Dam and Oswego River below Oswego Lake) where pH and specific conductance data were not collected. Both the Wading River and Oswego River sites were located very close to another station along the same stream. Spearman rank correlation and graphical analysis were used to determine if the fish-community composition of streams and impoundments, represented by the DCA ordination axes, varied in relation to selected environmental conditions. Based on the results of the Commission's initial fish study, the first axis site scores of the DCA ordinations were correlated with median pH and specific conductance and the percentage of developed land and agricultural land in a basin. The percentage of wetland agriculture, bankfull-stream width, impoundment area, median channel-plant cover, frequency of occurrence of channel-substrate type, latitude, and longitude were also included in the analysis. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to identify important relationships revealed by the correlation analysis.

In order of decreasing frequency of occurrence, the nonnative fish included the tessellated darter, bluegill, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, golden shiner, and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The tessellated darter was the most frequently encountered nonnative fish species. The yellow perch, a peripheral species that was not found in the Commission's initial survey , occurred at only one site along Hammonton Creek.

The six outliers displayed similar environmental and biological characteristics. Common environmental features included low pH (< 4.7), narrow-ditched channels, and small drainage areas with less than 10% developed land or farmed land within the basin. Five of the six stream reaches were located in abandoned cranberry bogs. The extreme position of these sites was due to their low species richness, composed of three to five native species, and similar species composition. Banded sunfish, redfin pickerel, and eastern mudminnow were found at all six sites. Mud sunfish and chain pickerel were collected at four of the sites. By deleting these six sites from the final analysis, the other sites were spread more evenly along the first axis. The first DCA axis of the final ordination contrasted stream sites with fish assemblages composed entirely of native species with those including both native and nonnative species (Tables 9.1and 9.2, Figure 9.5). The percentage of nonnative species increased along this community gradient (Figure 9.6), which was associated with differences in the range of watershed conditions where the native and nonnative species were found (Table 9.1, Figure 9.7). The order of stream sites along the first DCA axis was associated with increasing pH (r = 0.82), specific conductance (r = 0.62), and the percentage of developed land (r = 0.78) and upland agriculture (r = 0.76) in a basin (Figure 9.8). The gradient was also correlated with longitude (r = -0.57). The p level for all five relationships was < 0.001. A higher percentage of nonnative species was found on the more heavilyaltered western side of the basin, suggesting that the association between longitude and community composition was related to land-use patterns ( Figure  9.9). Neither the percentage of wetland agriculture, basin size, bankfull-channel width, channel sediments, nor median vegetation cover were associated with this stream community gradient. Nonnative species were absent at five sites shown at the disturbed end of the community gradient. The presence of the tadpole madtom was the most obvious common trait among four of these sites.

The absence of nonative species at Union Creek, another site included in this group, may be due to the absence of large impoundments in the drainage basin and the lack of suitable habitat for tessellated darter. The first division of the TWINSPAN classification separated a group of 12 stream sitesfrom all other sites (Figures 9.5 and 9.10). The 12 sites, which represented a non-Pinelands site class, were characterized by high nonnative-species richness. Nonnative fish, primarily the tessellated darter, were found at 29% of the remaining 42 sites, which represented a Pinelands site class.

The first DCA axis contrasted sites with and without nonnative species (Tables 9.1 and 9.2, Figures 9.11 and 9.12). The percentage of nonnative species increased along this community gradient, which was related to the range of watershed conditions associated with each fish species (Figure 9.13).

The p level for all four relationships was < 0.001. The weak relationship between the community gradient represented by the first DCA axis and specific conductance (r = 0.41, p = 0.02), was due largely to the nonlinear relationship between pH and conductance at very low pH values (Chapter 4). As with the stream assemblages, the association between longitude and community composition was related to land-use patterns because most nonnative species were found on the more heavily altered western side of the Mullica River Basin (Figure 9.15). The major difference between the stream and impoundment assemblages was the dominance or near dominance of nonnative species in impoundments within the most heavily altered watersheds. The TWINSPAN classification of impoundments clearly demonstrates this distinction.   The first division of the TWINSPAN classification separated a group of 11 impoundments (non-Pinelands site class), characterized by elevated pH, specific conductance, and a high percentage of altered land (developed land and upland agriculture) in the basins, from the remaining 19 Pinelands sites (Figures 9.11 and 9.16). The number of nonnative species found at the degraded sites ranged from two to five, with a mean (\u00b1 1 SD) of 4.2 \u00b1 1.2 species.

Five frog species and two toad species are native to the region. Based on their geographic affinity, Conant (1979) categorized these native Pinelands anurans as Pine Barrens species and wide-ranging species. Pine Barrens species include the Pine Barrens treefrog (Hyla andersonii) and carpenter frog (Rana virgatipes). In New Jersey, both species are confined to Pinelands habitats. Wideranging species, which are distributed throughout southern New Jersey, include the green frog (Rana clamitans melanota), southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia), northern spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer crucifer), Fowler's toad (Bufo woodhousii fowleri), and eastern spadefoot (Scaphiopus holbrooki holbrooki). The New Jersey chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata kalmi), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor and H. chrysoscelis), northern cricket frog (Acris crepitans crepitans), wood frog (Rana sylvatica sylvatica), pickerel frog (Rana palustris), and bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) are normally unable to enter the Pinelands except in habitats disturbed by human activity. Conant (1979) classified these six nonnative Pinelands anurans as border-entrant species. The low pH of surface waters is considered a major factor preventing the establishment of these species in undisturbed Pinelands habitats (Gosner and Black 1957, Freda and Dunson 1986, Freda and Morin 1984. Anuran assemblages have been used as indicators of environmental degradation in parts of the United States and Canada (Moyle 1973, Hecnar and M'Closkey 1996, Moyle and Randall 1998. Based on evidence that nonnative anurans are less acid tolerant than native species and can enter the region in humanaltered areas (Gosner and Black 1957, Conant 1962, Freda and Morin 1984, Commission scientists began to survey anuran assemblages to evaluate their use as indicators of watershed disturbance. The results of two initial Commission studies Bunnell 2000) provided the basis for a comprehensive survey of the Mullica River watershed."}, {"section_title": "ANURAN ASSEMBLAGES AS INDICATORS OF WATERSHED CONDITIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Basin-wide Anuran Survey", "text": "The Commission's initial basin-wide study (Zampella and Bunnell 2000) compared the anurancommunity composition at survey sites in the more intensely developed and farmed western portion of the Mullica River Basin to those in the less-disturbed eastern portion of the basin. The western portion of the basin, which included the Nescochague Creek, Sleeper Branch, Upper Mullica River, and Batsto River basins, was called the Mullica River system. The eastern portion, referred to as the Wading River system, comprised the Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River basins. Several questions were addressed in the study. First, are there differences in the distribution and abundance of individual anuran species between the two river systems? Second, are there differences in the composition of anuran assemblages between the two systems? Third, is the distribution and abundance of individual anuran species associated with land-use disturbance? Finally, what is the relationship between the bullfrog and native Pinelands anuran species? The presence of bullfrogs in the Pinelands is especially important because this species has been implicated in the decline of native anurans in the western United States (Moyle 1973, Bury and Luckenback 1976, Hammerson 1982, Schwalbe and Rosen 1988, Kupferberg 1997. Eighty-seven sites, representing a range of habitat types, including natural and excavated ponds, forested and nonforested stream crossings, abandoned cranberry bogs, and impoundments, were surveyed in 1993. Ten anuran species, including six native Pinelands species and four border-entrants, were heard vocalizing at these sites. Native species were found throughout the Mullica River Basin, but borderentrant species were heard only in the western portion of the basin. Most of the sites that supported border- entrants were on-stream sites. Bullfrogs, the most frequently encountered border-entrant species, were heard more often at sites located adjacent to upland agriculture and developed land. The native carpenter frog occurred more frequently at unaltered sites. Pine Barrens treefrogs and carpenter frogs were generally absent at sites where bullfrogs were heard vocalizing. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and TWINSPAN (Chapter 6) were used to ordinate and classify species and sites based on presence/absence data. The TWINSPAN classification separated the 87 sites into four relatively distinct anuran assemblages that included a carpenter frog-green frog-leopard frog group, a Pine Barrens treefrogspring peeper group, a spring peeper-Fowler's toadgreen frog-bullfrog group, and a green frog group. The spring peeper-Fowler's toad-green frog-bullfrog group, which included all of the pickerel frog occurrences and most of the cricket frog occurrences, was found more frequently in the Mullica River system. The first axis of the DCA ordination separated bullfrogs, cricket frogs, and pickerel frogs from the other species. This axis also contrasted the carpenter frog-green frog-leopard frog and the Pine Barrens treefrog-spring peeper groups with the spring peeper-Fowler's toad-green frog-bullfrog and the green frog groups. A significant difference in DCA site scores between the eastern and the western portion of the Mullica River Basin was due to the presence of bullfrogs, cricket frogs, and pickerel frogs at sites in the Mullica River system and the general absence of native species at those sites. The results of this initial survey emphasized three important points regarding the use of anuran assemblages as indicators of Pinelands watershed disturbance. First, the presence of individual borderentrant species and assemblages dominated by these species were associated with adjacent upland agriculture and developed land. Second, the general absence of the two Pine Barrens species at sites with bullfrogs indicated that the presence of bullfrogs may adversely affect native-anuran diversity. Finally, because the majority of sites that supported borderentrant species were stream sites, on-stream anuran communities may be better indicators of overall watershed conditions compared to off-stream communities.\nTwelve anuran species were heard during the surveys, including the two Pine Barrens species, four wide-ranging species, and six border-entrant species (Table 10.1). In order of increasing frequency of occurrence, the species found during the survey included the pickerel frog, cricket frog, gray treefrog, chorus frog, wood frog, bullfrog, Pine Barrens treefrog, Fowler's toad, southern leopard frog, carpenter frog, spring peeper, and green frog. The only native Pinelands species that was not heard at any survey site was the eastern spadefoot, a wide-ranging species (Conant 1979). The green frog and the bullfrog were the most frequently encountered native and border-entrant species. As in previous Commission studies Bunnell 2000), Pine Barrens and wide-ranging species were encountered more frequently than any border-entrant species, and borderentrant species were more closely associated with the western portion of the Mullica River Basin (Figure 10.3). Clear differences in breeding phenology, or timing of the breeding period, were evident for some of the species heard during the surveys ( Figure 10.4). The wood frog was the first species to initiate breeding and the northern cricket frog was the last. Several species continued to vocalize beyond the end of the survey period. The breeding phenology results indicate that the surveys successfully captured the vocalization periods for all species. Species richness at the 227 sites ranged from 1 to 9 species. The mean (\u00b1 1 SD) number of species heard at a site was 4.0 \u00b1 1.8. The median value was also 4.0. Total and mean species richness varied among the individual habitat types surveyed (Table 10.1).  Although most species were found at a variety of habitat types, there appeared to be differences in habitat preferences among species (Table 10.1). Pickerel frogs were limited to impoundments, whereas gray treefrogs were absent from this habitat type. Carpenter frogs, green frogs, and spring peepers were the only species heard at forestedstream crossings. Neither the Pine Barrens treefrog nor the carpenter frog were heard at ditches or forested-wetland sites."}, {"section_title": "Pond Communities", "text": "The Commission scientists also conducted a more intensive study of off-stream anuran-pond communities in the Mullica River Basin . In 1996, adult and larval (tadpoles) anurans were surveyed at 14 acid-water ponds located along the transition from forested to agricultural and urban landscapes ( Figure 10.1). The pH in these ponds ranged from 3.9 to 4.4. The primary objective of the study was to determine if adult-anuran assemblages and larval recruitment varied in relation to site-specific environmental factors and local and regional landscape characteristics. Six native species and four border-entrant species were heard during the surveys. The native species included Pine Barrens treefrogs, carpenter frogs, leopard frogs, green frogs, spring peepers, and Fowler's toads. Border-entrants included wood frogs, chorus frogs, gray treefrogs, and cricket frogs. The native species were more frequently encountered and more abundant than any border-entrant species. Border-entrants were heard at only six ponds. Anuran larvae were collected in 11 of the 14 ponds. All were larvae of native-Pinelands species. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to order adult anuran species and ponds based on adult presence/absence data. The first DCA axis, which represented a community gradient, contrasted nativeanuran assemblages with mixed native and border- entrant assemblages. Geographic position was the major factor that distinguished sites with and without border entrant species. Although not a significant result, most of the border-entrant species occurred at sites located close to upland agriculture or developed land. The results of this study suggested that although adults of border-entrant species may be found at Pinelands ponds near altered landscapes, pond acidity may prevent their successful reproduction and recruitment."}, {"section_title": "THE STATUS OF ANURAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE MULLICA RIVER BASIN", "text": "The Commission's initial anuran-assemblage studies Bunnell 2000) provided the basis for an expanded anuran monitoring program.

Using a subset of the basin-wide data, separate analyses were also completed for permanent onstream sites, temporary on-stream sites, and offstream sites (temporary and permanent). Forty-three sites were removed from the pool of 227 sites prior to completing the three separate site-type analyses. Eleven sites were deleted because they were only surveyed for wood frogs. Fourteen sites were deleted because only one species was present. Six on-stream sites located directly adjacent to impoundment survey sites were deleted. Inventories for adjacent survey sites that represented the same habitat type were pooled, reducing ten pairs of survey sites to ten single sites. A set of three adjacent survey sites were also combined as one site. Spearman rank correlation and graphical analysis were used to determine if anuran-community composition, represented by the DCA-ordination axes and TWINSPAN groups, varied in relation to environmental conditions. The permanent on-stream, temporary on-stream, and offstream sites were analyzed separately. For each site type, the first DCA-axis site scores were correlated with the percentage of developed land, upland agriculture, and wetland agriculture in a basin or surrounding area, pH, specific conductance, basin area, habitat-patch size, latitude, and longitude. To assess biogeographic relationships, these axes were also correlated with the percentage of Pine Barrens species, wide-ranging species, and border-entrant species found at each site. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to identify important relationships revealed by the correlation analysis. Because the high density of sampling sites in the basin may influence the outcome of the correlation analyses, these tests were performed primarily to evaluate general trends and the relative strength of the relationships between community gradients and environmental factors. Differences in pH, specific conductance, hydrology, geographic affinity, and adjacent or upstream altered land (developed land and upland agriculture) between TWINSPAN-derived site groups were analyzed graphically. The percentage of sites with Pine Barrens species, wide-ranging species, and border-entrant species present in each of the eight study basins was also compared graphically.

Most permanent on-stream and permanent off-stream sites were located on the right side of the ordination diagram. Temporary on-stream and off-stream sites were concentrated on the left side of the ordination diagram. The unclassified sites were distributed throughout the center of the diagram. The order of anuran species along the first DCA axis of the species ordination also reflected landscape position and hydrology ( Figure 10.6). Wood frogs, chorus frogs, gray treefrogs, Pine Barrens treefrogs, and spring peepers were heard more frequently at temporary off-stream sites. The position of these five species along the first DCA axis contrasted with that of pickerel frogs, cricket frogs, bullfrogs, Fowler's toads, green frogs, and carpenter frogs, which were heard calling at a higher percentage of permanent on-stream sites. Leopard frogs did not show a clear landscape position or hydrologic preference. The TWINSPAN classification of the 227 sites separated a group of 14 sites from the other 213 sites (Figure 10.7). These 14 sites were primarily temporary off-stream sites where wood frogs, chorus frogs, and springer peepers were heard. Although the other 213 sites included all landscape-position and hydrologic-site types, the majority of sites in this group were permanent on-stream sites. A second division of this large site class separated a group composed primarily of permanent-water sites from the other sites. This group of 45 sites included the majority of the cricket frog occurrences and all of the pickerel frog and bullfrog occurrences.

A total of 10 species were heard at the 78 sites, including both Pine Barrens species, the four wide-ranging species, and four of the border-entrant species (Tables 10.3 and 10.4). Pine Barrens species were heard at 68% of the sites and wide-ranging species at 100% of the sites. Border-entrant species were heard at 46% of the sites. With one exception, bullfrogs were present at every site where other border-entrant species occurred. The first DCA axis of the site ordination contrasted sites where only native species were heard with those that included border-entrant species (Figure 10.8). The percentage of Pine Barrens species decreased (r = -0.91, p < 0.001) and the percentage of border-entrant species increased (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) along this community gradient ( Figure 10.9). These relationships reflected differences in the range of watershed conditions where native and nonnative species were present ( Figure 10.10). The ordering of sites along the first DCA axis was associated with increasing pH (n = 43, r = 0.79), specific conductance (n = 43, r = 0.61), and the percentage of developed land (r = 0.75), upland agriculture (r = 0.73), and wetland agriculture (r = 0.43) in the basin ( Figure  10.11).

The p level for all seven of these relationships was < 0.001. The association between latitude and longitude and anuran-community composition was probably related to land-use patterns because borderentrant species were found more frequently on the heavily altered western and southern portions of the Mullica River Basin (Figure 10.3). Neither basin area nor habitat-patch size were associated with the community gradient. The first division of the TWINSPAN classification separated 48 sites characterized by Pine Barrens species (Pinelands site class) from 30 sites with a high percentage of border-entrant species (non-Pinelands site class) ( Figure 10.8). Compared to the Pinelands site class, the non-Pinelands sites class was characterized by elevated pH and specific conductance and a high percentage of altered land in the associated drainage basins ( Figure 10.12). Bullfrogs were present at all but two of the sites in the non-Pinelands site class. Pine Barrens species were heard at only five sites in this group. A second division of the non-Pinelands site class separated five sites that displayed some of the highest pH and specific conductance values.

The percentage of border-entrant species increased along this community gradient (r = 0.65, p < 0.001, Figure  10.14). There was a slight decrease in the percentage of wide-ranging species (r = -0.46, p < 0.03) and no trend for Pine Barrens species along the gradient. The first DCA axis of the site ordination was correlated with decreasing latitude (r = -0.54, p < 0.008), which indicated that sites in the southern portion of the Mullica River Basin had a higher percentage of border-entrant species. Neither the percentage of developed land, upland agriculture, or wetland agriculture in a basin, habitat-patch area, longitude, or basin area were related to the community gradient.

A total of 11 species were heard at the 83 sites, including both Pine Barrens species, the four wide-ranging species, and five border-entrant species (Tables 10.3 and 10.4). Pine Barrens species were heard at 75% of the sites and wide-ranging species at 100%. Border-entrant species were heard at 55% of the sites. The wood frog and bullfrog were the most frequently encountered borderentrant species.

Wetland agriculture, latitude, and habitatpatch area were not associated with the community gradient. Unlike the results for the permanent on-stream sites, the off-stream community gradient, represented by the first DCA axis, was only weakly associated with increasing pH (n = 44, r = 0.38, p < 0.01) and was not related to specific conductance ( Figure 10.19). The lack of a strong relationship between the community gradient and these two parameters may be due to the high acidity found at most of these sites. Only four of the 44 sites where pH was measured had a median pH > 5.0. These four sites were among those with the highest DCA scores and adjacent altered-land values. Bullfrogs were heard at all four sites and Pine Barrens species were absent. The pH may have been elevated at these sites either because they were within an altered landscape or because they were excavated ponds. Compared to natural ponds, excavated ponds typically displayed elevated pH and lower specific conductance values ( Figure 10.20). Similar differences in pond chemistry were observed between natural and artificial ponds in the Commission's initial anuran study ) and pondvegetation study (Chapter 8). The first division of the TWINSPAN classification for off-stream sites separated 15 sites, characterized by a high percentage of border-entrant species (non-Pinelands site class), from the other 68 sites (Pinelands site class, Figure 10.21). The non-Pinelands site class was characterized by permanentwater sites and the Pinelands sites class was dominated by temporary-water habitats. Adjacent altered land, specific conductance, and pH were generally higher in the non-Pinelands site class compared to the Pinelands site class. However, conductance and pH were only measured at four of the 15 sites in the non-Pinelands site class. The Pinelands sites class was characterized by a higher percentage of Pine Barrens species. Although bullfrogs were present at seven sites, the number of vocalizing individuals was low compared to that for Pine Barrens species, which were found at all seven sites."}, {"section_title": "Drainage Basin Characterizations Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River", "text": "Sites in the Wading River, Oswego River, and Bass River basins were dominated by native species and generally lacked border-entrant species ( Figure  10.22). Pine Barrens species occurred at almost as many sites as wide-ranging species in these basins. In the three site-type ordination analyses, the majority of the sites from these drainages were associated with the undisturbed end of the community gradients ( Figure  10.23). Pine Barrens treefrogs and carpenter frogs were heard at a large percentage of the sites, and bullfrogs were not present at any of the sites surveyed in these basins. Other border-entrant species, including wood frogs and gray treefrogs, were heard at only eight sites. Six of these sites were excavations. The higher pH of excavated habitats may provide an opportunity for pond-breeding borderentrant species to survive in landscapes dominated by acid-water habitats Black 1957, Freda andDunson 1986)."}, {"section_title": "ANNUAL ANURAN SURVEYS", "text": "Amphibians have been declining globally since the late 1950's and early 1960's (Houlahan et al. 2000).

Only 15% is developed or farmed. The basin comprises several major stream systems that display a diverse range of land-use patterns. The current status of the aquatic and wetland resources in each system is clearly related to these patterns. The surface-water quality and biological communities found in forested stream basins contrast sharply with those attributes found in basins with a high percentage of upland agriculture and developed land. The results obtained using different ecological indicators were remarkably similar. Changes in the composition of stream vegetation, fish assemblages, and anuran (frog and toad) communities paralleled gradients of increasing land-use intensity and waterquality degradation. Surface waters characterized by elevated pH and dissolved solids and biological communities that included nonnative plant and animal species were common in stream basins with a high percentage of developed land and upland agriculture. These basins were concentrated on the western side of the Mullica River Basin. Acid waters and typical Pinelands aquatic and wetland communities characterized survey sites in the forest-dominated eastern portion of the drainage. Wetland agriculture, primarily cranberry and blueberry farms, was more frequently encountered in the eastern basins. Most of the surface-water impacts observed in the basin were associated with nonpoint sources of nutrients and other dissolved solids. Due to variations in ground-water flow patterns and travel times, the current status of surface waters reflects the long-term effects of land-use activities. Temporal factors also influence the status of biological communities because water-quality changes generally precede the establishment of nonnative plant and animal species. The proximity of sources of nonnative species and the ability of these species to colonize new areas are additional factors that may influence the relationship between land-use and the species composition at a site. Most developed land and upland agriculture was concentrated in the headwaters of the western drainage basins. Although the water quality and biological integrity of these systems generally improved downstream as streams passed through Wharton State Forest, the effect of upstream land-use activities was still apparent. In contrast, studies of Atlantic white cedar swamps and Pinelands ponds indicated that plant and animal communities in forested landscapes appear to be buffered from upstream land-use disturbances that impact nearby instream communities. The land-cover composition of the Mullica River Basin was similar in 1979 and 1991. Most land-cover transitions involved new development or the conversion of one agricultural land use to another and occurred in the appropriate Pinelands management areas. Long-term trends displayed by Atlantic white cedar wetlands demonstrated that the landscape is dynamic."}, {"section_title": "APPLICATIONS", "text": "The relationships revealed through the Mullica River Basin studies offer insight about the eventual response of aquatic and wetland resources to various landscapepattern scenarios within the Mullica River Basin and other regions in the Pinelands. The results of the studies may provide general descriptive models with land-use policy applications. The long-term environmental-monitoring studies also helped to refine the concept of essential character introduced in the Pinelands legislation and the Comprehensive Management Plan. Pinelands reference-site conditions were characterized and sets of reliable ecological indicators were established. These concepts can be applied directly to assessments of other Pinelands watersheds and associated aquatic and wetland communities. The concepts can also be used to identify critical areas for acquisition. As the Commission embarks on its Mullica River Basin watershed-management program, the technical information included in this report can provide the information needed to accurately determine the status of surface waters in the watershed and may serve as the basis for discussions on watershed-management policy issues. The land-use trend study demonstrated the usefulness of maps produced by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Rutgers University Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. Future maps created through these efforts can be used to obtain accurate measurements of landscape changes in the Mullica River Basin and other areas of the Pinelands. The water quality and biological information collected through the Mullica River Basin program represents a baseline data set that can be used for future assessments of the basin's aquatic and wetland resources. As previously discussed, it is reasonable to expect a lag between upland land-use disturbances and changes in surface-water quality and biological-community composition. Absent any unexpected changes in landscape patterns, landscape transitions and associated ecological responses will most likely be subtle."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "text": "Because changes in pH and specific conductance usually precede shifts in biological community composition, it may be useful to conduct a complete Mullica River Basin assessment of these two waterquality indicators in 2006. Repeat biological assessments should be completed at sites where an increase in these measures is found. Additionally, a representative subset of the entire network of biological sampling sites should be surveyed at that time. The need for a full-scale reassessment of the entire basin can be based on the results of these reduced-scale studies. Annual surveys of the 20 off-stream anuran-monitoring sites should continue uninterrupted. Finally, the knowledge and experience gained through the Mullica River Basin monitoring program should be applied towards establishing an environmental data base for other Pinelands watersheds.
