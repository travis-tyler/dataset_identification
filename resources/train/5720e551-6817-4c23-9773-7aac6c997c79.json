[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mendelian adult-onset leukodystrophies are a spectrum of rare inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system . Among these, Cerebral Autosomal Dominant and Recessive Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL and CARASIL), Cerebroretinal vasculopathy (CRV), Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Hereditary diffuse Leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS), Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) present with rapidly progressive dementia as dominant feature and are caused by mutations in NOTCH3, HTRA1, TREX1, ARSA, CSF1R, EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, EIF2B5, respectively. Given the rare incidence of these disorders and the lack of unequivocally diagnostic features, leukodystrophies are frequently misdiagnosed with common sporadic dementing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), raising the question of whether these overlapping phenotypes may be explained by shared genetic risk factors. To investigate this intriguing hypothesis, we have combined gene expression analysis 1) in 6 different AD mouse strains (APPPS1, HOTASTPM, HETASTPM, TPM, TAS10 and TAU), at 5 different developmental stages (Embryo [E15], 2 months, 4 months, 8 months and 18 months), 2) in APPPS1 primary cortical neurons under stress conditions (oxygen-glucose deprivation) and single-variant and single-gene (c-alpha and SKAT tests) based genetic screening in a cohort composed of 332 Caucasian late-onset AD patients and 676 Caucasian elderly controls. Csf1r was significantly overexpressed (Log2FC>1, adj. p-val<0.05) in the cortex and hippocampus of aged HOTASTPM mice with extensive A\u03b2 core dense plaque pathology. We identified 3 likely pathogenic mutations in CSF1R TK domain (p.L868R, p.Q691H and p.H703Y) in our discovery and validation cohort, composed of 465 AD and MCI Caucasian patients from the UK. Moreover, NOTCH3 was a significant hit in the c-alpha test (adj p-val = 0.01). Adult onset Mendelian leukodystrophy genes are not common factors implicated in AD. Nevertheless, our study suggests a potential pathogenic link between NOTCH3, CSF1R and sporadic LOAD, that warrants further investigation."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "caused by mutations in NOTCH3, HTRA1, TREX1, ARSA, CSF1R, EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, EIF2B5, respectively (Joutel et al., 1996) , (Hara et al., 2009) , (Richards et al., 2007) , (Fluharty et al., 1991) , (Rademakers et al., 2011) , (Scali et al., 2006) . Given the rare incidence of these disorders (5/100 000 to only few cases reported), the lack of peculiar and distinctive 1) clinical features, generally represented by rapidly progressive dementia, behavioural changes, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs and, less commonly, ischemic strokes and epileptic seizures; 2) MRI lesion patterns, normally characterized by T2weighted periventricular and subcortical, patchy and later confluent white matter hyperintensities with prominent frontal involvement, and 3) neuropathological features, frequently a combination of diverse neurodegenerative hallmarks, these rare Mendelian disorders are most frequently underrecognized and misdiagnosed with common sporadic dementias such as Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD). On the other hand, motor features like ataxia and spasticity may appear in the course of AD progression, particularly in the cases caused by or associated to PSEN1 mutations (Rossor et al., 2010) and AD patients may display MRI patterns and neuropathological features typical of adult-onset leukodystrophies (Smith et al., 2000) (Marnane et al., 2016) (Barber et al., 1999) (Guerreiro et al., 2013) , suggesting a potential common pathogenic ground.\nIn the past 10 years, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) paved the way for groundbreaking discoveries in AD, showing that Mendelian rare disorders offer a unique window into the M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 sporadic complex traits and, particularly, that rare alleles in TREM2, TYROBP and NOTCH3, causative for adult-onset leukodystrophies, significantly influence the susceptibility for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013) (Guerreiro et al., 2012) . Moreover, the sequencing of different mouse strains showed extensive similarities between mouse and human genome and validated the importance of using mouse models to illuminate the genetics of human diseases (Cheng et al., 2014) , (Yue et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, NGS still presents 2 main challenges: 1) the huge amount of data generated is difficult to mine and 2) the investigation of rare coding variants requires several thousands of samples. Consequently, the need for experimental methods that accurately identify critical genes and strategies to empower association studies became priorities. Therefore, we have applied a combination of cortical and hippocampal gene expression analysis in 6 diverse AD mouse strains (APPPS1, HOTASTPM, HETASTPM, TPM, TAS10 and TAU), at 5 different developmental stages (embryo [E15], 2 months, 4months, 8months and 18 months) to comprehensively study leukodystrophy gene expression pattern in relation to the progression of AD neuropathology and under stress conditions such as oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which represents an in vitro model of ischemic stroke, a common feature in several adultonset leukodystrophies and frequent comorbidity in AD. We then used exome and genome sequencing data in a cohort composed of 332 Caucasian late-onset AD patients and 676\nCaucasian elderly controls to investigate rare coding variability in these main adult-onset Mendelian leukodystrophy genes. Among the studied genes, Csf1r was the only gene significantly overexpressed (Log2FC>1, p-val<0.05) in AD mouse models and its expression tightly correlated with the severity of core dense plaque deposition. Moreover, we identified a total of 3 rare variants in CSF1R tyrosine kinase (TK) domain and TK flanking regions (p.L868R and p.D565N, p.G957R, respectively) present only in cases and very likely pathogenic. We then screened CSF1R in an independent cohort composed of 465 MCI and AD cases, identifying 2 additional mutations in CSF1R TK domain (p.Q691H and p.H703Y).\nFinally, NOTCH3 was a significant hit in the gene-based analysis (adj p-value=0.01), suggesting a potential role as disease modifier. We conclude that rare coding variability in adult-onset Mendelian leukodystrophy genes is not a common risk factor for AD. However, CSF1R coding variants clustering in the TK domain and NOTCH3 may influence AD susceptibility."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Adult-onset Leukodystrophy gene selection", "text": "The selected genes are all Mendelian leukodystrophy causative genes with a core clinical hallmark represented by adult-onset subacute dementia with frontal predominance revealed by T2 weighted magneto resonance imaging (MRI) ( Table S1 ).

Adult APPPS1 data for hippocampus were available only for 2 months of age, where no plaques were reported but only rare A\u03b2 oligomers in cortex and surrounding cortical vessels ( Fig. S1) . Finally,\nconsidering that ischemic stroke is a common feature in several leukodystrophies and frequent comorbidity in AD, we used an in vitro model of ischemic stroke and performed OGD experiments in APPPS1 primary cortical neurons to test whether leukodystrophy gene expression pattern may have significantly differed between APPPS1 and WT mice under stress conditions\nWe do not report any significant differential expression in Arsa, Csf1r, Eif2b1, Eif2b2, Eif2b3, Eif2b4, Eif2b5, Htra1, Notch3 and Trex1 until the development of severe AD pathology, markedly pronounced in the most aggressive AD strain studied, HOTASTPM, homozygous for the Swedish mutation APP p.K670N/M671L and PSEN1 p.M146V, 8 months of age ( Fig.   2a-d , Table S3 and S4).

Moreover, Csf1r overexpression positively correlated also with tau pathology, suggesting that Csf1r upregulation is not A\u03b2 plaque specific.

In line with this observation, Csf1r and its ligands (Csf1 and Il34), Grn, Trem2 and Aif2 were significantly overexpressed in both APPPS1 and WT adult hippocampi compared to the embryonal ones (Log2FC=4, 2.45, 7.9, 1.5, 2.24, 3.4 and 4.2, 2.7, 7.9, 1.77, 3.1 and 3.8, respectively)( Table   S5 ).

Therefore, we have investigated TREX1 protein levels in both APPPS1 and WT adult brains and we do not report any macroscopically significant difference ( Fig. S2cI-IV) .

Csf1r was co-expressed and shared the same expression pattern with Trem2, Tyrobp and Grn, critical genes expressed on microglia, whose loss of function mutation in homozygosity is causative for adult-onset leukodystrophies such as Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL) (TREM2 and TYROBP) (Paloneva et al., 1993) , and in heterozygosity causes FTLD-TDP (GRN) or is a significant risk factor for sporadic AD (TREM2) (Guerreiro et al., 2013) and whose overexpression is protective and limits AD neuropathology through a very effective clearance of A\u03b2 plaques (GRN, TREM2) (Minami et al., 2014) . Notably, in all the strains, Csf1r and Grn degree of expression correlated and this was generally one third of Tyrobp and Trem2 overall upregulation (Fig. 3 , Table S3 and S4). This effect was not simply due to the aging process: we do not report significant differential expression in Csf1r, Grn, Trem2 and Tyrobp in the cortex and hippocampus of WT mice between 2 and 18 months of age (-0.04<Log2FC<0.2 and 0.04<Log2FC<0.4 in hippocampus and cortex, respectively) ( Table S3 and "}, {"section_title": "2009)", "text": "By contrast, no differential expression of any adult-onset leukodystrophy gene was observed in the E15 hippocampi and in primary cortical neurons after OGD experiments between APPPS1 and WT strains, likely given the fact that these genes, although expressed in neurons, mainly exert a critical role on microglia (TREX1, CSF1R), astrocytes (NOTCH3, HTRA1) and endothelial cells (NOTCH3, HTRA1, TREX1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B5)(http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) , that are minimally present in E15 hippocampi and primary cortical neuronal cultures.\nIn our discovery and validation cohorts we detected 3 rare coding variants in the TK domain of CSF1R in 3 late-onset AD cases, one of these neuropathologically confirmed. Moreover, we report 2 cases harbouring rare mutations in the TK flanking regions (aa 538-580 and aa 911-972, encoded by exon 12 and 22, respectively), where an additional causative mutation for HDLS has been recently described (c.1736G>A, p.R579Q) (Ghadiri et al., 2014) . These variants are very likely pathogenic: cluster to highly conserved domain among homologous proteins and different species (average PhyloP and PhastCons scores= 2.2 and 0.6, respectively)( Fig. 4i-m) and have been detected only in cases.\nMoreover, CSF1R p.L868R is a functional mutation as it was associated with a reduced expression of the mutated allele ( Fig. 4h) and decreased CSF1R expression in entorhinal cortex, a region primarily affected in AD and generally displaying CSF1R upregulation in AD patients (Fig 5a and b) . Importantly, a different amino acid change, clustering within the same codon (p.L868P) has been reported as de novo mutation, causative for HDLS (Rademakers et al., 2011) . Remarkably, to date, any missense mutation in Mendelian gene domains harbouring heterozygous causative mutations for autosomal dominant disorders such as familial AD and FTD (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 and MAPT) has always been reported as pathogenic ( Table S12 , http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations/). The only exception is represented by APP p.A673T, which is a very rare protective factor for AD (Jonsson et al., 2012) . In addition, an intronic SNP in CSF1R, rs1010101, displayed a trend towards association (adj p-val=2E-4), in a Genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in Caucasian LOAD patients (Wijsman et al., 2011) , supporting CSF1R possible role in LOAD progression.\nCSF1R mutation carriers presented a homogeneous phenotype, closely resembling HDLS.\nFirst, the symptom at onset was a memory deterioration followed by behavioural changes in 3/3 carriers. Second, the T2-weighted MRI, available for 2 patients, showed symmetric patchy periventricular hyperintensities, mainly pronounced in the frontal lobe (Patient E) and bilateral lesions localized to the centrum semiovale (Patient F) (Fig. 4b) , that represent common MRI findings in HDLS patients (Ghadiri et al., 2014) , (Rademakers et al., 2011 ) (Boiss\u00e9 et al., 2010 (Mateen et al., 2010) . Finally, senile plaques, amyloid angiopathy and M A N U S C R I P T\nA C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 16 tau tangles have been reported also in the cortex and hippocampus of 2 familial and one sporadic HDLS patients (Baba et al., 2006) (Browne et al., 2003) . Importantly, these 3 HDLS patients displaying AD neuropathological hallmarks presented an overall early age at onset (average 54 years [range 78-32y]), developed Parkinsonism, atypical Parkinsonism and motor impairment with increasing rigidity (Table S13) . By contrast, only Patient F (20%) displayed intermittent mild rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia, arguing for Parkinsonism, however within a neurological picture already dominated by cerebrovascular disorders, and\nPatient H reported no sign of motor impairment beside 2 falls in few months. Nevertheless, although an earlier age at onset, Parkinsonism and distinctive motor features may be more common in HDLS patients presenting AD neuropathology than AD cases carrying CSF1R TK mutations, the average disease duration for both these HDLS and AD patients was 7 years.\nTherefore, in the absence of accurate differential diagnostic criteria, this combination of clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological features strikingly overlapping makes the definitive neurological diagnosis a real conundrum. The fact that potentially pathogenic mutations in the TK domain in heterozygosity may be detected either in databases and apparently healthy controls or give rise to both HDLS or being rare risk factors for AD may be due to different factors modifying the mutation penetrance (Karle et al., 2013) .\nAnalogously to GRN missense mutations in AD and FTD, CSF1R mutation penetrance may be influenced by APOE genotype, aging, disease duration or comorbidities such as cerebrovascular accidents, for which CSF1R has been already shown to play a critical protective role (Luo et al., 2013) . In addition, It may be plausible that the majority of HDLS patients may not display AD neuropathology due to the rapid progression of the disease (Baba et al., 2006) .\nFinally, NOTCH3 was a significant hit in the gene-based analysis (c-alpha test, adj p-val= 0.01). The signal was driven both by a common synonymous variant (p.P1521P)( Table S9) , that may influence gene expression (Sauna and Kimchi-Sarfaty, 2011 ) and 3 rare coding variants with large effect size (p.V1952M, p.V1183M, p.H170R, 2.73<0R<1.63), whose carrier frequency was between 2 and 3 times higher in cases compared to controls, although not significant (Table S6 and S10). Importantly, these rare variants (p.V1952M, p.V1183M, p.H170R) have been already reported to be significantly associated with severity of white matter lesions in elderly with hypertension (Schmidt et al., 2011) , suggesting a M A N U S C R I P T\nA C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 17 potential role as disease modifier in LOAD. In addition, we report a heterozygous pathogenic gain of cysteine mutation in NOTCH3 (p.R578C) detected in one control and already reported in a Korean patient with clinical suspicious CADASIL , implying that the penetrance of NOTCH3 mutations is variable .\nTherefore, although canonical NOTCH3 mutations causative for CADASIL are highly stereotyped: 1) cluster in epidermal growth factor-like repeat domains (EGFR), 2) in exon 3 and 4 and 3) consist in the gain or loss of cysteine, nevertheless, our study reports a possible synergetic effect of common and rare variants in NOTCH3 potentially influencing AD susceptibility through an increased risk for small vessel disease or white matter lesions. Our hypotheses are supported by a growing body of evidence showing that 1) NOTCH3 common variants (rs1043994, rs10404382, rs10423702, rs1043997) are significantly associated with white matter lesion in elderly with hypertension (Schmidt et al., 2011) and 2) rare noncysteine mutations may be pathogenic as they have been reported in Korean and Japanese CADASIL patients, in a French case with small vessel disease and have been associated to severe white matter lesions in elderly patients (Mizuno et al., 2008) (Fouillade et al., 2008 ) (Schmidt et al., 2011) . Importantly, our findings add evidence to the pathogenic link between AD and CADASIL, displaying clinical shared features and rarely, as only few cases have been reported, neuropathological hallmarks characterized by A\u03b2 plaques, amyloid angiopathy and neurofibrillary tangles (Thijs et al., 2003) (Guerreiro et al., 2012) (Gray et al., 1994 ) (Paquet et al., 2010) . Biologically, presenilins cleaving both APP and NOTCH3 may bridge the gap between AD and CADASIL. However, whether NOTCH3 mutations or differential expression may accelerate a pre-existing AD or AD may contribute to CADASIL exacerbation remains to be elucidated.\nIn summary, adult-onset Mendelian leukodystrophy genes are not common and critical factors in AD, therefore the genetic screening plays a pivotal role in the differential diagnosis. However, genetically diagnosed HDLS and CADASIL patients may display clinical, "}, {"section_title": "Figure S1", "text": "A.
