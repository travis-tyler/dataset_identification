[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The use of the term sarcopenia to describe the age-related loss in skeletal muscle and its functional consequences is relatively recent. However, interest in the relationship of muscle mass to strength and function predates the concept of sarcopenia as researchers have attempted to understand differences in mass and strength between men and women, young and old. Most of these studies are cross-sectional comparisons in which muscle mass and strength tend to be linearly related, so that those with more muscle tend to be stronger. This article focuses instead on some potential problems with the sarcopenia-function association in old age and presents what little data exist from longitudinal population studies addressing the effect of sarcopenia over time."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "cle mass as well as current weight (Muller et al. 1995) ."}, {"section_title": "BODY WEIGHT AS A DETERMINANT", "text": "Lastly, despite the association with greater strength, heavier OF MUSCLE MASS body weight is associated with poorer functional health sta-In relatively sedentary populations, such as the elderly, a tus (Launer et al. 1994 ), suggesting that the relationship of major determinant of muscle mass is body weight.

Apart from clinical trials to increase muscle mass (Fiatarone et al. 1990 ), most longitudinal studies have examined change in strength only, particularly grip strength and lower extremity strength.\nGrip strength. Clement (1974) measured repeated grip strength in a French population of 369 men and 162 women twice over 5 y; 109 men and 55 women were retested a third time. Extrapolating the data, longitudinal loss in grip strength was estimated to be about 60% from ages 25 to 90 y and to accelerate with very old age. No mass measurements were This finding parallels the work of Bassey and Harries (1993), who examined longitudinal change in grip strength over 4 y in 620 men and women ages 65 y and older. Over the course was hypothesized to be the major determinant of strength loss. of the study, grip strength declined 12% in men and 19% in A second small study included 14 healthy survivors studied women.
