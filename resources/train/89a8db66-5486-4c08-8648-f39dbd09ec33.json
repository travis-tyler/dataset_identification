[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mounting evidence indicates that the polygenic basis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be harnessed to identify individuals at greatest risk for cognitive decline. We have previously developed and validated a polygenic hazard score comprising of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms for predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia age of onset. In this study, we examined whether polygenic hazard scores are associated with: (i) regional tracer uptake using amyloid PET; (ii) regional volume loss using longitudinal MRI; (iii) post-mortem regional amyloid-b protein and tau associated neurofibrillary tangles; and (iv) four common non-Alzheimer's pathologies. Even after accounting for APOE, we found a strong association between polygenic hazard scores and amyloid PET standard uptake volume ratio with the largest effects within frontal cortical regions in 980 older individuals across the disease spectrum, and longitudinal MRI volume loss within the entorhinal cortex in 607 older individuals across the disease spectrum. We also found that higher polygenic hazard scores were associated with greater rates of cognitive and clinical decline in 632 nondemented older individuals, even after controlling for APOE status, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume. In addition, the combined model that included polygenic hazard scores, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume resulted in a better fit compared to a model with only imaging markers. Neuropathologically, we found that polygenic hazard scores were associated with regional post-mortem amyloid load and neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, even after accounting for APOE, validating our imaging findings. Lastly, polygenic hazard scores were associated with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathology. Beyond APOE, we show that in living subjects, polygenic hazard scores were associated with amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in susceptible brain regions. Polygenic hazard scores may also be useful for the identification of individuals at the highest risk for developing multi-aetiological dementia."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Beyond the \"4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), there is increasing awareness that the genetic basis or architecture of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is polygenic (Escott-Price and Jones, 2017). Alzheimer's disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been aggregated into polygenic scores for disease prediction (Sabuncu et al., 2012; Escott-Price et al., 2015 Chouraki et al., 2016; Mormino et al., 2016) . Given the recent recommendations of the National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer's Association for a research framework focusing on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with biomarkers in living people (Jack et al., 2018) , it is increasingly important to elucidate the relationship of Alzheimer's disease polygenic scores with markers of amyloid deposition, pathologic tau and neurodegeneration.\nAlthough polygenic scores have been found to be associated with neurodegeneration in select brain regions (Sabuncu et al., 2012; Harrison et al., 2016; Desikan et al., 2017; Kauppi et al., 2018) and whole brain amyloid deposition (Mormino et al., 2016; Voyle et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2018; , few, if any, studies have evaluated the relationship between Alzheimer's disease polygenic scores, longitudinal volume loss and amyloid deposition in regions of interest across the entire cerebrum. Integrating common genetic variants into an age-dependent survival analysis framework, we have shown that a polygenic hazard score (PHS) can quantify Alzheimer's disease dementia age of onset, even among APOE \"3/3 individuals, who constitute the majority of all individuals with Alzheimer's disease dementia (Desikan et al., 2017) . We have previously shown that a high PHS was associated with (i) faster longitudinal cognitive decline; and (ii) postmortem and CSF/PET amyloid and tangle pathology, even in cognitively normal older individuals who are APOE \"4 non-carriers (Tan et al., 2017 . However, the observation of individuals with a high PHS but low levels of in vivo and post-mortem Alzheimer's disease pathology, and vice versa (Tan and Desikan, 2018) suggests the need to further understand the associations of polygenic risk with Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's pathobiology.\nUsing multimodal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), we systematically investigated the relationship between Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk and regional in vivo and post-mortem markers of Alzheimer's associated pathology and neurodegeneration. Beyond APOE, we examined whether PHS is associated with: (i) regional tracer uptake using amyloid PET; (ii) regional volume loss using longitudinal MRI; (iii) post-mortem regional amyloid-b protein and tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles; and (iv) four common non-Alzheimer's disease pathologies.

Cohort demographics from ROSMAP are summarized in Table 2 .\nWe used linear regression to investigate the relationships of PHS (centred and scaled) with regional neuropathology (specifically, amyloid-b protein and tau associated neuronal neurofibrillary tangles identified through molecularly specific immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis). We investigated regional amyloid and tangles in eight regions of interest, namely hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, midfrontal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, angular gyrus, calcarine cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior frontal cortex. Amyloid and tangle measures are the square-root of the percentage area occupied by amyloid or tangles in each of these regions. In all analyses, we co-varied for sex and age at death.

Specifically, we investigated whether PHS was associated with cerebrovascular disease pathology, Lewy body pathology, medial temporal lobe sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology (Pick's, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, FTLD with TDP-43, and other taupathies).

Briefly, we first delineated 1854 Alzheimer's-associated SNPs at P 5 10 \u00c05 using genotyped data from 17 008 Alzheimer's disease dementia cases and 37 154 controls from stage 1 of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. Next, using genotyped data from 6409 Alzheimer's disease dementia patients and 9386 older controls from phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium dataset and corrected for baseline allele frequencies from the European genotypes from 1000 Genomes Project, we integrated these SNPs into a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model. The survival model involves the stepwise selection of one SNP that most minimized the Martingale regression residuals at every step, and stops if no SNPs can further minimize the residuals. The top five genetic principal components (to control for population substructure), sex, and APOE \"2 and \"4 variants were controlled for during the stepwise procedure to generate the parameter estimates (i.e. log hazard ratios) for each of the final 31 SNPs identified.

In these analyses, we controlled for age at baseline, sex, education, and APOE status (binarized as having at least one copy of the \"4 allele versus none) to assess the effects of PHS beyond APOE (Ge et al., 2018) . Florbetapir SUVR data in ADNI were determined by mean uptake in the cortical grey matter normalized by the whole cerebellum, based on Freesurfer 5.3 segmentation and parcellation of the individuals' MRI that has been coregistered with the corresponding PET scan (Jagust et al., 2009 ). Left and right hemisphere's florbetapir SUVR (normalized by the whole cerebellum) in 34 regions of interest from the Desikan-Killiany atlas in Freesurfer (Desikan et al., 2006) were averaged and we controlled for multiple comparisons at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 50.05. As follow-up, we conducted the same analysis in a subset of 323 cognitively normal individuals, co-varying for age, sex, and education. Next, we used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the relationship of PHS with longitudinal volume change in 33 regions of interest from the Desikan-Killiany atlas in Freesurfer (Desikan et al., 2006) in 607 individuals across the disease spectrum from ADNI1 (Table 1) . Longitudinal volume change was quantified using quantitative anatomical regional change (QUARC; Holland et al., 2009; Holland and Dale, 2011) . Left and right hemisphere's volume change were averaged, and we controlled for multiple comparisons at an FDR of 50.05. In these analyses, we controlled for age at baseline, sex, education, and APOE status. We then examined the simple effects by comparing slopes of volume loss over time for individuals at high and low levels of PHS. We defined high PHS by 1 standard deviation (SD) above the mean (at $84 percentile) and low PHS by 1 SD below the mean (at $16 percentile) (Aiken and West, 1991; Tan et al., 2017) .\nNext, we used linear-mixed effects models to examine whether PHS was independently associated with longitudinal cognitive decline and clinical progression beyond frontal florbetapir SUVR, cross-sectional entorhinal cortex volume, and APOE. We restricted analyses to 632 non-demented individuals classified at baseline as cognitively normal (n = 229) or MCI (n = 403), and with both amyloid PET and MRI scans at baseline. To minimize multiple comparisons, we focused on frontal florbetapir SUVR given the known frontal cortex vulnerability for amyloid accumulation (Grimmer et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2017) . To minimize multiple comparisons, we focused on the entorhinal cortex as it is one of the earliest regions susceptible to Alzheimer's neurodegeneration (Van Hoesen et al., 1991; G\u00f3 mez-Isla et al., 1996; Desikan et al., 2009; Thaker et al., 2017) . We defined cognitive decline using change scores in two domains, namely executive function and memory (Crane et al., 2012) based on composite standardized scores developed using the ADNI neuropsychological battery and validated using confirmatory factor analysis. We defined clinical progression using change scores in Cognitive Dementia Rating -Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). We examined whether the higher PHS was associated with greater cognitive decline and clinical progression rate, controlling for frontal PET SUVR, entorhinal cortex volume, baseline age, sex, education, APOE status, and their interactions with time, using the following linear-mixed effects model:\nHere, \u00c1c = cognitive decline (executive function or memory) or clinical progression (CDR-SB) rate, \u00c1t = change in time from baseline visit (years), and (1|subject) specifies the random intercept. We were specifically interested in PHS \u00c2 \u00c1t, whereby a significant interaction indicates differences in rates of decline, as a function of differences in PHS, after accounting for effects of frontal amyloid deposition, cross-sectional entorhinal cortex volume, APOE, and other covariates. If the interaction was significant, we then examined the simple effects by comparing slopes of cognitive decline and clinical progression over time for individuals who were high (at$84 percentile) or low PHS (at $16 percentile). As follow-up, we conducted the same analysis in the subset of 229 cognitively normal individuals.

There were too few individuals with Pick's and corticobasal degeneration to generate estimates for these two FTLD pathologies."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Beyond APOE, we show that PHS is associated with crosssectional regional amyloid PET SUVR and longitudinal regional brain atrophy in individuals across the disease spectrum. The strongest effects for amyloid deposition were found in frontal brain regions such as the rostral middle frontal cortex and frontal pole while the strongest effects for brain atrophy were found in the entorhinal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, middle and inferior temporal cortex. Together, these results illustrate that in living persons PHS was associated with amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in susceptible brain regions.\nBuilding on prior work (Kauppi et al., 2018; , we found that PHS was associated with cognitive and clinical decline in non-demented older individuals, even after controlling for frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume. Although strongly associated with PET and MRI biomarkers, PHS may provide additional information for identifying older individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease associated decline beyond imaging biomarkers. In addition, the combined model that included PHS, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume resulted in a better fit for quantifying cognitive and clinical decline than a model with only imaging markers. The current study adds to the literature that PHS may have utility in disease screening and risk stratification (Kauppi et al., 2018; . This approach implies that the most relevant use of polygenic scores may be for disease prognosis through risk stratification, as opposed to diagnosis (Tan and Desikan, 2018; Torkamani et al., 2018) . While genetics by themselves do not quantify pathological change (Jack et al., 2018) , our combined results illustrate that polygenic information may be useful as an 'enrichment' marker for in vivo amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration and improves quantification of imaging biomarkers for detecting individuals most likely to develop Alzheimer's disease associated changes along the amyloid-b deposition, pathological tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)] biological construct. Although there is currently no disease-modifying therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, our results suggest that clinical risk (quantified by PET and MRI biomarkers) and polygenic risk may help determine the action threshold for therapeutic intervention by evaluation of combined risk (Torkamani et al., 2018) .\nIn the ROSMAP community-based cohort, we found that PHS was associated with regional post-mortem amyloid load and neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, validating our imaging findings. While regional differences were not evident for amyloid load, PHS was most strongly associated with tangles in the inferior temporal cortex. Crucially, we found these relationships even when accounting for APOE status, suggesting that polygenic information beyond APOE is associated with regional amyloid load and tangles. The absence of a statistically significant association of PHS with hippocampal tangles after controlling for APOE may suggest that genetic relationships with hippocampal tangles are driven relatively more by APOE compared to polygenic influence, or greater variation as a function of polygenic influence. The strength of the associations of PHS with amyloid load appears to be relatively homogenous across regions, while showing the strongest associations with tangles in the inferior temporal cortex, and weakest in the pericalcarine cortex. These relationships are consistent with the pathological staging of amyloid and tau propagation (Godert, 2015) , suggesting that PHS may be useful for identifying individuals who will eventually develop amyloid and tau pathology corresponding to the most severe disease post-mortem pathological stages.\nIn the NACC cohort, we found that besides Alzheimer's pathology, PHS was also associated with Lewy body and cerebrovascular disease pathology. These findings are consistent with cerebrovascular pathology being extremely common (up to 50%) as a mixed pathology in individuals with Alzheimer's dementia, especially in individuals aged 85 or older (Alzheimer's Association, 2017), suggesting a tight link between vascular and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Further, given that the typical clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia is usually due to heterogenous pathologic aetiology (Corriveau et al., 2017) , PHS may be useful in identifying individuals with the highest risk of developing dementia due to a combination of vascular and Alzheimer's aetiologies. The association of PHS with Lewy body pathology is also consistent with existing findings showing that dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) shares genetic risk with Alzheimer's disease (Meeus et al., 2012; Guerreiro et al., 2016) and that individuals diagnosed with DLB had higher levels of Alzheimer's pathology (Irwin et al., 2017) .\nWhy is an Alzheimer's associated polygenic score associated with cardiovascular and DLB pathology? We consider several possibilities. First, these findings may reflect underlying genetic pleiotropy/overlap between Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular traits and DLB (Desikan et al., 2015; Guerreiro et al., 2016; Broce et al., 2018) . Second, co-occurrence of these pathologies may make it more likely that individuals with Alzheimer's disease also have cardiovascular and DLB pathology. Third, compatible with recent findings , Alzheimer's pathology may lead to cardiovascular and possibly DLB pathologies. Fourth, a combination of these such that shared genetic Figure 5 PHS is associated with post-mortem cerebrovascular disease pathology. Box plots of severity of (A) cerebral amyloid angiopathy and (B) arteriolosclerosis for low (1 SD below mean, 416 percentile, n = 92 and n = 86, respectively) and high (1 SD above mean, 584 percentile, n = 98 and n = 90, respectively) PHS individuals.\nrisk may make it more likely that Alzheimer's, cardiovascular and DLB pathologies co-occur.\nIn conclusion, we show that PHS shows regional associations with amyloid PET and neurodegeneration across the disease spectrum, and may be useful for tracking disease progression even after accounting for amyloid deposition in the frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex volume. PHS also showed a degree of spatial specificity for post-mortem tangles in the inferior cortex beyond APOE \"4, and may therefore be useful for tracking tau deposition across the disease spectrum. In addition, PHS was also associated with cerebrovascular and Lewy body pathology. Taken together, these findings further suggest a nuanced relationship between polygenic risk and markers of amyloid deposition, pathological tau and neurodegeneration. Our results also suggest that PHS may be useful for the identification of individuals at the highest risk for developing multi-aetiological dementia."}]
