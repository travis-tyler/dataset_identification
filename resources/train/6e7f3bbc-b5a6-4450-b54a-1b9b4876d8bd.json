[{"section_title": "", "text": "when the U.S. economy requires more SET workers, the largest pool of potential workers continues to be isolated from SET careers. The Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology Development (the Commission) spent over a year examining the barriers that exist for women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities at different stages of the SET pipeline. The Commission conducted a comprehensive review of existing workforce data, past reports, and current trends, and commissioned new papers where there were gaps in the literature. Testimony was presented by experts in the science and technology policy arena, educators at all levels, corporate executives, government officials, and nonprofit sector leaders. The outcome is a carefully selected set of actionoriented recommendations designed to create systemic change that is national in scope and structured for immediate implementation. The Commission strongly believes that if the nation is willing to make the investment called for by these recommendations, our workforce will be strengthened for the foreseeable future. As studies have shown, appropriate investment in preparing the workforce yields approximately four or five to one returns in economic benefits to the nation. 2,3 If, on the other hand, the United States continues failing to prepare citizens from all population groups for participation in the new, technology-driven economy, our nation will risk losing its economic and intellectual preeminence. It is time to move beyond a mere description of the problem toward implementation of a national agenda that will take us where we must go, so that our nation can thrive now, and in the years to come. It is time also to establish clear lines of responsibility and to define effective accountability mechanisms. The responsibility of this continuing body will be to promote and monitor progress toward the Commission's goal of supplying our nation's SET work force needs through the development of the human resources represented by women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities. This collaborative body (whose members will include high-level persons from federal and state government, industry, academe, and the nonprofit sector, as well as students and teachers) will carry on the work of this Commission by developing and overseeing comprehensive action plans, and by securing resources that will help in reaching the Commission's goal of domestic work force parity in SET. The continuing body has four charges: \u27a3 Develop action items to implement the recommendations developed by the Commission. \u27a3 Further develop appropriate existing programs, using the recommendations of the Commission as a point of reference. \u27a3 Coordinate and assign actions/programs to appropriate sectors (government, industry, academe), and ensure funding and resources. \u27a3 Monitor progress through ongoing data compilation and analysis."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology Development (the Commission) was developed and sponsored by Congresswoman Constance A. Morella (R-MD), and established by Congress in 1998(Public Law 105-255, approved October 14, 1998. Chief among the Commission's duties is to recommend a specific set of actions that will: \u27a3 advance the full and equitable participation of all Americans in science, engineering, and technology (SET) education; \u27a3 increase the number of qualified American scientists and engineers by expanding the human resources pool of women, members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and persons with disabilities; and \u27a3 thereby enhance the nation's economic capacity and technological growth in an era of global competitiveness. Toward this end, the Commission strives to: \u27a3 broaden access to quality SET precollege education for all Americans, particularly underrepresented minorities; \u27a3 improve the preparation of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities for access to higher education and increase the number of SET degrees earned by these populations; and \u27a3 increase the retention and reentry of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities in SET education and the SET workforce. Beginning in April 1999, Commission members (see page 81) held a series of meetings and public hearings at various sites spanning the nation i to consider written and oral testimony from more than 100 experts representing industry, government, academe, and the nonprofit sector. The Commission heard descriptions of the obstacles faced by women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities as they move through the SET pipeline, and examples of best practices and effective strategies for making SET education and careers more accessible (the Commission looked at \"accessibility\" broadly, intending not just that financial, social, and cultural impediments be removed, but that the built environment, as well as information and assistive technologies, allow full participation by anyone who is capable of contributing to the SET enterprise). The Commission examined past reports and current data, analyzed recent trends, and commissioned papers to fill in the gaps. The work of the Commission culminated in the set of recommendations that appear in the following sections of the report. The section entitled \"A National Imperative\" reviews some of the data and analyses, and delineates the absolute imperative of the recommendations set forth by the Commission. The need for a highly skilled SET workforce is juxtaposed with the demographics of the population, which are becoming more and more diverse.\nThe current and imminent needs require a suite of strategies designed to establish parity in our domestic SET workforce. The next three sections provide data describing the underrepresentation of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in the various stages of the SET pipeline, beginning with the precollege grade levels, considering access to higher education, and continuing through professional life in industry, academe, and the federal government. The report discusses the barriers that impede women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities from being successful scientists, engineers, and technologists, and lay the groundwork for the Commission's recommendations for each pipeline stage. Minority groups currently underrepresented in the SET enterprise include African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians. While certain segments of the Asian population are also underrepresented in SET, Asians as a whole are at least equitably represented in SET fields based on their numbers in the general workforce. The \"Public Image\" section is devoted to an examination of how the public image of scientists, engineers, and technologists in the media might be improved so as to encourage more women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities to choose careers in SET fields. \"Nationwide Accountability\" suggests a mechanism of accountability by which the goals of the report may best be reached. Each section includes one or two specific recommendations for addressing the issues described. Both short-and long-term, these recommendations include policies and programs that can be immediately implemented by Congress, federal departments and agencies, state government, the private sector, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions. The recommendations call for a serious commitment of funds and other resources, but all promise a solid return on the investment. At the heart of the recommendations is the goal of creating a domestic, highly skilled SET workforce in which women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities participate on par with their representation in the U.S. workforce. By establishing parity as a major goal that can be used to measure accountability, the nation will simultaneously address two vital strategic needs: to boost the supply of skilled American workers and to ensure that every American has a chance to rise with the economic tide. Only then will the Commission fulfill its vision of a society that: \u27a3 enables access to, and achievement in, quality education and training in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology for all Americans; \u27a3 fosters a diverse, well-trained, and globally oriented workforce exemplified by innovation and productivity; and \u27a3 is committed to optimum utilization of all U.S. intellectual capital."}, {"section_title": "A NATIONAL IMPERATIVE", "text": "\"Hiring, retaining, and developing great people is the biggest challenge and single greatest key to the success of any business.\""}, {"section_title": "Scott McNealy CEO, Sun Microsystems", "text": "The United States' economy ranks among the best in the world, thanks in large part to a technological revolution that over the last fifty years has spawned unprecedented productivity and a host of new industries and jobs. In this climate, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that this new economy is especially dependent on, and thus vulnerable to, deficiencies in the talents and knowledge of the available workforce. Lester Thurow effectively argues that, \"In the twenty-first century, the education and skills of the workforce will end up being the dominant competitive weapon.\" 1 Success is ours today, but to sustain our preeminence we must take dramatic steps to change the way we engage the population in the new economy. Today, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities-groups that are chronically underrepresented in SET careers-constitute more than two-thirds of the overall workforce. At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that professional specialty occupations, which include most scientists, engineers, and medical workers, are booming, having increased 31.7 percent between 198831.7 percent between and 199831.7 percent between . Projections for 199831.7 percent between -2008 promise another growth spurt in this category (27 percent), with a need to fill 5.3 million new jobs. 2 In fact, of the top ten fastest growing occupations, the top five are computer related (see Figure 1). The business community is not alone in its need to develop and maintain a highly skilled, domestic SET workforce. Both academe and the federal government have a vested interest in finding ways to deepen their pools of science and technology educators and researchers. In addition to its interest in fostering economic productivity and growth, the federal government includes agencies with R&D programs that carry out essential goals of national importance (e.g., defense, environmental protection, space exploration, and health). These agencies need highly trained SET personnel to staff their programs. In 1995, the federal government employed 8 percent of all working scientists and engineers with a minimum of a bachelor's degree. 3 Equally important as an adequate quantity of science, engineering, and technological workers is the nation's ability to prepare for the changing nature of work of the future. In the last decade alone, we have seen unprecedented and unanticipated changes in the nature of work itself in fields such as information technology and biotechnology. To ensure that the workforce of tomorrow possesses the necessary competencies and knowledge, and that all U.S. citizens are provided an opportunity for a bright future, we must train workers to succeed in jobs that are not yet imagined. In addition, we must remain cognizant of the continuing need for the retraining of workers currently in the workforce. It is recognized that individuals in today's workforce will likely change the type of work that they do several times over the course of their careers. If SET jobs are to be filled by the domestic workforce, then every U.S. citizen must be given an equal opportunity to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to compete. And yet a disturbingly narrow range of citizens is now making its way through the SET pipeline. The SET workforce is comprised mainly of white males, with small percentages of women and minority group members (except Asians, who are overrepresented). Figure 2 shows the racial/ethnic distribution of the U.S. i The \"Asian and Other\" category in the 1997 U.S. Workforce graph covers both Asians and American Indians. BLS data do not disaggregate these two groups because the N is too small. Due to the small sample sizes for these populations, the percentage for \"Asian and Other\" may not be as accurate as the percentages for the other populations. population in 1997 compared to the representation of these groups in the general workforce and the SET workforce. Persons with disabilities (who are not represented in Figure 2) make up approximately 20 percent of the population, 14 percent of the overall U.S. workforce, and 6 percent of the U.S. SET workforce. 4 Unless the SET workforce becomes more representative of the general U.S. workforce, the nation will undercut its own competitive edge in the future. That is, the competition for SET workers has already become global, and American companies that depend on importing talent will become increasingly vulnerable. In the words of Hudson Institute researchers, \"The best jobs created in the Innovation Age will be filled by Americans\u2026to the extent that workers possess the skills required to compete for them and carry them out. If jobs go unfilled in the U.S., they will quickly migrate elsewhere in our truly global economy.\""}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Americans can fill SET jobs if they are provided adequate education and stimulation. The problem is that existing industrial and educational programs are failing to attract and keep those U.S. citizens who make up an increasingly large share of the workforce: women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities, who together comprise approximately 70 percent of the U.S. workforce. 6 The SET-related data on women and underrepresented minorities are more extensive than on persons with disabilities. With more consistent collection of comprehensive data will come a fuller understanding of the forces that inhibit these citizens' participation in SET careers. What we do know, however, is that technology has the capacity for improving access and participation of people even with severe disabilities. Access to built and virtual environments such as buildings, transportation, consumer products, and information technology is an important issue for this group. In science and technology fields, \"access\" includes access to laboratory and other specialized scientific equipment and computer analysis methods. People with disabilities will only be able to participate in SET if the tools created for these disciplines are universally designed. ii,7 Obviously, the current and projected need for more SET workers, coupled with the fact that women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities comprise an increasing proportion of the labor pool, argue for policies that support greater participation by these underrepresented groups in SET education and careers. Developing such policies requires that we take a serious look at the barriers preventing members of these groups from entering SET fields and learning critical workforce skills. In this report, the Commission identifies key barriers and makes recommendations for policies and actions that will build a diverse, domestic SET workforce capable of carrying the U.S. into an economically healthy future. ii Universal design is a process whereby environments and products are designed to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.\nIt seems, therefore, that as U.S. students progress through the education pipeline their performance in mathematics and science declines significantly.\n"}, {"section_title": "Diversity Promotes Economic Success", "text": "Beyond the demographic reality that skilled workers must be drawn from an increasingly diverse domestic population, there are other compelling reasons why a workforce that includes more women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities helps to strengthen business, academe, and government. While the Commission recognizes the important social responsibility of the nation to develop an inclusive workforce and to provide opportunity for growth for all of its citizens, there is also factual evidence that businesses and other organizations see a significant return on their investment when diversity is achieved. A recent survey of Fortune 100 human resource executives found that increasing diversity is desirable for the following five reasons: better utilization of talent; increased marketplace understanding; enhanced breadth of understanding in leadership positions; enhanced creativity; and increased quality of team problemsolving. 8 Another recent survey conducted by the American Management Association of more than one thousand of its members found that heterogeneity -a mixture of genders, ethnic backgrounds, and ages in senior management teams-consistently correlated with superior corporate performance in such areas as annual sales, growth revenues, market share, shareholder value, net operating profit, worker productivity, and total assets."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "In other words, the absence of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities from the highest level of corporate management deprives corporations of diverse strategic skills and competencies in management that translate into economic gains. A culturally diverse workforce creates competitive advantage through greater creativity and innovation; increased organizational flexibility thanks to higher levels of divergent thinking; and better decision making based on multiple perspectives (less \"group think\") as well as a critical analysis of alternatives. 10 This competitive advantage holds true not just for American industry, but for the national scientific and engineering enterprise as a whole. A diverse workforce also helps businesses reach a global market. For many firms, a growing proportion of their revenues comes from foreign sources, which heightens the need for U.S. businesses to understand the market preferences of different cultures. Employees with knowledge of other cultures become essential for firms that operate in a global context. Further, as minority populations constitute an increasing part of local markets, companies need the insight and cultural sensitivity that ethnic minorities can bring to marketing efforts.\nThe most common barriers to completion faced by students with disabilities are the faculty's negative predisposition to students' accommodation needs; conflicting policies between the financial and educational systems; and actual disability limitations. 10 These barriers contribute to students with disabilities being less likely than those without to be enrolled in or to have completed a SET bachelor's degree within five years (53 percent versus 64 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Wanted: A Long-Term Labor Solution", "text": "A report issued by the Council on Competitiveness identifies an \"acute skills shortage in every part of the country that threatens the foundation of American competitiveness.\" 11 The Council report cites a 1997 survey in which almost 70 percent of CEOs pointed to the skills shortage as the number one barrier to growth, and concludes that \"unless U.S. firms can create 'home grown' technicians by increasing adult training opportunities and by expanding college graduates in computer and engineering programs, [companies] will move their operations abroad or import talent from overseas.\""}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Indeed, faced with a shortage of highly skilled SET workers, particularly in computer-related occupations, many businesses are resorting to recruiting foreign engineers and scientists and bringing them to the U.S. on H-1B visas. Congress raised the ceiling on H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for 1999, a ceiling that was reached by June 1999. However, reliance on foreign workers to fill domestic SET jobs is a stopgap solution. Training foreign workers in the U.S. may sharpen the competitive edge of other nations. 13 More importantly, the supply of foreign workers is uncertain. As other economically competitive nations evolve, the supply of foreign workers available to U.S. employers will decrease. Other nations have been investing in the SET education and training of their citizens instead of sending them to U.S. universities, realizing the importance of developing their own human resources. Countries such as Taiwan and Korea have been aggressively encouraging their U.S.-trained citizens to return home by offering them prestigious positions and high salaries. Although many foreign SET doctoral recipients from U.S. universities plan to remain in the United States, the likelihood of this trend continuing is questionable at best. 14 The nation's economic well-being, the health of its citizens, the defense of its interests at home and abroad-all these matters hinge on there being a reliable domestic pool of intellectual talent. If women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities make up a majority and growing proportion of that talent pool, then it makes sense to take more effective action to nurture their intellectual development before turning to non-U.S. citizens for help. \nAfrican American and Hispanic students are more likely than white and Asian students to drop out of college entirely. Reasons for these higher attrition rates -especially for students in SET-include financial difficulties, poor precollege preparation, low expectations from faculty, poor quality of teaching, and an inflexible curriculum.\nFor the most part, the news media operate in a fundamentally different way from the entertainment media or advertising. While in recent years there has been a blurring of the line separating entertainment and news, a reporter's primary job is still to cover newsworthy events in an informational manner, not to shock, amuse, or promote a view or product. If there are fewer women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities among the ranks of scientists and engineers, then there will necessarily be fewer of them at work on groundbreaking projects, and this is not the news media's fault. Efforts to support diversity in SET professions will, de facto, help to improve diversity in SET news coverage. Still, too often reporters and their editors offer the news in the form of headlines and stories that rely on easy and unflattering cliches to make a quick point. Time magazine published a cover story entitled \" The Golden Geeks\" that discussed the lives of new computer multimillionaires. 13 Business Week ran an article on the IT workforce that was subtitled \"Send Nerds.\" 14 And a news story in the Washington Post referred to the pioneers of the Internet as \" venerated propeller-heads.\""}, {"section_title": "Education Boosts the Bottom Line", "text": "A stronger investment in national talent through education and training boosts productivity more than any other means-more than increases in work hours or in capital stock. As shown in Figure 3, a 10 percent increase in capital stock or work hours can boost productivity 3.4 percent or 5.6 percent, respectively, while the same percentage of increase in education yields a productivity increase of 8.6 percent. As the data indicate, an increased investment in SET education will boost U.S. global competitiveness by increasing productivity."}, {"section_title": "Bold Remedies for Tough Problems", "text": "The goal of this report is to set forth recommendations that will support the building of a domestic SET workforce that achieves parity while meeting our nation's strategic SET needs. The recommendations of this Commission thus focus on issues of education and training that affect both how women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities move into SET careers and how their progress can be sustained during their tenure in the workplace. The Commission offers short-term solutions to stop the hemorrhaging of workers from the SET pipeline as well as long-term solutions to increase the supply of workers and establish parity between the SET workforce and the nation's general workforce population. The Commision's recommendations, however, will be of little use without the joint efforts of the business community, federal and state governments, academe, and the nonprofit sector working in concert to craft bold remedies for tough problems. The actions required to carry out these recommendations call for a significant commitment of financial and other resources, as well as a system of accountability to ensure implementation.

High-quality education is a particularly relevant issue with regard to minority children, who today constitute a majority of the nation's fifty largest school systems, and whose educational opportunities today are the most dismal.

In physics, the outcome for U.S. students was somewhat worse, with U.S. students with AP physics scoring below the international average. At the eighth grade level the picture is somewhat rosier. Compared to five major economic partners-Japan, France, Canada, England, and Germany-U.S. students scored lower than Japanese students, not significantly different from English, Canadian, and German students, and higher than French students. U.S. eighth graders scored below average in mathematics achievement and above average in science achievement compared to the forty-one nations that participated in the eighth-grade level TIMSS assessment. 4 U.S. fourth graders had the best showing of all U.S. students.

There are now only small differences between girls' and boys' science and mathematics scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests, 7 and girls are now taking the upper level mathematics and science courses required to enter SET college majors at the same rate as boys. Although the ability and basic academic background needed to continue in SET careers exist for many girls, their interest in these careers is not maintained. Among SAT-takers, over three-fourths of students wishing to major in engineering and computer science are boys.

A combination of factors likely accounts for this paradox.

Data show that girls are indeed less likely than boys to be involved in informal science and mathematics activities outside of school, from using meters and playing with electromagnets to fixing machines and reading about technology. 12 Additionally, media and real-life images of women in scientific and technical careers are still rare (as are female role models and mentors, in general), sending an unspoken message to girls that a SET career is not for them."}, {"section_title": "Adding Color to the SET Pipeline", "text": "In contrast to the underrepresentation of women in the SET workforce, the cause of underrepresentation of minorities in the SET workforce begins with lack of access to high-quality mathematics and science education during the K-12 years. A great many African American and Hispanic students attend schools in the central city (32 percent and 25 percent, respectively). Students in these groups also tend to be enrolled in predominantly minority schools. For example, in the fall of 1996, while the overall percentage of white students enrolled in public schools was 64 percent, only one-third or less of the students in a typical African American or Hispanic student's school were white. 13 This is important information, because it means that the majority of African American and Hispanic students are isolated in schools that typically suffer from a grievous lack of resources. Although much less data are available to document the access that American Indian students have to educational resources, these students also attend impoverished schools in which they are the racial majority. A recent New York Times article quoted the director of American Indian education at the Department of Education as saying, \"We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children.\""}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "Data on the distribution of resources in schools ranging from expenditures, qualified teachers, high-quality curriculum, and computer equipment show that inner city, high poverty and high minority enrollment schools where African American and Hispanic students are concentrated consistently receive fewer resources than do schools that serve high percentages of white students. Although districts with the highest percentages of minority students have higher expenditures than those with the lowest percentages of minority students, when cost and student need adjustments are made, the relationship is reversed: districts with high percentages of minority students have lower expenditures because of lower buying power.\nIn the 1970s, industry stepped up its efforts to recruit underrepresented minority science and engineering professionals. In fact, government and industry opened up opportunities for some underrepresented minorities before the major, predominantly white educational institutions did. As reflected in the data, underrepresented minorities are now much more likely to choose jobs in industry than in academe. 15 Of course, one factor leading to this outcome is that advanced degrees are typically not required in industry jobs. In addition, financial pressures lead a disproportionate amount of underrepresented minorities to seek employment after the first degree. Barriers to advancement and retention identified by underrepresented minority professionals in SET careers include: 16 \u27a3 not having an influential mentor or sponsor; \u27a3 lack of opportunities for informal networking with influential colleagues; \u27a3 lack of company role models who are members of the same racial/ethnic group; \u27a3 lack of high-visibility assignments; \u27a3 stereotyping of some minority groups as incapable of doing science; and \u27a3 difficulty in securing grant monies even with a proven track record of producing high-quality research. Underrepresented minority women SET professionals, while facing some of the same obstacles as white women, experience discrimination due to both race and sex, the so-called \"double bind.\" This results in their being doubly disadvantaged in terms of income."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "High minority enrollment secondary schools also offer less extensive and less demanding science and mathematics programs, giving minority students fewer opportunities to take the courses necessary to help them pursue science and mathematics majors in college. Further, underrepresented minority students are disproportionately placed in lower track i courses and thus have less access to higher level courses, even when they are in schools that offer these courses. The negative effects of tracking are exacerbated in mathematics and science education because tracking affects not only the quality but also the quantity of courses that students may take. Over time, the effects of this practice compound and differences among tracks widen, as students who do not take prerequisite courses are excluded from more advanced classes. 16 Figure 3 (p. 20) shows the unequal access that high minority enrollment schools have to qualified mathematics and science teachers, and the section on \"Equal Access to Technology\" (p. 23) details the differential access of high-poverty schools to technological learning tools. The shocking lack of educational resources experienced by underrepresented minority students affects both their achievement and participation in mathematics and science. Achievement and participation data tell us that it scarcely matters whether underrepresented students of color have an interest in SET careers. Because of the inadequate education received, low achievement levels often preclude their successfully attempting a SET career. African American and Hispanic students perform well below white and Asian students in science and mathematics, and while the gap is closing, it is closing slowly. Over half of underrepresented students of color ii show less than \"partial mastery\" of science and mathematics at grades four, eight, and twelve as measured by NAEP, and while individual students of color possess superior mathematics skills, less than one-half of 1 percent of these students score at the advanced level of proficiency in mathematics on NAEP. Nationally, fewer African American, Hispanic, and American Indian students take advanced mathematics and science courses than do white and Asian American students (see Figure 2). And although underrepresented minority students are nearly 25 percent of the population, they are only 5 to 10 percent of AP test-takers in computer science, calculus, physics, chemistry, and biology.\nDeeply concerned about the detrimental public image of scientists and engineers, researchers and policymakers are advocating a broad national effort, perhaps a public relations or advertising campaign, to broaden the depictions of scientists by the image-makers on Madison Avenue and in Hollywood. They propose the formation of a coalition of several communities, including major science institutions, government agencies, private foundations, the entertainment industry, and the business community.

And while female and male academic researchers are receiving equal support from federal grants and contracts, African Americans, American Indians, and persons with disabilities are lagging behind other groups in this regard."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "In sum, better preparation and more role models are needed for underrepresented minority students to develop both the skills and interest they need to participate in SET careers."}, {"section_title": "Issues of Disability and SET Participation", "text": "Very little information is available on the achievement and participation patterns of students with disabilities in SET. The absence of NAEP data on this group deprives us of comparable achievement data at the fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade levels. It is known, however, that students with disabilities who plan to attend college score significantly lower on the SAT and ACT than do other students. These students also take fewer high school mathematics and science courses than other students and receive lower grades. 21 Reasons for this lack of precollege preparation in mathematics and science vary, but include physical and attitudinal barriers. For example, it is often difficult for students with disabilities to access science equipment in middle and high school. In addition, as with girls, students with learning disabilities may be implicitly or explicitly discouraged from pursuing a SET education because of adult and peer perceptions of their abilities. Free public education in the U.S., available as it is to all residents, can be a powerful mechanism to level the playing field for students from different socioeconomic levels and demographic characteristics. As it now exists, however, the educational system perpetuates inequality, as underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities have unequal access to educational resources. Report after report on the supply and quality of the workforce has called for the reform of the preK-12 education system as the most cost-effective way to increase the number of skilled adults in the future. Numerous efforts are currently underway at the local, state, and federal level to improve mathematics and science education. Improving teacher effectiveness, adopting national mathematics and science standards, and providing access to technology are critical to the reform efforts. Further, it has only been in recent years that early childhood development has been recognized as the true beginning of learning and, therefore, the beginning of workforce development. The Commission encourages the continued focus and thrust in early childhood development and its long-term impacts on learning.

Boosting teacher effectiveness can do more to improve education than any other single factor. Recent studies show that effective teachers help students at all achievement levels, regardless of the level of heterogeneity in their classrooms. Additionally, standardized test scores suggest that teacher effects on student learning are additive and cumulative over grade levels.  \"Rather than weed out students and discourage them from science classes, we must encourage and inspire them.\" Good teaching is imperiled by a growing shortage of qualified teachers. The inability of some school districts to find adequately prepared teachers has led to the widespread practice of granting provisional certification to individuals who have not been adequately prepared to teach. Furthermore, a large shortfall in the teacher supply is expected to materialize in the 2000s, resulting in a need for at least 2 million newly hired public school teachers by 2009. 24 This overall shortage will exacerbate the already critical shortage of mathematics and science teachers. Currently, because of this shortage, many who teach mathematics and science lack adequate preparation in these subject areas, a fact reflected by the TIMMS data. What's more, a large proportion of these poorly prepared teachers can be found in schools with large numbers of underrepresented minority students (Figure 3). 25 The implications of this situation are that underrepresented minority students are not getting the high-quality instruction they need to succeed in the pursuit of a SET education and career. The National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the Twenty-First Century (the Glenn Commission) is addressing the issue of teacher quality and quantity in mathematics and science.

College have been successful in recruiting girls-the summer camp typically hosts more female students than males. The networking and support offered by the faculty and staff of SKILL are so effective that every year the students lobby SDSM&T administrators to make the program longer. Many students say it's the best time they have all year. At graduation, there are always a few tears from those who are going away to college. \"SKILL students earn the traditional honoring song presented at each year's graduation,\" notes SDSM&T's interim vice-president for student affairs, Francine Campone. \"And they are powerful role models for the younger generations who follow them.\" Many of the strategies advocated by both the national mathematics and science standards, such as hands-on activities and cooperative learning, have been found to stimulate interest and understanding of science and technology for all students, including girls, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities. There has been, however, little assessment of how implementation of the standards-which varies widely from state to state-affects underrepresented populations. Enforcement of these standards should ensure that underrepresented groups have access to the high-quality education and resources that are often lacking in schools where underrepresented minorities tend to be enrolled. Inherent in the standards is the concept that all children can learn, given access to excellent and equal mathematics and science learning opportunities that develop not only basic skills but also problem solving and conceptual thinking. Such opportunities include access to quality teachers, appropriate learning materials, universal access for disabled students and other resources, and sufficient higher level mathematics and science courses. For these and other reasons, the standards are a crucial tool by which to lift underrepresented populations into the ranks of the twenty-first century SET workforce, and policymakers at the local level must be stimulated to embrace and implement them. One way of ensuring equality of access to higher level mathematics and science courses is for schools to adopt a rigorous high school core curriculum where all students take the same, mostly academic courses. This practice, which was found to be a common characteristic distinguishing high-performing schools from others, 26 has been associated with higher achievement for students independent of race/ethnicity, gender, or income level. 27 A recent study found that a high school curriculum of high academic intensity and quality has a large positive impact on degree completion for students of all racial/ethnic groups, suggesting that African American and Hispanic students can succeed academically when provided with a high-quality education."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "For nearly a decade, the National Science Foundation has promoted and undertaken systemic reform at the K-12 level to stimulate comprehensive reform that entails teacher preparation and development, quality student preparation, rigorous mathematics and science curriculum and performance standards for all students, effective governance, and the alignment of financial investments.

These strategies include designing multimedia curricula that are accessible, and that accommodate the varied physical and cognitive needs of children.

Children's access to a computer at home has increased substantially in recent years. 32 By 1997 almost half of all students had a computer available at home. However, white children were significantly more likely to have a computer at home (61 percent) than were African American (24 percent) or Hispanic children (23 percent). Family income also had a strong correlation with computer presence in the household. For example, just 20 percent of children from families with incomes under $25,000 had a computer, compared to 88 percent of those with family incomes above $75,000. Although boys were no more likely than girls to have a computer at home or to use it, 42 percent of girls used the household computer for word processing compared to 36 percent of boys, while 79 percent of girls played games on the home computer compared with 86 percent of boys. Common computer applications appear to be linked to the differences in technology between boys and girls. The violent and aggressive games that boys frequently play on both home and school computers tend not to appeal to girls. It has been suggested that these games involve a small set of skills which boys seem to enjoy mastering by playing the games repeatedly, while girls seem to become bored with the repetitiveness. Unfortunately, the way computers are presented to many high school students is through these games.\nHow much and what kind of financial aid is available to students, especially women, underrepresented minorities, and disabled students? The most important change in federal student aid policy occurred twenty-five years ago and involved a drastic shift from a grants-based to a loan-based system (see Figure 3). In the last ten years, loan aid more than doubled compared to a two-thirds increase in grant aid. 32 During this period total aid increased approximately 85 percent in constant dollars, but the growing reliance on loan programs was responsible for two-thirds of the increase.  Although recent increases in the Pell Grant appropriations have helped to stabilize the loan-grant balance in the aid system, the maximum Pell ($3,000 per student in 1998-1999) remains far below the purchasing power it had ten years ago. It manages to cover slightly over one-third of the average yearly cost of attendance at a four-year public institution and one-seventh that of a private institution. Tuition increases have far outpaced the growth in personal and family income during the 1980s and 1990s, with the share of family income required to pay college costs rising the most for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. 33 A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a $1,000 increase in public two-year tuition led to a 6 percent drop in undergraduate enrollment, with the effect concentrated among low-income youth.\nOther changes in the composition of family life have affected today's worker. Because of greater workforce geographical mobility, extended families that occupy the same household are a thing of the past. Changes in the workplace are also affecting scientific professionals. Organizations are becoming increasing unstable because of international competition and deregulation. As a result, restructuring resulting in temporary, part-time work is becoming more common. Because of their greater vulnerability to the consequences of a changed workplace (for example, they are more likely to hold part-time or short-term positions), women and underrepresented minorities of both sexes have been more affected by these changes."}, {"section_title": "Roberta Furger", "text": "Author, Does Jane Compute?

In fact, no increases in Internet connections were recorded in these schools from 1998 to 1999, while there were increases in schools with lower concentrations of poverty (see Figure 4). Data also show that schools with the highest concentration of poverty had more students per instructional computer with Internet access than schools with the lowest concentration of poverty (see Figure 5).

In a 1998 survey of firstyear students in four-year colleges and universities, one-third of white, African American, Hispanic, and American Indian students, and 43 percent of Asian students, had intentions of majoring in science and engineering. 4 Students with disabilities are as likely as students without disabilities to intend science and engineering majors. One study found that 30 percent of students with disabilities expressed an interest in a SET major, and while they were underrepresented in life sciences, physical sciences, and math, these  students enrolled in slightly higher percentages than those without disabilities in computer/information science and engineering majors. 5 These data show that there is at least a similar level of interest in SET fields among first-year students as a whole-except when it comes to gender. No matter what their race, ethnicity, or physical ability, women are significantly less likely than men to intend a SET major.

Disabled SET doctoral recipients increased 78 percent (from 200 to 355) from 1989 to 1995. 25 There are few efforts that directly target the retention of underrepresented minority, women, and disabled graduate students in SET. The programs that do exist usually focus on recruitment and/or financial support rather than interactive support programs. For students with physical disabilities, there is rarely a specific program focused on removing barriers; the disabled student services (DSS) office is the primary source of assistance. Furthermore, students with physical disabilities who major in SET may find that the DSS at their institution may not have encountered their specific needs before, especially in lab courses or when specific technologies or services are required."}, {"section_title": "26", "text": "\nConflicting demands of work and family affect women's ability to function as a professional and as a family member.

The availability of financial aid is especially critical for underrepresented minority students, who as a demographic group tend to have lower incomes than the body of white students. A study by NACME revealed that meeting the financial need of underrepresented minority engineering students is a key factor in addressing the problem of attrition. 29 A study by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) came up with a similar conclusion for students from low-income families. 30 Another GAO study showed that providing students with scholarship aid (as opposed to loans, which must be paid back) has a dramatic impact on the retention of low-income students.

Obviously, the rising costs of college tuition and the small amount of grant funding available to students reduces the feasibility of a college education for low-income students, many of whom are from minority backgrounds. This lack of affordability may be exacerbated for students in science-based programs where the time demands of coursework make employment during the academic year a hardship. At the graduate level, students are eligible for several different types of financial assistance from a range of sources: the federal government, the state, the institution, and private foundations.

Catalyst, an organization that conducts studies on women in a variety of fields, has contributed much insight into workplace conditions that affect women scientists and engineers. A recent study by Catalyst 10 of successful and highly visible senior women scientists employed in industry addressed the paucity of women scientists in Fortune 500 companies. As part of the study, the participants identified several reasons why women scientists may or may not choose careers in business. \u27a3 Female graduate students in the sciences remain uninformed about potential careers in business. Women said that they were given very little or no information about the corporate job market upon the completion of their academic studies. They also claimed that their university advisors prepared them solely for academic careers. \u27a3 And yet, academia is viewed by many as unwelcoming to women scientists. Despite the fact that their advisors tended to steer them toward academia rather than business, many of the women who participated in the study stated that they chose the business arena simply because they did not feel welcomed into academia. \u27a3 Companies that are seen as \"female-friendly\" are more likely to be successful in recruiting women scientists and engineers. Development of an environment in which women feel respected and valued within the company is an important recruitment-and retention-strategy. Policies that support family life, mentoring, and career development were seen both by organizations and women employees as contributing to a \"female-friendly\" workplace. \u27a3 Women were attracted to applied science and product development. They perceived industry as offering a faster-paced and more diverse career path, together with economic stability and liberation from the necessity of writing grant proposals to support research projects. Data on the exit rate of women from SET positions in industry were reported in a National Research Council document in 1994 11 (retention data on underrepresented minorities or persons with disabilities are not available). The picture is gloomy and suggests a need for innovative intervention. Women scientists and engineers in industrial jobs are more likely to leave technical occupations-and more likely to leave the labor force altogether-than women who work in other sectors. Attrition data on women in industry show that their exit rates are not only double those of men (25 percent versus 12 percent), but they are also much higher than those of women in other employment sectors. For example, women scientists and engineers in public employment exit at a rate of 13 percent, while those in nonprofit organizations have a 16 percent attrition rate. Women in industry are 30 percent more likely than women in other sectors to exit SET jobs for other types of employment, and they are 80 percent more likely than women in government or the nonprofit sector to exit SET jobs and actually become unemployed. Finally, women employed in industry are about 50 percent more likely than women in other sectors to exit the labor force entirely. Other studies describe some of the barriers to advancement and retention faced by women, including the following: \u27a3 Isolation. Women engineers and scientists often find themselves the sole woman in their group during both academic training and their professional careers. The lack of a critical mass in industry for women scientists makes it hard for them to tap into informal networks that could lend them support. \u27a3 Risk-averse supervisors and stereotypes. Women scientists' progress early in their careers may be impeded by their having to prove their technical credibility again and again. This may be the result of stereotyping of women's abilities as well as the perception that promoting women is riskier than promoting men. The perception that women cannot \"do science\" is one that women scientists in corporations have to battle constantly. The competencies and traits associated with success in science are generally viewed as male attributes. \u27a3 Differences of style. Different styles of communication may affect how employees' ideas are received. Corporations tend to reward an aggressive style of speaking and often discount language that is not certain. Women who exhibit assertive style, however, run the risk of being seen as inappropriately combative. \u27a3 Exclusion from informal networks. Women are often excluded from all-male networks, which often focus on sports activities that may not appeal to women as well as weekend events that can be difficult to attend because of women's larger share of family responsibilities. \u27a3 Lack of mentoring. Mentors and sponsors are of vital importance to women's advancement in the corporation. It may be difficult, however, for women to find mentors through the same informal mechanisms used by men, especially since individuals tend to mentor people who are very much like them. Because having a mentor is critical to advancing into management roles, women are at a disadvantage in predominantly male environments. \u27a3 Lack of line or general management experience. Line roles (sales and manufacturing functions) involve direct profit-and-loss responsibility in contrast to staff positions (research and development) that support the production line. Having line experience is critical to advancing further in the corporation. Catalyst has found that women are encouraged to enter staff roles and find it difficult to obtain line responsibility. \u27a3 Work/life balance. Women with spouses and/or children struggle to keep up with the fast-paced work environment as studies have shown that, unlike men, they remain primarily responsible for family and home care. Even in a firm with family-friendly policies, women are concerned that they cannot pursue their science careers and take family leave at the same time without risking the perception that they are less committed to their careers than their male colleagues. Issues of work and family balance are of paramount concern to women employed in SET fields. Policies and benefits such as extended parental leaves, part-time work options, on-site child care facilities, and greater scheduling flexibility are needed. Access to quality, reliable, affordable child care is key to the retention of working parents. And as previously pointed out, quality child care also impacts the workforce development over the long term. Women feel that in order to be successful they must exceed expectations, be flexible, and work hard to make male supervisors and coworkers feel comfortable around them. 13 If companies wish to attract and retain talented women in their SET workforce, they must do their part to equalize the \"success equation\" with creative solutions of their own-policies and practices that will help women scientists overcome the difficult obstacles to success that have been identified above."}, {"section_title": "Issues Relating to Underrepresented Minorities", "text": "Underrepresented minorities face many of the same barriers that impede women and persons with disabilities from experiencing success in SET careers, although there are specific issues relating to this group.\nAs with women, the career attainment of underrepresented minorities in SET is affected by both research productivity and organizational/environmental factors. Underrepresented minority faculty members tend to publish less often than nonminority researchers, which again, is a barrier to career advancement. 27 While underrepresented minority males may not face the same time constraints that women do, plausible reasons for this lower publishing rate are not hard to discern. The two main factors affecting career advancement for underrepresented minority SET professionals in academe are interactions with other faculty in the department and the school's overall racial climate.

Too many white faculty continue to believe that underrepresented minority faculty were hired because of affirmative action regulations and not on merit. Related to this belief is the conjecture that minorities are not as qualified as white academics and that the presence of more than one underrepresented minority faculty member in a traditionally mainstream program will lower the academic standing of the department (dubbed the \"oneminority-per-pot syndrome\"). 28 Such attitudes can poison the quality of interaction between underrepresented minority and white faculty. Moreover, many underrepresented minority faculty members consider the overall racial climate at their universities to be poor. Most agree that membership on faculty search committees is insufficient to address the problem, that underrepresented minority faculty representation in their departments and at their institution is low, and that their opportunity for advancement is hindered, not helped, by their racial/ethnic backgrounds. Issues of isolation, absence of other underrepresented minority faculty and students, and lack of mentors also contribute to underrepresented minority faculty members' perception of a less-than-welcoming environment on predominantly white campuses. It is not hard to understand how the scholarly productivity of underrepresented minority faculty could be negatively affected in a work environment where such an implicitly or explicitly hostile racial climate exists."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Professional Life in Academe", "text": "Institution, Rank, and Tenure Within educational institutions, women differ from men in terms of academic rank, tenure, and the type of school in which they are employed.

Women were also more likely than men to be employed in two-year colleges (16 percent versus 10 percent). In four-year colleges and universities, women SET academics hold fewer high-ranking positions than men and are less likely to be full professors but more likely to be assistant professors. For example, among full-time ranked Ph.D.s, 50 percent of men and 23 percent of women were full professors. Women were also less likely than men to be tenured. Twenty-nine percent of women SET academics employed full-time in four-year colleges and universities were tenured, compared with 58 percent of men. Minority women were less likely than white women and less likely than men of any racial/ethnic group to be full professors. African American women, however, were the most likely of all women to be tenured (40 percent versus 32 percent for white women, 29 percent for Hispanic women, and 17 percent for Asian women; however, the actual number of minority women professors is very small, so such statistics can be misleading).

Other than the data reported at the beginning of this section on persons with disabilities, additional information or research studies on the work lives of this group of professionals were unavailable. The lack of statistical information on the professional lives of persons with disabilities, as well as lack of data for this group with regard to school experience and outcomes at all levels, points out a critical failure in the ability to evaluate disability as a component of diversity.

Only a small number of workers, however, has access to dependent-care benefits such as child care information and referral services (20 percent); elder care information and referral services (25 percent); on-or near-site child care services (11 percent); financial assistance for purchasing child care services (13 percent); and dependent-care assistance plans (29 percent). A major finding of the 1997 National Study of the Changing Workforce was that work life is an important source of employees' personal problems. 35 The study concluded that special assistance programs-designed to help employees solve personal problems-that do not also address how the employees' jobs contribute to those problems may be insufficiently helpful in improving employee job performance. This finding speaks to several of the points made in this report with respect to women, underrepresented minority, and disabled scientists and engineers and the influence that workplace environment has on their success. For professionals in science and technology, regardless of sector, the work pace is rapid and the activities unceasing. Longer hours than average are the norm and physical presence still denotes dedication to the job at hand. Women and underrepresented minorities, who more often have conflicting family demands that include child-bearing, child-rearing, and care of elderly parents, may be more likely to take leave. In the culture of the scientific and technological workplace, taking leave still reflects poorly on science professionals' commitment to science and may lead to a judgment that people who take leave have a poor potential for scientific growth and development.

Despite decades of social change, the general perception remains that IT workers, scientists, and engineers are unusually intelligent, socially inept, and absent-minded \"geeks\" or \"nerds.\" Advertisers, the entertainment media, and the news media have an influential role in shaping these perceptions. Caricatures of (mostly male) scientists continue to appear on billboards, in magazine ads, in movies, and on television sitcoms. The news media also contribute to these distortions with stories that too often emphasize scientists and engineers as otherworldly geniuses working in isolation from society. To make matters worse, the relative absence of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities in SET careers, as documented in this report, makes it easier for the media to overlook those underrepresented individuals who are succeeding in SET, which only serves to perpetuate the problem. One reason that female, underrepresented minority, and disabled children-as well as the adults who support themdon't think of science as a career to which such children can aspire, is that people who look like them are so seldom portrayed as scientists. As one 15-year-old girl commented: \"Men are scientists. It is a masculine job career. Women don't go into it because being a scientist will make them look bad.\" "}, {"section_title": "Among School Children", "text": "Over four decades ago, anthropologists attempted to systematically describe the standard image of the scientist held by a population of American high school students. The anthropologists drew a composite portrait based on their research that describes the scientist as: [A] man who wears a white coat and works in a laboratory. He is elderly or middle aged and wears glasses\u2026he may wear a beard\u2026he is surrounded by equipment: test tubes, Bunsen burners, flasks and bottles, a jungle gym of blown glass tubes and weird machines with dials. Though modernized a bit, the stereotype of scientists as \"diabolic madmen, distinguished professors, harmless eccentrics, learned buffoons, and fashionable dilettantes,\" as one anthropologist described it, may still be seen today on the screen and on the printed page. 3 Research with children using the Draw-a-Scientist Test (DAST) has documented that this stereotypical image of the scientist emerges by the second grade and becomes more pronounced as children grow older. Studies have also shown that these concepts are deeply rooted and persistent: stereotypical images held by undergraduate and graduate students do not differ significantly from those held by younger students, even though these older students have encountered real-life scientists in college. 4 Strikingly, all the research on this topic describes the virtual absence of females and members of racial/ethnic minority groups in the students' drawings of scientists, no matter what grade level. Only female students drew female scientists, and this occurred rarely. A few underrepresented minority scientists were depicted as well, presumably by underrepresented minority students. The assumption that scientists are all able-bodied is so established that the studies themselves did not note the absence of persons with disabilities in the students' depictions. In response to speculation that the students failed to depict diverse scientists because of the small number of females and minorities in scientific professions, researchers point to the absence of Asian scientists in the drawings, despite Asians' overrepresentation in many SET professions. The attitudes of girls, in particular, regarding scientists and engineers have been influenced by the lack of female scientists in the media. In the absence of role models, many girls do not see themselves as successful \"doers\" of science, and tend to view science and technology as unsuitable careers and personally irrelevant to their lives. Nonetheless, studies have shown that these perceptions can be reversed through concerted interventions. Exposing children to researchers who do not look like the stereotype, for example, either through field trips to labs or by bringing scientists into the classrooms, has been shown to broaden the children's view of who can be a scientist. When asked to draw what a scientist looks like months after such interventions, these students portray a more diverse range of people."}, {"section_title": "Among the General Public", "text": "Twenty years ago, in summarizing two decades' worth of surveys, researchers concluded that the general public's attitudes toward science and technology were overwhelmingly favorable. 6 Today, 75 percent of Americans believe that the benefits of scientific research outweigh harmful results, and nearly 70 percent of American adults say they are interested in science and technology-the highest level ever measured. Yet, while more Americans than ever seem to appreciate the overall benefits of science and technology, their grasp of what scientists and engineers actually do remains abysmal, a fact that has ramifications for how scientists and engineers \"Many of the newest generations of women primatologists talk about the positive effects on them as children of seeing National Geographic coverage of Jane Goodall [and] Dian Fossey.\" themselves are perceived. A recent Harris Poll conducted by the American Association of Engineering Societies revealed that 45 percent of Americans feel uninformed about engineers and engineering. When the respondents were broken down by sex, almost 60 percent of women compared to nearly 40 percent of men felt that they were \"not very well informed about engineering and engineers.\" 7 A similar lack of understanding reigns in the public's grasp of science.

This is unfortunate because the images of scientists and engineers conveyed by prime time television are too often both negative and inaccurate. The scientists portrayed on Saturday morning children's television in the U.S. have been described by the late astronomer and science populist Carl Sagan as \"driven by a lust for power, or gifted with a spectacular insensitivity to the feelings of others.\" The media portrays scientific progress as hazardous, and scientists are often depicted as foolish, inept, or villainous. Even children's educational science programs on television perpetuate the stereotype of the scientist as male. A study of images of science and scientists in Beakman's World on CBS, Bill Nye, the Science Guy on independent stations, Mr. Wizard's World on Nickelodeon/MTV, and Newton's Apple shown on PBS found that these shows had three times as many male as female characters and twice as many adult male scientists as female scientists. Furthermore, of the female characters who were observed, almost all had secondary roles as students, lab assistants, or science writers. Few were expert scientists or held prestigious positions within the scientific community. 9 Because of its vast reach, commercial television has the greatest potential for influencing the public view of scientists. A longitudinal study conducted for the U.S. Department of Commerce found that only 2 percent of characters in prime time dramatic television from 1994-1998 were scientists. 10 Despite their small numbers, those scientist characters did not escape unflattering treatment. The study also found that while television doctors were among the most positively portrayed characters, other scientists suffered from a greater share of ambivalent and troublesome portrayals. They were older, stranger, and less sociable than other depicted professionals, and most likely to be foreigners.

As can be seen in the foregoing sections of this report, the perception of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities as people who do not engage in scientific or technical work severely hampers the access of these groups to SET careers, and impedes their progress if they do become SET professionals.
