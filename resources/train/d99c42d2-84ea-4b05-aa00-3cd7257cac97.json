Despite the ultimate transition to castration-resistant disease, ADT can slow disease progression, and these men usually remain on therapy for life. In addition to prolonging median survival, ADT can improve or prevent cancer-related symptoms. For example, the risks of pain, pathologic fracture, or spinal cord compression secondary to bony metastatic disease can be reduced by ADT, thus limiting disability and helping to optimize a patient's quality of life.\nContemporary literature has also demonstrated an overall survival benefit with the receipt of ADT in conjunction with radiotherapy in the localized setting, either as primary therapy or as salvage therapy postprostatectomy. [4] [5] [6] [7] Collectively, this broadening of indications for ADT use in PC means that, on average, patients will receive ADT earlier and for a longer total time over their disease course. Therefore, the physiologic sequelae of treatment should be even more apparent. The toxicity profile of ADT can include obesity, anemia, loss of bone mineral density, muscle atrophy, gynecomastia, and mood changes; and it also may include an increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. 8 Cognitive dysfunction and the risk of dementia have drawn an increased research focus in their association with ADT. Cognitive dysfunction here refers to changes in cognition potentially related to ADT and its effect on brain function. Dementia is a clinical syndrome involving the progressive deterioration of intellectual function and includes multiple subtypes. Depending on the etiology, cognitive dysfunction associated with dementia can span various cognitive domains, most often memory, language, reasoning, decision making, visuospatial function, attention, and orientation. In the United States, 1 in 9 individuals aged >65 years are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for 60% to 80% of patients with dementia and is the fifth leading cause of death among older adults. 9 Considering that one-half of all PC diagnoses occur in men aged >65 years, potential cognitive effects of treatment that may accelerate cognitive aging, as well as potentially increased risk of dementia, require careful consideration in a population already at increased risk. In the current general review, we examine and critique the key findings from clinical studies designed to investigate the association of ADT with cognitive dysfunction or dementia."}, {"section_title": "THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIC ROLE OF ANDROGENS", "text": "Dihydrotestosterone is a potent metabolite of testosterone, binding with higher affinity to the androgen receptor, which functions as a transcription factor. It is known that androgen receptor messenger RNA is expressed in the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and hippocampus ( Fig.  1 )-brain regions critical for memory and higher order cognitive function. 10 Several animal studies also support the notion that testosterone and its metabolites play significant roles in maintaining cognitive function. In rodents, there is an observed decrease in the density of spine synapses on pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus (the region supporting anterograde memory) upon androgen withdrawal. 11, 12 Levels of bamyloid protein, the neuropathologic hallmark of AD, increase in rodents that have undergone gonadectomy but revert with dihydrotestosterone supplementation. 13 Androgen blockade in rodents expressing the apoE4 allele (a known human AD risk factor) impairs memory performance.\n14 Male estrogen (formed through testosterone aromatization) also binds to sites in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, increasing serotonergic and cholinergic activity, which maintains neural circuitry and alters lipoprotein levels, to help decrease the risk of cerebral ischemia. Its withdrawal in clinical studies is associated with impaired memory (see reviews by Maki and colleagues). 15, 16 IMPACT OF AGE-RELATED DECLINE IN TESTOSTERONE AND SUPPLEMENTATION ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION In humans, it is well known that both serum and brain levels of testosterone decrease with age. [17] [18] [19] [20] Compared with controls, both serum and brain testosterone levels are lower in men with a clinical diagnosis of AD, with the latter confirmed at autopsy. 21, 22 Figure 1. The formation of androgen receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) and its expression in higher order cognitive brain centers are illustrated."}, {"section_title": "Dementia Risk With ADT in Prostate Ca/McHugh et al", "text": "Cancer April 1, 2018 Compared with the abrupt cessation of sex hormone production in women during menopause, the decline in testosterone is slower with age, with a 0.4% to 1.2% decrease per year beginning in the third or fourth decade. 23 Sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels increase by approximately 1.2% per year, and the free testosterone index (FTI) (the ratio of serum testosterone to SHBG) decreases up to 50%. 24, 25 Collectively, this gives rise to the term andropause, with male hypogonadism (defined by FTI criteria) increasing in prevalence from 9% in their fifties to 91% in their eighties. 18 Correlative studies undertaken to demonstrate a positive association between testosterone and cognitive functioning identified a wider influence in men that extended to other cognitive domains. 26, 27 Cherrier et al reported several placebo-controlled studies examining healthy, older men who received supplementary testosterone and observed higher performance in spatial tasks and possibly verbal memory, although they postulated that the latter was dependent on the aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. [28] [29] [30] Studies have also reported an association between low levels of testosterone and AD risk in men. As part of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 574 men were assessed at multiple time points for a mean of 19.1 years (range, 4-37 years). 31 AD diagnosis was inversely associated with FTI, with a 26% decreased risk of AD for each 10 nmol/nmol increase in FTI. Lower free testosterone levels also predated the clinical diagnosis of AD by up to 5 to 10 years. Similar observations were reported in the OPTIMA study (Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing), which examined 112 men with AD and compared gonadotropin, SHBG, and total and free testosterone levels with 98 age-matched controls. 32 Significantly higher levels of luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormone in patients with AD were postulated to explain in part the patients' lower free testosterone level, and follicle-stimulating hormone was identified as an independent predictor for AD. At this point, however, a direct causal role of testosterone in an increased risk of dementia has not been elucidated."}, {"section_title": "NEUROIMAGING IN THE SETTING OF ADT", "text": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a noninvasive method for assessing brain activity during cognitive tasks as well the integrity of regional functional connectivity at rest. In a pilot study, 5 patients who had biochemically recurrent PC after receiving definitive therapy and were eligible for ADT underwent neuroimaging with blood oxygen level-dependent-functional magnetic resonance imaging before treatment and after 9 months of ADT. 33 These imaging techniques were undertaken while patients performed 3 cognitive tasks (encoding, recognition in spatial memory, and mental rotation) to determine whether ADT affected neurovascular responses. These patients were compared with 7 matched healthy controls who underwent the same imaging at matched time intervals. After 9 months, the patients who received ADT had reduced task-related blood oxygen level-dependentfunctional magnetic resonance imaging activation in the right parieto-occipital region for tasks involving manipulation and spatial information.\nAn exploratory case-control study compared 12 patients with localized PC after definitive therapy who received 6 months of ADT versus 12 matched controls. 34 Performance on the N-back task (a behavioral paradigm widely used to assess working memory) was indistinguishable between the 2 groups across assessment time points at baseline and 6 months. However, voxel-based morphometry, which is used to detect differences in the composition of brain tissue and its association with behavioral and cognitive measures, revealed significantly decreased graymatter volumes after 6 months in the primary motor, frontopolar, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the ADT group only (P < .05). Despite the small sample size and relatively short duration of observation, these hypothesis-generating, preliminary findings warrant expansion to investigate whether the functional and structural differences associated with ADT worsen with additional time and perhaps are a harbinger of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "CLINICAL DATA: COGNITIVE EFFECTS OF ADT IN PROSTATE CANCER", "text": "Numerous prospective studies examining the impact of ADT on cognitive function (Table 1) have demonstrated conflicting results. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Favoring a correlation between ADT and cognitive decline is a study by Green et al, in which 82 men with extraglandular PC were randomized in a 4-arm design to receive either surveillance or various forms ADT. 35 Twenty-four of the 50 men who were randomized to continuous ADT demonstrated significant declines in either verbal memory or executive function at their 6-month assessments. No patients who were randomized to close monitoring exhibited cognitive decline. Despite consistent findings with longer follow-up and expansion to include a healthy control group, limitations exist. Spatial memory testing, a cognitive domain with widely reported sensitivity to both ADT use and testosterone supplementation, 28, 30, 33, 37, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] was omitted.\nReview Article Abbreviations: #, significant disimprovement; \", significant improvement; ADT, androgen-deprivation therapy; BCR, biochemical recurrence; BL, baseline; EBPM, event-based prospective memory; LHRHa, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist; NA, not applicable; NS, not specified. More than 20% of patients did not complete all cognitive tasks, and there were group differences in baseline IQ and education. In addition, supporting the relation between ADT and declining cognition, Jenkins et al evaluated patients with localized PC who were receiving neoadjuvant ADT and conducted cognitive assessments at baseline, at 3 to 5 months (ADT completion), and at 9 months after stopping therapy. 39 Forty-seven percent of patients in the ADT group declined on at least 1 cognitive task compared with matched controls, exhibiting lower performance on spatial ability and spatial memory tasks, although it is noteworthy that performance recovered at the 9-month post-treatment cessation assessment.\nSalminen et al also reported slower visuomotor skills and reaction times in various attentional domains in 26 men who received ADT for 12 months, but that study did not include a control group. 38 With the addition of controls in a follow-up study with baseline assessment only, the ADT group demonstrated improvements in object recall and semantic memory, likely because of practice effects from repeated administrations. 37 In addition, Yang et al undertook a cross-sectional study comparing neuropsychological parameters for 3 groups: patients with PC who were receiving ADT, patients with PC who were not receiving ADT, and healthy controls. 40 Notably, for this trial, prospective memory (PM) was examined, specifically, time-based PM (eg, remembering to call a friend in an hour) and eventbased PM (eg, remembering to purchase fruit when passing a fruit stand). ADT recipients had significantly lower scores for event-based PM (EBPM), but not for timebased PM, compared with the non-ADT and healthy control groups. Because the prefrontal cortex is a known higher cognitive functioning center, this finding complements earlier studies in which positron emission tomography/computed tomography activity was demonstrated in this region with EBPM tasks 46 and, conversely, deficits in EBPM were observed among patients who had injuries to the prefrontal cortex. 47 With respect to PC, this finding is congruent with the previously discussed study in which decreased gray matter volumes after ADT use were observed in the primary motor, frontopolar, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. 34 By contrast, several studies failed to demonstrate a relation between ADT and cognition. In a small study, Cherrier et al examined patients who received ADT treatment at baseline, 9-month (treatment cessation), and 12-month cognitive assessments. 36 Compared with healthy controls and except for a decline on a measure of spatial ability (mental rotation), the ADT group at 9 months exhibited no decline in cognitive function.\nMore importantly, 1 of the largest and best controlled matched cohort studies compared men who had PC from the time of ADT initiation versus men who had PC but did not receive ADT and healthy controls. 48 Neurocognitive testing was undertaken at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Cumulative drop-out rates were low (10% and 12% at 6 and 12 months, respectively). No consistent evidence of deleterious cognitive effects of ADT over 12 months were observed. Minor weaknesses included a lack of specificity for the type of ADT received and the allowance of baseline cognitive assessment up to 4 weeks after starting ADT. The size of this study helps to underscore its negative findings, which were made more robust in a recent publication from the same group, updating cognitive outcomes in the same patient cohorts, with an extended follow-up of 36 months. 41 Again, no significant declines in cognitive function among ADT recipients were reported. No prior studies had examined the impact of long-term ADT use beyond 1 year.\nThe studies discussed above have methodological deficits not limited to size, observation, or volunteer selection bias. Irrespective of the validity or reliability of cognitive testing, practice effects (the influence of prior experience taking a test on retaking the same test) are important confounders that can aggregate over time, concealing subtle cognitive changes. This finding is apparent in all studies that have examined this patient population, extends to healthy comparator individuals aged 70 years, and is evident in testing up to 2 years apart. 49 CLINICAL DATA: USE OF ADT AND THE RISK OF DEMENTIA Within the last 2 years there have been a number of large observational studies reporting incident dementia in patients who receive ADT for prostate cancer (Table 2) . [50] [51] [52] [53] Propelling the public concerns about an association between ADT use and dementia was a recent single-institution, retrospective study undertaken at Stanford University. 50 Information collected through a previously validated text-processing method was gathered on patients between 1994 and 2013 to include exposed (received ADT) and nonexposed patients with PC. The start of follow-up was from the initiation of ADT in the exposed group. Because the nonexposed group had no similar definitive start date, the time of follow-up was synthetic. The follow-up period began on the date of the PC diagnosis plus the exposed group's median time from diagnosis to ADT receipt. The latter is an important definition, Review Article because it may have introduced immortal time bias, in that some ADT recipients may have started ADT years after their PC diagnosis, giving the nonusers a longer average follow-up, which inflates the denominator of the rate and overestimates the hazard ratio (HR). 53 Of the 9272 patients who met inclusion criteria, 1826 (19.7%) received ADT. In total, 314 incident cases of dementia were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 3.4 years. Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated a significantly lower cumulative probability of remaining dementia free in the propensity score matched and unmatched cohorts, with a 4.4% absolute increased dementia risk in ADT users (3.5% in nonusers vs 7.9% in users). This statistically significant association persisted with the exclusion of patients who received chemotherapy and those who had incident dementia diagnosed within the first 2 years of follow-up. Stratification by duration of ADT use demonstrated the highest dementia risk in patients who received ADT for >12 months. In addition to being a retrospective, single-institution study, it was not adequately powered to analyze dementia risk by type of ADT, nor could the disease state for ADT use be characterized. The informatics-based approach to the study was previously validated in a report on surveillance of adverse events associated with pharmacotherapy, in which free text notes of both medication and adverse events were analyzed. 54 That report indicated that some level of accuracy would be lost in accurately identifying relatively unambiguous and publicly observable events (treatment and adverse outcomes), but this was deemed an acceptable compromise in exchange for the power of larger data sets.\nTwo studies from Taiwan comprised the first population-based studies exploring the relation between ADT receipt and the risk of dementia (Table 2) . 51, 52 For both studies, data were retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, which consists of medical claims and registry files for 1 million individuals randomly sampled from the Taiwan National Health Insurance program. Patients with newly diagnosed PC (according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification) were selected from records of ambulatory care visits or hospitalizations. The 'index date' (the time point from which incident dementia diagnoses were recorded) differed between the 2 groups, which was the time of first receipt of ADT for the treatment group and the time of PC diagnosis for the non-ADT group. All patients in both studies were followed for 5 years. Kao et al tracked patients for an In a recently published, large, retrospective, UK population-based study, the use of ADT was not associated with an increased risk of dementia (Table 2) . 53 By using the world's largest primary care database (700 practices), the Clinical Practice Research Datalink retrieved incident diagnoses of dementia by read code classification among 30,903 eligible patients. Each patient's dementia subtype was recorded by the general practitioner, a method that has demonstrated high validity. [55] [56] [57] Unique to that trial was the use of time-dependent exposure definition to eliminate immortal time bias. Cohort entry corresponded to the incident PC diagnosis, but the start of follow-up could only begin 1 year after a diagnosis of PC to account for potential delays in a diagnosis of dementia because of its insidious presentation. Consequently, patients who had a dementia diagnoses made in the 12-month interval after diagnosis were excluded. Exposure to ADT was lagged by an additional 1 year to account for a minimal latency period and to minimize detection bias.\nIn total, 17,994 patients (58.2%) received ADT for a median duration of 2.3 years, and 799 patients were diagnosed with dementia, for a crude incidence of 6.0 per 1000 person-years, similar to that reported for men in the general population aged >70 years. Two hundred ninetythree patients (36.7%) had AD, and 506 (63.3%) had other dementias. Compared with nonuse, the use of ADT was not associated with an overall increased risk of dementia (7.4 v 4.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87-1.19). Dementia risk did not vary by cumulative duration or ADT type. Furthermore, primary analyses were repeated with lengthening of the exposure-lag period to 2 and 3 years, which did not change the HRs.\nHowever, there are still limitations to that analysis. It is likely that diagnoses were made by practitioners who had various levels of expertise in neurodegenerative conditions and had still less expertise in distinguishing subtypes of dementia. The direct effects of ADT on cognition or the fatigue mediated by ADT may lead practitioners to misinterpret these cognitive changes and incorrectly identify them as the prodromal phase of an incipient dementia. Although the authors acknowledge that there may be some decrease in diagnostic accuracy in relying on clinical diagnoses rather than autopsy results, they reference 2 studies that reported adequate sensitivity and specificity in relying on clinical diagnoses. 58, 59 In both studies, however, clinical diagnoses were made either by neurologists in an AD research center using well defined and standardized qualitative criteria for diagnosis (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/ Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) or in a specialized neurologic unit that included formal, objective neuropsychological assessment.\nShould further work enable a more robust association of ADT with the risk of dementia, a natural follow-on question would be whether an intermittent approach to ADT administration would lower the risk of AD. A recent secondary analysis of the Southwest Oncology Group 9346 clinical trial, which randomized patients to receive intermittent or continuous ADT if they had a prostate-specific antigen nadir of <4 ng/mL after 7 months of induction ADT, compared the difference in dementia incidence during follow-up between these 2 groups. 60 That analysis of US-based patients used a novel linkage that matched the Southwest Oncology Group clinical records to Medicare claims data. Patients were classified as having dementia if they had any hospital claim or at least 2 physician/outpatient claims at least 30 days apart (the latter was used to reduce misclassification bias). Dementia codes were established before the analysis using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes. Results indicated a statistically nonsignificant difference in cumulative the incidence of dementia in patients who received continuous ADT compared with those who received intermittent ADT (8% vs 4%; HR, 1.98; P 5 .07%). The type of dementia was not specified. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution given the low number of events reported and the lack of power intrinsic to an analysis of a subset of patients."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Median survival rates for PC clinical states continue to improve, which equates to a larger population of older Review Article cancer survivors. ADT has been a crucial part of the improvements in cancer outcomes across the spectrum of the disease based on sound prospective, well controlled, and adequately powered phase 3 studies. This progress comes with the caveat that adverse effects of contemporary cancer therapies will increase in prevalence and relevance. A discussion of the correlation between ADT and cognitive decline and dementia should be part of the conversation about the merits and drawbacks of initiating ADT in a given clinical context, with consideration of the patient's disease risk, comorbidities, and expected longevity. At this point, the specific risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia, physiologic correlates, effects of ADT scheduling (continuous vs intermittent), or the global impact of mood or fatigue on cognition have not been fully elucidated. For many viable patients who face high risks of death or disability from disease, the possibility of neurocognitive risks is acceptable.\nSuch risk/benefit discussions should include the quality of the supporting data for these risks. For dementia, given the difficulties of prospectively assessing the association with ADT, studies rely on retrospective, remote identification of dementia based on textual analysis and surveillance of diagnostic codes, both of which will involve tradeoffs of diagnostic accuracy for large data sets. Although recent population-based analyses are laudable for their clear methodology and objectives, the ambiguity between studies is concerning with respect to concluding how to appropriately inform patients before therapy. For cognitive decline, although authors offer a biologically sound rationale for the development of cognitive impairment from ADT, many of the studies are small, methodologically flawed, but hypothesis-provoking. They do not form a body of work that can independently support a conclusion or change in practice.\nUntil prospective, randomized controlled studies with close periodic follow-up are completed, we recommend that physicians discuss the possible-although not certain-association between ADT and cognitive impairment before they initiate ADT with their patients. This discussion should be separated from discussions about other, well documented toxicities. Once ADT is started, these patients can be assessed during follow-up for temporal neurocognitive changes, with early specialist referral should cognitive impairment emerge."}, {"section_title": "FUNDING SUPPORT", "text": "This research was funded through the National Institutes of Health Cancer Center Support grant (P30 CA008748)."}]
