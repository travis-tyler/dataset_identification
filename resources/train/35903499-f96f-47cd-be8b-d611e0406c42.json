[{"section_title": "", "text": "G ROWTH hormone (GH), via both systemic and local production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), provides important trophic support for bone and lean tissues and is lipolytic in adults. Normal aging is associated with a progressive decrease in integrated spontaneous GH secretion and in circulating IGF-I levels, which fall by 30-50% from the third to the seventh decade (1) . Some studies suggest that the rate of decline in IGF-I is uniform throughout the life span (2) , while others show a decline less marked in middle age than in early adulthood (3) . Moreover, coexisting illness may exert independent inhibitory effects, further reducing IGF-I levels (4) .\nLean body mass and bone mass decrease progressively with age, whereas body fat increases, particularly in the intra-abdominal compartment (1, 5) . In women, peak trabecular bone mass is reached at approximately 30 years of age and declines rapidly for 3-5 years after menopause (6) . In men, peak bone mass is 25% higher and is reached 5 years later. After age 75, bone loss decelerates in both genders (6) . The risk of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is increased significantly in postmenopausal women when bone mass is reduced to 20-30% below peak values. In addition to age and gender, body weight is an important determinant of bone mineral density (BMD), with higher bone mass occurring in more obese individuals (7) .\nThe relationships of the typical changes in body composition during normal aging to alterations in the GH/IGF-I axis remain uncertain. Some studies suggest that age-related declines in GH/IGF-I axis activity may contribute to alterations in body composition (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . IGF-I levels are inversely related to obesity, independent of age, and may increase after weight loss. To our knowledge, there are no reports describing relationships of IGF-I with lean body mass across the entire adult age range. Of note is that GH administration, which raises plasma levels of IGF-I, increases lean body mass and reduces adipose mass in older men (13) and in younger adults with pathological GH deficiency (14) . Nonelderly GH-deficient adults exhibit decreased cortical and"}, {"section_title": "M176", "text": "Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-abstract/53A/3/M176/540600 by guest on 22 January 2018 M177 trabecular bone mineral densities that are improved by longterm treatment with GH (14) . Circulating levels of IGF-I have been positively correlated with bone mass in some (15, 16) but not all (17) studies of healthy men, as well as in premenopausal (18) but not postmenopausal (19) women. Similarly, reduced IGF-I levels have been reported in some (16, 20) , but not all (21) studies of osteoporotic patients.\nSome discrepancies among these studies may be explained by differences in the influences of age, gender, and certain confounding variables (e.g., disease, nutriture, medication use) on the interrelationships between GH/IGF-I axis function and body composition. Consequently, in order to clarify the effect of age on circulating IGF-I, and to characterize the relationships of IGF-I with body composition, we undertook a cross-sectional analysis of a group of healthy participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) to test the hypotheses that: (a) the rate of decline of circulating IGF-I levels varies over the adult life span; (b) IGF-I levels are inversely related to measures of body fat and positively related to indices of lean body mass and bone mineral density, independent of age; and (c) the influence of circulating IGF-I on BMD is manifest by its relationships with biochemical markers of bone metabolism."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "A subset of healthy participants in the BLSA was selected for this cross-sectional study. The general characteristics of this population have been described previously (22) . Subjects were screened to exclude medications and diseases that are known to interfere with GH/IGF-I axis function or bone metabolism, including recent acute illness or immobilization; endocrine, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disorders; or excessive alcohol use (defined as more than 5 drinks per day). Exclusionary medications were gonadal steroids, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, (3 blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, fluoride, or vitamin D (>400 IU/day).\nNutritional status, a known determinant of circulating IGF-I levels (9), appeared to be stable in these subjects, as indicated by a mean weight change of 3.4% (SD \u00b1 3.5%) over the 2 years prior to blood sampling. Twelve subjects (7 women and 5 men) had serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH D) < 15 ng/ml, suggestive of nutritional deficiency. Exclusion of data from these subjects did not alter the results of analysis of relationships between IGF-I and any other outcome variables measured; therefore, data for the entire group are reported below. The final study population consisted of 351 healthy, ambulatory Caucasian community-dwelling volunteers (223 men and 128 women).\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/ height squared (m 2 ) and used as a measure of total obesity. The waist-hip ratio (WHR), defined as the minimum circumference at the waist divided by the maximum extension over the buttock, was utilized as an index of central adiposity."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory Measurements", "text": "Blood was drawn between 0615 and 0730 h after a 12 h fast. Serum was separated and stored at -70\u00b0C. Aliquots were taken from 24 h urine samples collected in vessels containing 15 mL 6 N HC1 and stored at -70\u00b0C. All assays were performed in duplicate. Serum and urinary creatinine were measured by a standard automated procedure (Creatinine Analyzer 2, Beckman Instruments, Brea, CA). Twentyfour-hour urinary creatinine excretion (Crex) was used as a surrogate measure of muscle mass. This measure has been adjusted for height (Crex/ht) and validated previously (23) .\nTotal serum IGF-I (24) was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after acid-ethanol extraction (Endocrine Sciences Laboratories, Calabasas Hills, CA). The intra-and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 5.4% and 7.3%, respectively, and the sensitivity was 30 ng/ml.\nSerum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was quantified using the Allegro immunoradiometric assay (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). This assay is specific for the intact 1-84 amino acid peptide (25) . The intra-and interassay CVs were 6.1% and 8.2%, and the sensitivity was 1 ng/L. 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) was quantified after acetonitrile extraction by direct RIA (26) . The intra-and interassay CVs were each < 13%, and the sensitivity was 3 ng/mL. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 ) was determined by radioreceptor assay as previously described (26) . The. intra-and interassay CVs were each < 10%, and the sensitivity was 5 pg/mL. Serum osteocalcin was measured by a modified RIA (27) , with intra-and interassay CVs each < 10%, and a sensitivity of 1.0 ng/ml.\nBMD of the nondominant radius was measured at the distal one-third site by single photon absorptiometry (SPA) using a I25 I source (28) . The rectilinear scanner (model SP2; Lunar Radiation, Madison, WI) used in this procedure had a precision of 1.5% in our laboratory. The BMDs of the spine (region of interest L2-4) and hip (femoral neck and Ward's triangle) were assessed by dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) with a scanner (model DP-3; Lunar Radiation) containing a l53 Gd source (29) .

The frequency distributions of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), osteocalcin, and 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 in this population were skewed to the right, and log transformations of these data resulted in a normal distribution. All other data were normally distributed. Relationships between continuous variables were analyzed separately by gender using linear regression analysis and expressed as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients, as appropriate. All regression plots were visually inspected for appropriateness of fit of the linear model. Where relationships appeared to be nonlinear, higher order polynomial functions were compared with the corresponding linear function for goodness-of-fit using the technique of comparison of residual mean squares. Forward stepwise and multiple regression analyses were used to determine the variance of the dependent variable explained by the independent variables of interest. The F statistic to enter a variable in the stepwise regression model was set at 4 and the F to remove at 3.996. Where the relationship of one or more variables with age was significantly nonlinear, adjustment of the variables for age was performed by analysis of residuals of the corresponding higher order polynomials. When multiple comparisons of variables were performed, an adjusted p-value of .01 was used to determine significance. Accordingly, our sample sizes were sufficient to detect an intercorrelation among two or more variables with a correlation coefficient (r) of > .26. The significance of differences between linear slopes was compared by t tests. Gender differences of means were compared by t tests or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate.\nInspection of the curve of the relationship of IGF-I with age in women suggested that the rate of decline of IGF-I was steeper in women < 45 years than in women > 45 years. Accordingly, in a post hoc analysis, slopes of decline of IGF-I were compared in the younger versus the older groups. All of the 56 women < 45 years were premenopausal, whereas 60 of the 67 women > 45 years were postmenopausal."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Study Population", "text": "The men in this study were significantly heavier, taller, and more muscular (by Crex/Ht) than the women, and had greater total (by BMI) and central (by WHR) obesity (Table  1) . BMDs were greater at the radius, femoral neck, and spine in men. There were no significant gender differences in serum levels of IGF-I, BMD at Ward's triangle, or bone biochemical measures.\nAge versus IGF-I.-Plasma IGF-I declined linearly with age in men ( Figure 1A) . In women, a cubic model provided the best fit to the data ( Figure IB) . These declines were highly significant in both genders (Table 2 ). In a post hoc analysis, the slope of the regression line for women < 45 yr O = -6.6 \u00b1 1.3) was greater than the corresponding slopes for women > 45 yr (p = -2.5 \u00b1 0.6; p < .01) and for men O = -2.0 \u00b1 0.2; p < .001). When the data were analyzed in terms of menopausal duration, the slope of the regression line for premenopausal women (P = -6.5 \u00b1 1.3) was also greater than that of postmenopausal women ((3 = -2.0 \u00b1 0.7; p < .01). Comparison of slopes in women by age decade revealed no significant differences, because of the small numbers of subjects in each decade and the large variances. Bivariate Regressions IGF-I with body composition and bone biochemistries.-Bivariate regression analyses revealed inverse relationships of serum IGF-I with BMI in women and with WHR in both genders, and positive relationships of IGF-I with Crex/ht and BMD at all four sites in both genders (Table 2) . IGF-I was inversely related to PTH in women and was significantly related to osteocalcin in men as a third order polynomial, but not to 25-OHD and 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 in either gender.\nAge with body composition and bone biochemistries.-BMI increased with age in women and WHR increased with age in both genders (Table 2) . Crex/ht and BMD at all four sites declined with age. Age was positively related to PTH in both genders but not to 25-OHD or 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . The rate of decline of BMD with age at each of four sites, as assessed by comparisons of regression slopes, was greater in women than in men (p < .001). The relationship of age with osteocalcin in men was best represented by a quadratic equation (r = .36; p < .0001), osteocalcin declining until age 60 and thereafter increasing. In women, the relationship of osteocalcin with age was best described by a cubic equation (r = .37; p < .0005); osteocalcin declining rapidly until age 40, increasing thereafter until age 75, then declining again."}, {"section_title": "Multiple Regressions", "text": "Body composition and bone biochemistry versus IGF-I and age.-To determine the relative contributions of IGF-I and age to the measured body composition and bone metabolic variables, we performed a series of multiple regression analyses using BMI, WHR, Crex/ht, PTH, 25-OHD, and 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 as dependent variables, each regressed against circulating IGF-I and age as the independent variables (Table 3) . Addition of age to the model for BMI did not improve the variance explained by IGF-I alone in either gender. However, age, and not IGF-I, was positively related to WHR, and inversely related to CREX/ht (Table 3) .\nIn multiple regressions of the bone biochemistry variables versus age and IGF-I, PTH increased significantly with age in men (p < .01). Neither age nor IGF-I was a significant determinant of 25-OHD. 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 was independently and positively related to IGF-I in women (p < .01) but not in men. Because the relationship of age with osteocalcin was curvilinear, we evaluated the relationships of the age-adjusted residuals of osteocalcin to IGF-I; they were not significant in either gender.\nBMD versus IGF-I, age, and BMI.-Because of the important influence of body mass on BMD (7), BMD at each of four sites was analyzed as the dependent variable and regressed against IGF-I, age, and BMI (Table 4) . In both genders, age was significantly inversely related to BMD at four sites, while BMI was positively related to BMD of the femoral neck and spine.

No significant relationships of IGF-I were evident in the latter analysis."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this cross-sectional study of healthy, ambulatory women and men, serum IGF-I levels declined linearly with age in men, whereas in women, a cubic model provided the best fit of the data. The rate of decline of IGF-I was significantly greater in women under 45 years of age compared with that in older women or men. Prior studies have shown that peak levels of circulating IGF-I of about 500 ug/1 occur in boys and girls at about age 15, and decline thereafter to values around 100 ug/1 by age 80 in both men and women (2) . In one study, circulating IGF-I concentrations below the lowest 2.5th percentile of values in young (20-29 yr) men occurred in 85% of healthy older (59-98 yr) men (31) . Using the same criteria, 59% of older women and men in our study exhibited reduced levels of IGF-I. Although one prior study (2) found the decline of IGF-I levels to be linear with no gender differences, our observations are more in accord with results of a study in which there was a significantly greater rate of decline of IGF-I levels in women aged 21-40 years than in women aged 41-80 years or in men (32) , and in another study, in which there was a steeper decline of IGF-I levels from the third to the fourth and again from the eighth to trie ninth versus the intervening decades (3). Circulating levels of endogenous estrogen have been positively related to levels of IGF-I in premenopausal women (33) . In contrast, administration of oral (34) or high dose transdermal estrogen (35) to postmenopausal women diminishes circulating levels of IGF-I, presumably by inhibiting hepatic production. The current finding of a greater rate of decline in circulating levels of IGF-I in women under age 45 is consistent with loss of an endogenous estrogenic stimulatory effect on IGF-I production. An effect via circulating levels of IGFBP-3 is unlikely, as estrogen replacement therapy has been reported not to affect levels of this binding protein in younger postmenopausal women (36) .\nIn the present study, multivariate analysis revealed that age, and not circulating IGF-I, was the independent determinant of total and regional adiposity in both sexes. In contrast, cross-sectional studies conducted in other healthy populations reported that there were age-independent inverse relationships of IGF-I with BMI (9) , and that IGF-I was more strongly related to measures of intra-abdominal versus total adiposity (10) (11) (12) . Moreover, in studies of adult GH deficiency, and of healthy elderly people, administration of recombinant human GH or IGF-I reduces fat mass, particularly intra-abdominal fat, suggesting that the agerelated declines in GH secretion and IGF-I levels contribute to accumulation of body fat (1, 14) . One possible explanation for the discrepancies between the current and abovecited studies is that our population was nonobese and exhibited a predominantly peripheral fat distribution. In one prior study that included more obese subjects, men had significantly greater BMI values than did women and exhibited an independent inverse relationship of BMI with IGF-I, not demonstrable in women (9) . Taken together with these reports, our data suggest that there may be a threshold effect of body fat, below which its inhibitory effects on IGF-I levels are not apparent.\nIn this study osteocalcin levels decreased in both genders until the fifth decade and then increased, with a further late decline in the ninth decade in women. After adjusting for the effects of age, we found no cross-sectional relationships of osteocalcin with IGF-I in either sex. However, administration of GH and IGF-I to healthy people (37) and patients with osteoporosis (38) stimulates markers of bone formation, including osteocalcin, and some paradigms of IGF-I administration may selectively enhance biochemical markers of bone formation versus resorption (39) . One prior study of postmenopausal women reported no correlation between levels of osteocalcin and GH secretion, as assessed by frequent blood sampling from 0800 hr to 12 noon (40), a time when GH secretion is at its lowest. Further studies are required to examine the interrelationships between spontaneous GH secretion, as assessed by 24-hour or nocturnal blood sampling, and levels of osteocalcin or other bone biochemical markers.\nWe found that IGF-I levels were independently and positively related to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 but not to 25-OH D levels in women. Administration of GH to healthy older men and women and to osteoporotic patients increases plasma levels of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 , possibly by increasing PTH levels (41) . Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous GH increases synthesis of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 through the intermediacy of circulating IGF-I, perhaps by increasing activity of renal 1 a-hydroxylase (42) . As levels of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 are unchanged with age in this population (43) , the influence of the age-related decrease in GH-IGF-I axis function on endogenous vitamin D metabolism is probably small. Furthermore, our finding that the inverse relationship of PTH with IGF-I in women and men was no longer evident after adjustment for age suggests that the above-noted relationships of IGF-I and vitamin D are independent of PTH.\nBecause reduced levels of circulating IGF-I have been reported in some studies of patients with symptomatic osteoporosis (16, 20) , we assessed whether decrements in levels of IGF-I are associated with the age-related decline in bone mass. We found that the relationships of IGF-I with BMD at four sites disappeared after adjustment for age in both genders, consistent with prior findings in women (19) and men (17) . An age-independent positive relationship of IGF-I with spine BMD was described in a study of younger men with osteoporosis (16); however, it appears that data from patients and controls were combined to derive this result. In another study of healthy young men, IGF-I was independently and inversely correlated with BMD of the femoral neck and Ward's triangle (15) . Discrepancies between the current and latter study may result in part from the large number of variables included in the prediction model relative to the number of observations in the latter study. Our data do not support a relationship of circulating IGF-I with BMD, either directly or indirectly, in healthy older adults.\nIn summary, we found that the age-related decline in circulating levels of IGF-I was linear in men across the entire adult age-span, whereas in younger women, the decline was more rapid than in older women or in men. There were no significant age-independent relationships of IGF-I with body composition or BMD, suggesting either that such relationships do not truly exist, or that measurement of circulating IGF-I at a single time point is not a reliable index of integrated GH-IGF-I axis function. However, in women, IGF-I was independently related to serum levels of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . Because we studied a highly screened, healthy population with many disease and medication exclusions, generalization of the current findings to the larger population, or to frail elders, may not be valid. Finally, these data do not preclude the possibility that administration of GH and/or IGF-I may exert beneficial effects on body composition and function in elderly men and women."}]
