[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "[1] Microwave remote sensing of tropical cyclones undergoing rapid intensification (RI; DV 30 kt/24 h) reveals structural differences from storms of lesser intensification rates; with 85 GHz signatures depicting a moderately intense convective ring surrounding the storm center. Overpass composites binned by wind shear magnitude show the ring is consistent for low shear RI storms, forming approximately 6 h before RI begins, then contracting and intensifying over the following 24 h. High shear RI events make up a smaller portion of all cases, with little evidence of a convective ring. With the majority of RI cases occurring in low shear, microwave observations of convective axisymmetry prior to RI onset may hold promise for its forecast, with an observed lag between the structural and heating modification and resultant intensification. Given the potential for destruction to vulnerable coastal interests and the current poor predictability of RI, any increase in RI forecast skill would be of great benefit to society.

While trends in TC track forecasts have seen an improvement in accuracy of nearly 50% at time periods of 24-72 h from 1990-2008, little gain in accuracy of intensity forecasts over this same timeframe have been achieved [Rappaport et al., 2009] . This is a byproduct of forecast models' ability to resolve synoptic influences governing TC motion, but failing to capture the convective-scale to microscale processes occurring within the inner core that drive intensity change. This deficiency can be particularly troublesome in anticipating episodes of rapid intensification (RI), such that the National Hurricane Center has elevated this issue to top priority for the tropical meteorology community [Rappaport et al., 2009] . If additional routine globally-available observations could improve TC intensity change predictions, appropriate measures including evacuations and the protection of property could be undertaken.\n[3] Several processes, most occurring in the TC core, have been tied to RI. Implicated features include: mesovorticies [Nolan and Montgomery, 2002] , convective asymmetries [Braun et al., 2006] , and vortical hot towers (VHTs) under high wind shear [Molinari and Vollaro, 2010] . Conversely, RI has been noted in periods of weak shear [Frank and Ritchie, 1999] with a propensity for axisymmetric structure [Nolan and Grasso, 2003] . Kieper [2010] noted several case studies where axisymmetry of the inner core is depicted on multi-polarization 37 GHz composites of passive microwave (PM) brightness temperature associated with RI.\n[4] Satellites appear to be an optimal tool for observing TC intensity, as seen in the widespread usage of the Dvorak technique [Dvorak, 1984] . Infrared sensors, commonly used in Dvorak intensity estimates, only provide information about cloud tops, which in TCs are often cold cirrus obscuring convective structure and organization below. PM sensors can overcome this problem due to their ability to retrieve microphysical information within precipitating clouds. Low frequency PM channels (10-37 GHz) detect emission from liquid hydrometeors whereas higher frequencies (37-85 GHz) measure scattering of upwelling radiation by cloud ice, and accordingly can be used as a proxy for convective intensity [Spencer et al., 1989; McGaughey et al., 1996] . This study encompasses both the largest PM study of TCs and largest observational study of RI to date."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "[5] To examine TC convective morphology during periods of RI, a dataset is generated of all TC overpasses globally from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) from [Spencer et al., 1989] and PCT 85 < 220 K to deep convection [McGaughey et al., 1996] . Results using 37 GHz data (not shown), as by Kieper [2010] , were confounded due to the increased sensitivity to emission from liquid hydrometeors being offset by scattering signatures from frozen hydrometeors.\n[6] Overpasses are evaluated in terms of the intensity (wind speed; V) change over the 24-h interval following the time of overpass, as determined from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) [Knapp et al., 2010] . Using the framework of the HURSAT-MW dataset [Knapp, 2008] , swath brightness temperatures are bilinearly interpolated to a common 8 km grid centered on the linearly interpolated TC location from IBTrACS storm locations (given every 6 h at 0, 6, 12, and 18 UTC), however storm intensity information is taken from the nearest reporting time (up to \u00b13 hr). RI is defined as DV \u2265 30 kt/24 h, which was found by Kaplan and DeMaria [2003] to correspond to the 95th percentile of intensity change for the North Atlantic and here corresponds to the 96th percentile. For comparison to other intensity changes, the following criteria are utilized: intensifying (30 kt/24 h > DV \u2265 10 kt/24 h), steady state (10 kt/24 h > DV \u2265 \u221210 kt/24 h) and weakening (DV < \u221210 kt/24 h).\n[7] In order to only capture information regarding core processes of organized TCs. some additional criteria are applied. A minimum of 50% swath coverage of the innermost 1\u00b0from the storm center is required to ensure sufficient sampling of core structure. Satellite overpasses of storms with estimated intensities < 33 kt are excluded from the study to remove weak tropical depressions and decaying systems. All overpasses must be centered \u2264 35\u00b0latitude to remove storms possibly undergoing extratropical transition. Finally, all overpasses must have the best track position \u2265 150 km from land to remove any potential land influences. For our analysis, each overpass is evaluated in wind shear relative coordinates, with wind shear defined as the difference between NCEP/NCAR reanalysis [Kalnay et al., 1996] 850 and 200 hPa winds averaged at a radius of 200-800 km from the TC center. Winds at each level are averaged over a 200-800 km radius to remove the background TC vortex from the low level wind field, as done by the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme [DeMaria et al., 2005] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "[8] Composite PCT 85 plan views are generated for each of the four intensity change classifications, with the results seen in Figure 1 . The RI composite ( Figure 1a ) reveals a convective ring structure of PCT 85 values of 240-250 K not apparent in other intensity changes. PCT 85 values in this range, on average, have been associated with convection containing mixed and ice phase processes in TC eyewalls with TRMM precipitation radar 17 dBZ radar echo top heights around 10 km [Cecil and Zipser, 2002, Figure 10 ]. This axisymmetric feature possesses a more vigorous ice scattering signature than any location in the other classes, lending to the inherent differences in storms undergoing RI. The presence and intensity of this feature suggests the predictive potential of 85 GHz data to distinguish storms undergoing RI from other intensity changes.\n[9] To examine whether the composite annular structure for RI systems is a byproduct of the composite procedure with strong ice scattering signatures at constant radii but varying azimuth,, PCT 85 standard deviation values are calculated for each pixel of the intensity change classes with 20 and 25 K contours overlaid on Figure 1 . The RI composite ( Figure 1a ) has standard deviation values highest to the interior of the ring feature, with a smaller spatial field of standard deviation values \u2265 20 K that are constrained to the inner most 1\u00b0for the RI composite, whereas for the other classes this range extends out to 1.5\u00b0or more. Note that there is likely variation in the natural width, diameter, eccentricity, and magnitude of TC eyewalls that is lost in the averaging process. The high standard deviations present near the central eye region is likely a result, due to compositing of warm PCTs of a larger eye with depressed PCTs of a more narrow eyewall. However, the offset location of the maximum standard deviation values to the interior of the most intense scattering signatures and the horizontal extent of low standard deviation values for RI TCs suggests that the ring is likely consistent throughout individual overpasses.\n[10] With the highest variability in RI storms persisting to the interior of the convective ring, it is worth evaluating the possibility of an additional mode of RI besides the axisymmetric feature, e.g., VHTs in high shear [Molinari and Vollaro, 2010] . To evaluate this possibility, the composites are extended 24 h prior to and following RI onset by searching in 6-h intervals for PM overpasses. These composites are divided into two classifications based upon wind shear magnitude, with low shear systems < 10 kt and high shear systems \u2265 10 kt.\n[11] In the 48 h window, a cumulative density function (CDF) of PCT 85 for all pixels of the innermost 1\u00b0as a function of time is depicted in Figure 2 for both shear classes. In the low shear CDF (Figure 2a) for 24, 18, and 12 h prior to RI, the function is temporally consistent, before a shift towards a stronger scattering signature 6 h before RI onset. Intensification continues at all percentiles between 30 and 80 through 18 h following RI onset, with the function leveling off 18 and 24 h after RI begins. This pattern from 6 h before RI onset through 18 h after depicts that in low shear TCs that the RI structural and heating evolution occurs on the order of 6 h before the kinematic response (from 0 through 24 h). The observed temporal evolution of scattering signatures would suggest an observable lead time to forecast RI in low shear of 6 h prior to its onset and 30 h prior to its conclusion.\n[12] For high shear (Figure 2b ), there is a less clear picture of RI evolution. From 12 h prior through RI onset, more intense scattering signatures are seen from the 30th-80th percentiles as noted with low shear. However, for the 12 h after the wind field begins to undergo RI, these percentiles are relatively constant. At 18 h after the onset of RI, a sudden increase in the scattering signature occurs before weakening after 6 h. In both shear classes, the first percentile reveals no discernable role of convective burst features in RI, as far as is discernable by the footprint of PM sensors, as little change is seen in low shear and an unclear trend exists for high shear. It is noted these low percentiles occur at colder PCTs in the high shear CDF (Figure 2b) , so it appears if convective bursts have a role, it is more likely in this scenario.\n[13] To evaluate the spatial coverage of convective features, a pair of threshold values at 250 and 220 K are utilized in a frequency analysis associated with deepening convection in TC eyewalls. The results of these shear-composited analyses are presented in Figure 3 from 12 h prior to RI through 18 h after onset, the timeframe noted in the CDFs in Figure 2 .\n[14] For low shear, the pattern of 250 K occurrence 12 h before onset is disorganized, with a broad area of values around 30% throughout the innermost 1-1.5\u00b0. Moving forward 6 h, the ring structure noted earlier becomes apparent at 0.5\u00b0as a broad region of values 50%. For the next 24 h, the convective ring contracts inward and becomes increasingly well defined as the percentages increase above 70% by 18 h after RI onset. For the more intense convective evaluator (220 K), in low shear cases little activity is seen, with percentages below 10% throughout the storm prior to RI onset. Over the next 18 h, the percentages increase to 25% in isolated locations within the innermost 0.5\u00b0. These results suggest that within low wind shear RI cases (1) the importance of axisymmetric relatively moderately intense convection appears critical, and (2) at the resolution of PM sensors, there is an absence of relatively intense scattering signatures associated with convective bursts.\n[15] High shear presents a much different picture with 250 K depicting no discernable pattern prior to or after RI. This could be a byproduct of the relatively small sample size in these composites and/or a higher prevalence of asymmetry. The orientation of these features does not appear to correspond well to the wind shear vector orientation, possibly due to the large area over which shear is evaluated that may not be representative of the shear impacting the vortex. It is noted however that the percentages at 250 K are generally higher at all time steps than the low shear composites. The 220 K frequencies are higher near the core in high shear compared with low shear, but sample size may be a concern for these composites.\n[16] One potential source for the discrepancy in convective structure between the wind shear RI classes might be that high shear RI systems have lower initial intensities, and thus less convective organization than systems with low wind shear. To evaluate this, the cumulative percentiles of initial intensity of each storm at RI onset are listed in Table 1 for both shear scenarios. High shear cases have a near 10% increase in prevalence of initial winds < 40 kt, however by 50 kt there is a higher percentage of low shear systems (46.4%) than high shear (43.5%). At higher speeds the distributions are similar, suggesting that intensity at RI onset is not critical to the observed organizational differences of the two shear classes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "[17] A 22-year PM record at 85.5 GHz reveals two modes of RI dependent upon the magnitude of environmental wind shear. In low wind shear, axisymmetric convective organization steadily increases leading up to initiation of RI with a convective ring, likely of moderate intensity yet still containing ice and mixed phase microphysical processes, becoming evident around 6 h prior to RI onset. Over the following 24 h, this feature intensifies with an increased ice scattering signature, and contracts inward. The contraction and strengthening of the ring indicates a broad axisymmetric region of heating, which concurs with the arguments from the idealized modeling study of Nolan and Grasso [2003] of the dominance of axisymmetry during intensification. TCs undergoing RI in high wind shear appear more asymmetric with increased convective vigor, while lacking the consistent structural evolution of low shear TCs. The high shear mode accounts for only 10% of the RI cases in the data record. A prototype for this mode possibly follows a case study of 2001 Tropical Storm Gabrielle by Molinari and Vollaro [2010] , where a solitary VHT moved radially inward during RI although interpretation is limited by sample size and lack of kinematic data to establish coupling between heating and intertial stability.\n[18] Morphological information provided by PM imagery presents an opportunity to predict RI, especially in low shear. Analysis of the completeness and vigor of the convective ring are available through methods such as by Wimmers and Velden [2010] with other measures such as width and eccentricity likely providing further insight. The window to predict the initiation of RI via PM structure, and in turn latent heating, appears to be approximately 6 h before the wind field response begins its increase of \u226530 kt/24 h. The importance of morphology and the development of the axisymmetric eyewall structure in RI also indicates why prior PM predictors, such as SHIPS-MI [Jones et al., 2006] are limited due to their reliance on the magnitude of selected brightness temperature values rather than their spatial pattern. High shear RI presents a more complicated problem, likely resulting from the shear influence on asymmetry and the determination of the shear vector impacting the vortex. Low PCT 85 values used as a proxy for convective bursts fail to display a consistent trend as to whether they have a role as a precursor or byproduct of RI, however if they have a role it appears more likely to be under high shear.\n[19] PM platforms represent a potential tool in near real time RI prediction. It is believed an automated algorithm can be developed to estimate RI probability based upon axisymmetry measures along with wind shear based upon the results of this study. With PM overpasses of TCs averaging an estimated 3 h frequency since 2006 with additional future sensors planned (see auxiliary material outlining past and future PM coverage of TCs), in most cases RI can be anticipated using PM sensors.\n1 Further work is necessary, but it appears RI can be anticipated through PM morphology, potentially yielding a tool to better protect life and property in regions affected by TCs.
