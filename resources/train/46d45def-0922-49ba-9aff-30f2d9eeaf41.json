However, individuals' increased abilities to access information content electronically may have dampened urban areas' comparative advantage of proximity-driven knowledge flows. We investigate the effects of increased high-speed Internet access on the role of information proximity by modeling changes in the demands for locally-based information resources, exploiting variation in the use of US public libraries-the most common low-cost providers of locally accessible information content. Data describing a nearly comprehensive set of US public libraries during 2000-2008 provide empirical evidence of complementary growth in Internet access and the use of public library resources, suggesting that Internet access increases the value of locally accessible information content and overall information demand. Moreover, the complementarity is found to be largest in metropolitan areas, indicating that improved Internet access in locations with greatest proximity and information spillover effects are likely to experience more substantial economic impacts."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Proximity to information resources has repeatedly been shown to be important to urban development, facilitating stronger information spillover effects, greater knowledge flows, and overall increases in human capital (Rauch, 1993; Anselin et al., 1997; Funke and Niebuhr, 2005; Rosenthal and Strange, 2008) . Rauch (1993) ; Doms et al. (2010) ; and Charlot and Duranton (2004) show that such knowledge transmissions and spillovers can result in a more highly educated and skilled labor force and increased workplace communication, resulting in faster economic productivity and higher earnings. Consequently, relative to less densely populated areas, greater proximity to locally-based information has been critical for obtaining and transferring knowledge and making urban areas consistently more productive. The relatively recent and rapid growth of the Internet and individuals' increased abilities to access information content electronically, however, may have dampened urban areas' comparative advantage of proximity-driven knowledge flows.\nInformation and the Internet have become virtually synonymous as a result of expanding Internet access, growth of digital content, and improvements in information technology search tools. Between 2000 and 2009, digital content increased from one billion to one trillion unique web pages (Google Blog, 2008) and more than 70 million households began using high-speed Internet (Federal Communications Commission, 2010) .\n1 This growth has likely affected individuals' information content demands, influencing their choice to obtain information content from locally accessible sources or electronically. Following Gaspar and Glaeser (1998) , it is reasonable to posit that digital content could become a substitute for nearly all locally accessible information resources, eliminating the need for geographic proximity to information resources. Alternatively, if Internet access increases the value of locally accessible sources, proximity to these resources could remain integral to continued urban development. While a number of studies in the urban economics literature show that proximity to individuals remains relevant as technology improves (Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998; Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2009; Kolko, 2010a) , less is known about the relationship between Internet access and the demand for locally accessible information. This study investigates the impacts of increased high-speed Internet access on the use of US public libraries, which provide a convenient opportunity to study changes in the demands for locally accessible information resources. De Witte and Geys (2011) show that data describing public libraries can be used to answer broad economic questions, and we study variation in public library use to identify the dominant effects of Internet and information technology growth, which have affected the costs of both searching and acquiring information resources. Content digitization has helped individuals more effectively search for information and acquire some digital content directly (electronically) at relatively low costs. The resulting decreases in search and acquisition costs provide incentives for individuals to substitute away from locally accessible information sources toward Internet-based ones. However, the strength of this substitution effect is dependent on the availability of digital information resources and the realized acquisition costs. For example, although information consumers may be better able to locate information using the Internet (reducing search costs and increasing their information demand), strict and well-established copyright and intellectual property laws often require individuals to incur substantial (and sometimes prohibitive) monetary costs to acquire the content digitally, limiting the amount and types of accessible content.\n2 If individuals can acquire such proprietary information at lower costs from locally accessible providers, then the use of these alternatives would remain constant or possibly expand, especially if lower search costs increase the overall demand for information. This effect would be characterized by a complementary relationship between Internet access growth and the use of locally accessible information content. Local public libraries provide both proprietary and non-proprietary information content at a low monetary cost, these resources are widely accessible, and they are used by the largest proportion of the population.\n3 However, the search and acquisition costs traditionally associated with using these local information providers (such as visiting libraries' physical locations and searching through library catalogs) have likely been altered by Internet access and content growth. We posit that these changes could have resulted in either a substitution or complementary relationship between Internet access and the use of public library resources. To identify the prevailing effect, we estimate the impact of increased Internet access on the demand for US public library resources during 2000-2008, a period of rapid Internet access growth. We then extend the analysis to study the effects by the degree of urbanization (helping provide evidence of whether proximity remains relevant), across income levels, and conditional on local funding preferences. The estimation results indicate that increases in residential Internet access raise individuals' demands for information resources in local public libraries. Furthermore, the complementary relationship is shown to be strongest in large, metropolitan areas and among higher-income communities, but is independent of local communities' support for public libraries, offering some evidence against potential endogeneity. The results suggest that rather than replacing locally accessible information resources, the Internet serves as an integral tool for making these resources more valuable and cost-effective, thus increasing individuals' demands for those resources. This outcome implies that Internet access is likely to contribute to an overall increase in knowledge accumulation through both Internet accessible content and locally accessible content. In metropolitan areas, where locally-based information providers such as public libraries are more readily available, offer a greater breadth of content, and can serve a larger proportion of the population, increased access to information technology contributes most to information demand. Coupled with existing information spillover effects, the impacts of knowledge acquisition are likely to be amplified, helping increase educational outcomes and human capital, productivity, and future knowledge development efforts in cities."}, {"section_title": "Structure and use of US public libraries", "text": "Public libraries provide a convenient opportunity for investigating the effects of Internet access and content growth on individuals' demand for locally accessible information resources. The Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary Improvement Amendment (1988) introduced federally-funded annual surveys for collecting information about public library characteristics and services. In each state, surveys are administered by the chief office of the state library agency under the Federal-State Cooperative System (FSCS). Within the FSCS, public libraries are classified as establishments under state laws or regulations whose primary purpose is to serve their community, district, or region. Moreover, libraries must meet five requirements; they must (1) have an organized collection of printed or other materials; (2) have paid staff; (3) maintain an established schedule in which staff services are available to the public; (4) sustain facilities necessary to support the organized collection, staff, and schedule; and (5) be supported in whole or in part with public funds. Upon meeting these requirements, libraries are classified using a legal basis that identifies the operating structure within which they function."}, {"section_title": "Legal classification and structure", "text": "A library's legal basis does not directly impact its patrons; however, it can non-trivially affect the library's funding opportunities, potentially contributing to the quantity and quality of available information resources. Table 1 shows the distribution of public library classifications as reported in the public-use data from the 2000-2008 Public Library Surveys (PLS), which are collected by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and represent annual censuses of public libraries in the United States. The data indicate that 53.8% of all US public libraries are assigned the municipal government classification and an additional 10.5% have a county or parish government legal basis. Moreover, Table 1 shows that in 37 states, more than half of all public libraries are classified under a municipal, county, or parish government legal basis, and in 14 states, more than 90% of public libraries are assigned one of these two classifications.\n4 Funding for libraries is provided by local, 2 Goffe and Parks (1997) indicate that due to intellectual property rights laws and other factors, the Internet is not a comprehensive source of all available information and the acquisition of information content on the Internet is associated with non-zero costs. These costs may include fees to access particular databases or subscriptions to access journal articles. 3 Alternatives to public libraries such as academic libraries exist, but they are not nearly as geographically ubiquitous and accessible (academic libraries comprise only 22% of all US libraries). Moreover, although some academic libraries provide access to their information resources, the associated information content is unlikely to be demanded by the general population. Consequently, this study focuses only on public libraries, excluding academic libraries. 4 Annual descriptive statistics of legal basis classifications across the sample period provide evidence that libraries change their legal basis infrequently, and therefore, we consider a library's classification to be fixed throughout the sample period. We do not include libraries classified by the Native-American or multi-jurisdictional legal basis. Native-American libraries receive a large proportion of their funding from the federal government, which suggests that these libraries' operating structures may be substantially different from other US public libraries. Multi-jurisdictional libraries are excluded due to the uncertainty of their service areas and associated funding sources. These omitted data make up less than 4.2% of the overall dataset.\nstate, federal, and other sources and the percentage of funding from each source is highly conditional on a library's legal basis classification. The data show that 76.3% of all public library funds are supplied by local governments and 9.1% by state governments. Moreover, libraries classified under the municipal, county, or parish legal basis receive, on average, 82.2% of their funds from local government sources. This implies that the vast majority of US public libraries are funded locally and their operation structure may, therefore, be subject to variability in local economic conditions and historical voter preferences toward public libraries. Table 1 also provides information about library systems' structures and service areas, which helps characterize important differences across urbanization indicators. Library service areas are specified to be metropolitan, urban (non-metropolitan and nonrural), or rural using the 2003 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) rural-urban continuum codes. Continuum codes characterize metropolitan, urban, and rural areas not only using the population size, but also according to an area's proximity to metropolitan centers. Proximity measures are important because more public libraries are located in metropolitan areas and time opportunity costs associated with accessing these libraries are likely lower for information consumers who are closer to large cities. Although most systems only have a central library, this is less the case for library systems serving urban and metropolitan areas. That is, relative to rural communities, library systems serving urban and metropolitan areas are more likely to have branches and bookmobiles, because they may be able to take advantage of economies of scale associated with more spatially clustered library outlets and better infrastructure among these outlets. Over 15% of library systems in metropolitan areas are characterized by a central library with branches and/or bookmobiles compared to 9.6% in urban and 6.1% in rural areas. Furthermore, metropolitan area library systems serve substantially larger populations (14.8 times more people than rural systems and 5.5 times more people than in urban areas). These summary statistics help highlight the importance of locally accessible information sources in metropolitan areas, where knowledge resources are made available to a proportionally larger population and can contribute to greater information spatial spillover effects."}, {"section_title": "Overview of public library use", "text": "During the first decade of the 2000s, the data suggest that library use increased. primarily to use traditional information resources. That is, on average, patrons made 5.76 annual visits to a public library, checking out 5.32 circulated adult materials, 3.07 children's materials, and initiating 1.26 computer sessions. This implies that patrons checked out approximately 0.9 adult resources per visit, 0.5 children's resources per visit, and initiated 0.2 computer sessions per visit. Individuals' decisions to use locally accessible information content and changes due to Internet growth are characterized using responses to the 1996 National Household Education Survey (Library Supplement) and the 2002 Current Population Survey (Library Use Supplement). These data indicate that over 30% of individuals visited a library in 2002 to use computer or Internet services and the number of patrons accessing library resources using a residential Internet connection increased from 3.73% in 1996 to 21.62% in 2002. Furthermore, in both years over two-thirds of the respondents indicated that they use public libraries to obtain information for personal use and enjoyment and approximately 40% indicated that they used libraries for completing school or class assignments. However, the proportion of patrons using libraries to search for employment information decreased from 10.67% to 5.97% and those enrolling children in library-based activities increased from 7.92% to 16.63%. These trends further characterize the manner in which Internet-based content may have altered demands for locally-based information sources. For example, the relative search and acquisition costs of obtaining largely non-proprietary information content, such as employment listings, are likely to be lower using the Internet, leading to a lower demand for that content at public libraries. However, when acquisition of information content is prohibitively costly, such as obtaining textbooks, scientific journals, or other proprietary reference materials for completing school or class assignments, locally-based information providers remain integral. Moreover, remotely connecting to library resources using the Internet can decrease costs associated with searching for these resources, potentially increasing the value of these locally accessible information sources."}, {"section_title": "Empirical specification", "text": "To empirically test whether Internet access should be viewed as a substitute or complement to locally accessible content, we use the responses to the 2000-2008 Public Library Surveys. These data provide information about library systems, which can be composed of central, branch, and/or bookmobile outlets. Each library system serves a particular geographic area, which is specified by the state library or a state governing agency. A library system's service area corresponds to its legal basis, which, as discussed above, is typically a municipality or county. 7 Patrons of a particular library system are able to access resources in each outlet of the library system. Furthermore, we assume that service area borrowing restrictions ensure independence across library systems and the use of interlibrary loans (ILL) or additional payments to borrow materials from other library systems is infrequent."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "A balanced panel data set of public library characteristics and demographic information contains annual information on 8,373 public library systems and associated service areas.

In these cases, the IMLS adjusts libraries' service population to eliminate duplicated reporting due to overlapping service areas. 8 On average, interlibrary loan transactions account for less than 10% of total circulated materials annually. Moreover, ILL transaction levels change minimally across years and these changes are not statistically significant at a 10% level.\nsystem's service area, Web_Lib l,t is the number of Internetconnected computers per 1,000 library patrons provided by library l in year y, D l,t is a vector containing time varying demographic characteristics of patrons in the service area, L l,t is a vector containing time varying information on per patron library collection stocks, a l and a t are library system and temporal fixed effects, and u l,t is a random error term. The primary analysis focuses on the quantity demanded, Q j l;t , of total annual circulation counts (including renewals) of printed, audio, video, and electronic information materials. 9 Furthermore, interlibrary loan transactions to other library systems are excluded from circulation counts. In the library resource demand model, the coefficients of primary interest are b 1 and b 2 , which represent the marginal effects of changes in residential and in-library Internet access on the demand for library resources.\nAccess to residential Internet, Web_Res, is measured as the number of residential high-speed Internet service providers (as reported on Federal Communications Commission (2010) Form 477) offering high-speed access in a library system's service area at the beginning of the calendar year. 10 The FCC provides information about the number of high-speed Internet service providers beginning in December 1999. 11 Table 2 "}, {"section_title": "Library demand estimation results", "text": "The model of the demand for information resources in US public libraries is estimated using a fixed effects panel method, which controls for time-invariant library-system omitted variables and unobserved changes in yearly library use and implements robust standard errors clustered by library service area. Specifying a two-way fixed effects model implies that we are able to control for factors impacting information resource demands in a particular library system over the sample period and for unobservable changes affecting demand for information resources in all public libraries within a particular year. 15 Under the assumption that changes in the number of high-speed Internet service providers are exogenous to changes in unobserved preferences for information resources, the two-way fixed effects model yields unbiased coefficient estimates. Table 3 presents results of the adult and children circulation demand models-two primary resources offered in libraries-for a baseline model shown in Eq.\n(1) and a reduced model specification that includes only Internet access measures and library-system and time fixed effects. All estimated models show statistically significant positive relationships among both residential and in-library Internet access measures and public library content demand. The positive relationships imply that greater high-speed Internet access, regardless of where the Internet is accessed, is associated with higher demands for information resources in public libraries; that is, the evidence suggests complementarity between high-speed Internet access and locally-based information content. 16 These results have important implications about the Internet's role in changing the value of locally-based information sources. They suggest that information technology is a tool that can reduce individuals' search and acquisition costs of using both locally-based and digital sources to obtain information content. Consequently, increased valuation and demand for both modes of information acquisition are expected to have positive impacts on educational outcomes, productivity, future knowledge accumulation, among other human capital traits that have been extensively shown to contribute to faster economic growth. Moreover, in settings where knowledge spillover effects have been found to be strongest, such as densely populated areas (Fu, 2007; Li and Lu, 2009; Kerr, 2010) , economic responses are likely to be larger. Estimation results of the baseline model enable us to determine the degree to which Internet service growth contributed to increased information resource use in public libraries. Using the Web_Res coefficient estimate (0.031), Internet growth of 7.75 highspeed Internet service providers (a 150.4% increase), and adult circulation growth of 5.32 circulated items per patron (a 14.2% in- 9 The Public Library Survey separates library material circulation information into adult and children categories. However, survey responses do not differentiate among the type of materials being circulated and we are unable to determine the proportion of circulated materials that are printed, audio, or video. 10 To our knowledge, the number of Internet service providers is the best available indicator and has been used to represent residential Internet availability in numerous other studies (for example, see Crandall et al., 2007; Kolko, 2010b; Kolko, 2010a; Wallsten and Mallahan, 2010) . 11 Although the IMLS Public Library Survey data exist for periods prior to 2000, we use only information corresponding to the available FCC data to create a geographically comprehensive, balanced panel data set. 12 Because library outlets are aggregated into a single library system, county-level statistics provide an appropriate proxy for demographics of a library system's service area population. 13 In addition to controlling for per capita income levels, we attempted to include average educational levels in a county. However, there is a strong relationship between county-level education and income indicators. Using both measures to model library resource demand led to collinearity and only income-level characteristics were used in the estimation procedure.\n14 In Table 2 , we show descriptive statistics for the number of hours open, FTE librarians, and FTE staff. However, these variables are excluded from the set of library controls in the estimation model because they vary trivially over time and are, therefore, highly collinear with library system fixed effects. 15 The library system fixed effects will also account for effects of competing public institutions, such as universities and colleges, which may act as substitutes to local public libraries. 16 An alternative specification included a squared measure of residential high-speed\nInternet. The results indicate that there is a relatively linear, positive relationship after 3 ISPs-the censoring point in the FCC data. A similar empirical result is found by Vigdor and Ladd (2010).\ncrease), we estimate that the average increase in adult circulation attributed to the growth of high-speed Internet access is 0.23 circulated items per patron-a 4.5% increase in adult circulation. The increase in Internet access contributed to an 8.2% average increase in children's circulated materials. 17 Similarly, for every additional Internet-connected computer per 1,000 patrons, adult and children's circulation increase by 0.091 and 0.049 items per patron, respectively. These estimates imply that in-library Internet growth attributes to 2.8% and 2.5% change in these circulation measures. That is, relative to the impacts of in-library Internet access growth, increases in residential high-speed Internet access had a 1.6 and 3.3 times larger effect on adult and children's circulation in 2000-2008. These outcomes suggest that residential Internet access has a greater role in affecting the demand for locally-based information resources. Estimated demographic controls parameters provide further evidence that relative time and monetary costs impact the decisions to acquire locally accessible information content. First, unemployment rates are statistically significant and positively correlated with adult circulation. Similarly, higher juvenile-to-adult ratios and lower incomes increase both adult and children's circulated materials. These results indicate that information consumers for whom private information acquisition expenses constitute a larger proportion of overall income are more likely to use lower cost, locally-based information resources. 18 The parameter estimates also suggest that information consumers with potentially lower opportunity costs of time (especially relative to monetary cots) are more likely to acquire information content from locallybased information providers. Furthermore, increases in the stocks of printed, audio, and video library collections increase opportunities and help reduce costs of obtaining information, which is empirically supported by the statistically significant coefficients on all collection stock variables for both circulation measures. Lastly, we test whether the observed complementary relationships are robust in a reduced model that includes only library system and time fixed effects and the two measures of Internet access. Table 3 presents the results of these regressions and indicates similar complementarity. Furthermore, the reduced model estimates demonstrate that the inclusion of other explanatory variables do not substantially affect the estimated coefficient associated with residential Internet access, but do contribute to non-trivial omitted variable bias in the in-library Internet parameter."}, {"section_title": "Estimation results by degree of urbanization", "text": "Results estimated using the baseline model of library resource demands provide important general inferences about the relationship between high-speed Internet access and locally-based information content demand. However, this relationship may be heterogeneous across urbanization areas. For example, increased Internet access can affect the costs of searching and acquiring information content differently in rural, urban, and metropolitan areas. Consequently, we rigorously investigate the statistical and economic strengths of the complementary relationship across urbanization indicators. Whether the relationship between residential high-speed Internet access and the demand for information resources in public libraries is conditional on spatial indicators can provide important implications for understanding the degree to which proximity to locally accessible information sources will remain relevant in cities. Computer and Internet supplement, which asks respondents the method used to access the Internet, to construct high-speed and dial-up Internet access measures. The estimation results using the high-speed Internet access measure from the CPS exhibit the same complementary relationship between residential Internet access and public library resource use. Furthermore, using the dial-up Internet access measure from the CPS exhibited no statistically significant relationship to library resource use. Using the CPS measure significantly reduces the sample size, both cross-sectionally and temporally. Therefore, because using the number of ISPs has been shown by Kolko (2010b) to be an appropriate indicator of Internet access and its use allows the analysis to employ a lengthier, balanced panel data set, it is not unreasonable to assume that using the number of high-speed ISPs does not reduce estimation accuracy relative to other potential measures. Details of the analysis are available upon request from the authors. 18 The negative relationship between income and library circulation provide evidence that income is not likely to be positively correlated (endogenous) with high-speed Internet access and library use.\nTo identify differences in the effects of Internet growth, we specify metropolitan areas as the control group and add urban and rural area interaction variables to the baseline model in Eq.\n(1). That is, urban and rural area indicator variables are interacted with the residential and in-library Internet access variables.\n19 Estimation results of the re-specified models are shown in Table 6 , indicating that there is a strong complementary relationship between residential Internet access and both measures of library use in metropolitan areas, but no statistically significant relationships are found in urban and rural areas for either resource type. 20 Increases in in-library Internet access have the strongest positive correlation with uses of adult and children's materials in cities, and a more modest complementary effect in urban communities. In rural areas, there is a statistically significant negative correlation between Internet access and children's circulation and no relationship with adult circulation. Bhatt (2010) suggests that differences in information consumers' responses across urbanization indicators may be due to metropolitan and urban libraries having longer operating hours and offering access to workspaces. Because these effects are likely captured by the library-system fixed effects and urbanization indicators in our specification, we suggest two other reasons to explain the heterogeneous responses. First, opposing complementary and substitution effects are likely related to the relative opportunity costs of time associated with increased Internet access. Patrons of less accessible libraries (such as those in rural areas where transportation costs can be high) may seek to substitute Internet content for locally accessible content. Conversely, in metropolitan areas, where libraries are much more accessible to a large proportion of the population, increased Internet access lowers this opportunity cost. This relationship is consistent with existing studies that show telecommunication and Internet technologies being complements to cities (for example, see Gaspar and Glaeser, 1998; Sinai and Waldfogel, 2004; Kolko, 2010a) and that communication cost reductions increase agglomeration (Gersbach and Schmutzler, 1999) .\nA second reason is related to metropolitan libraries' abilities to offer a greater quantity, quality, and breadth of information resources. Public library systems that offer a larger number and more diverse resources reduce patrons' costs of locating and acquiring information resources. That is, a larger breadth of locally available resources increases patrons opportunities to access a greater amount of information, face a higher probability of locating a desired information source (i.e., lower search costs), and have a higher likelihood of acquiring the resource (i.e., lower acquisition costs). Therefore, areas with more available locally-based information resources are likely to be more valuable to individuals gaining high-speed Internet access. Conversely, when the breadth of locally-based resources is limited, information that can be acquired locally has a greater likelihood of being similar to content available on the Internet, resulting in a substitution away from local content. As shown in Table 4 , total collections in metropolitan libraries are on average nearly five times larger than collections in urban areas and over nine times larger than total collections in rural libraries. 19 Since urbanization indicators do not change for a given library system, the urbanization direct effects are absorbed by the library system fixed effects. 20 Separate F-tests are used to confirm these relationships by testing whether the sum of the direct effect (Web_Res or Web_Lib) and the indirect effects (urbanization \u00c2 Web_Res interaction terms or urbanization \u00c2 Web_Lib interaction terms) are statistically different from zero.\nIn all cases, the results suggest that in the presence of increased information technology access, libraries located in metropolitan areas become more valuable information resource providers than their urban and rural counterparts. These results have important implications on the relationship between Internet access and proximity, largely supporting existing evidence that the Internet is complementary to cities. The perseverance of this relationship in the context of information demand is especially critical because of the extensive and relatively consistent literature describing information spillover effects and their considerable role in contributing to urban development and economic productivity. It is expected that the importance of proximity as a conduit of knowledge flows is likely to become even greater as the use of metropolitan libraries increases resulting from increased access to information technology."}, {"section_title": "Demand for other library services", "text": "In addition to empirically investigating the impact of highspeed Internet access on the use of circulated library resources, we examine the relationship of Internet access on four other measures of library use. Specifically, we estimate models of public library visits, computer sessions, adult programs attendance, and child program attendance as functions of variables described in Eq. (1). Furthermore, we include interactions among urbanization indicator variables and the measures of Internet access. Estimation of these models helps offer general inferences about Internet access's effects on locally-based information resource use. Table 5 presents the estimation results of the additional public library resource use models. The results show that increases in either high-speed residential or in-library Internet access increase computer sessions initiated in libraries. However, only changes inlibrary Internet access affect library visitation and program attendance, with strongest impacts in metropolitan areas and more modest effects in urban and rural areas. 21 Collectively, these results suggest that growth in residential high-speed Internet access leads patrons to acquire more information resources per visit, but, on average, may not increase the number of times that they visit a public library. However, libraries that increase patrons' access to the Internet-accessible technology can create incentives for library use by patrons that previously may not have used libraries. Therefore, increases in either residential and in-library Internet access improve information acquisition. These outcomes are unlike those estimated by models for traditional library resources, circulated adult and children's materials, which reveal differences in responses to Internet access across urbanization indicators. The discrepancy may be related to differences in the types and quantities of resources offered at metropolitan, urban, and rural libraries. Metropolitan libraries can offer a large variety of printed, electronic, programmatic, and other information-based materials and services, and, therefore, gaining access to the Internet is expected to increase an individual's valuation of all locally-based information sources. However, Internet access to patrons of smaller, rural libraries is expected to increase their use of the most valued library resources such as computers, which may offer access to a greater breadth of information than the printed resources available at those libraries. Consequently, although it is expected that Internet access would increase the use of locally-based information providers across all urbanization indicators, there are also likely to be differences in demand changes for particular information resources."}, {"section_title": "Estimation results by income and local funding levels", "text": "In the baseline results, estimated parameters shown in Table 3 indicate that both Internet access and income levels affect information consumers' demands for information resources in public libraries. Moreover, Table 4 shows that between 2000 and 2008, changes in adult circulation, children circulation, and high-speed Internet service providers varied across library systems that serve patrons in different income quartiles. First, high-speed residential Internet access increased substantially in all income quartiles, but the growth was most prolific in the lowest income quartile areas (227.6%). Second, both adult circulation and children circulation increased most in the high income quartiles (19.5% rise in adult circulation and 7.7% increase in children circulation). In the lowest income quartile, adult circulation changed least (5.3%) and children circulation decreased (-6.5%).\nTo empirically test whether marginal effects of high-speed Internet access on the demand for information resources in public libraries are different across income groups, we specify interaction terms between income quartile dummies and residential and in-library Internet access variables, respectively, and re-estimate the library resource demand models. Table 6 presents the estimation results, which support previous empirical inferences that higher income communities are less likely to use public libraries and an increase in both Internet access measures have statistically significant positive effects on library use. The interaction terms between Internet access and income quartiles are all statistically significant, and separate F-tests are used to test whether the sum of the parameters associated with the direct and the indirect interaction effects are statistically different from zero. These tests indicate that residential Internet access does not significantly affect the demand for library resources by individuals in the second and third income quartiles, but do affect patrons in the first and fourth quartiles. For individuals in the highest income quartile, increases in residential Internet access contribute to higher use of public libraries. However, for those in the lowest per capita income quartile, there is substitution. Similarly, increases in in-library Internet access reduce the use of public library resources in the lowest income quartile, but lead to complementarity in the three higher quartiles.\nContrasting responses across income levels may indicate differences in the demand for different types of information content. If information consumers in lower income quartiles seek content that is largely non-proprietary and easily available on the Internet, then they are able to reduce acquisition costs by substituting toward digital content. It, therefore, remains unclear whether the Internet contributes to a net increase or decrease information demand for these types of information consumers. Conversely, information consumers who seek proprietary information content provided locally would find that the relative costs of acquisition through public libraries have decreased due to Internet growth. This decrease leads these information consumers to complement digital information content with locally-based content.\nIn addition to estimating differences across income levels, we test whether patrons' preferences toward local public library funding are associated with increased uses of library information resources. As shown in Table 1 , the majority of US public libraries are funded from local tax revenue sources, implying that, regardless of Internet access, library use may be closely related to voters' monetary support for public institutions. Moreover, Table 4 shows that communities with higher percentages of local funds have higher adult and children circulation counts per patron.\nTo empirically test this hypothesis, we re-estimate the baseline model after including interaction variables between Internet access variables with an indicator of above median local fund percentage. Table 6 shows the empirical results, which provide additional evidence of the robust complementary relationship between Internet access and library resource demand. The estimated direct effect associated with the local fund percentage variable insignificantly impacts adult and children's circulation. The estimated parameters associated with the interaction terms between local funding percentage and Internet access are also statistically insignificant from zero. Therefore, the effects of voter preferences and high-speed Internet access are likely independent. That is, the statistically insignificant marginal effect of the local funding percentage and Internet access interaction term suggests against differences in behavior (in response to increased Internet access) between communities that show a greater preference for public library resources and those that do not. Absence of a statistically significant differential marginal effect between these types of communities provides suggestive evidence that unobservable factors related to community preferences do not bias the estimation results shown in Table 3 . "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The role of information acquisition in human capital development and economic productivity has been widely documented and the magnification of these effects in densely populated settings through information spillovers is well known. We show that the growth of Internet access contributes to further knowledge acquisition by increasing overall demand for information. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate that increased access to high-speed Internet is complementary to the use of locally-based information sources and that this relationship is strongest in metropolitan areas. The latter inference is especially important because it offers evidence that proximity to locally-based information resources remains essential even as technology for obtaining information remotely continues to grow. This suggests that agglomeration in cities is likely to strengthen as Internet access and increased use of locally accessible information sources result in greater knowledge flows. Inferences provided by this study are similar to those in the literature examining the impact of Internet access on educational attainment. For example, Vigdor and Ladd (2010) show that simply introducing high-speed Internet access to primary school students increases student attainment gaps between children with access to additional locally-based resources and those without such access. The authors suggest that students in households where parents can serve as effective instructors are more likely to use information technology more productively, while the productivity of children without these locally available resources would diminish as a result of increased Internet access. Similar findings have been reported by Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2008) ; Shapley et al. (2009) and Cristia et al. (2012) , providing important implications about the continued relevance of locallybased resources in the presence of increased information technology.\nPeripherally, this study also provides insights about the continuing role of locally-based information providers and access to information technology. Because many low-cost, locally-based information resources are supplied by publicly funded institutions such as libraries, these information repositories will continue to be important to knowledge acquisition in the 21st century. Moreover, these institutions are expected to have the largest impacts in metropolitan areas, where more extensive information supplies can be accessed by a larger proportion of the population, thereby providing the highest value of those information resources. If individuals' abilities to access the Internet are limited, then the demands for overall information content could diminish, potentially stunting the growth of information demand. Examples of such limitations include net neutrality policies, Internet censorship laws, and Internet access restrictions."}]
