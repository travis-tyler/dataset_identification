Family SES is viewed as a major risk factor for childhood obesity (4-7). Children from low-socio-economic households had a three to four times higher odds of obesity than children from higher socio-economic households (8) . The magnitude of the socioeconomic disparities in overweight/obesity prevalence increased between 2003 and 2007, with substantial social inequalities persisting even after controlling for behavioural factors (8) .\nFor offspring during the years of childhood, the economic conditions of their families can be more dynamic than their parents' educational achievements. Experiencing poverty during childhood has especially shown its associations with a wide variety of children's health outcomes, as well as with their occupational and educational achievements, according to findings from cross-sectional studies (2, 9) . A few longitudinal studies suggested the associations between income dynamics and children's risk of obesity. One study found that children whose families had moved into lowincome status during their childhood had a 2.4 times higher odds of being adolescents with obesity than children who had never experienced low income (10) . Also, an increase in family income over a 4-year period was associated with a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) Z-scores among girls (11) .\nHowever, variable definitions of household income and statistical modelling approaches for classifying income dynamics have impeded consistent findings in the association with children's obesity risk in previous studies (12, 13) . No study has examined how the pattern of income dynamics influences both of children's BMI trajectory and health behaviours.\nUtilizing federal poverty thresholds and rigorous statistical methods, this study aimed to better understand the impact of household SES dynamics on child health behaviours and overweight/obesity risk from early childhood to adolescence. The findings may provide further insight about the vulnerable health needs of children and how to support them during times of economic challenge."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and study sample", "text": "We used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K 1998-1999), which followed a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds in the US to 8th grade.

We chose the best combination of fractional polynomial functions ( Fig. 1) for modelling childhood BMI trajectories as a function of age after testing the models' goodness of fits in diverse combinations of age terms (19) .

The pattern of household poverty dynamics affects childhood BMI growth and overweight/obesity risk in the US. Recurrently and persistently, poor groups were characterized by being primarily African American and Hispanic, having less-educated parents and having more single parents than the other groups. In particular, the recurrent poor had the highest BMI and overweight/obesity rate from the ages of 5 to 16 years; the persistently poor had started with the lowest BMI level in the early ages but became the second highest in BMI trajectories and overweight/obesity rate by the 8th grade. The experience of childhood poverty was associated with child health behaviours at the 8th grade as well: the recurrently poor were more likely to have excessive soda and fast food intake and irregular exercise than the other poverty groups. More than 80% of the persistently poor had excessive screen time. In the longitudinal analysis, the recurrently poor had a 1.5 times higher risk of being children with overweight/obesity during follow-up than the never poor, after adjusting for various socio-demographics.\nThe US population has a higher poverty rate ratio than other developed countries (USA: 0.17 vs. Finland: 0.07, France: 0.08, United Kingdom: 0.10, Canada: 0.13 in OECD 2013) (20) . The official US Census Bureau statistics estimated that 43 million persons were poor in 2015, and 19.7% of children were living in poverty (21) . African-American and Hispanic children have a higher poverty rate than White children (2) . Children experiencing the longest years in poverty were those with mothers who were unmarried (average time: 5.4 years) or did not have a high school degree (5.0 years) (22) . Our study also found consistent socio-demographic characteristics in poor groups defined by household poverty dynamics. Children from persistently and recurrently poor households were reported to constitute 21.2% of those in the US in 1999, and they were more likely to be African American or Hispanic, having a low parental education level, and more single parents than other poverty status groups.\nWhile entire households experience poverty, children are especially vulnerable to inadequate food, energy, transportation, and housing and the absence of psychological buffering from the stresses and harms of poverty, which can lead to adverse physical health, socioemotional development and academic achievement through a lifetime (23) . In life course perspective, patterns of poverty experience during childhood could have a strong effect in a person's health trajectories. Children may remain in poverty throughout childhood or rotate in and out of poverty over time. Worldwide, about 37% of children experience some level of poverty for some period of time (24) . Most studies investigating the association between childhood SES and adulthood obesity or chronic diseases use cross-sectional data for one measure of childhood SES (10) . The few longitudinal studies have found that downward mobility or persistently low income were associated with a greater risk of obesity during childhood in the US (10, 11, 25) . A birth cohort in New York state found that children who moved into low income during their childhoods were 2.4 times more likely to be adolescents with obesity, while children who were held in poverty were 2.4 times more likely to maintain overweight (10) . Girls in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey Birth Cohort also had a significant decrease in BMI Z-score during the ages of 2 to 6 years due to an increase in poverty to income ratio (=family income divided by poverty status; \u03b2 = \u00c00.002; 95% CI = [\u00c00.042, \u00c00.002]) (11). However, variable definitions of household income and statistical modelling approaches for classifying income dynamics have impeded consistent findings in the association with children's obesity risk in previous studies (12, 13) ; and no study has examined how children's BMI trajectory and health behaviours are influenced by the pattern of income dynamics with which they live (26, 27) .\nOur study found that children from recurrently poor households were 1.5 times more likely to be children with overweight or obesity during follow-up from ages 5 to 16 years compared with children who had never been poor. The recurrently poor were also the highest in BMI level and overweight/obesity prevalence compared with the persistently or transiently poor groups, as well. The persistently poor had the lowest rate of childhood obesity at the beginning of follow-up but grew to be the second highest group at 8th grade after steady increases in BMI throughout childhood. There are two potential explanations for these findings. First, the mechanisms that could cause obesity in children who rotated in and out of poverty over time compared with children who remained in poverty are likely different (10) . Children with persistent household poverty may have low birth weight and premature risks in early life and be used to food insecurity and fewer physical activity resources in low-income neighbourhoods (28) . In contrast, some family events such as divorce, loss of jobs or accidents/disasters may place children in more stressful circumstances due to experiencing the ups and downs of SES throughout cycles of rotating in and out of poverty, which may lead to further mental stress and worsen child eating behaviours and levels of physical activity (10, 29) . In addition, the accumulated exposure of adverse eating habits and an excessively sedentary life may lead both recurrently and persistently poor groups to have higher risks of childhood obesity than the other poor groups (30) . We found that at the age of 16, the recurrently poor had the highest BMI and overweight/obesity rate, but the persistently poor could exceed the obesity risk of the recurrently poor group during late adolescence or adulthood. Much additional work is needed to confirm our results and Poverty dynamics on childhood obesity | 595 to examine the mechanisms connecting poverty dynamics to obesity risk.\nThis study has some limitations. Due to missing responses and those lost to follow-up, only a part of child health behaviours in the 8th grade was examined. The relatively small sample size of the poor groups may not allow us to detect significant differences in the association between household poverty dynamics and childhood obesity risk by ethnicity, gender or baseline weight status. However, this study uses a nationally representative sample, and longitudinal data and offers a life course perspective on examining how household poverty experience influences the development of adverse child health behaviours and overweight/obesity risks. Further investigation may help to address whether the obesity risk among the persistently poor would increase more than that in the recurrently poor if there were longterm follow-up. These findings provide insight as to how to better support child health when families experience economic challenges.\nIn conclusion, childhood poverty experience associates with significant differences in children's health behaviours and obesity risks in the US. Supporting effort for the children who rotate in and out of poverty needs to focus on healthy eating and physical activity to prevent childhood obesity."}]
