It was caused by a new strain of beta coronavirus, known as the 73 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] [2] [3] . After the 74 identification of the first patient with COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple 75 local COVID-19 clusters were identified nationwide by the end of February. The 76\nJapanese government focused on identifying and mitigating emerging COVID-19 77 clusters before they could spread further. In an effort to contain these clusters and limit 78 the number of new cases, active, nationwide epidemiological surveillance of each 79 cluster was conducted in order to identify the close contacts of existing patients with 80 COVID-19. Japan has sustained a moderate spread by focusing on COVID-19 outbreak 81 clusters; however, an ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases appeared until early 82\nApril, which made it difficult to identify all infection routes. 83\nAlthough some of the COVID-19 clusters were successfully contained, the number of 84 cases continued to increase. As of 16 April, the Japanese government declared a 85 nationwide state of emergency in view of the worsening spread. To support the ongoing 86 epidemiological surveillance, we collaborated with the local public health institutes in 87 Japan (Supplementary Table S1 ) and conducted a whole genome sequencing of SARS-88\nCoV-2. Our goal was to apply genomic epidemiology to predict potential routes of 89 infection within or between clusters 4 . Thus far, multiple studies have been conducted to 90 demonstrate the COVID-19 spread under nationwide and global comparative genome 91 surveillance; as of 2 June, there were already 33,483 complete genomes publicly 92 available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform 5 . 93 Some detailed reports have been conducted to highlight regional specific clusters and its 94 intra-and international spreads in the US 6 , UK 7 , Hungary 8 , Australia 9 , Denmark 10 , 95\nIceland 11 , and California 12 96\nIn this study, we aimed to evaluate viral genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until 97 early April and characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of 98 spread in Japan. 99"}, {"section_title": "100", "text": ".
