[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Hypogonadism is a clinical condition in which low levels of serum testosterone are found in association with specific signs and symptoms. When hypogonadism occurs in an older man, the condition is often called andropause or androgen deficiency of the aging male or late onset hypogonadism (LOH). 1 The most easily recognized clinical signs of relative androgen deficiency in older men are a decrease in muscle mass and strength, a decrease in bone mass and osteoporosis, and an increase in central body fat. However, symptoms such as a decrease in libido and sexual desire, forgetfulness, loss of memory, anemia, difficulty in concentration, insomnia, and a decreased sense of well-being are more difficult to measure and differentiate from hormone-independent aging. This condition may result in significant detriment to quality of life and adversely affect the function of multiple organ systems. [1] [2] [3] A health factor-independent, age-related longitudinal decrease in serum testosterone levels has been reported. 4 This LOH is important since it features many potentially serious consequences that can be readily avoided or treated, and the affected sector of the "}, {"section_title": "Dovepress", "text": "population is currently expanding in number. Prospective population-based studies reported in the past decade indicate that low testosterone levels are associated with an increase in the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and possibly a reduction in survival.\nResults were similar for bioavailable testosterone. [5] [6] [7] In men, endogenous testosterone concentrations are inversely related to mortality due to cardiovascular disease and all causes. Low testosterone may be a predictive marker for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. 8 Also, low testosterone levels were associated with increased mortality in male veterans 9 but this association could not be confirmed in the Massachusetts Male Aging Study 10 or the New Mexico Aging Study.\na proxy for unbound testosterone, has also been shown to be a reliable substitute for free testosterone measurements. [55] [56] [57] Diagnosis of late life hypogonadism requires both symptoms and low testosterone ( Figure 1 ).\nSkin irritation may be associated with the use of transdermal systems especially with testosterone patches but is uncommon with gel preparations. 70 At present the two testosterone gel preparations (Androgel \u00ae and Testim \u00ae ) are the most commonly used in the United States.\nhowever, their data suggest that there is a threshold level of T above which there is no further enhancement of response. On the other hand, Two placebo-controlled trials reported on the effect of testosterone on overall sexual satisfaction, yielding imprecise results. 91, 92 Transdermal testosterone replacement therapy, in particular, has been linked to positive effects on fatigue, mood, and sexual function, as well as significant increases in sexual activity.\nLow androgen levels increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in men. 236 Data are lacking as to whether higher testosterone levels predict reduced incidence of combined nonfatal and fatal major cardiovascular events. 101 The inverse correlation between T levels and the severity of coronary artery disease 248 may be related to the fact that low androgen levels are accompanied by an accumulation of abdominal visceral fat, [249] [250] [251] which is known to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors 252 impaired glucose tolerance, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (syndrome X). 253 No consistent relationship between the levels of free or total testosterone and coronary atherosclerosis in men undergoing coronary angiography has been observed. 151, 254 Testosterone-replacement therapy does not increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease or events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or angina. 88 A meta-analysis 255 in 2007 concluded that the current available evidence shows no association between testosterone replacement therapy and cardiac events. Transdermal testosterone replacement therapy was found to be beneficial for men with chronic stable angina as they had greater angina-free exercise tolerance than placebo-treated controls. 151 However, trials of testosterone therapy generally have not been designed or adequately powered to detect effects on clinically significant cardiovascular events. 86, 256 The outcome of most studies in men report either a favorable or neutral effect of normal T levels on cardiovascular disease in men. The administration of T in physiological concentration increases coronary blood flow in patients with coronary heart disease. 257 Beneficial effects on endothelial function 258 and myocardial ischemia have also been demonstrated, 248, 259, 260 but not with cardiovascular mortality. 257, 258 In addition, testosterone has a negative correlation with fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 261 and a direct effect on several vasoactive factors such as endothelin, 262 prostacyclin, thromboxane A 2 and platelet aggregation, 263 blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis, respectively. 248, 261 Thus, although lower testosterone levels are associated with higher cardiovascular risk and to an extent with mortality in aging men, randomized controlled clinical trials of adequate size and duration are needed to determine whether testosterone therapy will reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease in hypogonadal or eugonadal men.\nsupplements increase prostate volume with, eventually mild increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in old men. 90, 117, 270 Although a meta-analysis 58 showed that the total number of prostate events combined was significantly greater in testosterone-treated men than in placebo-treated men, the majority of events are due to prostate biopsy; and the marked reduction in serum testosterone caused by chemical or surgical castration causes reduced prostate volume. At the same time, many studies [271] [272] [273] have failed to show significant exacerbation of voiding symptoms attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia during testosterone supplementation, and complications such as urinary retention have not occurred at higher rates than in controls receiving placebo nor has there been any difference in the urine flow rates, postvoiding residual urine volumes, and prostate voiding symptoms with patients receiving treatment in these studies. The poor correlation between prostate volume and urinary symptoms explain this illogicality.\nFinally, although there are no compelling data to suggest that testosterone treatment exacerbates lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or promotes acute urinary retention, severe LUTS, due to BPH, represent a relative contraindication which is no longer applicable after successful treatment of lower urinary tract obstruction. 45 \nbe monitored for signs of edema, gynecomastia, sleep apnea, lower urinary tract symptoms, and low BMD. There are clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society for monitoring patients receiving TRT. 45 Testosterone level, digital rectal exam, PSA, hematocrit, BMD, lipids, and liver function tests should be checked at baseline then evaluate the patient 3 and 6 months after treatment starts and then annually to assess whether symptoms have responded to treatment and whether the patient is suffering from any adverse effects.\nTestosterone levels should be monitored 3 months after initiation of testosterone therapy. A mid-morning total serum testosterone level should be obtained. A target range of 400 to 500 ng/dL (14.0 to 17.5 nmol/L) for older men is suggested. However, if there is no symptomatic response, higher levels may be necessary. For injectable testosterone, the serum level can be measured between injections. For men treated with a transdermal testosterone patch, the serum level should be measured 3 to 12 hours after patch application. In patients receiving buccal testosterone tablets, the serum level should be measured immediately before application of a fresh system. Patients on testosterone gel may have levels checked anytime after at least 1 week of therapy. 45 In all cases, bioavailable testosterone levels should also be monitored as testosterone therapy lowers SHBG.\nThe hematocrit should be checked at baseline, at 3 and 6 months, and then annually. If hematocrit is more than 54%, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to a safe level; evaluate the patient for hypoxia and sleep apnea; reinitiate therapy with a reduced dose. BMD of lumbar spine and/or femoral neck should be measured at baseline every 1 to 2 years of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with osteoporosis or low trauma fracture. A digital rectal examination and PSA level should be obtained before initiating treatment, at 3 months, and then in accordance with guidelines for prostate cancer screening, depending on the age and race of the patient. A urologic consultation is mandatory if any of the following is present ( Table 4 ).\nThe use of testosterone preparations should be discussed with patients and then closely monitored for efficacy and toxicities. 3, [318] [319] [320] Failure to benefit from clinical manifestations should result in discontinuation of treatment after 3 months for libido and sexual function, muscle function, and improved body fat; and a longer interval for bone mineral density. Further investigation for other causes of symptoms is then mandatory. 45 \nawareness of the condition. The symptoms in the elderly have a complex origin. It may be reasonably assumed that the ageassociated decrease in T levels is in part responsible for the symptoms of aging. The benefits and risks of testosterone therapy must be clearly discussed with the patient and assessment of prostate and other risk factors considered before commencing testosterone treatment. There is some benefit from testosterone replacement therapy on muscle mass and strength, fat mass, BMD, sexual function, mood and general sense of well-being. Therefore, it seems logical to consider that in elderly men with subnormal T levels and clinical symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, hormone replacement therapy in combination with physical activity (resistance training) and adequate nutrition will result in an optimal increase in muscle strength, BMD, and general sense of well-being. However, data on clinical effects of androgen substitution, such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, falls and bone fracture rates are not yet available. Response to testosterone treatment should be assessed. If there is no improvement of symptoms and signs, treatment should be discontinued and the patient investigated for other possible causes of the clinical presentations. The major contraindication for androgen supplementation is the presence of a prostatic carcinoma."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "As the clinical symptoms of hormone deficiency in older males may be nonspecific, and since a substantial number of relatively asymptomatic elderly men have testosterone levels outside the normal range for young adults, investigators have suggested that testosterone replacement therapy is only warranted in the presence of both clinical symptoms suggestive of hormone deficiency and decreased hormone levels. 12 Restoring serum testosterone levels to the normal range using testosterone replacement therapy results in clinical benefits in some of these areas. Successful management of testosterone replacement therapy requires appropriate evaluation and an understanding of the benefits and risks of treatment."}, {"section_title": "Aging and hypogonadism", "text": "Due to the baby boom that occurred after World War II, the percentage of population in the older age group in developed countries is increasing. Testosterone deficiency is a common disorder in middle-aged and older men but it is underdiagnosed and often untreated. Clinicians tend to overlook it, and the complaints of androgen-deficient men are merely considered part of aging. Hypogonadism affects an estimated 2 million to 4 million men in the United States. Many patients can derive significant benefits from treatment. Testosterone supplementation in the United States has increased substantially over the past several years. 13 However, it has been estimated that only 5% of affected men currently receive treatment.\nThe decline of serum testosterone levels appears to be a gradual, age-related process resulting in an approximate 1% annual decline after age 30. In cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of men aged 30 or 40 years and above, total, bioavailable and free testosterone concentrations fall with increasing age with a steeper decline in bioavailable and free compared with total testosterone concentrations. 4, 14, 15 In older men above the age of 65 or 70 years, the changes in total testosterone are overshadowed by a more significant decline in free testosterone levels. 16, 17 This is a consequence of the age-associated increase of the levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) demonstrated by cross-sectional studies, and has now been confirmed by longitudinal studies. 18, 19 Although the fall is gradual, by the eighth decade, according to the Baltimore Longitudinal Study, 30% of men had total testosterone values in the hypogonadal range, and 50% had low free testosterone values. The rate of age-related decline in serum testosterone levels varies in different individuals and is affected by chronic disease and medications. 20 There is evidence that many of these men are not symptomatic. 21 Multiple mechanisms are likely to influence the decline in testosterone levels in aging men. 22 Lower testosterone levels may result from reduced testicular responses to gonadotrophin stimuli with aging, coupled with incomplete hypothalamo-pituitary compensation for the fall in total and free testosterone levels. 23, 24 Whether the age-dependent decline in androgen levels leads to health problems in older men is being debated vigorously. 21, 25 Diagnosis At present, the diagnosis of hypogonadism requires the presence of symptoms and signs suggestive of testosterone deficiency. 1, 26 The symptom most associated with hypogonadism is low libido. [27] [28] [29] Other manifestations of hypogonadism include erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis, mild anemia, breast discomfort and gynecomastia, hot flushes, sleep disturbance, body hair and skin alterations, decreased vitality, and decreased intellectual capacity (poor concentration, depression, fatigue). 30 The problem is many of the symptoms of late life hypogonadism are similar in other conditions 31, 32 or are physiologically associated with the aging process. 33 One or more of these symptoms must be corroborated with a low serum testosterone level. 21, 25, 34 Depression, hypothyroidism and chronic alcoholism should be excluded, as should the use of medications such as corticosteroids, cimetidine, spironolactone, digoxin, opioid analgesics, antidepressants and antifungal drugs. Of course, diagnosis of LOH should never be undertaken during an acute illness, which is likely to result in temporarily low testosterone levels ( Figure 1 ).\nThe problem with symptoms associated with low serum testosterone is that they may be found in other conditions, which become increasingly common as men age. While the questionnaires, the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Male (ADAM) 35, 36 and the Aging Male Symptoms Scale (AMS) 37, 38 (Table 1) , may be sensitive markers of the low testosterone state (97% and 83%, respectively), they are not tightly correlated with low testosterone (specificity 30% and 39%), particularly in the borderline low serum testosterone range. Therefore, questionnaires are not recommended for screening of androgen deficiency in men receiving health care for unrelated reasons. 26 Moreover, healthy ambulatory elderly males over 70, assessed by the AMS, had a high perception of sexual symptoms with mild psychological and mild to moderate somatovegetative symptoms. 39 Note also that there is marked inter-individual variation of the testosterone level at which symptoms occur. 28, 34, 40 A low libido by itself is insufficient to allow the diagnosis of hypogonadism. 41 "}, {"section_title": "Laboratory diagnosis", "text": "A thorough physical and biochemical work-up is necessary. Transient decreases of serum testosterone levels such as those due to acute illnesses should be excluded by careful clinical evaluations and repeated hormone measurement. Hypogonadism (primary or secondary) can occur at all ages, including in elderly men. Risk factors for hypogonadism in older men may include chronic illnesses (including diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease, and inflammatory arthritic, renal, and HIV-related diseases), obesity, metabolic syndrome, and hemachromatosis. 26 Such chronic diseases should be investigated and treated. 42 Primary hypogonadism is characterized by raised levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in response to diminished testosterone (and estradiol and inhibin B) feedback. Secondary hypogonadism is characterized by low levels of testosterone associated with low or normal levels of FSH and/or LH. 43 However, in older men, the figure is less clear-cut, testosterone deficiency being both primary and secondary.\nSerum testosterone has a diurnal variation and levels peak between 08.00 and 10.00 h, a serum sample should be obtained between 07.00 and 11.00 h. 44 The most widely accepted parameters to establish the presence of hypogonadism is the measurement of serum total testosterone. Total testosterone levels above 500 ng/dL do not require substitution; patients with serum total testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL will usually benefit from testosterone treatment. If the serum total testosterone level is between 230 and 350 ng/dL in males under 50 years or between 300 and 500 ng/dL in older males, repeating the measurement of total testosterone with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) to calculate free testosterone or measuring free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or bioavailable testosterone is recommended. 45 Note that SHBG is elevated in elderly patients and effected by many diseases. 30 Measurements of serum LH will assist in differentiating between primary and secondary hypogonadism and serum prolactin is indicated when the serum testosterone is lower than 150 ng/dl [46] [47] [48] [49] or when secondary hypogonadism is suspected. 50, 51 Measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone (BT, free plus albumin bound) should be considered when the serum total testosterone concentration is not diagnostic of hypogonadism, particularly in obese men. Bioavailable testosterone appears to correlate better with potential hypogonadal symptoms than does total testosterone. 52 A free testosterone level below 65 pg/mL can provide supportive evidence for testosterone treatment. 53, 54 The gold standard for bioavailable testosterone measurement is by sulphate precipitation and equilibrium dialysis for free testosterone. However, both techniques are not usually available in local laboratories so that calculated values seem preferable.

[96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] The combination treatment should be considered in hypogonadal patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) failing to respond to either treatment alone. Testosterone produces this effect by enhancing the production of nitric oxide synthase. It is unclear whether PDE5-I, testosterone, or the combination of the two should be started first in men with hypogonadism and ED. 45 All men with ED should be screened for hypogonadism before treating for erectile dysfunction. 102 In addition to improvement in sexual function, testosterone therapy may also improve lower urinary tract symptomatology (LUTS)/bladder functions by increasing bladder capacity and compliance and decreasing detrusor pressure at maximal flow in men with SLOH. 103 However, the role of testosterone supplementation in men with erectile dysfunction who are not androgen deficient or in the low to normal range needs further investigation to determine whether testosterone therapy will improve erectile function in older men and to weigh the risk-benefit ratio for testosterone therapy in this setting. 86 "}, {"section_title": "Bone mineral density", "text": "Chronically ill men may have both apparent androgen deficiency and low bone mass. 104 Osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fracture prevalence rates are greater in hypogonadal younger and older men. 105 The prevalence of osteoporosis in testosterone deficient males is double that of those with normal testosterone level. 106, 107 Testosterone plays a major role in BMD. 108 Bone density in hypogonadal men of all ages increases under testosterone substitution provided the dose is high enough; [109] [110] [111] although normal adult bone mass is not reached. 112 Testosterone produces this effect by increasing osteoblastic activity and through aromatization to estrogen reducing osteoclastic activity. The role of the partial androgen deficiency in aging males in bone fracture rate remains to be established. 113 Patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy have an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture. 114 The long-term benefit of testosterone requires further investigation. However, the correlation with bioestradiol, the levels of which decline in elderly males, was even stronger, suggesting that part of the androgen effects on bone are at least partially indirect, mediated via their aromatization. 115, 116 An increase in osteocalcin levels, an index of osteoblast activity was observed, 90 and a decrease of hydroxyproline excretion, an index of bone resorption also was noted. 117 Assessment of bone density at 2-year intervals is advisable in hypogonadal men, and serum testosterone measurements should be obtained in all men with osteopenia. 118, 119 Trials of the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on bone mineral density yielded mixed results. 120 Increases in spinal bone density have been realized in hypogonadal men, 121 with most treated men maintaining bone density above the fracture threshold. 122 An improvement in both trabecular and cortical bone mineral density of the spine was seen, independent of age and type of hypogonadism; in addition, a significant increase in paraspinal muscle area has been observed, emphasizing the clinical benefit of adequate replacement therapy for the physical fitness of hypogonadal men. 123 The pooled results of a meta-analysis suggest a beneficial effect on lumbar spine bone density and equivocal findings on femoral neck BMD. Trials of intra muscular testosterone reported significantly larger effects on lumbar bone density than trials of transdermal testosterone, particularly among patients receiving chronic glucocorticoids. 124 Also in eugonadal men with osteoporosis, Testosterone esters (250 mg/2 weeks) increased BMD; 125 again, the effects in elderly men are less convincing, though the 3 year study of Amory et al 126 showed a significant increase in hip BMD.

[134] [135] [136] In most of these studies, the body weight change did not differ significantly.

Recent cross-sectional studies showed that in aging men there are also positive correlations between testosterone and muscle strength parameters of upper and lower extremities, as measured by leg extensor strength and isometric hand grip strength. 141 Moreover, testosterone was positively associated with functional parameters, including the doors test as well as \"get up and go\" test, and 5-chair sit/ stand test. 142 On the other hand, some reported an increase in lean body mass (LBM) but no change in physical function, 92 or an increase in strength of knee extension or flexion.\nAlthough there is a potential role of testosterone in the management of frailty, we do not know whether testosterone replacement improves physical function and other healthrelated outcomes, or reduces the risk of disability, falls, or fractures in older men with low testosterone levels in addition to the long-term risks and benefits of testosterone supplementation in older men. 143 "}, {"section_title": "Mood and energy and quality of life", "text": "Men older than 50 years with low free testosterone levels had poorer quality of life.

There is significant inverse correlation between bioavailable testosterone and a depression score in elderly men, independent of age and weight but not with total testosterone levels. 146 There was a reduced libido and reduced feelings of well being and minimal effect on mood in patients with induced testosterone deficiency; the depressive symptoms during the hypogonadal state were reversed by testosterone replacement. 147 One study showed that the relationship between testosterone level and depression was nonlinear and may be idiosyncratic. 148 The risk of depression was increased for hypogonadal and hypergonadal men, but this effect was only detectable in underweight and obese men, not in 'normal' weight men in whom a linear decrease in the risk of depression with increasing testosterone level was noted. 149 Testosterone replacement therapy has variable effects on mood, energy and sense of well being. The results of placebo-controlled randomized trials on testosterone's effect on quality of life and depressive mood were inconsistent across trials and imprecise.

In HIV-infected men, testosterone therapy was well tolerated and effective in ameliorating symptoms of hypogonadism. For patients with major depression and/or dysthymia, improvement was equal to that achieved with standard antidepressants with significant improvement in depression inventory score. This effect may On the other hand, several placebo-controlled testosterone replacement studies did not show a testosterone-placebo difference distinguishable with respect to mood. 150, 164, 167, 168 No relationship between testosterone level and depressive symptoms was found in the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS).\n14 This discrepancy in the results of the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on mood may be explained by the genetic polymorphism in the androgen receptor which defines a vulnerable group in whom depression is expressed when testosterone levels fall below a particular threshold. 169, 170 Finally, the available controlled studies using exogenous testosterone for depression in elderly men are limited, and testosterone treatment must be considered experimental. The best candidates for treatment may be hypogonadal men who are currently taking an existing antidepressant with inadequate response.

Altered T levels in AD may precede rather than follow diagnosis.\nThere is good evidence for a strong correlation between T levels and cognitive performance such as spatial abilities or mathematical reasoning. 178 Higher bioavailable and free testosterone concentrations have each been associated with better performance in specific aspects of memory and cognitive function, with optimal processing capacity found in men ranging from 35 to 90 years of age even after adjustment for potential confounders including age, educational attainment and cardiovascular morbidity; [179] [180] [181] whereas total testosterone was not. 182 However, contradictory findings have also been reported, two cross-sectional studies did not show a relationship between total or free testosterone and measures of working memory, speed/attention or spatial relations in men aged from 48 to 80 years. 184 In another cross-sectional analyses of similarly aged men, no association was found between lower free testosterone levels and higher performance on spatial visualization tasks, and between higher free and total testosterone levels and poorer verbal memory and executive performance; however there is correlation with faster processing speed. 184, 185 A possible source of conflicting results in these studies may stem from interactions between testosterone levels and other risk factors for cognitive impairment such as apolipoprotein E 4 genotype 186 and systemic illness which cause low testosterone. 24, 177, 187 In men undergoing hormonal therapy for prostate cancer, suppression of endogenous testosterone synthesis and blockade of the androgen receptor resulted in a beneficial effect on verbal memory but an adverse effect on spatial ability 188 and visuomotor slowing and slowed reaction times in several attentional domains; 189 plasma amyloid levels increased as T levels decreased. 190 Discontinuation of treatment resulted in improved memory but not visuospatial abilities. 190 One of the possible protective mechanisms of action of T would be through its conversion into estradiol (E2), the most potent estrogen. Both serum E2 and T levels were lower in men with AD compared to age-matched controls. 191, 192 E2 could exert protective effects on the brain structures in aging patients. 193 Trials of testosterone therapy in men to evaluate its effects on measures of cognitive function and memory to date were all relatively small and of a relatively short duration and have shown mixed results. 177, 194 Small-scale T intervention trials in elderly men suggest that some cognitive deficits may be reversed, at least in part, by short term T supplementation. 178 Androgen supplementation in elderly hypogonadal men improves spatial cognition 117, 195 and verbal fluency 196, 197 and in elderly men without dementia, it may reduce working memory errors. 198 In addition, transdermal testosterone or DHT treatment in men aged 34 to 70 years improved verbal memory and spatial memory respectively, 199 and intramuscular testosterone improved verbal and spatial memory and constructional abilities in non-hypogonadal men with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. 200 In one study of healthy men aged 50 to 90 years, intramuscular testosterone alone or in combination with anastrozole improved spatial memory, whereas verbal Testosterone replacement therapy Dovepress submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress memory only improved in testosterone-treated men in the absence of anastrozole, raising the possibility that part of the effect of exogenous testosterone is mediated by its aromatization to estradiol. 200 However, in men with Alzheimer's disease testosterone treatment appeared to improve quality of life without impacting on measures of cognition. 201 In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial intramuscular testosterone therapy resulted in decreased verbal memory. 202 In other placebo-controlled randomized trials, one of which studied patients with Alzheimer's dementia and low testosterone levels, 203 reported imprecise effects on several dimensions of cognition, none of which was significant after pooling. 203, 204 Therefore, although the evidence from observational studies is not uniform, lower free testosterone appears to be associated with poorer outcomes on measures of cognitive function, particularly in older men and testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men may have some benefit for cognitive performance."}, {"section_title": "improving metabolic syndrome and diabetes type 2, cardiovascular disease", "text": "Many of the components of the metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia impaired glucose regulation, and insulin resistance) are also present in hypogonadal men. Lower testosterone levels are associated with surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease, including less favorable carotid intima medial thickness [205] [206] [207] ankle/brachial index as a measure of peripheral arterial disease 208 and calcific aortic atheroma. 209 Endogenous testosterone concentrations are inversely related to mortality due to cardiovascular disease and all causes. Low testosterone may be a predictive marker for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. 8 Thus, lower testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction and conditions associated with higher cardiovascular risk appear to be interrelated. 210, 211 Obesity induces a decrease of T levels via a decrease in SHBG levels, and morbid obesity also induces a decrease of FT. 212 There is evidence to suggest that an inverse relationship exists between serum testosterone levels and the degree of obesity in men. 213, 214 There is a close relationship between obesity and low serum testosterone levels in healthy men. 215 Twenty percent to 64% of obese men have a low serum total or free testosterone level. 216 Visceral obesity is more strongly inversely related to total and free testosterone levels than other forms of obesity. 217, 218 The Relationship between reduced testosterone and obesity in men can be explained by the hypogonadalcytokine-obesity cycle 219, 220 and it exhibits antiatherogenic effects at the tissue level, whether mediated by classical or nonclassical pathways. 221, 222 Initially cross-sectional studies but later also longitudinal studies were able to confirm that low testosterone levels and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were predictive of the metabolic syndrome, not only in obese men but also in men with a body mass index (BMI) \ue02c 25 kg/m 2 ."}, {"section_title": "223,224", "text": "The metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with low plasma testosterone 34, 225, 226 and insulin sensitivity. 34, 227, 228 There is positive correlation between serum testosterone levels and insulin sensitivity in men across the full spectrum of glucose tolerance 229 and an improvement of insulin sensitivity was noted after replacement. 230 Although Abate et al 231 found no association between low plasma levels of bioavailable testosterone and insulin resistance in eugonadal men; a recent larger study (NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]) showed that low free and bioavailable testosterone levels, even in the normal range, are associated with diabetes, independent of adiposity. 216 Serum testosterone should be measured in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus with symptoms suggestive of testosterone deficiency. The effects of testosterone administration on glycemic control of men with diabetes mellitus are much less certain. [232] [233] [234] By increasing lean body mass and reducing fat mass, testosterone therapy modulates insulin resistance and risk of metabolic syndrome. 232 Studies on androgen replacement in elderly men on LDL-C and HDL-C are controversial. 235, 236 The correlation between testosterone levels and HDL-C and insulin sensitivity is only observed within the physiologic male concentration range of testosterone. 237 A physiologic dose of androgens did not cause significant change in lipids. 238 A recent randomized controlled trial showed decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 239 A 24-week, multi-center, randomized, parallel-group study by Dobs et al 240 of transdermal and intramuscular administration of androgens in 58 men did not detect any significant change in HDL levels or in the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL in either group, apart from the mode of therapy. In addition, testosterone replacement decreases lipoprotein (a). 19 The mechanism of the fall in lipids might be related to the decrease in the visceral abdominal fat mass 241 under the influence of androgens, which inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity and increase lipolysis 242, 243 with improvement of insulin sensitivity and mobilization of triglycerides from abdominal fat tissue. 244 Supraphysiological T levels induce an increase in LDL-C and a decrease of HDL-C [245] [246] [247] and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Testosterone deficiency results in a 10% to 20% decrease in the blood hemoglobin concentration, which can result in anemia. 264, 265 Young hypogonadal men usually have fewer red blood cells and lower hemoglobin levels than age-matched controls, whilst healthy older men also may have lower hemoglobin than normal young men. The main androgen involvement in the mechanism of normal hematopoiesis is thought to involve direct stimulation of renal production of erythropoietin by testosterone. Moreover, the latter may also act directly on erythropoietic stem cells. 265 "}, {"section_title": "Risks of testosterone replacement therapy", "text": "The risks of testosterone replacement therapy depend upon age, life circumstances, and other medical conditions. 26 There is a risk for prostate cancer and worsening symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, liver toxicity and tumor, worsening symptoms of sleep apnea and congestive heart failure, gynecomastia, infertility and skin diseases.

Testosterone "}, {"section_title": "Prostate cancer", "text": "Prostate cancer is well known to be, in the majority of cases, an androgen sensitive disease, and prostate cancer has been treated in patterns designed to lower testosterone levels. 270 Androgen replacement therapy is an absolute contraindication. There is also no good evidence that testosterone treatment will convert subclinical prostate cancer to clinically detectable prostate cancer, 45 although some case reports reported this correlation. 274, 275 In a retrospective analysis of hypogonadal men who underwent prostate biopsy prior to testosterone replacement therapy, no increase in the risk of prostate cancer in men was revealed compared to those without prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at baseline. 276 The prevalence of prostate cancer in many studies receiving testosterone replacement therapy was similar to that in the general population. 67, 277 So far, there is no compelling evidence that testosterone has a causative role in prostate cancer. 271, 272, 278, 279 In fact, it should be recognized that prostate cancer becomes more prevalent exactly at the time of a man's life when testosterone levels decline. At a median of 19 months of TRT hypogonadal patients with a history of prostate cancer had no PSA recurrence and had statistically significant improvements in total testosterone and hypogonadal symptoms. In highly select patients after radical retropubic prostatectomy TRT can be administered carefully and with benefit to hypogonadal patients with prostate cancer. 280 Hormonal replacement in patients that underwent castration seems to be feasible in improving intense symptoms associated with androgen deprivation. After 18 months, no evidence of recurrence was noted. It is an experimental alternative for highly symptomatic patients, but the short follow-up and the small number of patients cannot allow for definitive conclusions and should be studied further. 281 A recent prospective study 282 did not show definitive data to confirm the relationship between serum sex hormones and prostate cancer. There is, however, unequivocal evidence that testosterone can stimulate growth and aggravate symptoms in men with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. 283, 284 Men successfully treated for prostate cancer and diagnosed with hypogonadism are candidates for testosterone replacement after a prudent interval if there is no clinical or laboratory evidence of residual cancer. 285, 286 In addition, no effect was found of testosterone replacement therapy on PSA levels [287] [288] [289] and the change in PSA were not influenced by the mode of testosterone replacement therapy, patient age, or baseline levels of PSA or testosterone. 290 The online prostate cancer risk calculator is one of the most commonly used tools to assist the clinician in assessing the risk of prostate cancer. [291] [292] [293] All men who present for TRT should undergo prostate biopsy if they have abnormal PSA level or abnormal result on digital rectal examination with low threshold to do or repeat prostate biopsy if the PSA level or digital rectal exam changes. Prostatic biopsy or referral to a urologist is recommended if PSA rises above 4.0 ng/mL or if it increases either by more than 1.5 ng/mL/year or by more than 0.75 ng/mL/year over 2 years, 294 or if PSA rises by more than 1.0 ng/mL in the first 6 months of treatment or by more than 0.4 ng/mL/year thereafter. 295 In summary, there is no convincing evidence that the normalization of testosterone serum levels in men with low levels is deleterious. TRT can be cautiously considered in selected hypogonadal men treated with curative intent for prostate and without evidence of active disease. 296 "}, {"section_title": "Liver problems", "text": "Benign and malignant hepatic tumors, intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure have been reported with testosterone replacement therapy. 297, 298 These unfavorable hepatic effects do not appear to be associated with transdermal or intramuscular injections. For this The risk of polycythemia\nThere is a correlation between high testosterone levels and high hemoglobin, most likely because testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis. Erythrocytosis can develop during testosterone treatment, especially in older men treated by injectable testosterone preparations. 45 Hemoglobin at puberty increases 15% to 20% in boys, men have higher levels of hemoglobin than women, and hypogonadism causes a decline in hemoglobin levels that can be restored with testosterone replacement therapy. 139, 300 But the elevation in hemoglobin above certain levels may have bad outcomes, particularly in elderly, because the increase in blood viscosity could exacerbate vascular disease in the coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular circulation, especially in people with other diseases that cause secondary polycythemia, ie, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [301] [302] [303] Injection is associated with higher potentials for erythrocytosis than topical preparations. 240 Snyder et al noticed that erythrocytosis occurred in 5.5% of scrotal transdermal users, and the majority of changes took place over the first three months of treatment. 92 It has been demonstrated that testosterone dosage correlates with the incidence of erythrocytosis, 67 The frequency of polycythemia (hematocrit over 51%) is related most of the time to supra-physiological levels. 240 The resolution of erythrocytosis (hematocrit \ue02e 52%), untreated obstructive sleep apnea, or untreated severe congestive heart failure, is required before starting on testosterone treatment. 19, 58, 304 Periodic hematological assessment is indicated (ie, before treatment, then at 3 to 4 months and at 12 mo in the first year of treatment and annually thereafter). While it is not yet clear what critical threshold is a desirable, dose adjustment and/or periodic phlebotomy may be necessary to keep hematocrit below 52% to 55%. 45, 58, 305 Other effects of testosterone replacement therapy Psychotic symptoms, excessive libido and aggression, in addition to physical and psychological dependence and withdrawal syndromes have been rarely described with testosterone treatment, 306, 307 though the validity of testosterone or the cause is uncertain. Kenny et al 204 did not find that significant changes in behavior, function, depression, or cognitive performance occurred following 12 weeks of testosterone replacement in men with low testosterone levels and early-to-moderate cognitive impairment.\nGynecomastia is a benign complication of testosterone treatment. It is related to aromatization of testosterone into estradiol in peripheral fat and muscle tissue. Even the ratio of estradiol to testosterone usually remains normal. It occurs especially with testosterone enanthate or cypionate. Dose adjustment may be necessary.\nDiminished testicular size and compromised fertility during testosterone replacement therapy occur because of the down-regulation of gonadotropins. 308 The administration of exogenous testosterone as a means of male contraception is under study. 309 In these men, azoospermia usually results within approximately 10 weeks of beginning therapy. Rebound of the sperm count to baseline levels occurs within six to 18 months of cessation, and subsequent fertility has been demonstrated. 310 Supraphysiologic doses of androgens may cause decreased testicular size, and azoospermia. 311 Testosterone-replacement therapy has been associated with exacerbation of sleep apnea. 312, 313 The effect of testosterone is not on the dimensions of the upper airway, but it most likely contributes to sleep disorder breathing by central mechanisms. 314 The development of signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea during testosterone therapy warrants a formal sleep study and treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if necessary. If the patient is unresponsive or cannot tolerate CPAP, the testosterone must be reduced or discontinued.\nTransdermal testosterone-replacement therapy is associated with a variety of skin reactions, mainly erythema or pruritus, which are more common with patches than with gel preparations. 67 Intramuscular injections of testosterone can cause local pain, soreness, bruising, erythema, swelling, nodules, or furuncles. 315 Supraphysiologic doses of androgens may cause acne. 311 Testosterone is anabolic, and it will cause some nitrogen, sodium and water retention.
