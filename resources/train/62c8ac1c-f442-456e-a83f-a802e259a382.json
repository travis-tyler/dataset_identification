ALS biomarkers have potential value on several levels, but the clinical benchmarks are already high (see Table II ). Moreover, the history of biomarker discovery in human disease to date is sobering, with \u03fd 0.01% of the number of published papers containing multiple candidates estimated to have been translated into biomarkers in routine clinical use (6).\nNational and international collaborations are required to obtain the numbers of samples necessary Table I .

Possible sources are listed in Table III . Control samples as a rule are likely to be more meaningful if matched for age and gender, to perform large biomarker validation studies for rare disorders like ALS (2). A recent initiative resulted in consensus guidelines for neuroimaging biomarkers in ALS (7), and ALS biobanking efforts have been initiated in some countries, e.g. the Northeast ALS consortium (NEALS) BioBank (www.alsconsortium.org) (8). However, standardized protocols of sample collection and annotated clinical information are not currently uniform and limit the ability to share samples and information. The Alzheimer ' s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) standardized procedures for the collection, processing, storage and shipment of biofl uid samples, from which a consortium identifi ed CSF biomarkers for the early disease currently being validated in large studies.

This strategy can be useful for identifying potential diagnostic markers or pathogenic pathways. These designs will not have value for identifying markers of therapeutic response or prognosis without continued clinical monitoring. The yield from group comparison may be reduced as a consequence of the heterogeneity in ALS (and compounded by small sample size); however, attempts to select patients with homogeneous phenotype are not without their own problems. Grouping of patients by site of symptom onset (e.g. bulbar versus limb) may have value as a broad prognostic marker. Realistically, however, there is no evidence for a distinct pathogenesis in terms of site of onset, nor between regional phenotypes, e.g. ' fl ail arm ' , so separation of groups by onset phenotype may be artifi cial. Equally, rigid adherence to revised El Escorial criteria categories does not equate to homogeneity in terms of prognosis. Furthermore, such criteria exclude those without mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs clinically, despite general acceptance that Progressive Muscular Atrophy and Primary Lateral Sclerosis form a continuum with ALS at a pathological level. Age at symptom onset and other established prognostic surrogates such as referral delay, are potential confounds within an otherwise homogeneous ALS group. While the exploration of subgroups stratifi ed according to a variety of criteria especially for an age related condition like ALS. Some controls (e.g. spouses) will have the advantage of additional matching for environmental factors. Obtaining more than one control for every patient enrolled is recommended. It must be carefully considered whether to use blood relatives of patients as controls, even when studying apparently sporadic cases, as biomarkers might in theory be present in both the patient and an unaffected relative with an occult genetic predisposition. The establishment instead of specifi c repositories for samples from presymptomatic relatives of patients with known ALSassociated gene mutations is advocated, being a potentially powerful resource in understanding the earliest steps in pathogenesis and achieving the larger goal of disease prevention. This will require significant and sustained funding as well as a robust ethical and counseling framework."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal studies", "text": "Multiple sampling over time in individual patients is the gold standard for assessing the usefulness of any biomarker as a prognostic indicator or marker of disease progression. It may not be an essential requirement to have a separate control group in longitudinal studies, since each patient can serve as their own control, with the change in value over time of a biomarker being the most relevant measure. The sampling interval must be a balance between the improved statistical robustness of multiple timepoints and the practicality of repeated sampling in patients who become increasingly disabled. Easily obtainable samples (e.g. blood, urine, saliva) might reasonably be sought every three months, whereas six-monthly or annual sampling is more realistic for more invasive procedures (e.g. cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF), skin or muscle biopsy). At present, neurofi laments have been confi rmed independently by a number of groups to be of prognostic and diagnostic value (e.g. 10 -13). Therefore we recommend the quantification of the very stable neurofi lament heavy chain to be included in longitudinal studies. Apart from diagnostic use this will allow comparison of studies, benchmarking of other candidates and emerging biomarkers and, if absent, indicate poor sample quality.

Although questions remain regarding the value and practicality of standardizing fasting status and time of day for sample collection, such information, along with the processing ' timeto-freezer ' should be recorded and linked to all samples in a database. All biofl uids should be collected in polypropylene tubes with screw caps and stored at -80 o C. While not all groups may be able to follow exactly identical collection, processing and storage protocols, it is crucial to at least record the volume and precise nature of the tissue sample.

A frankly traumatic tap should be recorded, and good practice is to discard the fi rst 2 ml to minimize occult blood contamination (this can be sent for routine laboratory CSF parameters such as cell counts, total protein, albumin and lactate, with paired serum). The latter measurement can be used for internal and external quality control of biosamples (14). Larger volumes of CSF are most helpful and there is no risk in removing up to 20 ml. Less than 5 ml can adversely affect quantitative measures due to gradient effects. The incidence of lifethreatening complications of lumbar puncture (in those without standard clinical contraindications) is negligible. Signifi cant post-procedure headache is uncommon with the use of 22G or narrower needle gauge, and largely self-limiting within 72 h when it occurs. In one research study there was an incidence of only 2.5% in a cohort of over 1000 AD study subjects (15), and so concern about complications should not be seen as an ethical barrier per se to the extraction of this valuable biomarker source. The importance of rapidly centrifuging the CSF has been demonstrated in studies that identifi ed rapid generation of proteomic and metabolomic artifacts (16, 17) . The supernatant should be quickly aliquoted into polypropylene screw cap tubes and frozen within an hour. CSF should be centrifuged with a speed of up to 2000 g for at least 10 min (at 4 \u00b0 C if the resources are available), to pellet any cells and avoid their lysis with subsequent thawing. Prompt CSF handling is also important to minimize observed variations in pH (18).

The blood collection tube type will determine if whole blood, serum or plasma has been processed for banking. Since hormonal circadian rhythm and diet are likely to infl uence the bioavailability of different compounds and of the gene expression in blood, a morning fasting blood sample may be ideal although probably not always possible during the regular follow-up of ALS patients. RNA analyses and metabolomics are thought to be most sensitive to time of day and the fasting state at collection. Proteomic analysis is less sensitive and DNA analysis least.\nThe impact of pre-analytical handling on mRNA gene expression has been evaluated with regard to the effects of delays to freezing and the buffers. Storage of whole blood at \u03ea 80 \u00b0 C is recommended, in either PAX-gene tubes or in RNAlater highly saline solution, the latter used in RNase-free microfuge tubes in which the RNAlater solution is three-fold the volume of blood. Red cells as a by-product of whole blood centrifugation during plasma extraction can be safely pooled into plastic tubes and stored at \u03ea 80 \u00b0 C. This simple protocol allows lipid chemistry analysis in red cells. White cell separation may provide the best source for DNA/RNA extraction or serve as a test-bed in the search of peripheral infl ammatory markers in ALS.

Collection of morning urine (that includes biochemical substances from several hours ' urine production) is recommended to overcome potential issues relating to diurnal variation. The second morning urine is recommended, as this reduces contamination of proteins from bacteria or bladder epithelial cells. The use of the creatinine ratio may compensate for 24-h urine collection.

Furthermore, it remains unknown whether muscle damage in ALS is due to unique biochemical pathways within the muscle or non-specifi c changes refl ecting denervation (20).

A schematic overview of quantitative proteomic approaches is shown in Figure 1 . To date, the search for ALS biomarkers was mainly based on the surface enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) technology (for review see (2)). While having the advantage that large numbers of individual samples from biofl uids can be processed without prior pre-fractionation, SELDI as a pattern recognition tool usually does not directly reveal the identity of the differential protein peaks and huge efforts are often needed subsequently to achieve this task (24). Alternatively, the two-dimensional fl uorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) system, a protein profi ling method that can be interfaced to mass spectrometric protein identifi cation in a more direct way, has been used for differential proteome analysis of CSF in ALS (25). 2D gel-based approaches have limitations such as under-representation of certain protein classes, low sensitivity, and restricted multiplexing capabilities. To address these limitations, gel-free mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantifi cation approaches of the shotgun type have been put forward, although often on the cost of information linked to protein integrity. These approaches usually rely on stable isotopes, either introduced by chemical tagging (e.g. iTRAQ) or metabolic labeling (e.g. SILAC) (Figure 2) . Here, potential drawbacks include the variation of labeling effi ciency in iTRAQ and the requirement of cultured cells for SILAC, preventing direct application to human material. In this regard, very recent spike-in versions of the SILAC approach (26) are promising at least for tissue samples, although some bias may be introduced through the reference proteome. With the advancements in liquid chromatography (LC) and MS, label-free quantifi cation is currently emerging as a powerful technique with the potential to complement stable isotopebased approaches (see, for example (27) for an experimental comparison). Based on the softwareassisted comparison of peptide intensities within separate LC-MS/MS runs, this technique features high sensitivity and dynamic range, unlimited multiplexing capabilities, and low running costs, making it ideally suitable for biomarker discovery from biofl uids. However, as the samples to be compared are not mixed at any time (as in stable isotope labeling workfl ows), accuracy of quantifi cation is an issue and the inherently higher variability has to be compensated by technical replicates. An early form of label-free quantifi cation has even been used for protein pattern classifi cation and identifi cation in CSF from ALS patients (28).\nBiomarker discovery typically involves searching for low-abundance proteins and proteins of small molecular weight such as cytokines and trophic factors. Detection of these small and low abundant proteins -that can be detected with multiplex antibody based platforms -can provide critical data on disease states. A further advantage is, that this biomarker profi le can't be overlooked (29, 30) . A targeted proteomic approach is important to consider, given that the typical dynamic range of quantitative proteomic approaches (2 -4 orders of magnitude) is far from being suffi cient to cover the entire protein concentration range of CSF (8 orders of magnitude (2)) or plasma/serum (10 orders of magnitude). Such biofl uids must be depleted of high-abundance proteins to shift the quantifi able portion of the proteome towards minor (potentially pathology-specifi c) components. Antibody based depletion of up to 20 major proteins and resin-based affi nity removal of albumin and IgG are common pre-fractionation strategies for both serum (31) and CSF (32). More recently, an alternative strategy based on the use of a combinatorial hexapeptide ligand library has been introduced (33) and used for an in-depth exploration of the CSF proteome (34).\nThe targeted validation phase of biomarker discovery workfl ow has been expedited due to the more recent transfer of the well-established selected reaction monitoring technology (SRM, also known as multiple reaction monitoring -MRM) from the small molecule fi eld into proteomics (35). This is an easy-to-operate mass spectrometric method for the accurate quantitation of (pre-defi ned) proteins from complex mixtures, with the potential to overcome antibody-based assays bottlenecks of biomarker validation (which typically involve antibody-based assays). For absolute quantitation, SRM assays require stable isotope-labeled standards of the targeted proteotypic peptides, a high demand that hampered broad applicability of SRM-MS in routine clinical proteomics to date. This is expected to change with the success of international initiatives like the human Proteome Detection and Quantitation Project (hPDQ) so that in future SRM-MS may bridge the gap between discovery proteomics and clinical assay development.\nThe proteomic and perhaps any of the biomarker analyses are unlikely to identify a single protein that will provide diagnostic and therapeutic insights but rather a biomarker panel or ' fi ngerprint ' is more likely. Therefore, data analysis is as critical as the platform chosen to provide the biomarker. For example, multifactorial analysis of analyte expression and crossvalidation in a ' leave one out ' strategy for determining how well a protein panel (fi ngerprint) is associated with disease classifi cation, should be considered as the biomarker strategies go forward (29, 30) ."}, {"section_title": "RNA and DNA analysis", "text": "Biomarker discovery in the central nervous system using the available micro-array platforms for tissue RNA-profi ling is limited by the cell based heterogeneity and complexity. To circumvent this problem and obtain cell-specifi c markers of disease initiation and progression, laser-capture microdissection has become a viable route to explore the contribution to the pathology of different cellular entities (36). The discovery of the role of particularly vulnerable portions of RNA like the microRNAs, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and may contribute to human diseases including ALS (37), has accentuated the debate on the reliability of the commonly used techniques of RNA extraction and storage and their effect on RNA integrity. Similar to other human disorders, ALS may arise from the acquisition of somatic, genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to changes in gene sequence, structure, copy number and expression. Therefore, the most appropriate investigative tools must allow serial analysis of gene expression in parallel with high-throughput DNA sequencing to defi ne point mutations, rearrangements and copy-number changes. As systems biology evolves into the defi nition of new types of biological macromolecules, a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes will have to include the characterization of microRNAs and of protein-DNA interactions. miRNA and mRNA in exosomes are probably more stable and therefore more suitable for biomarker studies."}, {"section_title": "Metabolomics", "text": "Metabolomics is a complementary technique to genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics that aims to study the metabolome in a holistic way.

The introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and of liquid chromatography for the resolution of lipid chemistry has revolutionized this area of investigation, creating the ground for the large-scale profi ling of a vast array of lipid classes and the computational demand for handling the large amount of data that these techniques generate (41).\nOne of the most comprehensive repositories of information surrounding lipid classifi cations, metabolic pathways, involvement in disease processes is contained in the Nature Lipidomics Gateway (http:// www.lipidmaps.org). In this web-based resource, practical considerations are discussed with respect to methods of sampling, storage, and lipid extraction of red blood cells. An overview of analysis tools for lipid determination, of analytical standards to obtain MS spectra and of the experimental parameters used for acquisition of MS/MS spectra is also available.\nA caveat in the reliable use of lipidomics to dissect novel disease biomarkers is the largely untested effect that diet may have in the lipid profi le of the target biological fl uids or tissues.
