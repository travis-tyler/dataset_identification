The main objective of this study is to gain further biological insights via the integration of statistical gene associations in AD with physical protein interaction networks."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia. Although its etiology is not completely understood, a genetic component of susceptibility to AD has been shown in the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies [7] [8] [9] [10] have also been conducted in AD to identify differential biomarkers. Given that one hallmark of AD pathology is a cerebral accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 peptide (A\u03b2 ) in amyloid plaques, the A\u03b2 1-42 level has been shown markedly reduced in CSF. In addition, the total tau (t-tau) protein level has been shown significantly elevated in the CSF of AD patients. As a result, the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio has also been studied as a biomarker for differentiating AD from normal older adults [5, [11] [12] [13] .\nWith the recent advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been applied to the analysis of CSF biomarkers (e.g., [13, 14] ) to identify relevant genetic markers, such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). While most studies examined genetic associations with CSF biomarkers at the individual SNP or gene level, mining higher level genetic associations using biological interaction networks is still an under-explored topic for the CSF biomarker studies in AD. Recently, many studies in other domains have demonstrated that integrative analyses of GWAS data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks can provide valuable biological insights. Some methods have been proposed to identify subnetworks enriched by GWAS results [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . One tool is iPINBPA [16, [20] [21] [22] [23] , which is based on the fact that the genes identified in GWAS are more likely to physically interact as well as to belong to the same or related pathways.\nWith these observations, in this work, we performed a genome-wide network-based pathway analysis for CSF studies in AD. We analyzed an AD cohort from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), used the CSF biomarker t-tau/A\u03b2 ratio as the test phenotype or quantitative trait (QT), downloaded the PPI network from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (http://www.hprd.org/), and applied the iPINBPA analysis to the GWAS findings of the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio. Our goal was to search for subnetworks or network modules enriched by the CSF GWAS findings, which may offer valuable biological insights and suggest high confidence candidates for subsequent analyses. Figure 1 illustrates the work-flow of this study. The genotyping and CSF data were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. GWAS of the CSF QT was performed using the PLINK software [24] . This resulted in 563,980 SNPs with associated p-values, which were then assigned to 22,179 genes. The gene assignment and gene-based pvalues were calculated using the VEGAS2 software [25] . The nominally significant genes (i.e., gene-based pvalues \u2264 0.05) were mapped onto the HPRD PPI network [26, 27] and analyzed using the iPINBPA method in order to identify the enriched subnetworks. The Enrichr pathway analysis tool [28] was applied to functionally annotate the subnetwork."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

An additive genetic model was tested with covariates, including age, gender, and diagnosis (through five binary dummy variables indicating CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, and AD). Then, the SNP-level p-values were obtained.\nThe VEGAS2 software [25] "}, {"section_title": "Network-level Analysis", "text": "The Human PPI data (n = 9,617) were downloaded from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD, http:// www.hprd.org); gene-level p-values obtained from the GWAS of the CSF t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio were mapped to the PPI network. The integrative protein interaction network-based pathway analysis (iPINBPA) software [22] was used to integrate GWAS findings with physical evidence of interaction at the protein level, and to detect new high-level associations (i.e., subnetworks of functionally interacted genes) with the CSF biomarker. Briefly, iPINBPA identifies enriched subnetworks using the following three steps.\nIn Step 1, using the GWAS findings, the nominally significant genes (i.e., p \u2264 0.05) are treated as seed genes, and assigned with certain weights (e.g., in this work, 1 for seed genes, 0 for the rest). After that, a random walk with restart strategy is employed to smooth these weights over the entire network. Intuitively, the nodes in the network are weighted based on their connectivity to seed genes (i.e., guilt-by-association). Let n k be a node on the PPI network mapped with gene-level p-value p i . Let e ij be the edge connecting n i and n j , and W ij be the weight of e ij . All the W ij 's form the adjacency matrix W. Extending K\u00f6hler's approach [35] , iPINBPA weights the edge e ij as follows:\nIn addition, it normalizes the adjacency matrix W by its columns. After each step of random walk, a score vector is calculated as AD Alzheimer's disease, ADNI Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, CDR-SOB clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes, CN cognitively normal, SMC significant memory concern, EMCI early mild cognitive impairment, LMCI late mild cognitive impairment. Number (%) or mean (s.d.) was shown in each entry. P-values were assessed due to significant differences between diagnosis groups, which computed using one-way ANOVA (*except for gender using chi-square test)\nwhere P(t) is the score after walking t steps, and r is the restart ratio. In this work, we assign 1 to all the seed genes, and 0 to the rest. Upon the completion of the random walk after T steps, the vector P(T) contains the node weights, which reflect the topological connections to the seed genes [36] .\nIn\nStep 2, given a network A containing k nodes, iPINBPA defines its score by combining the gene-level pvalues with node weights described above, using the Liptak-Stouffer method. Specifically, the network score of A is defined, via weighted Z transform test [37] , as follows:\nA random sampling of gene sets of size k\u2208[1, 500] for 1000 times was applied in iPINBPA [36] to determine the background distribution of the network score. Using this distribution, the adjusted network score of A is defined as:\n, where Z A is the network score, and \u03bc k and \u03c3 k are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the background distribution of the network scores at size k.\nIn Step 3, a greedy algorithm was developed to search for modules with high network scores, i.e., those enriched in genes with low p-values and high weights. Details about the algorithm is available in Wang et al. [22] .\nIn this work, the parameters were set in iPINBPA as follows: r = 0.5, T = 5, NetScore > 3.0, NetSize \u2265 5, and MaxNetSize \u2264 300. Given the stochastic nature of the iPINBPA algorithm, we ran iPINBPA ten times, respectively by setting the random seed value from 1 to 10. Consequently, we obtained ten groups of enriched subnetworks (GNs) identified by iPINBPA. Below, we couple a consensus module (CM) strategy with iPINBPA (named as CM-iPINBPA) to generate consensus findings from these analyses.\nGiven two subnetworks m and n, we use Dice's coefficient DC(m,n) to measure their similarity: DC m; n \u00f0 \u00de\u00bc 2 m\u2229 j nj m j j\u00fe n j j . In this work, we only focused on analyzing the top subnetwork (TN) in each iPINBPA run. Let TN a be the top subnetwork identified in Run a \u2208 {1, 2, \u2026, 10}. We first find SN b (TN a ), which is the most similar subnetwork to TN a in Run b \u2208 {1, 2, \u2026, 10}\\{a}. Clearly we have\nwhere sn is any subnetwork enriched in Run b.

To overcome this limitation, we proposed to examine the consensus modules discovered by multiple iPINBPA analyses. In other words, we focused on examining the shared subnetworks among multiple iPINBPA runs, which turned out to be more stable patterns. A two-stage strategy was employed. First, ten groups of subnetworks were generated by running iPINBPA ten times with varying random seed values ranging from 1 to 10. After comparing these ten sets of results, we identified ten CMs, one from each run (defined as the intersection of the top subnetwork from the current run and the most similar subnetworks from all the other runs). As a result, there are four unique CMs based on ten identified ones.\nThe genes in the CMs might not show a direct statistical significance but could interact with some genes identified in our GWAS. These genes can demonstrate indirect association with the studied QT, and may potentially provide valuable biological interpretation. For example, Consensus Module 1 contains the protein gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor (GABRB1) gene. GABRB1 codes for the \u03b21 subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A ) receptors [1] . The GABRB1 gene has been demonstrated to be involved in the thalamus structure and its interactive effects on intelligence [51] . The GABRB1 gene had also been associated with many neuropsychological diseases, such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease [52] .\nIn this study, we hypothesize that trait prioritized CM with high replication might have strong functional associations with t-tau/A\u03b2 1-42 ratio. We gathered these identified pathways for 4 CMs to plot heatmap to explore and refine the relationships between pathways and CMs (Fig. 4) . In Fig. 4 , it was observed that four pathways, including colorectal cancer, gliomas, renal cell carcinoma, and Huntington's disease, were commonly enriched in all the consensus modules. The neurodegenerative symptoms of neuron death affect many diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Below we briefly discuss a few additional pathways identified in Fig. 4 . In AD, focal adhesion complexes regulating neuronal viability can be used in treatment to adjust neuronal survival [53] . The adherens junction has been demonstrated as maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity, and the adherens junction pathways is highly associated with neurodegenerative diseases [54] . Apoptosis is an important pathway in Alzheimer's disease that is associated with neuronal loss [55] . The change in the MAPK signaling pathway contributes to significant change in neurotropin [56] . Some cancer-related pathways were found, such as colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, and so on. Some prior studies have been performed to examine the relationship between cancer and neurologic disease [57, 58] .\nWith these observations, the genes in the CMs may provide valuable information to suggest novel molecular mechanisms for subsequent analyses.
