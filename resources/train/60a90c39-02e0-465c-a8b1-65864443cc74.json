A total of 56 participants were included at the baseline evaluation. Notably, participants in the AD group were significantly older than those in the NC group, with a mean difference -7 \u00b1 2.5 (p = 0.018). No significant differences were observed between the AD and MCI groups. All three groups were similar with respect to years of education and gender. All participants were of European descent and Spanish-speaking. Fifty-three of the 56 participants had at least one AD biomarker performed (CSF 71.4%; PiB-PET 89.2%). The distribution of positive AD biomarkers between groups was similar for both methods (CSF and PiB-PET), with significant differences in the frequency of positivity of the NC group compared with the AD group (CSF p = 0.07; PiB-PET p = 0.01). In the case of the MCI group, there was a finding of positive amyloid detection in almost half of the participants (CSF 50%; PiB 45.5%). Table 2 shows the mean scores and SD of the neuropsychological testing between groups at the baseline visit. The three groups significantly differed from each other in the following tests: the RAVLT immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition (all three phases of memory), MoCA test, Semantic Fluency and TMT-B (p = 0.000). For the baseline analysis, the MMSE, Logical Memory and CDR were not considered, as these tests were used as part of the sample classification process, but they were considered in subsequent longitudinal analysis. For the rest of the neuropsychological tests, we found significant differences between the NC and AD groups, as well as between the MCI and AD groups, but not between the NC and MCI groups. There was no significant difference in the Geriatric Depression Scale between any of the groups. The NC group had no functional impairment as shown in the FAQ; however, there was a significant difference between the MCI versus the AD group, as expected (MCI mean score 2.4 versus AD mean score 12.7; p = 0.000)."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal analysis", "text": "As mentioned above, 50 participants completed the one-year follow-up visit, as six participants were excluded during the follow-up, causing slight changes in the total number of participants in each group: NC (n = 14); MCI (n = 24) and AD (n = 12) (Figure 1 ). Regarding the clinical status, five MCI participants had converted to dementia (AD group) based on functional worsening measured by the CDR (conversion from CDR 0.5 to 1). This represented a rate of conversion of 20% at the one-year follow-up. Four of these participants had a positive AD biomarker (only one was negative). For the purpose of longitudinal analysis of the neuropsychological testing, these participants were kept in the MCI group preserving the initial classification (Figure 1) . Figure 2 shows the evolution of scores of the neuropsychological testing indicating the mean values and SD between baseline (T1) and annual visit (T2) for each clinical group. To achieve a better correlation between the test results and age and educational level, z scores were used for most of the tests, except for the MoCA, ADAS-cog, Logical Memory, FAQ and CDR, in which the sum of boxes was used instead. In addition, and next to the graphs of the clinical groups, the same model was drawn showing those participants who had positive AD biomarkers versus those who were negative.\nThe Logical Memory test was included in the longitudinal analysis. After one year, the significant differences between groups remained similar to the baseline visit (p = 0.000) and time did not cause a significant decline in total scores for both immediate and delayed recall. The presence of AD biomarkers in this test did not change the evolution slopes significantly. However, we observed a trend towards improvement for those who were negative for AD biomarkers. This same situation was found for the RAVLT, as significant differences were found after one year (p = 0.000) but there were no significant changes in the total scores. In this case, the presence of AD biomarkers did not modify the results slope. T1  T2  T1  T2  T1  T2   Negative biomarker Positive biomarker   T1  T2  T1  T2  T1 T1  T2  T1  T2  T1  T2 12.

However, for only the MoCA test, time had a significant impact in all three clinical groups with a significant decline of 1.35 points (p = 0.018) in the global score.\nThere was no difference between groups over the timespan for the Geriatric Depression Scale. With respect to the FAQ, the AD group showed a mean decline of 18.27 points (p = 0.000) compared with the MCI group and 20.4 points compared with the NC group (p = 0.000). There was no difference between the MCI group and the NC group. The addition of an AD biomarker in this model showed no significant impact although it should be considered that only one participant had a negative biomarker in this group (almost all positive). The same was found for the CDR as the AD group increased by 4.34 more points compared with the mean value of the MCI and NC groups.\nWhen analyzing the language domain, semantic fluency showed different evolutions over time between the groups (p = 0.008), insomuch as the AD group had a mean decline of 1.71 z score points compared with the NC group (p = 0.000) and 1.17 z score points compared with the MCI group (p = 0.006). For the Boston Naming Test and phonological fluency, the same significant differences found at baseline remained at the one-year visit. For these tests, the addition of AD biomarkers as a variable did not significantly alter the variations previously found for the established clinical group's model.\nFinally, there were no significant variations over time for the non-memory tests (TMT-A and TMT-B) from those differences found at the baseline visit. Again, the addition of the biomarker variable in the model also did not change these findings."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this longitudinal study, we describe variations found in neuropsychological testing of the first ADNI cohort in South America after a one-year follow-up. In this study, there was a high prevalence of positive AD biomarkers in the AD group, 92.3% (12/13) and a low prevalence in the NC group, 20%. This means that the AD group represented a high probability pre-test group (the probability of having positive amyloid plaques prior to detection). The prevalence of AD biomarkers found in the NC and AD groups could have important considerations about the correct indication of AD biomarkers in the clinical setting. As previously noticed for other imaging task groups, the use of biomarkers is not recommended in these individuals due to their lack of usefulness in the diagnostic process. A different T1  T2  T1  T2   T1  T2  T1  T2  T1  T2   4 scenario is set for the MCI group with respect to AD biomarkers. Although MCI patients are at risk of converting to AD, there is great uncertainty about the underlying pathology, as a non-AD pathology could be causing the clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to have biomarkers that support the suspected diagnosis in investigational studies. In our cohort, almost half (48%) of the patients diagnosed with MCI had positive amyloid detected, and the conversion rate to dementia was 20% ( five patients from the MCI group). Interestingly, one of the participants who converted to dementia had negative amyloid biomarkers. Although, in this patient the possibility of a false negative result could not be ruled out 27 , non-AD pathology in patients with an AD-like phenotype is not uncommon 28 . Even though MCI patients with positive AD biomarkers are at higher risk of conversion to dementia, in our cohort there was no additional impact on neuropsychological tests when differentiating positive MCI versus negative MCI after one year. We acknowledge that the time period may have been too short to show significant differences, although some trends were found between groups.\nIn regard to the baseline analysis, it is well established that these groups represent a clinical continuum in memory impairment with different functional levels. However, not all the tests had the discriminatory power to recognize all groups, probably due to the preservation of the other cognitive domains usually found in MCI. Of note, we found that MCI patients who only had referred memory problems (amnestic type) also showed some impairment on non-memory tests, as was demonstrated by the TMT-B and semantic fluency, regardless of the expected impairments on memory tests. In regard to short tests, the MoCA test showed statistically significant differences among the three groups (p = 0.000). In contrast, the ADAS-cog could only discriminate the AD group from the NC and MCI groups, but not the NC group from the MCI group. This makes MoCA a suitable (and shorter) test when screening individuals with cognitive complaints and also an alternative test to the MMSE, as previously reported 16 . Longitudinally, the significant differences found at baseline were similar in the one-year follow-up assessment for almost all tests, perhaps due to the relatively short time between evaluations. The exception was semantic fluency, which showed greater impairment between the AD group and the MCI and NC groups respectively. Impairment in semantic fluency is a characteristic feature in patients suffering from AD, demonstrating the spread of the AD pathology to the entorhinal region 29 . In our cohort, significant differences in semantic fluency were found from the beginning in all groups, which could mean this domain is affected early. However, after one year these differences were more pronounced only in the AD group. In addition, the FAQ and CDR functional scales showed a pronounced worsening in the AD group (higher scores), leading to more significant differences compared with the NC and MCI groups. Surprisingly, the functional decline documented in the AD group was not accompanied by a significant worsening for the rest of the tests evaluated, except for semantic fluency.\nDividing each group and the cognitive tests according to biomarker status (positive versus negative) did not have a significant impact in our model. This was in part due to the NC group having a low prevalence of AD biomarkers and the AD group having a high prevalence, making biomarkers and the clinical diagnosis redundant. This was different for the MCI group. The ADNI model specifically focuses on patients diagnosed with MCI and aims to determine predictors of conversion to dementia. It was for this reason that more MCI participants than the other groups were included into the study. As mentioned before, half of the patients in our MCI group were positive. Therefore, we intended to demonstrate whether those \"biomarker positive MCIs\" would have greater impairment on neuropsychological testing, but that was not the case. We acknowledge, as limitations of the study, the limited time of the follow-up and the small cohort, which could have masked the influence of AD biomarkers. It is worth mentioning though, that some trends (not enough to be statistically significant) were shown between cognitive tests and biomarkers. Focusing on the MCI group, \"biomarker positive MCIs\" had higher mean values (worse) in the ADAS-cog. On the other hand, \"negative MCIs\" had shown some degree of improvement in Logical Memory, probably due to preservation of their learning skills."}]
