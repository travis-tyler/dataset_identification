There are scales for the evaluation of global atrophy [1] medial temporal atrophy [2] and for the classification of white matter lesions [3] . For these scales, there are also published cut-off threshold values according to age [4] . Visual inspection of the size and shape of the brain ventricles is a standard procedure in radiologic evaluation of diagnostic computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several studies have suggested that ventricular enlargement may be an objective and sensitive measure of neuropathological change associated with brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) at group level [5] . In the 2005 guidelines for diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, an EI of 0.3 or greater combined with gait dysfunction plus either urinary or cognitive dysfunction is required prior to consideration of treatment with ventriculoperiteoneal shunt [6] .\nHowever, assessment of ventricular enlargement is in most cases performed by subjective means and is typically based on the radiologist's experience.\nThe Evans Index (EI) [7] is an indirect linear measurement of ventricular size initially used on pneumoencephalography in paediatric patients. In 1987, Sherman et al stated that the EI normally is smaller than 0.3 in adults and that the index can be an objective form to diagnose hydrocephalus [8] . Currently, the EI is applied as an indirect, surrogate marker of ventricular volume (VV) in CT [9] and MRI [6] in adults.\nThe relationship between linear indices and ratios and true VV has been evaluated in several studies using CT [10, 11] and MRI [12] [13] [14] . Two recent studies in adults have questioned the reliability of the EI for assessment of ventricular size, and volumetric analyses of VV have been suggested instead [11, 13] . Volumetric ventricular analyses are time consuming, require specialized software, and are not available in every hospital. A quick and reliable measurement of the ventricular size, to separate normal from pathologically enlarged ventricles, is lacking in routine radiological evaluation. The EI is well known by radiologists and easy to perform, with previously reported high reliability [15] .\nSeveral studies have proposed a normal range for EI in the elderly population, but many were limited by small samples, combinations of sex and age ranges, and did not specify the method of EI measurement [10, 12, 13] .\nThe aim of this study is to define the upper normal value of EI (97,5 percentile) in healthy elderly controls (CTR) according to sex and age. The cut off values are applied to compare EI as a marker of pathological ventricular enlargement in iNPH and AD groups, to test the method's performance for the everyday routine radiological practice. The hypotheses are: 1) the EI is not different in men and women, and 2) the EI increases with age, and differs in patients with iNPH and AD compared to healthy elderly controls (CTR)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AD and CTR", "text": "A total of 534 participants aged 65-84 years were included; 226 patients with AD (57 % women) and 308 CTR (51 % women), see Table 1 .

Participant recruitment and eligibility criteria were similar in the two cohorts [16, 17] . AddNeuroMed is part of the Innovative Medicines in Europe (InnoMed) European Union Sixth Framework program [18] . Briefly, a diagnosis of AD was based on the NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria for probable AD, as well as a total Clinical Dementia Rating score [19] of \u22650.5. The inclusion criteria for CTR were an MMSE score of between 24 and 30, a total Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 and a Geriatric Depression Scale score \u22645.

Cut-off values based on healthy controls aged 65-85 shows that for age groups 65-69, 70-74, 75-79 and 80-84, the upper bound for EI was higher than 0.3 in both men and women.\nThe new EI cut-off values suggested here, cannot be applied to separate AD from CTR due to low sensitivity, but may separate CTR from iNPH with high sensitivity.\nA recent study by Missori et al concluded that an EI > 0.3 reflects an underlying neurological condition in every individual [24] . According to our study, this would imply that 29% of all healthy elderly would wrongfully be suspected to have an underlying neurological condition.\nHowever, there is one important flaw in the statistics of the Missori paper, in which only the average EI for each age group was presented, thus ignoring the normal variation in subjects of the same age.\nThe EI values measured in this study are in line with results from previous MRI studies in healthy elderly subjects. If we combine the CTR female and male values from all age groups in our study, mean EI \uf0b1 SD is 0.28 \uf0b1 0.03 (NO: 308, M/F: 150/158, age: 75 \uf0b1 7). Ishii et al [12] found EI to be 0.26 \uf0b1 0.003 (NO: 34, M/F: 21/13, age 75 \uf0b1 5) and Ambarki et al [13] found EI to be 0.28 \uf0b1 0.03 (NO: 46, M/F 18/28, age 71 \uf0b1 6). Nonetheless, these are not suitable as cut-off values for application in single subjects, as the merely represent averages of EI values for both sexes and any age group combined.\nSeveral MRI studies examining the gender effects on brain structures, including VV in healthy ageing, have been published. Some studies found a different age-related regional pattern across different brain structures in men and women [25] , while others found no gender differences [26] . In our study, we found that women at all ages, and in both the CTR and AD groups, have lower EI and LVV than men, and, in addition, the shape of the curves for EI are different in men and women implying that VV changes differently in males and females as we grow older. This has also been shown in a previous study of healthy elderly subjects [27] .\nThis is in contrast to another study which showed that while men have larger brain volume, CSF volume and lateral ventricles, compared to women, VVs and intracranial areas corrected for differences in cranial size do not vary between sexes [28] . The sensitivity for detecting AD in different age groups using the cut-offs from this study was low, ranging from 0 -21%, owing to the highly overlapping EI values between CTR and ADs. EI cut-off can therefore not be regarded as a well-suited method for diagnosing AD on MRI scans. There seems to be a smooth transition between normal and pathological values. Still it may be a valuable tool in the evaluation of brain scans from elderly patients in addition to other visual scales.\nEI \u22650.3 is a suboptimal indicator when diagnosing iNPH, and diagnosing iNPH is challenging as a whole [29] . In this study, 94 % of patients treated surgically with a shunt procedure after MRI improved clinically, indicating a high proportion of what may be considered \"true\"\niNPH. The sensitivity of detecting iNPH using the new cut off values is high (80%), and might be applied in the clinical setting. Our results need to be confirmed in larger groups of iNPH patients and unselected cases referred to the neurosurgical departments to test if the sensitivity is reproducible.\nA limitation of working with databases such as AddNeuroMed and ADNI is that their population represents a clinical trial population and not an epidemiologically selected population based study. Findings such as low educational level and increased prevalence of depression have for example been mentioned as possible confounders in the AddNeuromed study [30] and this may limit to which extent the results from this study can be generalized to the entire population. The results should be confirmed with data from other large population based cohorts.\nAdvantages of our study is the relatively large cohort of patients and controls compared to previous studies with EI measurements, high intra -and inter-observer reliability in the EI measurements and good clinical information about their health and cognition, which is lacking in many other studies. Cut-offs have also been tested on patients with a clinically probable iNPH diagnosis and a high shunt response rate.\nIn conclusion, we report normal EI ranges and propose new age-dependent cut-off values for men and women based on our healthy controls for use in routine radiological practice. EI in women are significantly lower than for men for all age intervals examined. We found that the sensitivity for discriminating AD from normal is very low in individual cases, but high in Tables   Table 1: EI and other "}]
