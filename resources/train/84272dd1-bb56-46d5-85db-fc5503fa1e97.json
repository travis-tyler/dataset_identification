[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Measurements of four Ra isotopes, Ba, Mn, U, and dissolved nutrients were used in concert with hydrodynamic modeling to reveal a large, tidally regulated sediment-surface-water exchange within Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in Monterey Bay, California. Hydrologic and oceanographic data from in situ sensors and geophysical surveys of estuarine bottom sediments were integrated with the chemical measurements to develop Ra flux boundary conditions for a three-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model of the estuary. Sediment and surface-water exchange is the dominant source of Ra isotopes within this system. This process occurs without significant fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge. A number of known solute transport and pore-water flushing mechanisms can explain the 224 Ra input, including diffusion, evaporative transport, bioirrigation, and inundation and drainage of borrows and macropores. The 226 Ra results suggest that some of these mechanisms, or others, are capable of mobilizing Ra from deeper sediments. The sediments supplying this flux may cover an area as large as the entire intertidal zone, primarily salt marsh, to a depth of 1-2 cm. In addition, the Ra delivery to the estuary appears to be temporally regulated by the tidal inundation of the salt marsh and subsequent drainage through tidal creek channels. These results illustrate the importance of the intertidal zone as a flowpath in the estuarine water cycle and the tidal phase lag that results when solute from this zone is transported into the estuary. This process is essential to understanding estuarine biogeochemical budgets of elements with significant sedimentary sources."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Among marine environments, estuaries stand out for their high biologic productivity, numerous societal functions, and hydrologic and chemical complexity. Because of their complexity and variability, estuaries are also challenging environments to study, and even more so to predict. Large tidal excursions, temporally variable freshwater inputs, and stratification can confound efforts to relate water chemistry to anything but the largest features (e.g., riverine inputs). Mixing processes, and thus net tidal exchange, are spatially and temporally variable in many estuaries (Uncles 2002) , making it difficult to predict chemical exchange with the sea. The complex morphology of intertidal salt marshes and mudflats results in irregularly flushed areas where evaporation and stagnation can alter the salinity, trace element, and nutrient chemistry of intertidal water. Such water is ultimately remixed back into the main estuary, influencing surface-water chemistry.\nSediment pore waters also possess distinct chemical characteristics and can influence surface-water chemistry through a variety of exchange processes (Huettel et al. 1998; Charette and Sholkovitz 2006) . In shelf sands, intertidal sand flats, and other permeable sediments, the dominant solute exchange mechanism is pressure-induced advection created by the interaction of currents, waves, and tides with sediment topography (Huettel et al. 1996; Precht and Huettel 2004; Billerbeck et al. 2006) . Along coastlines with permeable aquifers, solute exchange can be driven by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), a combination of fresh terrestrial groundwater and recirculating seawater Burnett et al. 2003; Hougham et al. 2008) .\nIn the muddy cohesive sediments found in many intertidal wetlands and estuaries, a number of additional solute exchange processes are also present. Diffusion and bioirrigation have long been held important (Berner 1980; Aller 1982) . Along the banks of tidal creeks, tidal inundation and drainage through burrows, macropores, and permeable sediment layers is prevalent (Howes and Goehringer 1994; Morris 1995; Jahnke et al. 2003) . For marsh flats, evaporation-driven transport mechanisms also play a role; both evapotranspiration and salt excretion by marsh grasses and macropore inundation coupled with micropore capillary transport may occur (Harvey and Nuttle 1995; Morris 1995) . In addition, sediment erosion, resuspension, and bed form-induced flows can result in pore-water exchange and may be dominant in some systems. This is a long list of seemingly disparate processes, some involving recirculating seawater and some simply the movement of solute. However, in terms of estuarine solute exchange these mechanisms can be grouped together because they occur predominantly in surficial sediments and they do not require fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge. The important questions are, what is the magnitude of this collective surficial sedimentary exchange and how does it affect estuarine water chemistry and ecosystems?\nFor many estuaries, the rate of sediment pore-water and surface-water exchange is great enough to significantly influence nutrient and trace element cycling (Rama and Moore 1996; Dulaiova et al. 2006; Martin et al. 2006) . Studies by Huettel et al. (1998) , Charette et al. (2005) , and Charette and Sholkovitz (2006) have shown how such fluid exchange can establish redox zones within the sediments and affect the transport of nutrients, transition metals like Fe and Mn, and trace elements such as Ba, U, and Sr. However, because of the aforementioned complexity of the estuarine environment and the variety of potential exchange processes, there is a high degree of uncertainty in determining which sediment exchange processes are most important, and in estimating the net chemical fluxes in an estuarine system. Consequently, our predictive ability is still limited in terms of the amount and timing of estuarine chemical fluxes involving elements with significant sedimentary sources and sinks (e.g., Ra, transition metals, P, and N). Work reported here uses Ra isotopes to elucidate some of these processes and is a step towards determining the more general contribution of sediment and surfacewater exchange for other elements within Elkhorn Slough, California.\n226 Ra, 228 Ra, 223 Ra, and 224 Ra, with half-lives of 1600 yr, 5.8 yr, 11.4 d, and 3.66 d, respectively, are members of the three naturally occurring U-and Th-series decay chains and each the product of Th decay. Whereas Th readily adsorbs to particles, Ra is much more soluble, especially in brackish and saline waters, where Ra isotopes partition into the dissolved phase, leaving the particlereactive Th parents sediment-bound. Thus, Ra isotopes are enriched in brackish groundwater and sediment pore waters and can be transported into the water column (Rama and Moore 1996) . In surface waters, what little Th is produced by decay of dissolved U or Ra is rapidly scavenged by particles and transported to the sediments. Consequently, there is relatively little Ra production in surface water, and the open ocean has low Ra activities (Krest et al. 1999 ). This makes Ra isotopes natural tracers of groundwater and pore-water discharge to the coastal ocean, and has been the basis for much of the recent research on estuarine sediment and surface-water exchange.\nIn this study we combined data from in situ environmental sensors, measurements of four Ra isotopes and Ba, geophysical marine sediment surveys, and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modeling to improve our understanding of sediment and surface-water exchange in Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in central California. Using this combination of data, we developed a set of flux models for Ba, 224 Ra, and 226 Ra to simulate hypothetical and best estimate scenarios of sediment and surface-water exchange (e.g., fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge or seawater recirculation), and ran the models through a hydrodynamic simulation to evaluate their ability to predict the measured values. The collective results show that sediment and surface-water exchange is the dominant mechanism supplying Ra isotopes to Elkhorn Slough estuary and that this process occurs without significant fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge. The results suggest that intertidal zone sediments are an important source of Ra to the estuary, perhaps the most important, and that the release of Ra to the estuary is regulated by tidal inundation of the salt marsh."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Study area-Elkhorn Slough (Fig. 1) is a drowned river mouth estuary in the center of Monterey Bay, California (Schwartz et al. 1986 ). The mean semidiurnal tidal range is 1.2 m and the mean spring tide range is 2.5 m (Breaker et al. 2008) . At low tide, water is confined to the 200-m-wide, 10-km-long curving main channel, which ranges in depth between 9 m at the mouth to 0.5 m at the head and is 2.7 3 10 6 m 2 in surface area. At high tide, water inundates and submerges up to an additional 9.7 3 10 6 m 2 of intertidal mud flats, salt marsh, and tidal channels. At mean lower low tide the estuarine volume is estimated to be 2.8 3 10 6 m 3 and at mean higher high tide it is 10.3 3 10 6 m 3 . These volumes are determined from a tidal rating curve based on bathymetry obtained via multi-beam sonar in 2003 by the Seafloor Mapping Lab at California State University, merged with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) topography of the intertidal zone; these same elevation data are used throughout our analyses.\nTwo facts about the estuary are particularly relevant to this study. First, the combination of a small main channel and a large salt marsh area results in significant intertidal storage in the marsh (Breaker et al. 2008) . Second, groundwater in the watershed has been drawn down to the point where seawater increasingly intrudes into the lower part of the aquifer; thus, fresh groundwater is less likely to be a significant source of water to this estuary.\nSample collection-Estuarine water samples (60 liters) for dissolved Ra analysis were collected on 10 March (n 5 4), 30 April (n 5 10), and 01 May 2006 (n 5 9) (Fig. 1) . Surface-water, river water, pore-water, and sediment samples were also collected throughout the watershed. Surface-water samples (30-100 liters) were collected from fringing ponds, marshes, standing water on agricultural land, and the harbor. River water samples (40-60 liters) were collected from the two direct terrestrial drainages, Carneros Creek (CCRK) and Old Salinas River channel (OSRIV), as well as Moro Cojo Slough, a tributary to the OSRIV. Pore-water samples (10-20 liters) were collected from surficial estuarine and beach sediments, and sediment samples (1-2 kg) were collected from estuarine and terrestrial sources. To determine the pore-water Ra balance and Ra production rates within estuarine sediments, sample sets of estuarine water (n 5 5, 60 liters), pore water (n 5 5, 8-20 liters) and sediment (n 5 5, 1-2 kg) were also collected along the Elkhorn Slough shoreline on 17 and 18 February 2008.\nTo assess changes in estuarine Ra activities during the course of a tidal cycle, G. Misra and A. Paytan collected and measured the Ra activity of a series of six surface-water samples (60 liters) at different tidal stages from three locations within Elkhorn Slough on 01 February 2003. These samples were collected synoptically from the Moss Landing harbor, from the mouth of Elkhorn Slough, and from the dock at Kirby Park in upper Elkhorn Slough (near the locations of E7, GM0, and L02; see Fig. 1 ). To assess tidal marsh Ra supply, a time series of tidal creek drainage (n 5 4, 40 liters) and receiving estuarine water (n 5 4, 60 liters) samples was collected during an ebb spring tide on 18 February 2008. Surface-water samples were collected by hand, pore-water samples were collected as seepage in 20-cm-deep excavated pits, and sediment samples were collected from the upper 10 cm of pits dug into the unconfined surficial sediments. Water temperature and salinity were determined at the time of sampling using a YSI Inc. Model 30 sonde.\nRiver and groundwater samples (n 5 14, 30-100 liters) were also collected and analyzed by Peters (1999) on 21 and 22 May 1998. The river data are included with the samples collected during this study period and the groundwater data are summarized in the discussion. The groundwater samples were collected by down-well pumps. All Ra samples were processed using the same methods. We also used total suspended solid data collected by D. Hardin (unpubl. annual report 2002 Hardin (unpubl. annual report -2003 (Eaton et al. 1995) .\nRadium isotopes-Dissolved Ra was extracted from the water samples in the field by filtering through columns of MnO 2 impregnated acrylic fiber at a flow rate of less than 1 L min 21 (Moore 1976) . Plugs of untreated acrylic fiber were used to reduce the particulate deposit onto the MnO 2 fiber. After filtering and in the laboratory, the MnO 2 -impregnated fiber was thoroughly rinsed with distilled water to further remove any particulates. Short-lived 224 Ra and 223 Ra as well as 228 Th were measured using the delayed coincidence counting method of Moore and Arnold (1996) . 226 Ra and 228 Ra were then measured on a high-purity Ge-well gamma detector following the procedure outlined by Rutgers van der Loeff and . For the sediment samples, the desorbable Ra activity was measured by mixing the samples with Ra-free seawater (salinity 5 32) and performing a dissolved Ra analysis of the resulting supernate (Webster et al. 1995) . The initial Ra-free seawater sediment mixture was stirred regularly over a 24-h period, after which the sediments were allowed to settle. The Ra activity of the supernate was then measured in the same manner as the other water samples. In addition, after the first Ra desorption, the five sediment samples collected for the pore-water Ra balance were incubated for 30 d to regenerate 224 Ra. These samples were desorbed a second time to determine the desorbable 224 Ra production rate. This method measures desorbable Ra production, not Ra that remains within the solid matrix; thus, the 228 Th parent activity we report is the fraction that produces desorbable Ra.\nElemental and nutrient analysis-Measurements of dissolved nutrients and element concentrations were made on the estuarine and endmember samples using standard methods (Table 1 ). All samples were filtered using 0.2-mm silica-free (polycarbonate) filters. The samples for elemental analysis were stored in 15-mL polyethylene vials, acidified with trace metal-grade nitric acid, and kept at 5uC until analysis. Element concentrations for Ba, Mn, and U were measured on a Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Samples for nutrient analysis were stored in 25-mL polyethylene bottles and kept frozen until analysis. Dissolved nitrate + nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and silicic acid were measured on a continuous segmented flow system consisting of components of both a Technicon Autoanalyzer II and an Alpkem RFA 300 (Gordon et al. 1994 ).\nSediment resistivity profiling-Continuous resistivity profiling is a controlled-source electromagnetic technique for measuring the horizontal and vertical distribution of apparent electrical resistivity in submarine sediments (Constable et al. 1987) . Continuous resistivity profiling surveys were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the main channel sediment structure to determine whether highpermeability sand lenses outcropped through the bottom mud and clay layer (Swarzenski et al. 2004; Breier et al. 2005) . The main channel of Elkhorn Slough was surveyed repeatedly during 30 April and 01 May 2006 using an Advanced Geosciences (AGI) Marine Supersting R8-IP resistivity meter with a towed electrode array (Fig. 2a,b ). We used a towed dipole-dipole electrode configuration in which one dipole pair of electrodes creates an electric current through the water column and benthic sediments and a set of eight additional dipole electrode pairs, with increasing horizontal spacing, measures the resulting potential field and bulk sediment resistivity. To obtain two-dimensional (2D) depth profiles of estimated actual resistivity, the data were post-processed using the AGI EarthImager 2DH smooth model inversion algorithm based on the method of Constable et al. (1987) .\nApparent resistivity measurements vary in response to temperature, sediment type, salinity, and porosity; thus, these measurements alone identify simply a change in resistivity, not the underlying cause. Their utility is in evaluating sediment heterogeneity and identifying anomalous regions that may be overlooked by other stratigraphic techniques (i.e., sediment coring). In addition, the inversion algorithm can produce false resistivity features from erroneous measurements, which can occur if excessive wave action exposes the electrodes to air. Consequently, individual small-scale (tens of meters) features in 2D profiles are ignored unless they occur with frequency and consistency during multiple surveys.\nMeteorological and hydrographic data-Several types of hourly environmental data series were compiled from different stations and used in both box and hydrodynamic modeling. For Elkhorn Slough, salinity, water temperature, and water depth were obtained from the Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory (LOBO) moorings: L02 (upper slough), L04 (mid-slough), and L01 (lower slough) (2006, http://www.mbari.org/lobo/loboviz.htm; Jannasch 2008). The water height data were used to estimate flood and ebb heights and volumes by cataloging the change in water height between inflection points. For Monterey Bay, salinity and water temperature were obtained from the M0 mooring.\nStream gauge data for CCRK, at the head of Elkhorn Slough, were collected by M. Los Huertos using standard river gauging techniques and provided to us (Rantz 1982; Ruehl et al. 2006 ). Net precipitation is based on a fit of precipitation and evaporation measurements to the CCRK gauge data (Fig. 3) . The hourly precipitation and evaporation measurements were collected at the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) (Office of Water Use Efficiency 2006, http://www.cimis. water.ca.gov/cimis/data.jsp) stations 19 and 129, north and south of the estuary respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Discharge to the estuary through the OSRIV, from Tembladero Slough and Gabilan Creek, came from gauged streamflows at United States Geological Survey (USGS) station 11152650 (2006, http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/discharge). In the hydrodynamic model, because the gauged stream flows were not at the point of entry into the estuary, these values were adjusted by a constant fraction until salinity distributions in the estuary satisfactorily matched the observations at the LOBO moorings. In addition, salinity in the nearshore region of Monterey Bay is significantly affected by stormdriven river discharges from the Salinas River 6 km to the south of Elkhorn Slough. Thus, in order to obtain the correct longitudinal salinity distribution in Elkhorn Slough, 20% of the hydrograph from the Salinas River (USGS station 11152500) was put into the ocean region of the model domain and an additional 10% of the Salinas flow was used to augment the OSRIV flow (an irrigation gate connects the Salinas River with the OSRIV). The free surface of the hydrodynamic model was driven by 6-min observations of tidal height from NOAA tide station 9413450, in Monterey, California, corrected for phase lag to the mouth of the estuary. Fig. 8 ). Drainage was clearly visible from the (d) pervasive secondary porosity network created by burrowing organisms and plant roots, in what are otherwise relatively low permeability salt marsh sediments. This is an ideal setting for sediment and surfacewater solute exchange processes such as (e) tidally driven seepage from creek bank burrows and macropores as well as (f) diffusion and bioturbation when the marsh is submerged and evaporative transport when it is exposed.\nSalinity and Ra box models-Box models (Fig. 3) were used to balance estuarine water volume (m 3 ), Ra activities (Bq), and dissolved salt (kg) in order to develop initial estimates for tidal mixing and Ra fluxes (Breier and Edmonds 2007) . The water and Ra balances were performed over a 52-d period from 10 March to 01 May 2006, and assumed to be at steady state such that any imbalance reflects discrepancies in the flux terms. The salt balance was performed as a transient analysis over a 6-d high discharge period in April 2006 when the salinity of the estuary went through a major excursion; the larger the excursion, the more accurate the estimate of tidal mixing efficiency. For periods longer than a tidal cycle, we assume that any recirculating seawater within intertidal sediments has no net effect on the estuarine water volume and thus is not included in the water balance (Eq. 1):\nwhere f and i are the final and initial periods of a daily discretized time series of unit time DT n , F and E are the daily flood and ebb tide water fluxes (i.e., tidal prisms), respectively, RW is river discharge, (P 2 Evp) is input due to direct net precipitation and ungauged runoff, GW is the unknown fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge, and V is the estuarine water volume (Fig. 3a) . Recirculating seawater is included in the Ra balance (Eq. 2) because Ra is released from aquifer solids as seawater flows through and is chemically modified during the process:\nwhere e is the effective tidal mixing efficiency (Fischer et al. 1979) , A F is the flood-tide Ra activity, A E is the ebb-tide Ra activity, A RW is river Ra activity, l is the radioactive decay constant, A ES is the mean estuarine Ra activity, A GW is the groundwater Ra activity, and A SW represents the collective recirculating seawater and sedimentary sources Ra activity (Fig. 3b) . GW and SW are the unknown components of SGD and the subject of our study. In any case, the Ra is produced from sediment-bound Th in the coastal sediments, a fraction of which remains within sediment grains and adsorbed onto sediment surfaces (Fig. 3c) . The effective tidal mixing efficiency, e, is defined as the mixing fraction of the tidal volume, which is also the complement to return flow, b, as in e 5 (1 2 b). For the box models, e is estimated using a dissolved salt balance for the estuary, which neglects any salt contribution from SGD (Eq. 3):\nwhere s \" F is the flood tide salt concentration, s \" E is the ebb tide salt concentration, s \" RW is river salt concentration, and s \" ES is the mean estuarine salt concentration. Salt concentration (kg m 23 ) was determined from the relationship s \"5 Sr S (S,T) where S is salinity, T is temperature, and r S is the density of seawater, also a function of S and T as described by Millero and Poisson (1981) .\nThe quantity (s \" ES V) f 2 (s \" ES V) i is the change in estuarine salt inventory following a river-flushing event, in this case during the period of 06-12 April 2006. Equation 3 can be solved for e using the time series hydrographic measurements of salinity, temperature, river discharge, and water height just discussed. Tidal mixing is handled implicitly and more accurately in the hydrodynamic model.\nHydrodynamic modeling-For the hydrodynamic and chemical transport modeling we used the 3D tidal, residual, Fig. 3 . Box model schematics for (a) water, (b) estuarine water Ra, and (c) pore-water Ra. The estuarine water balance (Eq. 1) is a function of river discharge (RW), net precipitation (P 2 Evp), ebb tide (E), flood tide (F), and potentially fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge (GW). For the estuarine Ra balance (Eq. 2), radioactive decay is included as well as the unknown GW and recirculating seawater (SW) inputs; the estuarine salt balance (Eq. 3) is analogous except that there is no decay or SW input. Dissolved pore-water Ra inventories are a balance between Ra production by sediment-bound Th parents, decay, sediment surface exchange, and SGD sediment and surface-water exchange.\nintertidal mudflat model TRIM3D (Casulli and Cattani 1994 ) with a conservative flux-limiting scalar advection scheme (Gross et al. 1999) . Turbulence is modeled using the generic length scale method of Umlaf and Burchard (2003) . To incorporate Ra into the numerical model, a decay term was added to the scalar equation. The scalar advection equation in conservative form (Eq. 4), with the addition of a decay term, is\nwhere s represents the chemical scalar of interest (e.g., salt, 224 Ra) and l is the decay constant. A boundary condition is applied at the sediment-water interface to specify the solute flux between the sediment pore water and the overlying water column. The horizontal resolution of the model domain was 30 m with 0.25-m vertical bins. The model domain had a total of 15,218 water columns with 230,415 active grid points. The domain grid represents a compromise between the need to model ocean and estuary exchange processes while focusing the computational power in the estuary itself. An ocean region that utilized true offshore bathymetry while covering a horizontal area large enough to include the Salinas River was not possible, and we have modeled the nearshore region as a box, with a tidal boundary 3 km west of the estuary. The modeled period began at 08:00 h, 01 January 2006, to ensure adequate spin-up prior to the Ra sampling dates in March, April, and May (Fig. 4) .\nThe ability of the model to predict physical and chemical results is evaluated by calculating an ''index of agreement'' (Willmott 1982) . This quantitative measure of model variance (Eq. 5), commonly referred to as skill, compares model predictions to measured observations:\nwhere X is the scalar value of interest and the subscripts denote an observed or modeled value. The overbar is evaluated as a time average for the LOBO data, and as the mean for the surface-water samples."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Elkhorn Slough estuarine waters are typically near or above ocean salinity, and receive very little freshwater inflow. Freshwater inflow is typically lowest during the summer, at which point the average water residence time in the upper estuary is on the order of 2 weeks (Nidzieko 2009 ). However, the winter-spring wet season is characterized by episodic river discharge. The focus of this study was the wet period, when the water content of the watershed-aquifer-estuary system is greatest. The spring of 2006 was wetter than normal and included several major precipitation events (Fig. 4) The continuous sediment resistivity surveys confirm thick homogeneous bottom deposits throughout most of the Elkhorn Slough main channel (Fig. 5) . This is consistent with the results of previous acoustic surveys and sediment cores that have shown the main channel sediments to be composed of several meters of clay and mud (Schwartz et al. 1986 ). The bottom sediments in the upper portion of the estuary are the most heterogeneous, containing 10-100-m-scale, higher-resistivity features (Fig. 5b,c) . These higher-resistivity features could be the result of differences in porosity, higher sand fraction, or potentially lower pore-water salinity, but their location is consistent with the general presence of sand lenses in this part of the channel. Thus, the sediment resistivity surveys of the main channel suggest that terrestrial groundwater advection must be limited to the upper estuary, or possibly the channels and fringes of the salt marsh, where surveying was not practical.\nFor the 2006 Elkhorn Slough samples (Table 1) , the mean 226 Ra, 228 Ra, 223 Ra, and 224 Ra dissolved activities were 2.13, 3.85, 0.537, and 5.80 Bq m 23 (1 Bq 5 60 dpm), respectively. There were no significant differences in mean Ra activities between the three sample periods, but all were significantly greater than Monterey Bay Ra activities, which for 226 Ra, 228 Ra, 223 Ra, and 224 Ra are ,2.17, 0.83, 0.20, and 3.07 Bq m 23 , respectively (Peters 1999) . The activity range of Ra in Elkhorn Slough is therefore generally consistent with that of many other estuaries and indicates input of Ra-enriched SGD (in its broad definition) to the system (Rama and Moore 1996; Charette et al. 2001; Breier and Edmonds 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Ra and Ba as a function of salinity-In Elkhorn Slough, dissolved Ba concentrations, like salinity, are controlled by ocean and river water mixing, as illustrated by the linear relation between salinity and Ba ( Fig. 6a; Table 1 ). This differs from larger river and estuarine systems on the east coast of North America, the Arctic, and Europe, where the Ba salinity distributions exhibit varying degrees of nonconservative behavior throughout the estuarine salinity range (Coffey et al. 1997; Guay and Kenison Falkner 1998; Moore and Shaw 2007) . A key difference is that for Elkhorn Slough the freshwater input is proportionally much smaller than these larger river systems. The lowsalinity mixing zone is restricted to the very head of the estuary, typically ,500 m of the main channel, and the fringes of the wetlands, where we could not obtain sufficient samples. We do not rule out nonconservative Ba behavior, but during our sampling period either it was restricted to these low salinity areas that were not sampled or it was a transient phenomenon that our sampling did not capture; it was not observed in the main estuary. The salinity and dissolved Mn relationship is similar to that of Fig. 5 . Elkhorn Slough bottom sediment resistivity profiles along the (a) upper and (b) lower segments of the main channel. Depth is total depth from the water surface; the sedimentwater interface is shown as a black line. The results show the low-resistivity saline surface water over a bottom of mostly fine sediments containing saline pore water (0-2 Ohm-m). Areas of elevated sediment resistivity (4-8 Ohm-m) are potentially because of either reduced porosity, reduced salinity pore waters, or higher sand fraction; these areas occur more frequently in the upper slough, which is consistent with the known presence of sand lenses at shallower depths. The areas of highest sediment resistivity (4-16 Ohm-m) occur predominately in the upper slough in small patches (tens of meters) such as those shown (c) in the vicinity of Kirby Park.\nBa. In contrast, Elkhorn Slough dissolved Ra activities show a clear nonconservative mid-salinity maximum within the estuary (Fig. 6b,c ; Table 1 ). This is similar to observations at other estuaries, and is indicative of Ra input from sediment and surface-water exchange processes occurring within the Elkhorn Slough estuary. Also noteworthy, estuarine dissolved U concentrations increased with salinity (Table 1 ) and were greater than sediment pore-water concentrations (Table 1: PW1-3). This suggests that scavenging of U from seawater is occurring in the surficial sediments of the salt marsh, even while Ra is being released (Church et al. 1996; Moore and Shaw 2007) .\nDesorption from riverine suspended particulates is one potentially significant nonconservative source of dissolved Ba and Ra isotopes (Guay and Kenison Falkner 1998) . Many studies indicate this process is rapid and occurs at relatively low salinities; estimates vary concerning the salinity at which desorption completes but are typically between 5 and 15 (Krest et al. 1999) . Although the majority of Elkhorn Slough surface water is above this salinity range, the stream samples for CCRK and OSRIV (Table 1: CCRK, OSRIV) are not. Thus, the effective riverine contribution could, in theory, be greater than the dissolved measurements suggest. However, in Elkhorn Slough during this study, the data indicate that desorption of Ba and Ra from riverine particulates is not significant. We estimate that Elkhorn Slough particulate desorbable Ra activities are typically ,1% of dissolved riverine Ra activities (Table 1 : CCRK, OSRIV) based on the highest measured desorbable Ra activities of watershed terrestrial soil samples (Table 2 : SED3, SED4) and a mean total suspended solids concentration of 0.014 kg m 23 (D. Hardin unpubl.). Basing this estimate on the watershed soil samples makes this a conservative upper limit because these sediments have not undergone any previous desorption. Indeed, these comparatively low-organic-matter, ''fresh'' soils had much higher desorbable Ra activities than any of the marine sediments. Actual estuarine suspended material is a varying mixture of terrestrial and marine organic and inorganic matter and is expected to have desorbable Ra activities between those of the marine sediments and terrestrial soils. This is consistent with the salinity relationships, which for Ba clearly reflects linear conservative mixing, and for the Ra isotopes indicates that nonconservative inputs occur at salinities .20, which is not consistent with desorption from riverine particulates (Fig. 6 ). Desorption may have increased during the high discharge period because of higher suspended particulate concentrations (Fig. 4 : 06-12 April 2006). But there were no significant differences between the Ra and Ba concentrations before and after this event, indicating that any increase in dissolved concentrations was transient.\nThe difference between the Ba and Ra salinity relationships is important. It signifies that in Elkhorn Slough, sediment and surface-water exchange is being driven primarily by seawater recirculation or other surficial sediment processes (predominantly a source of shorterlived Ra isotopes) and not by fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge (a source of Ba and all four Ra isotopes) or riverine input. This is supported by the increasing degree of nonconservative enrichment from long-lived 226 Ra to shortest-lived 224 Ra and the fact that samples with high 224 Ra (i.e., Table 1 : B5) are clearly distinct from CCRK water (i.e., Table 1 : CCRK), which is dominated by Ba, Mn, and silicic acid, and the OSRIV water (i.e., Table 1 : OSRIV), which is dominated by inorganic nitrogen.\nEstuarine and tidal creek Ra time series-The February 2003 time series reveal an interesting feature of estuarine Ra transport: activities are greatest during ebb and rising tides (Fig. 7) . For 226 Ra this was true at all three of the February 2003 sampling stations: in the upper estuary (Kirby Park), at the estuary mouth, and within the harbor (between the mouth and the OSRIV). The 226 Ra activities increased significantly during the ebb tide, nearly doubling in the upper estuary. Activities remained elevated for the duration of the rising tide in both the upper estuary and the harbor. At the estuary mouth, activities began to decrease immediately after low tide. The 224 Ra trends were similar but with a greater increase in upper estuary activity. Activities remained elevated in the upper estuary during the rising tide. In the harbor, activities began to decrease 2 h after low tide and did not peak at all in the mouth.\nThe February 2008 time series reveals another feature of estuarine Ra transport: activities in tidal marsh drainage are greater than those in receiving estuarine waters (Table 3, Fig. 8 ). The time series was collected in the lower estuary during the slack and rising portions of an ebb spring tide, following a complete submerging of the salt marsh. The salinity of the tidal creek drainage was always 1-1.5 greater than that of the receiving waters. The 226 Ra activity was up to 30% greater and the 228 Ra activity was 60% to 160% greater. The two short-lived Ra isotopes exhibited greater variability: the 223 Ra activity was between 40% less and 280% greater, whereas the initial 224 Ra activity of the tidal creek drainage was 10% less than the receiving waters but was always greater thereafter, by as much as 100%.\nThe phase lag between the tide and estuarine Ra activities may be indicative of the mechanism supplying the nonconservative Ra input. It is known that the morphology of the intertidal zone and estuary allows significant intertidal storage (Breaker et al. 2008 ). In addition, drainage from the burrows and macropores along the tidal creeks lags the tidal cycle. When tidal waters flood the salt marsh, they become enriched in Ra to some degree, and the subsequent drainage would continue to transport that Ra into the estuary even while the tide is rising. Similar seepage cycles have been observed in Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, Massachusetts (Howes and Goehringer 1994) .\nElkhorn Slough endmember waters and Ra activity ratios-Additional indications of Ra supply from surficial sediments can be drawn from the activity ratios of the decay series 228 Ra R 228 Th R 224 Ra (Table 1) . For any two of these isotopes, an activity ratio near 1 indicates a state of equilibrium between production and decay. For all of the estuarine samples, the 224 Ra : 228 Th activity ratio is significantly greater than 1. This indicates the 224 Ra was regenerated from surficial sediment-bound 228 Th because most of the 228 Th, produced by 228 Ra decay, is removed to the sediments. For a number of the estuarine samples, the 224 Ra : 228 Ra activity is also significantly greater than 1. For these, there is insufficient 228 Ra to account for the 224 Ra, another indication that the 224 Ra was regenerated from surficial sediment-bound 228 Th. Sample B5 (Fig. 1c: midestuary) has both the highest 224 Ra : 228 Ra activity ratio and the highest absolute 224 Ra activity of all the estuarine samples. The salt marsh surface-water samples (Table 2: SW3-SW6) also had high 224 Ra : 228 Ra activity ratios (3.2-8.4). So did Monterey Bay beach pore waters PW2 and PW4 (5.4 and 9.5), though their absolute 224 Ra activities were less ( Fig. 2; Table 2 ). High 224 Ra : 226 Ra ( 228 Ra not measured) has been reported in other wave-driven beach environments (Boehm et al. 2006) . In contrast, only one of the 11 groundwater samples collected by Peters (1999) had a comparable 224 Ra : 228 Ra activity ratio (7.8) but the absolute 224 Ra activity (0.78 Bq m 23 ) was less than a tenth of sample B5 or the groundwater average (8.5 Bq m 23 ).\nBox model estimates of sediment and surface-water exchange-Using steady-state Ra box models based on Peters (1999) . 1 Surface water salinity for subtidal sediments; for dry subaerial sediments, salinity not applicable.\nEqs. 1 and 2, we can place some constraints on the magnitudes of the nonconservative Ra inputs (Table 4) . For the 52-d period from 10 March 2006 to 01 May 2006, the estimated mean water volumes for the flood tide, ebb tide, and river discharge were 392,000, 2415,000, and 20,300 m 3 d 21 , respectively. Net precipitation as either ungauged river runoff or a direct estuarine input is negligible with respect to river input, and fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge is initially assumed to be zero. Thus, using only the first three terms of Eq. 1, the water budget shows only a minor imbalance of 2700 m 3 d 21 (Table 4) . Our tidal mixing efficiency estimate of 19% is based on a transient salt balance (Eq. 3 solved for e) for the high-discharge period of 06-12 April 2006, in which the salt fluxes are 1561 3 10 6 kg for the flood tide, 21291 3 10 6 kg for the ebb tide, and 0.6 3 10 6 kg for the river, and the initial and final estuarine dissolved inventories are 168 3 10 6 kg and 220 3 10 6 kg, respectively. This makes the mixing portions of the flood and ebb tides 74,480 and 278,850 m 3 d 21 (Breier and Edmonds 2007) . Using the Ra activities (Table 1) of sample B2 for the flood tide, the mean activities of the estuarine samples for the ebb tide, the mean of the CCRK and OSRIV samples for the river, and the water fluxes, we calculate modest nonconservative inputs for long-lived 226 Ra but progressively larger nonconservative inputs for the shorter-lived isotopes (Table 4 ). The 226 Ra input is small: 24.7 3 10 3 Bq d 21 .\nAssuming for now that this is the result of fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge, because of the low 226 Ra availability for desorption in surficial sediments, this equates to a water flux of 6800 m 3 d 21 based on the average activity of pore-water samples PW1-PW3: 3.63 Bq m 23 (Table 4) . In contrast, the 224 Ra input is large: 6.08 3 10 6 Bq d 21 . The results suggest that this is due to a sedimentary source, so it is worth considering the constraints on this supply. Using the sediment desorption measurements, we estimate an average 224 Ra production rate of 43.3 Bq m 23 d 21 based on the 228 Th sed activities (Table 3) . When compared on a wet sediment basis, this is similar to the 2200 m 23 d 21 estimate for the Bega River Estuary, Australia (Hancock et al. 2000) . The 228 Th sed activities are such that the average pore-water 224 Ra activities could be completely regenerated in less than 1 d. Simply producing the daily 224 Ra input would require at least 140,000 m 23 of estuarine sediment. Although the areal extent of this input is uncertain, the subtidal (2.7 3 10 6 m 2 ) and intertidal (9.7 3 10 6 m 2 ) areas are good estimates of the upper and lower limits: 140,000 m 23 of estuarine sediment is then equivalent to a 5-cm layer of the subtidal zone or a 1-cm layer of the intertidal zone. More sediment may actually be required. Pore-water 224 Ra activities were much less than desorbable activities, which were near equilibrium with 228 Th sed (Table 3 ). This is evidence that under in situ conditions the majority of Ra produced in the sediments remains in Beginning after low tide (13:30 h) time series water samples were collected from tidal creek drainage and the receiving estuarine surface waters at station D2 in the lower estuary (see Fig. 1 ). Measurements of (a) salinity, (b) 226 Ra, and (c) 224 Ra dissolved activities show that tidal creek drainage was elevated above that of the estuarine samples; 228 Ra is similarly elevated as is 223 Ra but with greater variability and less consistency. the sediments and decays in place. We consider pore-water Ra to be the mobile fraction. Based on the average porewater 224 Ra from Table 3 (91.7 Bq d 21 ), the 6.08 3 10 6 Bq d 21 224 Ra input could be met by a sediment porewater flushing rate of 66,000 m 3 d 21 . This would be equivalent to flushing sediment pore waters to an average depth of 6 cm at 24 L m 22 d 21 for the subtidal zone or a depth of 2 cm at 6.8 L m 22 d 21 for the intertidal zone based on the average sediment porosity of 0.4 (Table 3 ). These flushing rates are comparable to rates estimated for other intertidal sediments: 9.4-16.6 L m 22 d 21 for the intertidal marsh sediments of North Inlet, South Carolina (Morris 1995) and 2.4-4.2 L m 22 d 21 for intertidal sand flats along the North Sea coast of Germany (Billerbeck et al. 2006) . Thus, in terms of 224 Ra production and inventory the surficial estuarine sediments appear to be able to support the magnitude of the calculated input.\nWe also need to determine whether the exchange mechanisms can support the release rate. As previously noted, the possible exchange mechanisms for intertidal surficial sediments include diffusion, sediment erosion and resuspension, bioirrigation, inundation and drainage of burrows and macropores, and evaporation-driven transport mechanisms. We can estimate supply rates for a number of these mechanisms. In Elkhorn Slough, resuspension largely results in erosion, for which the 224 Ra contribution is small: 567 3 10 3 Bq d 21 , which is an upper limit based on the highest desorption activity of 0.817 Bq kg 21 for a terrestrial soil with higher Ra loads than the marine sediments (Table 2 : SED3), a maximum sediment density of 3700 kg m 23 (Table 3: D1) , and an erosion rate of 190 m 3 d 21 (Smith et al. 2007 ). Estimating diffusive flux involves more uncertainty because surficial sediment Ra activity gradients are difficult to measure in the first few centimeters of sediment, because of the water volumes necessary for analysis. One thing is clear: the larger the sediment surface area, the smaller the gradient needs to be for the flux to be significant. So an upper limit on the sediment surface area would involve input from the entire intertidal zone (9.7 3 10 6 m 2 ), which we just estimated would require at least 1 cm worth of surficial sediment to produce the daily flux. Using that area and depth, neglecting decay, we estimate a diffusive flux of 2. (Table 4 ; Rama and Moore 1996) . Based on this estimate, 50% of the estimated 224 Ra input could be supplied by diffusion if the entire However, the inherent uncertainties in these calculations are large. Breier and Edmonds (2007) performed a detailed uncertainty analysis of similar estuarine Ra box model results and determined that the relative uncertainties were as high as 100%. Tidal exchange estimates were the biggest contributors to the uncertainty.\nHydrodynamic model inputs and results-For a final, more accurate and realistic description of the transport and mixing processes at work in Elkhorn Slough during this study period, we developed the spatially and temporally resolved, 3D, hydrodynamic transport models for Ba, 226 Ra, and 224 Ra in Elkhorn Slough described below. Using the box model results as initial estimates, several sets of Ra and Ba input fluxes were developed for the ocean, river (R), recirculating seawater and sedimentary sources (RSW), and fresh terrestrial groundwater (TGW) endmembers (Fig. 9) . There are two groups of 3D model runs. The first three are based on the box model results, whereas the last two incorporate additional refinements aimed at improving the box model predictions. In all 3D model runs, the ocean endmembers are held constant throughout the simulation, such that river and sediment sources within the slough are the only variable parameters.\nThe first three model runs (R, R + RSW, and R + RSW + TGW) were designed to further evaluate our conclusion that sediment and surface-water exchange is supplying significant amounts of Ra to Elkhorn Slough. The river model (model R) illustrates the null case, in which the only inputs of Ba and Ra are from CCRK and the OSRIV and the ocean is the sink. The inputs are the product of time Ba for the ocean. The composite models R + RSW and R + RSW + TGW build on the river model by closing the Ra balance with evenly distributed areal RSW and pointsource TGW fluxes. To collectively model tidally driven exchange processes, the full 567 3 10 3 Bq d 21 224 Ra source is input as an evenly distributed RSW flux; because the current algorithm cannot model subsequent seepage from a dry intertidal zone, the RSW flux was restricted to the subtidal area (below mean lower low water) of the estuary (2.7 3 10 6 m 2 ) at a constant rate of 2.25 Bq m 2 d 21 . The TGW flux of 24.7 3 10 3 Bq d 21 was input as a 6800 m 3 d 21 , 3.63 Bq m 23 point source at the location of sample C5; the concentration and volumetric flux are based on the average pore-water activity of samples PW1-PW3 (Table 1) .\nThe model is validated for salinity against both the samples obtained during the field campaign (Table 1 ; Fig. 9 ) and the LOBO moorings (Fig. 10) ; model agreement with observed velocities was excellent (not shown, skill 5 0.98 and 0.96 at L01 and L02, respectively). A comparison of the salinity field at LOBO moorings L01 and L02 shows that the model does not freshen sufficiently in response to large rain events, a limitation of the gauged stream flow data when simulating runoff. Consequently, we have omitted the March samples from further discussion. The model does a good job, however, of simulating the hourly LOBO observations in the weeks prior to the 30 April-01 May sampling (Fig. 10c,d : skill 5 0.84, L01 deep; skill 5 0.63, L02 deep. Not shown: skill 5 0.69, L01 surface; skill 5 0.65, L02 surface). Thus, we have confidence in the ability of the model to simulate transport and mixing during this period. Comparison of the model salinity to discrete samples yields similar results (Fig. 9a , skill 5 0.63).\nFor Ba, the correlation between the river model (R: the null condition) and the observed concentrations is good (Fig. 9b: skill 5 0.73). This agrees with our chemical analysis that river discharge is the dominant source of this constituent at the time of our sampling. The 226 Ra model to discrete sample comparison is good near the mouth of the estuary, indicating the ocean and OSR endmembers are correct; but in general, both 226 Ra and 224 Ra are underpredicted by the R model (Fig. 9c,d : skill 5 0.24, skill 5 0.32), confirming the importance of nonconservative estuarine sources for these constituents.\nFor 226 Ra, the box model flux estimate of 24.7 3 10 3 Bq d 21 , as either a benthic flux (R + RSW model) or a fresh terrestrial groundwater source (R + RSW + TGW model), is clearly insufficient to replicate the actual measured activities (Fig. 9c) . As a check on our riverine and Monterey Bay source terms, we developed a fourth effective endmember concentration (EEC) model using effective zero salinity and Monterey Bay (salinity 5 33.5) concentrations determined by fitting a river-to-seawater mixing line to our Ba and Ra sample measurements; the EECs are shown in Fig. 6 . For Ba, all of the March, April, and May estuarine samples (Table 1) and stream samples R1 and R2 were used to fit the river-to-seawater mixing line (Fig. 6a) . For Ra this is complicated by mid-estuary inputs, so we estimated conservative endmembers by using just samples B2 and R2 (Fig. 6b,c) . As a result, the predictive skill for Ba and 226 Ra increased to 0.85 and 0.25, respectively. However, the modeled 226 Ra inputs still underpredict the measured 226 Ra activities by an average of 43%, or 0.97 Bq m 23 (Fig. 9c) .\nTo bring the 226 Ra flux into general agreement with the observations requires a revised nonconservative input many times larger than our original box model estimate. Because the hydrodynamic model accurately predicts salinity and Ba concentrations, it appears that the discrepancy is because of underestimates in the box model. The most sensitive element of the box model, and possible source of the error, is the Ra activity of the ebb tide: a 1% difference in the effective 226 Ra activity of the ebb tide results in a 6.8% change in the estimated imbalance. The revised 226 Ra flux is large enough that it cannot be the result of fresh terrestrial groundwater discharge. Even the smallest volumetric groundwater flux, based on the highest groundwater 226 Ra activity (20.5 Bq m 23 ) measured by Peters (1999) , would be twice as large as the estimated river water discharge. There is no evidence of such a large water flux in the salinity record, and the hydrodynamic model does very well recreating the observed salinity distribution without it. In other words, the majority of the nonconservative 226 Ra input must be introduced without freshwater.\nTo evaluate this interpretation, we developed a new model (Best Fit model) by adding 226 Ra to the RSW flux of the EEC model. Using a 2 2 6 Ra RSW flux of 0.40 Bq m 2 d 21 distributed over the 2.7 3 10 6 m 2 subtidal zone greatly improved the correlation between predicted and observed 226 Ra (skill 5 0.58). This further indicates that in Elkhorn Slough the principal nonconservative supply of 226 Ra is primarily due to recirculating seawater or sedimentary processes. This is noteworthy because although 224 Ra is regenerated in surficial sediments, 226 Ra cannot be regenerated to any significant extent, suggesting that at least some of the sedimentary processes we have discussed, or others not fully known, are capable of mobilizing 226 Ra from deeper sediments.\nFor 224 Ra, including the recirculating seawater and sedimentary flux values from the box model (R + RSW model) increased the modeled activities into the lower range of the measured activities (Fig. 9d) ; indicating that the magnitude of the box model flux estimate, 6.08 3 10 6 Bq d 21 , is a lower limit on the actual input. However, the correlation between the modeled and actual 224 Ra activities is poor; increasing the 224 Ra flux increases the modeled activities, but it has no effect on the correlation. Therefore, our treatment of the recirculating seawater and sedimentary input as a constant evenly distributed areal flux does not adequately describe the driving mechanisms.\nWe conclude that the inundation and drainage of the intertidal zone is a key aspect of Ra delivery to the estuary and one that our current model does not handle realistically. It is likely that the drainage of the intertidal zone through salt marsh tidal creeks introduces a significant phase lag in the Ra flux with respect to the tides and also results in a series of point source inputs along the estuary. Modeling this process accurately requires a coupled hydrodynamic and groundwater algorithm capable of dealing with intertidal storage, the complex low-relief topography of the salt marsh, and at least pore-water seepage and potentially bioirrigation and evaporative transport. Gardner and Wilson (2006) have explored several 2D numeric models of pore-water seepage, but what is needed is a scheme for applying such algorithms to a real 3D tidal creek network and integrating the results with a hydrodynamic transport model.\nTidally regulated solute fluxes from the intertidal zoneAll of our evidence indicates that for Elkhorn Slough the nonconservative dissolved Ra input is not associated with fresh groundwater or surface water, even during the wet season. This is clear for 224 Ra, but our modeling also indicates that the majority of 226 Ra, 228 Ra, and 223 Ra may also be introduced without fresh groundwater or surface water. We conclude therefore that in the case of Elkhorn Slough during this study period, the dominant sediment and surface-water exchange processes involve recirculating seawater or sedimentary mechanisms. Time series tidal creek measurements, the 224 Ra : 228 Ra activity ratios, and the hydrodynamic modeling scenarios suggest that the most significant source is intertidal sediments; this may include sediments covering the entire intertidal zone to a depth of 1-2 cm. A number of known solute transport and porewater flushing mechanisms can explain this input; which specific ones are most important remains an open question. Importantly, the Ra delivery to the estuary appears to be regulated by tidal inundation of the salt marsh and is consequently nonlinear with respect to the tides. This requires a coupled hydrodynamic and groundwater algorithm to model realistically, which may ultimately be necessary in order to accurately determine or predict the net estuarine fluxes of biogeochemical constituents with significant sedimentary sources such as N, C, and transition metals."}]
