As one who has followed the achievement gaps and differential progress of various groups of students from elementary through secondary school, I am struck by the fact that such differences are present consistently by fourth grade. This constant is evident in the National Assessment of Educational Progress fourth-grade scores and in U.S. fourth-grade scores in international mathematics, science, and reading assessments. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), now offers ample proof that such differences are obvious much earlier, indeed as early as kindergarten entry. Subsequent tracking of this cohort of kindergartners through first and third grades continues to show that while all children make considerable progress in the early grades, children who begin with an advantage maintain that advantage and may even widen the gap as they acquire more advanced skills faster than children who have one or more risk factors in their lives. It is also the case that children who start kindergarten with family risk factors tend to make fewer subject area gains than children without risk factors. Clearly, the findings show a tremendous range in performance across third-graders. While almost all children by the end of third grade could recognize words and solve simple addition and subtraction problems, fewer than half (46 percent) were able to use background knowledge combined with sentence cues to understand the use of homonyms and only 42 percent demonstrated an understanding of place value in integers to the hundreds place. Twenty-nine percent were able to make interpretations beyond what was stated in text (e.g., make connections between problems in a narrative and similar life problems), and 16 percent could use rate and measurement to solve word problems. ECLS-K is one of the first nationally representative studies to portray a full picture of early childhood development and educational experiences. Moreover, by collecting information from parents, teachers, and school officials, it also can sketch out the features in children's families, schools, and wider communities that may relate to children's educational progress and success. In this way, it can suggest not only conditions that put students at risk of school failure, but also opportunities that enable students to be successful. The main study (kindergarten cohort) began in the fall of 1998 with a nationally representative sample of approximately 23,000 kindergartners from over 1,000 kindergarten programs. These children have been followed longitudinally through fifth grade, and plans are under way to continue to track their academic progress into eighth grade and beyond. The data from the 2005 collection will be eagerly anticipated in the coming years as the students move into middle school and adolescence. The summary included in this edition of the Quarterly highlights children's gains in reading and mathematics over their first 4 years of school, from the start of kindergarten to the point when most of the children are finishing third grade. It also describes children's achievement status in reading, mathematics, and science at the end of third grade. It shows as well information on children's perceptions of their competence and interests in school subjects, their relationships with peers, and any problem behaviors they might exhibit. Comparisons are made in relation to children's sex, race/ethnicity, number of family risk factors, kindergarten program type, and the types of schools (i.e., public or private) they attended in the first 4 years of school. It is the fourth in a series of reports from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99."}, {"section_title": "FE A T U R E D TO P I C : EA R L Y CH I L D H O O D LO N G I T U D I N A L STUDY", "text": "Children begin kindergarten with many different levels of reading and mathematics skills and make significant gains in their reading and mathematics achievement over the first 2 years of school (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000;West, Denton, and Reaney 2001;Denton and West 2002). The knowledge and skills children acquire in kindergarten and first grade can serve as a foundation for their later educational success. It is important to explore children' s growth and development as they move from the beginning of kindergarten through the elementary school years. This is the fourth report in a series that provides descriptive information about young children' s school experiences, based on data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), part of the U.S. Department of Education' s Institute of Education Sciences, 1 ECLS-K selected a nationally representative Featured Topic: Early Childhood Longitudinal Study sample of kindergartners in the fall of 1998 and is following these children through the spring of fifth grade. The study collects information directly from the children and their families, teachers, and schools. The full ECLS-K base-year sample is composed of 22,782 children who attended 1,277 schools with kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year. The first ECLS-K report, America's Kindergartners (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000), provided a national picture of the knowledge and skills of entering kindergartners. In the second report, The Kindergarten Year (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001), children' s gains and status in reading and mathematics were explored during their first year of school. The third report in this series, Children's Reading and Mathematics Achievement in Kindergarten and First Grade (Denton and West 2002), described children' s reading and mathematics achievement in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. This fourth report highlights children' s gains in reading and mathematics over their first 4 years of school, from the start of kindergarten to the point when most of the children are finishing third grade. 2 The report also describes children' s achievement in reading and mathematics at the end of third grade, both in terms of their overall achievement in the two subject areas and in terms of their specific reading and mathematics knowledge and skills. It examines whether differences in reading and mathematics achievement that were identified for certain groups of children in kindergarten and first grade persist 2 or 3 years later. Specifically, comparisons are made by children' s sex, race/ethnicity, and number of family risk factors. 3 Achievement is also compared for children with different early school experiences (i.e., attended full-day vs. half-day kindergarten programs, attended public vs. private vs. both school types from kindergarten through third grade). Information on two new ECLS-K direct child assessments conducted in the spring of 2002 is included. In the third-grade year, children were administered a science assessment for the first time in place of the general knowledge assessment, which was used in the kindergarten and first-grade years. In addition, third-graders completed a self-description questionnaire (SDQ) on their perceptions of their competence and interests in reading, mathematics, and school in general. They also rated their popularity with peers and competence in peer relationships, and reported on any internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors that they might exhibit. The SDQ provides the first direct information from the ECLS-K children about how they feel about their school experiences. The purposes of this report are to describe the academic gains children have made from kindergarten through third grade, their achievement status at the end of third grade, and their perceptions about their school experiences. Two types of analyses were used to achieve these purposes. In addition to comparing the overall mean estimates and scores for different groups of children (i.e., bivariate analyses), more complex multivariate analyses (i.e., ordinary least squares regression) were conducted to describe the relationships of different child, family, and early school experience characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, number of risk factors, kindergarten program type) with children' s achievement and perceptions, while controlling for the other characteristics. One of the limitations of mean comparisons is that they describe children' s achievement gains and status for different groups of children without taking into account other factors that may also be related to achievement differences. For instance, family risk factors are related to children' s achievement (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001), though the average number of these factors varies by children' s race/ethnicity (Zill and West 2001). Bivariate results are included in the report to describe overall, unadjusted mean values for subgroups in the population. Findings from the regression analyses follow the bivariate results within each section of the report and further explain whether bivariate differences hold when other risk factors are taken into account. This is a descriptive report. Readers should not draw causal inferences from the regression results in this report, since apparent relationships can change based on the particular independent variables examined. The small set of independent variables used in this report' s regression analyses were included with the specific purpose of clarifying the descriptive results observed in the multiple bivariate comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "The report uses data from ECLS-K to address the following questions: \u25a0 What knowledge and skills do children demonstrate in the spring of third grade? How have these changed since they first started school? Do children' s knowledge and skills and the gains they have made over time differ by certain child, family, and school characteristics? \u25a0 How do third-graders perceive themselves and their relations with other children? Is their academic achievement at the end of third grade related to their perceptions? The findings in this report are based on children in the ECLS-K sample who entered kindergarten for the first time in 1998 and were administered the direct cognitive assessments in English in fall 1998, spring 1999, spring 2000, and spring 2002."}, {"section_title": "Changes Over Time for the ECLS-K Children", "text": "Over the first 4 years of school, young children may encounter different early learning experiences. From the start of kindergarten to the end of third grade, many children had changed schools at least one time. 4 For instance, in the spring of 2002, about half of the children remained in the same school they had attended in kindergarten, 39 percent had made one school change, and 10 percent had changed schools two or more times since the start of kindergarten. Some children also changed the type of school they attended. Eighty-one percent of the children had attended public schools for the duration of the study, and 9 percent always attended private schools. Ten percent changed the type of school they attended at least once between kindergarten and the end of third grade. Also, in the spring of 2002, about 89 percent of first-time kindergartners were in third grade, 10 percent were in second grade, and about 1 percent were enrolled in other grades (e.g., first or fourth grade)."}, {"section_title": "Overall Gains in Reading and Mathematics Knowledge and Skills From Kindergarten to Third Grade", "text": "The ECLS-K reading and mathematics assessments were designed to reflect children' s knowledge and skills in both subjects over the duration of the study. The reading assessment captured information on children' s basic literacy skills, vocabulary, and comprehension. The mathematics assessment measured children' s conceptual understanding of numbers, shapes, patterns, mathematical operations, and processes for problem solving. From the start of kindergarten to the end of third grade, children' s reading scale scores, a measure of their overall reading achievement, increased an average of 81 points, and their mathematics scale scores increased about 63 points. Children' s spring third-grade reading scale scores were about 8.4 standard deviations higher than their fall kindergarten scores, and their spring third-grade mathematics scale scores were about 7.3 standard deviations higher than their fall kindergarten scores. Thus, one standard deviation in the reading score amounts to a 9.6-point difference in the reading scale score, and one standard deviation in the mathematics score amounts to an 8.6-point difference in the mathematics scale score. It is important to note that the data points represented in the figures and tables in this report cover different time spans (i.e., the kindergarten school year, the full calendar year between spring of kindergarten and spring of first grade, and 2 full calendar years between spring of first grade and spring of third grade). Thus, increases in achievement over time must be interpreted relative to the amount of time between assessments. Between the start of kindergarten and the end of third grade, the reading and mathematics achievement gaps across certain groups of children widened. Black children had made smaller gains in reading and mathematics by the end of third grade than White, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander children. 5 As the number of children' s family risk factors (e.g., living in a single-parent household, living below the federal poverty level) increased, children tended to gain less in both subject areas than children with fewer family risk factors (figures A and B). Children' s gains in their first 4 years of school did not differ substantively, however, by their sex, the type of kindergarten program they attended (i.e., half-day or full-day), or the type of school they attended (i.e., public school all 4 years, private school all 4 years, both public and private school attendance).  Black third-graders had lower achievement scores than White, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander children in all three subjects, and Hispanic third-graders had lower overall achievement scores in science compared with White children (figure C). Those with more family risk factors had lower mean achievement scores in all subjects than those with fewer family risk factors. In addition, third-graders who had always attended private schools from kindergarten through third grade had higher reading achievement scores than those who had always attended public schools. Children' s third-grade achievement did not differ substantively by their sex."}, {"section_title": "Specific Reading and Mathematics Knowledge and Skills in Third Grade", "text": "In addition to assessing children' s overall reading and mathematics achievement, ECLS-K provides more specific information on the knowledge and skills that children have acquired in both subjects by the end of third grade. By the end of third grade, almost all children could identify the ending sounds of words, name sight words, and recognize words in context. They could also demonstrate mathematics concepts of ordinality (e.g., identify ordinal positions of objects) and solve simple addition and subtraction problems. Seventy-eight percent could make literal inferences based on text (e.g., recognize the comparison being made in a simile) and solve simple multiplication and division problems. Forty-six percent were able to use cues to derive meaning from text (e.g., use background knowledge combined with sentence cues to understand the use of homonyms), and 42 percent demonstrated an understanding of place value in integers to the hundreds place. Twenty-nine percent were able to make interpretations beyond what was stated in text (e.g., make connections between problems in a narrative and similar life problems), and 16 percent could use rate and measurement to solve word problems. Many of the patterns of differences in children' s overall achievement gains and third-grade status were also present when children' s proficiency in specific reading and mathematics knowledge and skills was examined. After controlling for the other child, family, and early school experience  characteristics, Black third-graders were less likely to be proficient in more advanced reading levels (i.e., making literal inferences, deriving meaning from text, and making interpretations beyond text) and mathematics levels (i.e., multiplication and division, place value, and rate and measurement) than White, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic children. Children with more family risk factors were also less likely to be proficient in these skills than their peers with fewer family risk factors. Hispanic third-graders were less likely to be proficient in deriving meaning from text and making interpretations beyond text than White thirdgraders, and were less likely than White and Asian/Pacific Islander children to demonstrate mastery of place value and rate and measurement skills. In addition, children who attended public school from kindergarten through third grade were less likely to demonstrate some of the more advanced reading and mathematics skills and knowledge than those who had attended private schools for some or all of their first 4 years of school (figures D and E). Finally, although overall reading and mathematics achievement status did not differ substantively by children' s sex, girls were more likely to demonstrate proficiency in most of the advanced reading skills than boys, and were less likely to exhibit proficiency in most of the advanced mathematics skills than boys."}, {"section_title": "Children's Perceptions About Themselves and Their School Experiences", "text": "At the end of third grade, children were asked about their perceptions of their competence and interest in reading, mathematics, and school in general, and about their peer relationships and problem behaviors that they may exhibit. 6 On average, children indicated that they were generally interested in and enjoyed school, and that they did not perceive their schoolwork to be too difficult. Girls tended to have greater interest and perceived competence in reading than boys, a finding that persisted after controlling for children' s race/ethnicity, number of family risk factors, and their early school experiences. On average, children also responded positively regarding their peer relationships, with most indicating that they generally made friends easily and got along well with their peers. Black third-graders were more likely to feel this way than Asian/Pacific Islander children, after controlling for other child, family, and school experience factors. Children tended to indicate that they only occasionally exhibited NOTE: Estimates reflect the sample of children assessed in English in all assessment years.

Boys indicated a higher likelihood of exhibiting externalizing behaviors than girls. Black third-graders reported more of both types of problem behaviors than White, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander third-graders. In addition, as the number of family risk factors increased for third-graders, they were more likely to report internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors (figure F). Third-graders' perceptions about their interest and competence in reading and mathematics were also associated with their achievement at the end of the school year. Those scoring in the highest third on the reading assessment in the spring of 2002 expressed greater interest and competency in reading than children scoring in the lower two-thirds. The same pattern of relationships between perceptions and achievement occurred in mathematics. The relationship between children' s perceptions and achievement was subject-specific, in that there was no relationship between achievement in one subject area and perceived interest and competence in a different subject area."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, the findings from this report are consistent with patterns identified in earlier ECLS-K reports on children' s achievement in kindergarten and first grade (Denton and West 2002;West, Denton, and Reaney 2001;West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000). The knowledge and skills children demonstrated at the end of third grade continued to differ in relation to their race/ethnicity and number of family risk factors. In addition, this report found that the achievement gaps between disadvantaged and more advantaged children identified at the beginning of school (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000) grew wider over the first 4 years of school attendance. In the first months of school, private school kindergartners demonstrated higher achievement status in reading and mathematics than public school kindergartners (West, Denton, and Germino Hausken 2000). These unadjusted mean differences were also found in third grade between children who attended public schools for all 4 years and those who attended private schools for part or all of the time, and were also found in terms of children' s science achievement. However, when other factors (e.g., race/ethnicity and  number of risk factors) were taken into account, some of the substantive school-type achievement differences did not persist. Also, the achievement gap between public and private school children did not widen substantively over the first 4 years of school, even between those children who always attended the same types of school from kindergarten through third grade. In earlier ECLS-K reports, findings also indicated that public school children who attended full-day (vs. half-day) kindergarten programs had higher overall achievement at the end of kindergarten in reading and mathematics, after controlling for other characteristics, and were more likely to demonstrate advanced reading skills at the end of the kindergarten year (Walston and West 2004;Denton, West, and Walston 2003). When overall kindergarten achievement was compared for full-day and half-day children from both public and private schools, however, differences in reading and mathematics achievement were not detected (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001). Findings from this report also indicate no substantive differences in reading, science, and mathematics achievement at the end of third grade related to the type of kindergarten program children had attended. New information collected directly from children at the end of third grade indicates that, on average, they generally enjoyed reading, mathematics, and school in general, and felt competent in their schoolwork in these areas. Children' s academic performance in reading and mathematics was positively related to their perceptions of their competence in the corresponding subject area. Third-graders perceived that it was easy for them to make and maintain friendships, and that they only occasionally exhibited internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors in school. However, disadvantaged children were more likely than more advantaged children to indicate that they exhibited problem behaviors. Denton, K., West, J., and Walston, J. (2003).

Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics. NOTE: Family risk factors included living below the federal poverty level, primary home language was non-English, mother's highest education was less than a high school diploma/GED, and living in a single-parent household. Values range from 0 to 4. Scale scores on children's perceptions come from a self-description questionnaire (SDQ). Scores on the SDQ scales ranged from 1 (\"not at all true\" ) to 4 (\"very true\"). Estimates reflect the sample of children assessed in English in all assessment years. Although most of the children in the sample were in third grade in the spring of 2002, 10 percent were in second grade and about 1 percent were enrolled in other grades.  Longitudinal studies grow increasingly useful over time as data accumulate and patterns of individual development are illuminated. This is illustrated by the most recent National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) report on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), From Kindergarten Through Third Grade: Children's Beginning School Experiences, which reports findings from the fifth wave of data collected, in spring 2002-when most students were in the third grade-on the schooling experiences and achievement patterns of a cohort of 1998-99 kindergarten students. ECLS-K began in the fall of 1998 with a nationally representative sample of approximately 23,000 U.S. kindergarten students. These students were assessed in fall 1998, spring 1999, fall 1999, and spring 2000, in math, reading, and general knowledge; and in spring 2002, in math, reading, and science. Their parents, teachers, and principals were also surveyed. Most recently, the ECLS-K assessment was conducted in spring 2004, when most students were in the fifth grade. This current report summarizes patterns of children' s achievement in math, reading, and science-and patterns of children' s interest in school, sense of academic competence, and problem behaviors-in third grade. ECLS-K is one of a long line of longitudinal studies conducted by NCES to examine the associations among schooling policies and practices, family background and environment, individual characteristics, and educational and social outcomes (including educational achievement, educational attainment, and labor force outcomes). Most of these studies, however, have followed adolescent and young adult cohorts, beginning in middle school, high school, or college, and so have provided no evidence on educational patterns and processes in the early childhood and elementary school years. 1 ECLS-K is the first nationally representative longitudinal study focused on schooling processes and outcomes to begin with a cohort as young as kindergarten age. As such, it provides a rich source of data unmatched in any other extant dataset. If the early childhood years-particularly those that correspond with the early elementary grades-are crucial in shaping young children' s academic identities and skills, then it is essential that educators, policymakers, and researchers have access to reliable evidence about the educational and social factors that promote early reading and math skills, positive academic self-concepts, and strong social skills in the elementary school years. Moreover, the ability of ECLS-K to link students' achievement trajectories to a rich set of variables describing their educational contexts and experiences provides potentially valuable evidence for educators and policymakers regarding how best to structure schooling.\nIn summary, the broad picture of children' s involvement in activities during the summer after their kindergarten year shows substantial differences in participation by socioeconomic status (SES). Low SES children were the least likely SES group to participate in the summer activities investigated in this Issue Brief; high SES children were the most likely to participate in these same activities. Looking more closely at children' s summer library use reveals a more complicated picture. Low SES children were the least likely SES group to go to the library, and if they did go, they went less frequently than children in the other SES groups. However, low SES library visitors attended story time at levels as high as or higher than library visitors from other SES groups. The gap between the percentage of low and high SES children who visited the library was smaller for those children whose parents reported having a neighborhood library than for those children whose parents reported no neighborhood library. The list of summer activities investigated in this Issue Brief is by no means comprehensive, and further research could expand the list. Future research based on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study could improve our understanding of the linkages between summer activities, socioeconomic status, and academic achievement. Homeschooled Students in 2003 Stacey Bielick, and Chris Chapman \nFrom 1999 to 2003, the number of homeschooled students in the United States increased, as did the homeschooling rate. The increase in the homeschooling rate (from 1.7 percent to 2.2 percent) represents about 0.5 percent of the 2002-03 school-age population and a 29 percent relative increase over the 4-year period. While data from NHES cannot explain why homeschooling was more prevalent in 2003 than in 1999, it can provide insight into why parents homeschooled their children in 2003. 3 Parents may have homeschooled their children for a variety of reasons, but certain factors appear to have been more influential than others. Nearly two-thirds of homeschooled students had parents who said that their primary reason for homeschooling was either concern about the environment of other schools or a desire to provide religious or moral instruction. Data from NHES can also be used to examine the student, family, and household characteristics of homeschoolers. Upcoming reports will use these data to study the characteristics of homeschoolers, to compare the characteristics 3 Questions about reasons for homeschooling were asked differently in 1999 and 2003, and thus are not comparable.\nThe number of ELL students in the United States grew by about 900,000 students between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, but growth was not equal across regions. The Midwest, South, and West all showed an increase in the size of the ELL student population both in total and as a percentage of the total public school population. At the same time, the West had the largest population of public school students designated ELL, with more than half of the national total of ELL students in the 1999-2000 school year. Regional differences were apparent, as well, in terms of the concentration of ELL students in public schools, with ELL concentration most prevalent in the West. This Issue Brief provides a profile of the location and concentration of public school ELL students. The Schools and Staffing Survey can be used to address other questions regarding the education of ELL students, including the characteristics of the schools with high concentrations of ELL students. SASS also contains information on techniques used to teach ELL students, as well as the programs schools offer to ELL students. A closer examination of this topic could reveal whether regional differences in the concentration of ELL students in public schools translate into differences in educational services provided for ELL students. \nThis Issue Brief looked at the qualifications of elementarylevel reading teachers relative to general elementary teachers. There were about 29,000 public elementary-level reading specialists in 1999-2000, compared with approximately 32,000 other elementary teachers who reported teaching at least one reading class and 1 million general elementary education teachers. Public elementary school reading specialists differed from other elementary teachers on several measures of their assignments and educational backgrounds. Three-quarters of reading specialists held full-time positions and were more likely than other elementary teachers to have part-time or itinerant assignments. Reading specialists tended to teach pull-out classes, while other reading teachers were more likely to teach in departmentalized instruction assignments and general elementary education teachers were more likely to teach in self-contained classrooms. Reading specialists and other reading teachers were more likely to have master' s degrees than other elementary-level teachers. Reading specialists also tended to have more educational preparation in reading than other elementary teachers. Although reading specialists tended to have more educational preparation in reading than did the other teachers typically engaged in reading instruction, they tended not to have as much educational preparation as other teachers in their main assignments. Seastrom et al. (2002) listed several subjects in which higher percentages of teachers held majors and certifications in their main assignments in 2002 than did reading specialists. This Issue Brief provides an initial description of reading teachers and their assignments. It has not examined the school settings of teachers who specialize in reading instruction. Future analyses could examine the extent to which these teachers are employed in Title I or other schools with expected high need for specialized reading instruction."}, {"section_title": "Key Findings of the ECLS-K Report", "text": "Probably the single most useful aspect of ECLS-K is that it provides detailed, high-quality longitudinal achievement data for a nationally representative sample of elementary school students. These data enable researchers to examine, in detail, students' trajectories of cognitive development in math and reading. At present, available ECLS-K data span the first 4 years of schooling (K-3), although fifth-grade data have already been collected and are scheduled for release within the next year. Plans are being made to follow the sample through middle and high school, holding out the possibility that ECLS-K will be the first nationally representative dataset to contain longitudinal data from kindergarten through 12th grade. The availability of longitudinal achievement data for kindergarten through third grade yields powerful descriptive evidence about the development of cognitive skills during early elementary school. Variations in the rates at which children acquire different literacy and math skills allow us to observe both the development and/or narrowing of achievement gaps among demographic subgroups and the association of achievement trajectories with education policies and practices."}, {"section_title": "Racial/ethnic achievement gaps", "text": "One of the key findings of the ECLS-K report is that racial/ ethnic gaps in math and reading skills-which prior reports have shown to be large at the start of kindergarten (Fryer and Levitt 2004;West, Denton, and Reaney 2001)-remain large through third grade. In particular, Black students, who start kindergarten with average math and reading scores well below those of White, non-Hispanic students, make smaller gains in math and reading between kindergarten and third grade than do White, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander students. Early School Development Some, but not all, of the Black-White gap in third grade can be attributed to racial differences in family socioeconomic status. Prior research using ECLS-K data has shown that the Black-White gap in math and reading at the start of kindergarten can be attributed entirely to racial differences in family socioeconomic status (Fryer and Levitt 2004;Reardon 2003); this is no longer true, however, by third grade (Fryer and Levitt 2005). Black children have, on average, lower math and reading scores in third grade than do White children from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. This finding-that the Black-White achievement gap between socioeconomically similar children is null at kindergarten entry but sizable 2 by third grade-suggests that schooling plays some role in producing the achievement gap."}, {"section_title": "Invited Commentary: Examining Patterns of Development in Early Elementary School Using ECLS-K Data", "text": "The Black-White achievement gap has received considerable attention in the last decade (e.g., Jencks and Phillips 1998), but comparably less research has been done to understand the achievement trajectories of minority groups other than Blacks. One of the strengths of ECLS-K is its relatively large samples of Hispanic and Asian students. The ECLS-K report shows that Hispanic students' average math, reading, and science scores fall roughly midway between those of White and Black students, while Asian students, on average, have achievement levels similar to those of White students. There is, however, considerable heterogeneity in both Hispanic and Asian students' achievement trajectories, some of which is related to differences in, for example, English proficiency, country of origin, and immigrant generation (Galindo and Reardon 2004). Given the growth of the immigrant population in the United States, a better understanding of the factors that contribute to educational success for Hispanic, Asian, and other immigrant groups is essential. No nationally representative longitudinal dataset other than ECLS-K includes such large samples of immigrant students."}, {"section_title": "School mobility", "text": "Another important topic addressed in the report is school mobility. The report indicates that 49 percent of 1998-99 first-time kindergarteners had changed schools at least once by the spring of third grade; 10 percent had changed schools two or more times in the first 4 years of schooling. Students change schools in the elementary grades for a variety of reasons, including family residential moves, school district policies (some districts have separate kindergarten and elementary grade schools, so all students must change schools at the start of kindergarten), and moves between the public and private schooling sectors. Moreover, some stu-dents change schools between grades, while others change schools during the school year. Midyear school transitions associated with residential moves-particularly residential moves due to family income instability-are likely to have the most detrimental effect on children' s achievement trajectories. While the report does not examine these issues, the substantial school mobility it documents suggests the need for a better understanding of the associations among residential mobility, school mobility, and education outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Achievement differences between public and private schools", "text": "The report also addresses the association between patterns of achievement and public/private school enrollment. It calls attention to the finding that students enrolled in private schools from kindergarten through third grade have, on average, higher levels of literacy and math skills than students enrolled in public schools. This finding is accurate, but should not be taken to imply that private schools have a causal effect on learning, since, as the report notes in its conclusion, private school students also have higher average achievement scores when they enter kindergarten and show gains equal to those of public school students during the period from kindergarten through third grade (West, Denton, and Reaney 2001). Thus, it is likely that most, if not all, of the public/private school differences in third-grade achievement are attributable to differences in skill levels between the populations of students entering schools in each sector, rather than to differences in the average quality of public and private schools."}, {"section_title": "Student perceptions about school", "text": "Finally, the report describes patterns of student responses to the ECLS-K self-description questionnaire (SDQ). The SDQ was administered to ECLS-K students for the first time in third grade, and measured students' perceptions about their academic competence, peer relations, and problem behaviors. Perhaps the most notable finding in this section of the report is that there are very few significant differences in students' perceptions of their competence by race or family background; in general, most students report generally positive interest and competence in school. This suggests that any racial differences in motivation and academic selfconcept that are observed in high school must arise after the early elementary grades. Subsequent waves of data from ECLS-K may shed light on the evolution of academic selfconcept and attitudes toward schooling through the later elementary grades and middle school. Although there are few substantial group differences in selfreported academic interest or competence in third grade, the SDQ does reveal significant differences in peer relationships and problem behaviors by race. Black students reported substantially higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors than did White students. More investigation of these patterns is certainly warranted, as they may have deleterious effects on students' subsequent achievement."}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "text": "In order to provide policymakers, educators, and the public with the most useful education policy analyses, education researchers should provide both (1) careful descriptive analyses of educational environments, experiences, and outcomes (think of this as \"educational epidemiology,\" a tool that enables researchers and policymakers to focus attention where the least is known and the most intervention is needed); and (2) research and evaluation methods that enable us to make strong causal inferences about the impacts of education practices and policies. One of the strengths of longitudinal observational education studies such as ECLS-K is that they provide a detailed descriptive picture of the achievement trajectories and educational experiences of a nationally representative sample of a specific cohort of students. As education is a developmental enterprise, detailed longitudinal descriptive analyses of achievement trajectories and the development of academic and social behaviors are an essential part of any useful \"educational epidemiology.\" The corresponding drawback of studies such as ECLS-K is that they do not readily enable researchers and policymakers to draw strong causal inferences about the effects of specific education practices and policies. The finding that students enrolled in private schools have higher achievement scores than students enrolled in public schools, for example, likely reflects simply the selection of students from more advantaged backgrounds into private schools rather than a causal effect of private schooling on achievement. That \"correlation does not imply causality\" must be taken seriously in all analyses of studies such as ECLS-K. That said, it is possible to learn something about the effects of schooling practices and policies on achievement (or other schooling outcomes) by analyzing the data from longitudinal observational studies such as ECLS-K. Researchers might take advantage of natural experiments evident in the data, or use instrumental variables; matching estimators; regression discontinuity; school-, classroom-, and student-fixed effects; difference-in-difference estimators; or other econometric techniques to identify some plausibly exogenous variations in classroom, school, district, or state education practices and policies. In the absence of randomized experiments (which are often infeasible or unethical in many areas of education research), researchers can-and should-use ECLS-K and other large longitudinal observational datasets to provide whatever strong evidence can be gleaned regarding the effects of education practices and policies. This, in combination with detailed descriptive analyses of the sort provided in From Kindergarten Through Third Grade, will help ensure that our education practices develop in line with our best knowledge of effective practices. Children enter kindergarten showing wide achievement gaps by family socioeconomic status (SES) (Coley 2002; Lee and Burkam 2002). 1 A number of studies suggest that achievement gaps grow during the summer months when children are away from school (Heyns 1978;Cooper et al. 1996;Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson 2001). This finding may be related to a number of factors, including differences in children' s summer activities; children may differ by SES group in the extent to which they have the opportunity to engage in activities that reinforce school learning or broaden knowledge more generally-activities such as reading, attending library programs, or visiting museums. However, we know relatively little about the extent to which children actually differ by SES group in their engagement in these kinds of activities during the summer months.    Library use also varied by parental report of neighborhood library availability. Compared to children whose parents reported having no neighborhood library, children whose parents reported a neighborhood library were more likely to visit a library at least once over the summer (70 percent compared to 47 percent). In addition, children who visited the library over the summer went more frequently if their parents reported having a neighborhood library (7 times on average compared to 5 times on average). These two relationships held for low and middle SES children. Parental report of neighborhood library availability varied by SES; low SES parents (64 percent) were less likely than middle SES parents (81 percent) to report having a neighborhood library, and both groups were less likely than high SES parents (91 percent) to do so."}, {"section_title": "Library Use by SES and Neighborhood Library Availability", "text": "Another way to examine the data in table 2 is to look at how children' s library use varies by household SES while taking into account parental reports of neighborhood library availability. Among children whose parents reported no neighborhood library, low SES children were the least likely to visit the library (31 percent) while high SES children were the most likely to do so (72 percent). In addition, when no neighborhood library was reported, low SES library visitors went less frequently, on average, than middle or high SES library visitors (4 times compared to 5 and 6 times, respectively). These relationships also held among children whose parents reported having a neighborhood library. However, the difference between the percentage of low and high SES children who visited the library was smaller in neighborhoods with a library than in those without one (26 percentage point gap compared to 41 percent-age point gap). Among children whose parents reported no neighborhood library, low SES library visitors attended story time at higher levels than high SES library visitors (28 percent compared to 15 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2003", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "This article was originally published as an Issue Brief.

HBCUs are institutions established prior to 1964, whose principal mission is the education of Black Americans. Although most HBCUs are 4-year institutions in the southern United States, they represent a diverse set of institutions in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. They are both public and private; single-sex and coeducational; predominantly Black and predominantly White; 2-year and 4-year colleges; research universities, professional schools, community colleges, and small liberal arts colleges. Three colleges for Blacks were established before 1862. Cheyney University of Pennsylvania was established in the 1830s. Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Wilberforce College in Ohio were established in the 1850s. In 1862, the first land-grant college provisions, known as the First Morrill Act, were enacted by Congress. By the late 1860s, Morrill Act funds were distributed to the states, with the intention that they would foster educational opportunity for all students, especially newly freed Blacks. Congress passed the Second Morrill Act in 1890, which required states with dual systems of higher education (all-White and non-White) to provide land-grant institutions for both systems. Nineteen land-grant institutions for Blacks were organized and were initially non-degree-granting agricultural, mechanical, and industrial schools. In 1965, Congress introduced its institutional aid program for HBCUs (20 USC 1060). This E.D. TAB report presents tabular data on institution enrollment, degrees conferred, staff and salaries, revenues, expenditures, and student financial aid.\nThis report attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of total federal financial support for education since fiscal year (FY) 1980.* In addition to U.S. Department of Education programs, the many other federal programs that support education are included. The report also includes other types of federal support that are sometimes overlooked."}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) is a 1-year followup of a sample of approximately 8,400 teachers who were originally selected for the teacher component in the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The Schools and Staffing Survey is an integrated set of surveys of public and private schools, principals, teachers, library media centers, and public school districts throughout the United States of America. There have been four data cycles for the Schools and Staffing Survey, and likewise, four Teacher Follow-up Surveys. The 2000-01 Teacher Follow-up Survey data in this report link responses from the 2000-01 school year to characteristics of those same teachers who participated in SASS during the 1999-2000 school year. Within this report, there are some data that are drawn directly from the 1999-2000 SASS. These data are termed \"base-year\" because the SASS sample is the \"base\" for the teachers who are selected for the Teacher Follow-up Survey. Base-year characteristics include personal and professional descriptors of the teacher (age, sex, race/ethnicity, teaching assignment field), as well as characteristics of the school in which the teachers worked in 1999-2000 (whether the school was public or private, region of the country in which the school was located, and the community type or locale of the school). These \"base-year\" characteristics provide the context for the data collected in the Teacher Follow-up Survey. The purpose of the Teacher Follow-up Survey is to provide information about teacher mobility and attrition. For example, how do teachers who remain teaching at the same school from year to year (\"stayers\") compare with those who do not? How many teachers move from one school to another school (\"movers\")? What percentage of teachers leave the profession between one year and the next (\"leavers\")? These types of questions can be answered with data from the Teacher Follow-up Survey. For teachers who leave the profession, TFS asks about their occupational status (are former teachers working, retired, or caring for family members?) or whether they are seeking further education, and reasons for leaving teaching, as well as recommendations for how schools might retain teachers. Those who remain in teaching are asked about changes in teaching assignment, opinions about retaining teachers, and retirement plans. Teachers who move from one school to another are asked to describe the type of school to which they moved. Furthermore, data from the Teacher Follow-up Survey can be used to compare attrition and mobility across the public and private school sectors. Approximately 3,300 stayers, 2,200 movers, and 2,800 leavers were included in the initial 2000-01 Teacher Follow-up Survey sample. A questionnaire for former teachers was mailed to leavers, while stayers and movers were mailed a separate questionnaire for current teachers.

Why do teachers move or leave? Where do these teachers go? A set of tables with data from the 2000-01 Teacher Follow-up Survey is presented for each question. The first section, \"Who is most likely to move or leave?,\" presents basic information on base-year (1999-2000) teachers who left the teaching profession (\"leavers\"), as well as corresponding characteristics of teachers who remained in their base-year schools (\"stayers\") or who moved to another school to teach during the 2000-01 school year (\"movers\"). The number and percentage of stayers, movers, and leavers are reported along a number of selected teacher, school, and job characteristics, as well as teachers' plans to remain in teaching, as reported in SASS in 1999-2000. This section also includes the average income levels of stayers, movers, and leavers during the 1999-2000 school year. The second section, \"Why do teachers move or leave?,\" includes current and former teachers' satisfaction with their base-year schools; their perceptions of the administrators, instructional leaders, and staff at their base-year schools; and the reasons movers and leavers gave for leaving the school in which they taught in 1999-2000. Finally, the section titled \"Where do teachers go when they move or leave?\" reports the current main occupational status of former teachers, as well as how those teachers perceived their current jobs relative to their former teaching positions. The percentage of base-year teachers moving across schools, school districts, and sectors is also considered in this section, as are data on base-year teachers who retired from the teaching profession between the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years. Many of the tables found in this report present findings by a set of selected teacher and school characteristics. Included among these characteristics are the sector (public or private) and level of the school (elementary, secondary, or combined-grade) at which the respondent taught during the 1999-2000 school year, the main assignment field (e.g., mathematics, science) and teaching status (full-time or part-time) of the respondent in 1999-2000, and the current or former teachers' years of teaching experience, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Public school teachers include those who teach in public charter schools as well as in traditional public schools."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "Who is most likely to move or leave? \u25a0 Between the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years, 85 percent of all public school teachers remained at the same school, 8 percent moved to a different school, and 7 percent left the teaching profession. A higher proportion of public school teachers left the profession between the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years compared to the 1990-91 to 1991-92 and 1987-88 to 1988-89 school years. \u25a0 Between 1999-2000 and 2000-01, private school teachers were more likely to leave teaching (13 percent) than their public school counterparts (7 percent). Conversely, public school teachers were more likely to stay, and 8 percent of the teachers in both sectors moved. \u25a0 Public and private school teachers with fewer than 10 years of teaching experience were more likely than their more experienced colleagues to move to a different school between the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years. Additionally, private school teachers with 1 to 3 years of experience were more likely to leave the profession than more experienced teachers. \u25a0 Public and private school teachers who were younger than age 30 were also more likely to move than older teachers in both sectors (table A). In public and private schools, respectively, 16 percent and 13 percent of teachers who were less than 30 years old transferred to another school. Public school teachers who were older than 50 years of age or younger than 30 years of age were more likely to leave the teaching profession after 1999-2000 than other public school teachers, while private school teachers younger than 30 years old were also more likely to leave than their older counterparts.

Additionally, both public school movers and leavers were more likely to earn less than $30,000 (23 percent and 21 percent, respectively) compared to public school stayers (16 percent). Similar trends appear among private school teachers. For example, 69 percent of private school leavers and 68 percent of movers reported earning less than $30,000 in annual income, compared to 54 percent of private school stayers.* \u25a0 Many public and private school leavers did not plan to leave the teaching profession when asked during the base year. Twenty-seven percent of public school leavers and 40 percent of private school leavers stated in 1999-2000 that they planned to remain in teaching as long as they were able. Nineteen percent and 32 percent of public and private school leavers, respectively, were undecided about their future plans to remain in teaching when asked during the base year."}, {"section_title": "Why do teachers move or leave?", "text": "\u25a0 Among the reasons that public school teachers gave in 2000-01 for moving to a new school were an opportunity for a better teaching assignment (40 percent), dissatisfaction with support from administrators (38 percent), and dissatisfaction with workplace conditions (32 percent). \u25a0 Like public school movers, private school movers frequently cited an opportunity for a better teaching assignment (42 percent) and dissatisfaction with support from administrators (41 percent) as reasons for changing schools following the 1999-2000 school year. However, private school movers more frequently reported changing schools to obtain a better salary or benefits (48 percent) than public school movers (19 percent). \u25a0 Twenty-nine percent of public school leavers reported in 2000-01 that they left the teaching profession in order to retire and about 20 percent each reported that they left to pursue another career and obtain a better salary or benefits. Private school leavers also frequently reported that they left teaching to pursue another career (31 percent) or obtain a better salary or benefits (28 percent). However, private school leavers were less likely than public school teachers to report that they left in order to retire (11 percent). \u25a0 Among public and private school teachers who left the teaching profession between 1999-2000 and 2000-01, larger percentages of women than men cited pregnancy/child rearing and health as very important or extremely important reasons in their decision to leave teaching. Conversely, men were more likely than women to report leaving their public or private school teaching position for a better salary or benefits, to pursue another career, or to take courses to improve their career opportunities within or outside the field of education. \u25a0 One-half of all black, non-Hispanic public school leavers in 2000-01 cited retirement as a very or extremely important reason in their decision to leave teaching, compared to 28 percent of white leavers. Black, non-Hispanic public school leavers (44 percent) were also more likely to report that they left teaching to pursue a better salary or benefits than white, non-Hispanic (17 percent), Hispanic (13 percent), and American Indian or Asian (13 percent) leavers. \u25a0 Of public school teachers who left teaching after the 1999-2000 school year and who were drawing a pension in 2000-01, about three-quarters indicated that their eligibility to receive full pension benefits was a very or extremely important factor in their decision to retire. Eligibility for an early retirement incentive was also an important factor in the decision to retire for about one-quarter (27 percent) of these former teachers. \u25a0 Public school movers were generally more likely to report dissatisfaction with their teaching experience in their former school than public school leavers (table B). For example, movers were more likely to report that they were not satisfied with their salary at their 1999-2000 school (29 percent) than leavers (22 percent). Additionally, public school movers were more likely to report that student behavior was a problem (25 percent) than leavers (13 percent). \u25a0 A comparison of private school movers' and leavers' levels of satisfaction with aspects of their 1999-2000 school shows that movers were less satisfied than leavers with the salary and benefits they received (table B). Private school movers were also more likely than leavers to report that they had neither enough NOTE: Movers are teachers who were still teaching in the current school year but had moved to a different school after the previous school year.

Percentage of public and private school teacher movers and leavers who strongly agreed or strongly disagreed with various statements about their former schools: 2000-01 influence over the school' s policies and practices nor enough autonomy and control over the classroom in 1999-2000. \u25a0 Movers were more critical of the instructional leader at their 1999-2000 school than stayers, in both public and private schools, on all eight measures included in the Teacher Follow-up Survey. Public school movers were also less likely than leavers to report that their 1999-2000 instructional leader was very or extremely effective at communicating respect and value of teachers, encouraging teachers to change teaching methods if students were not doing well, encouraging professional collaboration among teachers, and working with teaching staff to solve school or department problems. Private school movers were more critical of their previous year' s instructional leader than private school leavers on one measure: encouraging teachers to change teaching methods if students were not doing well. \u25a0 Private school movers and leavers were less likely than private school stayers to rate their former instructional leader as being effective on a variety of measures. For example, 66 percent of stayers, 41 percent of movers, and 46 percent of leavers reported that their instructional leader was effective at encouraging professional collaboration among teachers in the 1999-2000 school year. Sixty-three percent of stayers, 39 percent of movers, and 40 percent of leavers reported that their instructional leader was very or extremely effective at facilitating and encouraging professional development activities of teachers. Additionally, 70 percent of stayers reported that their instructional leader was very or extremely effective at communicating respect and value of teachers compared to 52 percent of movers and 61 percent of leavers. \u25a0 Movers were generally less satisfied than stayers with their former school' s administrators and staff. For example, fewer public and private school movers strongly agreed that there was a great deal of cooperative effort among staff members at their 1999-2000 school compared to public and private school stayers. Where do teachers go when they move or leave? \u25a0 Between the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 school years, private school movers were much more likely to transfer to the public school sector (53 percent) than public school movers were to transfer to the private school sector (2 percent). Additionally, switching to the public school sector was more common among private school teachers with less than 5 years' experience (61 percent) than among those with 5 or more years' experience (48 percent). \u25a0 About half (53 percent) of public school movers chose to move to a public school in a different school district for the 2000-01 school year, while 45 percent moved to a different school but remained in the same public school district. \u25a0 Public school leavers were most likely to specify \"retired\" as their main occupational status in 2000-01 (28 percent), whereas private school leavers were most likely to report that they were working in an occupation outside the field of education (30 percent) or were caring for family members (24 percent). About 20 percent of public school leavers and 14 percent of private school leavers continued to work in a K-12 school in 2000-01, but were no longer teaching. \u25a0 Of leavers who reported that their main occupational status in 2000-01 was working, private school leavers (67 percent) were more likely than public school leavers (32 percent) to be employed in the private sector. Fifty-nine percent and 23 percent of public and private school leavers whose main occupational status was working, respectively, reported being employed by the local, state, or federal government. \u25a0 Leavers who were working in a nonteaching position in 2000-01 were asked to compare their current position to their 1999-2000 teaching position on 17 occupational characteristics, like salary, intellectual challenge, availability of resources, and recognition and support from administrators or managers (table C). Of leavers who did not report \"no difference\" between the two positions, public school leavers indicated that 15 of the 17 characteristics were better in their current position than in teaching, with the exception of benefits and job security. Similarly, private school leavers were more likely to report that 16 of the 17 characteristics were better in their current position than better in teaching. There was no statistically significant difference in whether job security was better in one position or another. \u25a0 In comparing their new positions with teaching, half or more of both public and private school leavers who selected working as their main occupational status reported that the manageability of their workload, opportunities for professional advancement, professional prestige, and general work conditions were  (table C). Private school leavers were more likely to report that they received a better salary in their current position (65 percent) than were public school leavers (44 percent).

This task is assigned to general elementary teachers who teach reading as one of many subjects taught during the day, as well as to teachers assigned specifically to teach reading. This Issue Brief presents a description of the teachers who provide reading instruction in public elementary schools. Specifically, it presents 1999-2000 school-year estimates of the number of public general elementary school teachers, public elementary school teachers who taught reading as a main assignment, and any other elementary teachers who taught at least one reading class. This Issue Brief also describes these three groups of teachers in terms of their educational preparation in reading and elementary education. Data are taken from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) teacher survey.

Estimates are presented on the percentage of teachers who have postsecondary majors or state certifications in reading and elementary education. Major and certification in the subject of their main teaching assignment from the 1999-2000 SASS have previously been used as indicators of teacher qualifications (Seastrom et al. 2002).

About three out of four (73 percent) reading specialists taught \"pull-out\" classes. In other words, they taught students who were excused from their regular classes for sessions of reading instruction. Eleven percent or less of reading specialists taught in each of the four other arrangements: self-contained classrooms in which they taught the same children all day long (11 percent); team-teaching arrangements in which they collaborated with other teachers in teaching multiple subjects to the same classroom of children (6 percent); elementary enrichment classes in which they taught only reading, ----------------------------------David Meyer and Daniel J.

Shafer ..................................................................59 Undergraduate Student Aid The decade of the 1990s saw growth in tuition at the postsecondary level and in the amount of financial aid available, particularly student loans (U.S. General Accounting Office 1998; The College Board 2002). Since public funding was constrained in the early part of the decade, tuition increases were of growing concern. At the same time, federal financial aid programs and policies as we know them today were being shaped by the 1992 Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA-92). Growth in tuition, the increased availability of federal student loans (especially unsubsidized Stafford loans), and increases in grant aid from nonfederal sources were among the major driving forces of change in undergraduate student financing during this decade. This study examines changes in many of the major aspects of undergraduate financing during the 1990s for full-time, full-year undergraduates enrolled in the four major institutional sectors located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico: public 2-year, public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and private for-profit less-than-4-year. Tuition, total price of attendance, various net price measures, need, total aid, remaining need after aid, grants, loans, and work-study 1 are compared using data from the four National Postsecondary Student Aid Studies (NPSAS 2 ) conducted in 1989-1990, 1992-1993, 1995-1996, and 1999-2000. The main purpose of this report is to provide a convenient and readily accessible reference to the data most frequently used for trend analysis from the NPSAS surveys."}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "During the 1990s, tuition increased faster than inflation and median household income (U.S. General Accounting Office 1996,1998). Financial aid also increased, particularly in the form of federal loans. HEA-92 was a defining moment in the history of federal financial aid because it established the direction in which the federal government would support 1 Federal tax subsidies provided through the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits are not included as financial aid. This study focuses only on the types of assistance that are offered as part of a student's financial aid package. 2 NPSAS is a nationwide study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) primarily to determine how undergraduate and graduate students and their families pay for postsecondary education. For more information on NPSAS surveys, consult the NPSAS website at http://nces. ed.gov/npsas. postsecondary education in subsequent years. 3 As a result of its passage, many middle-income students who were previously ineligible for need-based student aid were able to receive it, primarily in the form of subsidized student loans. HEA-92 also increased the amounts students were permitted to borrow and for the first time allowed dependent students to take out federally guaranteed unsubsidized loans. NPSAS data from 1989-90 and 1992-93 reflect the federal financial aid policies in effect prior to HEA-92, while the 1995-96 and 1999-2000 data reflect the changes introduced by that legislation. Between 1989Between -90 and 1999Between -2000, the average net tuition (tuition minus grant aid) 4 increased at public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, indicating that among those types of institutions, increases in grant aid did not keep pace with increases in tuition over time. As the decade progressed, the proportion of full-time 5 undergraduates who received any type of financial aid (grants, loans, work-study, or other) increased among all of the institutional sectors included in this study, from an overall average of 60 percent to 74 percent between 1989-90 and 1999-2000 (figure A). Among those who received aid, the percentage of the price of attendance that was covered by any type of aid also increased over time, from 47 percent to 54 percent. Increases between 1989-90 and 1999-2000 were seen in the percentage of students who received at least one of the two major types of aid: grants (51 percent to 60 percent) and loans (36 percent to 47 percent) (figure B). Single parents, however, were one group of students for whom financial aid declined. While as many as 94 percent of single parents who were enrolled full time received some form of financial aid in 1989-90, the proportion had dropped to 79 percent by 1999-2000. 6 This may have reflected several changes in the characteristics of single parents enrolled full time in postsecondary education. Between 1989Between -90 and 1999Between -2000, the average expected family con-tribution (EFC) among single parents had increased from $800 to $1,300 even though it had decreased among all independent students with incomes at or below the median. In 1989-90, about one-half (48 percent) of all single parents worked while they were enrolled full time; in 1999-2000, this proportion had increased to about three-fourths (77 percent). 7 While 87 percent of single parents were females in 1989-90, this proportion had dropped to 76 percent in 1999-2000. The socioeconomic backgrounds of single parents also appear to have changed. 1995-96, about 35 to 38 percent had a parent with at least some postsecondary education; in 1999-2000, about one-half (51 percent) of all single parents came from families with one or more parents who had some postsecondary education. 8 In addition, the proportion of single parents receiving public assistance while enrolled full time decreased from 34 percent in 1995-96 to 9 percent in 1999-2000. Compared to the earlier years, single parents enrolled full time at the end of the decade were less likely to be receiving public assistance, more likely to have parents with some postsecondary education, and more likely to be working while they were enrolled. These changes may have been related to a reduced eligibility for need-based financial aid among single parents. Among the different types of financial aid that are available to postsecondary students, the growth in federal unsubsidized loans has been most prominent. 9 After the restriction on dependent students was lifted by HEA-92, the overall rate at which full-time undergraduates borrowed unsubsidized loans increased from 3 percent to 23 percent between 1989-90 and 1999-2000. 10 However, the inclusion of dependent students was not the sole driving force behind this increase. Independent undergraduates also were more likely to borrow federal unsubsidized loans in 1999-2000 than in 1989-90 (35 percent vs. 11 percent).

The definitions are as follows: \"total price of attendance\" (or \"student budget\") is equal to tuition plus estimated living expenses; \"net tuition\" is defined as tuition minus total grants received (up to the tuition amount) 11 ; \"net price of attendance\" is the total price of attendance minus all grants and loans received; \"financial need\" is equal to the total price of attendance minus the federal EFC-which is the federal estimate of the student' s and family' s ability to pay based on the formula (need analysis) prescribed by law; and \"remaining financial need\" (or \"unmet need\") is the amount of financial need that remains after all financial aid, including loans, is subtracted from the total financial need. The two net price variables used in this study-net tuition and net price of attendance-measure the different levels of cost to students and families. The net tuition variable (tuition and fees minus grant aid) represents the amount of tuition paid after grants are received, while the net price of attendance (price of attendance minus all grant and loan aid) represents the amount paid for both tuition and living expenses after all aid is taken into account. Researchers who are interested in changes in tuition and grant aid can utilize the \"net tuition\" variables included in this report for further study. Because net tuition is equal to the amount of tuition that is paid after all grants have been received, and does not subtract loans, it represents the amount of tuition for which students and families are responsible. In some cases, however, grants will exceed the amount of tuition (and would therefore be used to offset the cost of living), resulting in a negative net tuition amount. In calculating the average net tuition, all negative net tuition values were set to zero. In 1999-2000, the percentage of full-time, full-year undergraduates with zero net tuition was 5 percent at private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions, 12 percent at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, 26 percent at public 4-year institutions, and 34 percent at public 2-year institutions. Analysis of changes in the net price of attendance can help determine whether total aid-which includes loans that must be repaid-has kept up with changes in total price over time. However, the net price of attendance does not equal the actual price that must be paid for a postsecondary education because loans were subtracted from the total price to achieve this estimate. While grants reduce the amount to be paid, loans only postpone the actual cost since loans must be repaid eventually and with interest. The net price of attendance represents only the immediate, out-of-pocket costs upon enrollment. The actual cost of a postsecondary education over the lifetime of the student (or parent) who has taken out a loan will be higher. Any increases or decreases in average net price should be viewed with caution. A reduction in net price over time may only signify that students and/or parents have taken out more loans rather than received more grant aid or paid less in tuition. Dependency and income are important considerations when financial aid is awarded. Most students under age 24 are dependent, and their income quartiles are based on their parents' income. Most independent students are 24 or older, and their income quartiles are based on their own income (and that of their spouse, if married). In addition, independent students are disaggregated by their marital status and whether they had children, factors that are also considered in determining financial aid eligibility. In this report, comparisons of average amounts over time are made using constant (1999) dollars. In most cases, comparisons in constant (1999) dollars were made only between the two survey years at the beginning and end of the decade (1989-90 and 1999-2000), although estimates from the interim NPSAS years (1992-93 and 1995-96) are presented to provide the reader with complete information.
