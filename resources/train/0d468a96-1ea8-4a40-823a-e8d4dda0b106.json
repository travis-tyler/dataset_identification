[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation in the pre-dementia stage facilitates the selection of appropriate measures for early detection and disease progression. Objective: To examine the trajectories of cognitive performance, gray matter volume (GMV), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, together with the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in subjects with amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposits across the pre-clinical to dementia stages of AD. Methods: 356 subjects were dichotomized into A\u2424+ and A\u2424\u2212 groups based on their CSF A\u2424 1-42 level. We derived AD-related atrophic regions (AD-ROIs) using the voxel-based morphometry approach. We characterized the trajectories of cognitive scores, GMV at AD-ROIs, and CSF biomarkers from preclinical to disease stages in A\u2424+ subjects. The effect of APOE 4 genotype on these trajectories was examined. Results: Impairments in executive functioning/processing speed (EF/PS) and atrophy at the right supramarginal/inferior parietal gyrus were detected in cognitively normal A\u2424+ subjects. Together with the APOE 4 carrier status, these measures showed potential to identify cognitively normal elderly with abnormal CSF A\u2424 1-42 level in another independent cohort. Subsequently, impairment in memory, visuospatial, language, and attention as well as atrophy in the temporal lobe, thalamus, and mid-cingulate cortex were detectable in A\u2424+ mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. In MCI and dementia A\u2424+ subjects, 4 carriers had more severe atrophy of the medial temporal lobe and memory impairment but higher EF/PS compared to non-carriers. Conclusions: EF/PS decline and right parietal atrophy might act as non-invasive screening tests for abnormal amyloid deposition in cognitively normal elderly. APOE modulation on subsequent trajectories in cognition and atrophy should be taken into account when analyzing disease progression."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the underlying pathology for dementia of the Alzheimer's type, a neurodegenerative process characterized by a gradual onset of cognitive decline in memory as well as nonmemory domains [1] . Clinical AD is categorized into three disease stages: cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia [2] . In the CN stage, pathology predominantly exists in the neocortical area, in the form of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposits while pathology in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is still minimal [3] . These A\u2424 deposits were present years before the onset of dementia [4] . As ongoing clinical trials in the disease-modifying treatment target the pre-dementia stage of the disease [5] , the knowledge of biomarkers and cognitive changes in early AD is crucial for quantifying disease progression.\nA comprehensive review paper by Twamley and colleagues [6] on 91 papers concerning neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings in pre-dementia AD revealed that decline in episodic memory and attention, medial temporal lobe atrophy, and hypoperfusion in temporoparietal areas were the most consistent findings during the preclinical stage of AD. Most evidence supported deficits in the attention domain and volumetric differences in the parietal and posterior cingulate in the MCI stage of the disease [6] . However, findings on the pre-dementia stage of AD still vary and remain largely inconclusive. Although additional deficits in executive functioning [7] [8] [9] and language [10] have been reported in the pre-dementia stage, a previous study by Goldman et al. did not find any cognitive decline in preclinical AD [11] . The inconsistencies of these findings could possibly be explained by its limitations. Most previous studies relied on the clinical criteria of AD that poses difficulties such as the requirement for subjects to already be in the dementia stage and the lack of diagnostic accuracy [12] . Emerging studies on pre-dementia AD depended on prospective conversions to dementia to identify subjects, which were at risk of misclassifying subjects with long conversion times [6, 9, 13, 14] . Studies with autopsy verification are few with relatively small sample sizes [6, 8, 11] . Additionally, the neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging experiments employed in previous studies mostly focused on memory domains and the medial temporal lobe, with less emphasis on other cognitive domains and other brain regions [6] .\nApolipoprotein E (APOE) influences the risk of sporadic AD [15] . APOE has been shown to alter AD manifestations, with APOE 4 allele carriers having greater MTL atrophy and memory decline compared to non-carriers [16] [17] [18] [19] . On the other hand, Geroldi and collaborators reported non-carriers having greater frontal lobe atrophy [16] and van der Vlies et al. and Wolk et al. showed non-carriers having greater cognitive decline in non-memory domains such as executive or verbal functions [20, 21] . However, controversy remains with Drzezga et al. showing no significant difference between carriers and non-carriers in regional brain atrophy [22] and the Agosta et al. study which found greater atrophy in the bilateral parietal cortex and right hippocampus in carriers but no difference in cognitive profiles [23] . Several studies have investigated the effects of APOE on brain atrophy and cognition in pre-dementia subjects with pathological amyloid deposition. Findings by Ellis et al. and Goldman et al. did not support the influence of APOE on modifying the progression of the disease in the preclinical stage [10, 13] .\nThere is therefore a need for further refinement of current knowledge on the AD manifestation process and the influence of APOE with regards to brain atrophy, cognitive decline in various domains, and biomarkers, especially in the pre-dementia stage. In the present study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u2424 1-42 was used to identify subjects with pathological A\u2424 deposits with high accuracy [24, 25] , enabling disease analysis in the early stage. We aim to examine the trajectories of five cognitive domains, gray matter volumes, and CSF tau/p-tau level from CN to mild dementia stage. With the observed pathological changes in the pre-dementia stage of disease [3] , we hypothesized that atrophy first take places in vulnerable neocortical areas during the CN stage before MTL atrophy occurs. Specifically, we previously found an area in the parietal cortex to be the epicenter of AD that could be the initial site of disease manifestation in the CN stage [26] . In addition, we also hypothesized that in our cohort, APOE 4 carriers would have greater impairment in memory and MTL atrophy compared to non-carriers in the dementia and pre-dementia stages of the disease."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative protocol", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership.\nThe primary goal of ADNI is to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as to reduce the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects were recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but following ADNI, there were ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date, these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults with an age range of 55 to 90 to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option of whether they want to be followed-up in ADNI-2.

First, a study-specific template and priors were created from images from all subjects to minimize spatial normalization and segmentation errors using the DARTEL toolbox.

This finding favored the concept of abnormal A\u2424 deposition as a prequel for tauopathy in AD. We also found that the CSF A\u2424 level reached a plateau early during the preclinical stage, while CSF tau and p-tau level rose during the pre-dementia stages and during the dementia stage, consistent with the extant literature [33] .\nBy the a-MCI stage, all five cognitive domains were impaired and all the regions of AD-ROIs showed atrophy. This finding is consistent with the current evidence in the literature [34] and serves to emphasize that multi-domain cognitive decline and multiple regional atrophy are common findings even in the pre-dementia stage.

The finding of the decline in EF/PS is consistent with the longitudinal study conducted by Johnson and colleagues with 444 subjects [35] . They found the decline in visuospatial ability to be the earliest disease manifestation in preclinical AD before the decline of memory. They measured 'visuospatial' ability using the Block Design and Digit Symbol subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, TMT A, and Form D (copy) of the Benton Visual Retention Scale, which partially overlapped with our ES/PS measures.\nThe right SMG/IPG AD-ROI corresponds spatially with the proposed epicenter of AD, which we previously hypothesized to be the possible initial site of disease manifestation [26] . The hub-like nature of the right SMG/IPG, in other words, having large number of connections to other brain regions, might produce activity-dependent 'wear and tear' or increase amyloid production that heightens its early vulnerability to amyloid deposition [36] . Previous histopathological studies of cognitively normal elderly with CDR of 0 [3, 37] showed that the neocortical histopathology of the A\u2424+ CN group is likely to consist of amyloid plaques of the diffuse or neuritic type but with an insignificant amount of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). There are numerous studies describing various neurotoxic effects of A\u2424 in various forms [38] . A recent fMRI study also found disruptions in the brain default mode network in cognitively normal subjects with brain A\u2424 deposits [39] . All of these were suggestive of a causal association between neocortical A\u2424 deposition with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in pre-clinical AD. A recent review on clinical pathologic correlation (CPC) studies [40] reported that most CPC studies found a significant correlation between antemortem cognitive impairment and neocortical A\u2424 plaques as well as neocortical NFTs, in the absence of other diseases that could affect cognitive status. In the more advanced stages of the AD, the neuroanatomic distribution of NFTs correlate with locations of neuronal death and with the cognitive domains affected. It is well established that the degree of cognitive impairment was associated with the severity of neocortical NFT pathology in dementia stage of AD. That neurodegeneration and cognitive decline could occur in relative absence of NFTs importantly raises the possibility of an in vivo amyloid neurotoxic pathway independent of NFT formation that is significant in the pre-dementia stage of the disease. A recent longitudinal analysis of preclinical AD subjects further found accelerated neocortical degeneration in the preclinical stage of AD [41] , which is consistent with our findings.\nUsing logistic regression modeling, EF/PS score and APOE carrier status were shown to be significant variables in the classification of A\u2424+ deposits in cognitively normal elderly in the ADNI-1 cohort. More importantly, results from the ADNI-2 cohort further validated the model and possibly indicated the right SMG/IPG GMV as a significant predictor. The use of the EF/PS measure, APOE genotyping, and GMV of the right SMG/IPG of AD-ROIs has the potential to be a relatively non-invasive screening tool for individual at risk of future AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2+ APOE 4 carriers had more severe MTL atrophy", "text": "Apart from A\u2424 deposition, APOE is also involved in NFTs formation, neuronal repair, synaptogenesis [42] [43] [44] , and the cholinergic transmitter system [45, 46] . Therefore, evidence for APOE as a modulator of AD manifestation should not be entirely unexpected. Differences in cognitive abilities and the GMV of APOE 4 carriers and non-carriers were evident in the MCI and dementia stages but not in the CN stage of AD. We found a greater atrophy in MTLs of the APOE 4 carriers. Several other cross-sectional studies have replicated the finding of greater MTL atrophy in 4 carriers AD dementia subjects [16, 17, 47] . A longitudinal study conducted by Mori and colleagues has also found greater hippocampal atrophy rate in 4 carriers of the AD dementia subjects [18] . Lower memory performance in the carrier groups became borderline significant only when we increased the power of our analysis by combining the MCI and dementia groups, suggesting a low effect size. This finding is consistent with the findings from other studies [17, 48] as well as the finding of a greater MTL atrophy. The preferential vulnerability of APOE 4 carriers to MTL atrophy and memory decline might be related to the fact that APOE 4 carriers have lesser capacity for synaptogenesis, associated with memory processing in the hippocampus [44] ."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2+ APOE 4 carriers had higher EF/PS performance", "text": "Interestingly, we found a higher EF/PS performance in our carrier groups. Similar findings from other studies were still relatively few [20, 21] and limited to the analysis of AD dementia. We extended these findings to the MCI stage of the disease in the present study, although possible explanations are limited as we did not find a greater atrophy in non-carrier groups. Another study found a greater frontal lobe volume in carriers [16] , which is in concordance with the finding of a lesser amyloid deposits burden as measured by [11C] PIB binding in the frontal lobe of carriers [49] . Hence, one might infer that relatively lesser neuronal damage in that region in the carriers may be the underlying explanation for better EF/PS.\nAnother potential explanation is the temporarily altered intra-and inter-functional connectivity of the specific networks in the brain at the CN stage. A recent resting-state functional MRI study by Machulda and colleagues compared the functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) in CN subjects with and without APOE 4. They found that the connectivity of DMN was weaker while the connectivity of SN was enhanced in APOE 4 carriers when compared to non-carriers [50] . The DMN is anti-correlated with the SN in terms of their BOLD signal over time [51] and the reduction of connectivity in one might lead to the enhancement of the other as part of a reciprocal network mechanism in the AD pathophysiology process [31, 52, 53] . It is possible that in our subjects, the DMN connectivity was relatively weaker in carriers than non-carriers, which led to the relative enhancement of SN connectivity. SN has been found to function as a filter for salient stimuli and act as a switch between DMN and other task-positive networks, for example the central executive network, when faced with goal-directed external stimuli [54] . Consistent with prior evidence, our findings might suggest a temporary protection or even an enhancement of the frontal network facilitating executive functioning in CN subjects with APOE 4."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In summary, emphasizing on the pre-clinical and pre-dementia disease stages, we characterized the cross-sectional trajectories of the cognitive measures and major AD biomarkers together with APOE modulation. We demonstrated the possibility of classifying CN subjects into CN subjects with and without CSF AD signature using genotype, brain atrophy, and cognitive measures. Capturing AD progression based on disease stages has an inherent advantage over capturing the progression along time-to-dementia in applicability, as patients can be diagnosed into a certain disease stage even with an unknown time to dementia.\nFuture longitudinal studies are needed to characterize within-subject trajectories of these AD-related biomarkers and cognitive measures and the specific modulation effect of APOE to evaluate the potential clinical applicability of these measurements for individuals. Future studies on the association between atrophy and amyloid burden using amyloid imaging in the pre-dementia stage of AD would be helpful to characterize region-specific pathophysiological disease progress. Network connectivity analysis of the brain would be a valuable addition to further explain the relationship between disease pathology and disease manifestation in structural changes and cognitive deficits. Impairments in connectivity might occur before brain atrophy becomes apparent and would be worth exploring in future studies as a potential early biomarker."}]
