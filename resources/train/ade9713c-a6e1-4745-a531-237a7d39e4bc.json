[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "[1] A newly developed global model, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM) which is designed for both weather predictions and climate-change simulations, is used to predict the tropical cyclone activity at 25-km resolution. Assuming the persistence of the sea surface temperature anomaly during the forecast period, we show that the inter-annual variability of seasonal prediction for hurricane counts in the North Atlantic basin is highly predictable during the past decade (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010). A remarkable correlation of 0.96 between the observed and model predicted hurricane counts is achieved. The root-mean-square error of the predicted hurricane number is less than 1 per year after correcting the model's negative bias. The predictive skill of the model in the tropics is further supported by the successful prediction of a Madden-Julian Oscillation event initialized 7-day in advance of its onset.

Diverse approaches are being used operationally [Camargo et al., 2007] . In addition to the more established statistical methodologies [Gray, 1984; Elsner and Jagger, 2006; Klotzbach and Gray, 2009] , dynamical models (atmospheric or coupled atmosphere-ocean global models [LaRow et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010; Vitart, 2006; Vitart et al., 2007] , and the hybrid statistical-dynamical models [Wang et al., 2009; Vecchi et al., 2010] ) have been increasingly utilized, showing promising skill in the seasonal hurricane predictions for the North Atlantic basin. With rapid increase in computing capability, Shukla et al. [2009] proposed the concept of \"seamless weather-climate prediction\" which argued that \"much higher resolution of the major model components is a fundamental prerequisite for a more realistic representation of the climate system and more relevant predictions (e.g. extremes, convection, and tropical variability), and thus regional and local applications\".\n[3] Seasonal TCs activities provide an ideal test case for the afore-mentioned strategy of seamless weather-climate prediction. The geographical distribution and frequency of TC genesis are strongly influenced by atmospheric and oceanic phenomena that are global in scope, yet these largescale features have origins in convective-scale motions, which are typically under-resolved in today's global weather or climate models. The time scale of these large-scale events ranges from intra-seasonal to decadal (e.g. the MaddenJulian Oscillation (MJO) and the El Ni\u00f1o and Southern Oscillation (ENSO)). Organized moist convections in the tropical atmosphere that have their origins at space scale of less than 10 km play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of these events, which in turn are key large-scale factors controlling the seasonal to inter-annual variability of TC activity. Therefore, it can be argued that in order to achieve the best possible skill in the seasonal predictions of TCs, dynamical models must be able to directly resolve or at least realistically parameterize the moist convections within the entire global domain.\n[4] A coupled atmosphere-ocean global model with cloud and eddy resolving capability should probably be the ultimate tool for seasonal prediction of TCs. The first global cloudresolving/cloud-permitting model, the Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Atmosphere Model (NICAM) without parameterized convection, is capable of explicitly resolving convective clouds in the tropics if the model is run with a few kilometers horizontal resolution. Nonetheless, even with 3.5 to 7 km resolution, it successfully predicted cyclone genesis 1-2 weeks in advance and simulated the life cycle of a TC with approximately the same intensity as the observed [Fudeyasu et al., 2008; Miura et al., 2007a] . The NICAM also demonstrated an excellent simulation of the slow eastward migration of a MJO event during the winter of 2006 [Miura et al., 2007b .\n[5] Encouraged in part by the success of NICAM but primarily motivated by the need to remove or at least reduce the uncertainty in the highly parameterized moist convective processes in today's climate models, this study utilized a lower resolution prototype (thus presently affordable) global cloud system resolving model to demonstrate this potential by showing successful predictions of seasonal hurricane counts in the North Atlantic basin."}, {"section_title": "Model and Methodology", "text": "[6] The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has developed a High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM), which is a \"cloud-resolving capable\" global model designed to be applicable for a wide range of resolution. The flexibility in resolution is mandated by the limitations arising from computational resources as well as the need for a wide scope of applications ranging from 5-day hurricane forecasts to century-long climate-change assessments. To achieve the flexibility in resolution, instead of a traditional deep convective parameterization, the HiRAM adopted only a non-intrusive shallow convective scheme for the parameterization of the underresolved moist processes. For this study, a 6-category bulk cloud microphysics scheme which is similar to Lin et al. [1983] is utilized to represent the resolved component of the moist processes. Other details of the model formulation are the same as in the study of global hurricane climatology using the 50-km resolution version of HiRAM [Zhao et al., 2009] .\n[7] Constrained by the existing computational resources, the seasonal TC predictions in the northern hemisphere covering only the 11-year period (from year 2000 to 2010) are performed by the C360 resolution HiRAM which uses the finite-volume dynamical core [Lin, 2004] on the cubedsphere grid [Putman and Lin, 2007] with 360 \u00d7 360 grid spacing on each face of the cube, resulting in approximately 25-km horizontal resolution over the entire globe. Although the 25-km resolution is not high enough to resolve the convective clouds, it is sufficiently higher than the 50-km resolution applied to establish a realistic global TC climatology [Zhao et al., 2009] and skillful seasonal predictions of Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes (Z10 hereafter).\n[8] Given a \"perfect\" global cloud-and eddy-resolving coupled atmosphere-ocean model, the quality of the slowly evolving oceanic initial condition should be the dominant factor determining predictability of the intra-seasonal to inter-annual variability of TCs, with the more rapidly changing atmospheric initial state plays perhaps a less critical role. In this scenario, hurricane seasonal prediction is an \"initial-value problem\". In reality, with the imperfect standalone global atmospheric model, the skill of seasonal prediction should depend strongly on the quality of the model's science algorithms. With a state-of-the-art high resolution atmospheric model that can simulate moist convection realistically, it is believed that the skill of TC seasonal predictions will then mainly come from the oceanic \"boundary condition\", the sea surface temperature (SST) (Z10). Our experiments were performed in true forecast mode, using only information available up to forecast time. The SST anomaly (defined as departure of analyzed SST at forecast time from monthly climatology) was \"frozen\" during the forecast period (Z10). With this approach, the intra-seasonal variation of SST is entirely determined by the background monthly-varying SST climatology.\n[9] As the predictability of synoptic \"weather\" is believed to be less than 2 weeks, if the initial state of the atmosphere is to play a role in seasonal predictions of TCs, the information must be contained in the low-frequency parts such as MJOs and the large-scale stratospheric circulation. To include the impacts of initial atmospheric states, contrary to the climatology initial conditions used in the previous study of the retrospective hurricane season forecasts (Z10), the atmospheric initial states used in this study are initialized with the National Center for Environmental Prediction/ Global Forecast System (NCEP/GFS) data. For each season, four forecast members are run from July 1 to October 31 (the peak hurricane season), with one day lagged initial condition between members. The first forecast begins at 00Z July 1, while the second member begins at 00Z June 30, and so on. The observed SST anomalies based on these one day lagged initial times were used for the four members, respectively, during the 4 month forecast period."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "[10] Given the likely impacts of MJOs on TC genesis at the intra-seasonal to seasonal time-scale [Leroy and Wheeler, 2008] , as well as the dependence of TC activities on the MJO phase in the tropical Atlantic [Klotzbach, 2010] , the MJO representation in the model is first examined to evaluate the predictability in the tropics. The forecast from the first month of the latest season (July 2010) is chosen for this demonstration. The observed daily precipitation averaged between 5\u00b0S and 10\u00b0N from TRMM and the HiRAM forecast are shown in Figures 1a and 1b . There was a major MJO event occurred around July 7, 2010 at 60\u00b0E and propagated eastward with speed about 6.3 m/s, while a relatively weak signal was found at earlier time between 90-100\u00b0E with eastward speed about 8.5 m/s (Figure 1a) . The model was initialized 7-day in advance of the onset of the major event. The eastward propagation was well predicted with roughly the same speed as the observed (Figure 1b) . The secondary signal in the model is weaker, but still detectable (Figure 1b ). This successful MJO representation supports our hypothesis that using the initialized atmosphere states may improve the predictions at least up to the intraseasonal (30-90 days) time scale.\n[11] We used the TC tracker that is similar to the one that has been used operationally at NCEP since 1998 [Marchok, 2002] with warm-core criterion for tracking and counting the numbers of TCs. For the North Atlantic basin, the correlation of the hurricane counts between the forecasts and the observations (for the same 4-month period) for the 11-year time series is 0.96 (Figure 2a) . The key to this remarkably high correlation appears to be our model's ability to successfully capture two extreme transitions that dominated the variability during the past decade. The first is the sharp decrease from 2005 to 2006, and the second is the rapid rise from 2009 to 2010. Note that the spread among the four forecast members is greatly reduced after 2006 as compared to the previous 6 years. It may be attributed to the improved resolution (and quality) of NCEP/GFS analysis from T254 to T382 since 2006. It is noted that the representation of the stratosphere in the NCEP analysis is much improved after 2006 with the switch to the hybrid vertical coordinate. Further studies are needed to understand this inhomogeneous-in-time behavior.\n[12] A mean negative bias of \u22121.43 (hurricanes) is present during the 11 years. From the monthly distribution the negative bias mostly came from the under-prediction in September (not shown). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced from 1.84 to a very low 0.93 (hurricanes) after removing the bias by normalization, which is achieved by multiplying a constant (1.24) throughout the 11-year period. The time series of total tropical storm (TS) counts (hurricanes included) in the Atlantic basin shows a good but less remarkable correlation of 0.80 between the forecast and the observed (Figure 2c ). This may be due to the fact that the 32.5 (m/s) 10-m wind criteria used for hurricane detection are more selective and less ambiguous to identify in the model (and in nature).\n[13] We also examined results in the western North Pacific basin. Unlike the North Atlantic basin where the local SST is the dominant factor affecting TC activities, in this basin, various large-scale systems, such as the Asian summer Monsoon and the MJO, also play important roles on the TC genesis frequency and location [Chia and Ropelewski, 2002] . It is therefore more challenging to get a skillful prediction of TC inter-annual variation in this area. The correlations of \"typhoons\" (using the same criteria as hurricanes) and TS counts are 0.60 and 0.77, respectively (Figures 2b and 2d) . Contrary to the North Atlantic basin, the model exhibited positive biases in this basin. After removal of the biases, the RMSEs of counts for both TS and typhoon are 2.30. These predictions can still be considered skillful even though the performance is not as outstanding as that in the North Atlantic. The individual information for the four ensemble members can be found in Table 1 . Figure 3c , but for the TS. The occurrence counts are divided into 5-longitude by 4-latitude pixel using the distance between TC location and pixel as the weight.\n[14] In addition to storm counts, other key characteristics of TCs such as genesis locations and intensity distribution are compared with the corresponding observations. The occurrence locations of the observed TCs of which intensity reach the hurricane and the TS criteria (with 32.5 and 17.5 m/s maximum wind speed) are shown on the geographical map of the North Atlantic (Figures 3a and 3b) . Two branches can be identified in the distribution of the hurricanes as well as the TCs occurrence. The belt with rare occurrence is between 20-25\u00b0N. It may be associated with the inhibiting effects of the dust and hot dry air from Saharan air layer [Zipser et al., 2009] . Our model displayed the two-branch pattern in the eastern Atlantic (east to 50\u00b0W) (Figures 3c and 3d) . The maximum area of the south branch in the TC category is closer to the Africa than the observed, showing an eastward bias. The hollow area within 20-25\u00b0N, 55-65\u00b0W for the hurricane occurrence distribution in the observation is not captured by the model.\n[15] The wind-pressure relationship is used to evaluate the model's realism regarding the TC intensity (Figure 4) . The 10-m wind and sea-level-pressure (SLP) for the identified storms are compared with the observations from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) [Kruk et al., 2010] . It shows that the relationship is well captured for the TS and hurricane categories 1 and 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The 10-m wind speed can only reach up to category 3 in our 25-km resolution model. On the other hand, the SLP of the strongest storms in the model matched that of the observed categories 4 and 5 hurricanes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "[16] In this study, the GFDL HiRAM which is a cloudresolving capable global model with minimal parameterized moist convection is used successfully for the prediction of inter-annual variability of TC seasonal activity. Constrained by the existing computational resources, the seasonal TC predictions in the northern hemisphere covering 11 years (2000 to 2010) were performed with quasi-uniform 25-km horizontal resolution over the globe. The SST anomaly is frozen at the initial forecast time, relying completely on the background climatological SST to describe the intralseasonal SST variation during the entire forecast period. The impacts of initial atmospheric states were included by using the NCEP/GFS data for the model initialization. The results show that the inter-annual variability of seasonal prediction for hurricane counts in the North Atlantic basin is highly predictable during the past decade, producing a remarkable correlation of 0.96 between the observed and the model predictions. After the bias correction, the RMSE is below one hurricane per year. This notable skill also demonstrated that the use of the frozen SST anomaly can be sufficient to generate and perhaps sustain the signals existed in the initial atmosphere states pertaining to the intra-seasonal events that regulate the TC genesis. This hypothesis is supported by the successful prediction of the MJO events in 2010. "}]
