[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Despite the extent of pupil mobility being discussed in many quarters, it is something we know remarkably little about. This seems very surprising since moving school is often identified as an important potential influence on the educational achievement of pupils and their progression through the school years. Of course, the reasons for changing schools may be different. Some pupils move schools because their parents change jobs, divorce, or because they migrated from other regions of the country or other countries. Others may switch because parents change neighbourhood to be closer to a 'better' school for their children, often paying significant house price premia to do so Machin, 2003, 2006). Pupil mobility has been prominent in recent British policy debates on education. The government has set up projects to look at issues to do with pupil mobility, because as the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills Charles Clarke emphasised \"it is a challenge to which we must rise if we are to have any impact on individual pupils, on the schools they belong to and on their future contribution to society as a whole\" (DfES, 2003). Since January 2000 pupil mobility has been absorbed into the school inspections process (see Ofsted, 2000Ofsted, , 2002. There are at least three policy areas of relevance: first, to do with school funding and whether schools with more mobility need to be compensated; second, the policy agenda on child development and whether mobility (and its correlates) poses a problem in this regard; and, thirdly, the possible impact of mobility on academic achievement. The extent of differential mobility exposure for school children has potentially important implications for the evaluation of school performance. Increasingly Local Education Authorities (LEAs) are attempting to measure local mobility to assess its possible impact. There are concerns that the integration of new pupils can lead to a diversion of teaching resources away from current pupils that may lead to a negative externality arising from mobility. This is why in a recent report the Association of London Government suggested that schools with high mobility rates get extra funding to deal with mobile pupils (BBC News, 27 June 2005). Despite rising interest in the issue of mobility and its potential to influence school standards, empirical analysis of mobility in the English educational system has been scarce. This is particularly true on a national level, as most existing work focuses on pupils in specific Local Educational Authorities (Strand, 2002;Strand and Demie, 2005) or on specific birth cohorts of children (Ferri, 1976;Blane, 1985). In this study we offer a (predominantly descriptive) analysis of the extent of and patterns in pupil mobility for all state school children in England. To do so we use administrative data from two academic years of the Pupil-Level Annual School Census (PLASC). This data offers significant advantages in that it covers all state school pupils in every year of compulsory schooling, from which we can calculate school switches. In this paper we do this for the two academic years, 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. The main findings of our study are: \u2022 Pupils from lower income families are significantly more likely to change schools than other pupils, and this is true for pupils at all levels of schooling. \u2022 Pupils who move schools are more likely to have a lower previous academic achievement record than pupils who stay at the same school. \u2022 Pupils at schools with higher Key Stage performance levels move less than pupils from lower performance schools. \u2022 Pupil mobility is more marked in London than in other regions of the country. \u2022 When children move school, they are more likely to end up in a school with better Key Stage performance than the one they left, but this improvement is significantly more marked for children from better off backgrounds. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss existing research related to the subject matter of this paper. In Section 3 we describe the data and discuss some descriptive statistics derived from them. In Section 4 we present some statistical models on pupil mobility. Section 5 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Related Work", "text": "The issue of pupil mobility in the UK has attracted researchers' attention for a long time, with research on the issue dating back at least as early as the 1960s (e.g. Douglas, 1964). Yet on a 'big picture' level, we currently know very little about the extent of mobility, how it differs for different ages of children, and how it is affected when we extract compulsory school shifts (such as from primary to secondary school) from the picture. Our aim in this paper is to rectify this imbalance. Research documenting the extent of pupil mobility, or its links to pupil achievement, is thin on the ground. This is especially true in the UK context. But what does exist can be divided into two main themes, those which look at the determinants of school switching, and those that try to answer the more difficult question of whether, and if so in what direction, mobility impacts upon pupil achievement."}, {"section_title": "Research on the extent of pupil mobility and its determinants", "text": "Most empirical research looking at the extent of pupil mobility in England relies on descriptive statistics (often compiled by schools or LEAs) that document the incidence of pupil mobility in specific circumstances (e.g. Alston, 2000;Demie, 2002;DfES, 2003;Dobson and Pooley, 2004;Greater London Authority, 2005). This is mainly a consequence of the lack of data at the national level. Since 2000 the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) has started to collect school-level data on pupil mobility as part of its inspection process. The government has also started to take a close interest in aspects of pupil mobility. For example, a recent Department for Education and Skills project (DfES, 2003) looked at 51 schools characterised by high levels of pupil mobility to consider how to best tackle problems related to mobility. One of the few studies examining the nature and causes of pupil mobility in England is Dobson et al's (2000) work on six LEAs. Their analysis isolates several factors associated with pupils switching schools between 1998 and 1999. The key factors they identify are migration (for several reasons including jobs, for reasons of career progression, and among refugee families) and family break-ups. They also stress that mobile pupils are predominantly from low income families. One of their conclusions is to highlight the need for national data to be able to analyse patterns of pupil mobility in a comprehensive manner. More recently, the Office for Standards in Education (2002) has analysed mobility in 3300 primary schools and 1000 secondary schools that were under their inspection regime between 2000 and 2001. Although this study does not cover all schools in England, it is the first larger scale research on the patterns of pupil mobility. The study reports huge differences between schools in the extent of pupil mobility, ranging from 0 to 80 percent with a median of 11.1 percent in primary schools, and between 0-35 percent in secondary schools with a median of 5.6 percent. In addition, the findings suggest that pupil mobility in secondary schools was twice as high in London (14 percent) than elsewhere, and schools with high mobility levels tended to be those enrolling pupils from lower income families. Evidence from other countries shows pupil mobility to be an important phenomenon. For example, it appears to be widespread in the United States, both at the elementary and secondary level, and reports suggest that rates of pupil mobility have increased over time (Plank et al, 1993). A recent study of 2000 US Census data (US Census Bureau, 2001) showed that around 15 to 18 percent of school age children moved in the previous year. Yet, in the US, there is also only a very limited amount of research that specifically focuses on patterns of pupil mobility. Astone and McLanahan (1994) utilise High School and beyond data to show that students from single parent families are more likely to change schools between fifth and tenth grade and are less likely to complete high school education, as compared to students coming from two parent families. A national study (US General Accounting Office, 1994) reports pupil mobility between first and third grade to be very high at around 40 percent, and even higher among children coming from low income families. Swanson and Schneider (1999) examine the causes of pupil mobility in the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) dataset, concluding that school mobility is almost twice as high in the early high school years (grades 8-10) than the late high school years (grade 10-12). Rumberger and Larson (1998) also employ NELS, finding that a quarter of 8 th graders changed schools between 1988 and 1992 and, more importantly, both school and residential mobility were higher among students from relatively lower social backgrounds than other students. Moreover, students who changed schools were more likely to be high school drop outs. Factors such as educational expectations, absenteeism, misbehaviour and grades were all found to contribute to student mobility."}, {"section_title": "Research on pupil mobility and achievement", "text": "The second main strand of research concerns itself with whether pupil mobility matters for pupil achievement. This, of course, is a very difficult question to credibly answer since unravelling the direction of causation between mobility and achievement is a huge challenge. Moreover, this difficulty is heightened when one considers that mobility may occur for differing reasons, either in response to parental actions like job loss, divorce or other similar events, or for Tiebout reasons where parents try to get their children into better schools. Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin (2004) carefully discuss these, stating that the moves for the first reason are likely to impact negatively on pupil achievement due to disruption, whilst the second will impact positively on achievement (if parents are successful in their moves). Studies focusing on the link between pupil mobility and their academic achievement have found mixed results, either reporting a negative correlation between academic achievement and mobility, or no association at all. Strand (2002) persuasively argues that much of the work that simply looks at the correlation between mobility and achievement without taking into account other factors is highly misleading. Much of this basic correlation work reports a negative association, but it is evident that there are many possible factors that are correlated with both mobility and achievement that need to be controlled for and, if one does control for them, the negative relationship can be driven away. Indeed, this is exactly what happens in Strand (2002) and Strand and Demie (2005). Of course, controlling for these observable characteristics is necessary, but problems of possible reverse causation are potentially even more serious, as there may exist a whole host of unobservables (e.g. to do with pupil motivation, luck, family resources and so on) which further contaminate the relationship. The bias from these could go either way and so we may still worry that, without a better identification strategy than simply conditioning on other correlated variables that the researcher has available for analysis, research may not be picking up the 'true' relation between achievement and mobility."}, {"section_title": "Aims of this paper", "text": "This paper is firmly grounded in the first of these two areas, namely trying to glean a better understanding of patterns of pupil mobility for state school pupils in England. The reason for this focus is, as already stated, the fact that we know very little about pupil mobility patterns despite their importance. The richness of the data means we are able to consider residential moves alongside changes of school through the availability of home postcode information in the dataset. Also, given the large sample sizes available, we can look in detail at school switches across school years. Importantly, we can also separate compulsory and noncompulsory school switches. Additionally, there is an identifier for the school the pupil attends (which we use to match to other school level data) and the home postcode of the pupil. This provides us with the advantage of being able to look at mobility patterns not only in terms of schooling, but also to look at coincident changes in home residence."}, {"section_title": "Data, Definitions and Descriptive Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Measuring pupil mobility", "text": "We measure pupil mobility on the basis of whether there is a change in the school that a pupil attends between the academic years 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. 3 In particular, we can do this by looking at changes in the Register of Educational Establishments (REE) school code for each pupil across the years. The REE dataset is matched to PLASC and can be used to identify school moves that are a result of normal educational transitions, such as when a student changes from primary to secondary school, and other non-compulsory school moves that are not. For many reasons, we are most likely to be interested in these non-compulsory moves and so need to define pupil mobility accordingly. 4 In our initial descriptive analysis we show results for all school moves and for school moves excluding compulsory transitions, but for the majority of our analysis we look at a mobility definition excluding compulsory educational moves."}, {"section_title": "Measuring residential mobility", "text": "We can also look at residential mobility since PLASC contains home postcodes. Of course, residential moves may occur for a range of different reasons, some of which relate to schools (like parents trying to move closer to 'better' schools), and some of which do not (like occupational mobility or changes in family circumstances). More frequent moves of residence may also relate to particular family types, such as refugee families and travellers (Dobson et al. 2000). Residential mobility is measured by changes in the residential postcode of each pupil between the two academic years. This measure of mobility is adjusted to take into account Royal Mail postcode changes over the two periods and miscoding errors. 5 Initial descriptive analysis Table 1 shows the extent of pupil mobility across school years, derived from the two years of PLASC micro-data. It shows two sets of mobility estimates, the first for all types of school movers and the second for school movers excluding compulsory school shifts (such as from primary to secondary school, see the Appendix). The percent, make non-compulsory school moves in the year we analyse. There are interesting differences across the particular year groups. The rate of pupil mobility is at its highest in Key Stage 1 (when pupils are aged 5/6-6/7). In the Key Stage 1 years 6.4 percent of pupils make non-compulsory moves, as compared to 5.0 percent in Key Stage 2 (aged 6/7-10/11) and 3.4 percent by Key Stage 3 (aged 10/11-13/14). Mobility is therefore higher in the primary as opposed to secondary schooling years. In terms of individual year groups the highest movement occurs in school years 1-2, at a peak of 7.3 percent. The fact that the majority of change takes place in the early years of a child's education suggests that parents try to minimise potentially disruptive effects of mobility on education progression by switching schools before the child is fully settled into a particular school and the education system itself. Our next concern is to look at possible differences in mobility patterns that are associated with particular pupil characteristics. In Table 3 we present statistics on a range of background characteristics of those that move (focusing on non-compulsory school movers only) relative to those that stay in the same school, between each school year. The Table   reports the proportion of movers and stayers by year group for five different pupil characteristics. One striking feature of the The final descriptive Table, Table 4, combines pupil movement with movement of home, to determine the extent to which school switches are inextricably linked with changes in residence. Again focussing on non-compulsory school movers, we find that in almost all year groups (except for year 6-7 and year 10-11) more than half of those transferring schools combine this with a change of residence. Occupancy changes also predominantly occur in the early years of primary schooling, reinforcing the point made earlier that parents perceive moving at this time of a child's life to be less disruptive to their educational development. In school years 1-2 and 2-3 nearly 70 percent of those that switch schools also change dwellings. By contrast, housing movement is much smaller amongst those remaining in the same school across the academic years, at less than 10 percent in all year groups."}, {"section_title": "The Determinants of Pupil Mobility Approach", "text": "To determine which factors influence pupil mobility, we sequentially build up statistical models that we estimate separately for different year group transitions. The starting point is estimation of the following pupil mobility equation that controls only for student level characteristics: where i indexes individual pupils, j indexes the school and t indexes time. S ijt is a dummy taking the value of 1 if a pupil switches schools between year t-1 and year t, and 0 otherwise. We can consider within-school variations in mobility by amending equation 1to include a set of school fixed effects, \u03b1 j , as follows: Inclusion of the school-specific \u03b1's in equation 2 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical estimates of mobility equations", "text": "The mobility equations are estimated separately for year group transitions so as to allow the influence of the factors associated with pupil mobility to vary across year groups. Table 5 thus reports marginal effects from a set of baseline probit models of mobility. The Table   shows three sets of estimates. The first, in the upper panel of the Table (Panel A) Table. In all year group transitions, pupil mobility is consistently positively related to free school meal eligibility (FSM). The marginal effect for the FSM variable clearly shows pupils from lower income families (as proxied by FSM status) to be significantly more likely to move than other pupils. Interestingly, the magnitude of the FSM association is larger for primary school children. For example, conditional on the other variables entered into the mobility equation, a pupil entitled to free school meals is almost 6 percent more likely to move school than a non-eligible pupil in the year 1-2 transition. In the later primary school transitions, this falls a little but remains in the 4 to 5 percent range. On the other hand, in the secondary school transition years the marginal effect remains significant and positive, but smaller in the range of 1-3 percent. In the statistical models, there is not much evidence of gender differences in mobility, where the marginal effects are very small across year groups. Special Educational Needs pupils are significantly more mobile and this holds across primary and secondary phases of the schooling sequence. Similarly, for the most part non-white pupils have higher mobility rates, especially amongst the primary years. Finally, the results associated with whether English is not the child's first language are rather mixed and change signs across year groups. 7 Turning to the results in the middle panel of Table 5, there are two main points to note, over and above the discussion on the upper panel estimates. First of all, prior pupil academic attainment matters. 8 The results demonstrate that the higher the pupil's previous attainment, the less likely it is that the pupil will change schools. Since the test scores are standardised one can view the estimates as showing the impact of a one standard deviation increase in Key Stage performance. 9 The results show that previous attainment has a more detrimental impact on mobile pupils in primary school years than in secondary ones. But the finding that pupils with better prior Key Stage performance are significantly less likely to move is always in place. In terms of magnitudes, a pupil with a one standard deviation higher prior achievement has a mobility rate of .6 to 1.3 percentage points lower. When compared to the mean mobility rate of around 4-5 percent this is sizable. The second finding of note is that inclusion of the prior attainment measures tends to dampen down the estimated connections with FSM eligibility, SEN status and the ethnicity variable. In almost all models, these remain significant determinants of mobility, but the magnitude of their association is weakened since students with these characteristics tend to have lower levels of prior achievement. The inclusion of school fixed effects, in Panel C of the Table, does "}, {"section_title": "Differences between switchers who do and do not move residence", "text": "The previous section showed that pupils who switch schools are significantly more likely to come from less advantaged backgrounds and that they, on average, have lower previous achievement levels than non-switchers. In the earlier discussion, we did stress, however, that students may move for different reasons and, in particular, that children who also move residence at the time of school switching may well have different characteristics to those who stay in the same residence. To analyse whether pupil characteristics have a different impact on the probability of moving schools and home compared to those that move only school, we therefore estimate equation (1) again by restricting the data to pupils that move schools. The equation we estimate is a probit model of moving house conditional upon school switching. For the school fixed effect specification this is: where the dependent variable equals 1 when a pupil moves home as well as school and 0 when a pupil only moves school. Two sets of specifications, that respectively do not (Panel A) and do control for school fixed effects (Panel B) are presented in Table 6. For the most part, they show that pupils who move school and home are more socially disadvantaged than pupils who move school only. However, special educational needs pupils are much more likely to only move school, rather than school and home. This effect is stronger for primary than for secondary school pupils, but constitutes a large negative association in both phases of schooling. The results also show that pupils who move both school and home, as compared to school only, do not differ greatly in their previous academic attainment. The estimated marginal effects for the KS measures are all small and in many cases one cannot reject the null hypothesis of no association with moving house and school relative to only switching school. Inclusion of school fixed effects (in Panel B) amends some of the magnitudes, mostly attenuating the estimated effects since unobserved school-level attributes both matter for mobility and are correlated with the other independent variables, but the qualitative pattern of results remains."}, {"section_title": "Do pupils move from better or worse schools?", "text": "We are also able to look at whether pupils are more likely to move from better or worse performing schools. To do so we add measures of t-1 dated school achievement to the mobility equations. Adding Of course, the inclusion of the average school performance measure means we cannot include school fixed effects in this model as there is no within-school variation in this variable (put alternatively, in this model this is the fixed school characteristics in which we are interested 10 ). The results shown in Table 7 reveal that higher prior school performance makes pupils less likely to move. These findings are consistent for Key Stage 1, Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3, and are of similar magnitudes (around 1 percentage point lower for a one unit standard deviation higher school KS performance). On the whole, the results are supportive of the notion that children are more likely to move if they are in less well performing schools."}, {"section_title": "Do pupils move to better or worse schools?", "text": "As we argued above, parents may make residential moves to take advantage of better schooling in other areas. If they do make such Tiebout related moves, one would expect that pupils move to better schools. If residential moves are associated with other reasons than schooling of their children, then it is not clear whether children end up in better schools or not. To consider this we have looked at the relative performance of schools that mobile pupils move to relative to those that they leave. The previous sub-section already established that, on average and conditional on observable characteristics, mobile pupils switch from less well performing schools. Table 8 shows the number of school switchers who move to schools that have higher or lower Key Stage test score performance as compared to the school that they moved from. The Table shows that, on average, movers are more likely to end up in a school with better Key Stage performance than the one that they left. Around 57 percent of school switchers move to a school with better Key Stage results than their previous school. Looking at the subgroups in the four final columns of the Table, there is also some evidence that FSM eligible children and children who move home as well as school are less likely to end up in a better performing school relative to the school they were in. Table 9 presents statistical estimates exploring which characteristics matter for whether or not pupils move to better performing schools relative to the one they left. The Table presents probit estimates of whether children move to a better performing school. The results make it evident that the gaps between FSM and non-FSM eligible children reported in the descriptives Table, Table 8, are statistically significant. Similarly SEN children are much less likely to move to a higher achievement school. The same is true for non-white pupils and 10 Essentially this means that, for this particular model, we have parameterised the school fixed effect as KS \u2212 pupils for whom English is not their first language. With respect to prior achievement, it is also pupils with higher prior achievement who are more likely to go to a better performing school. In terms of average school achievement, unsurprisingly, children in higher achieving schools are less likely to move to a better one. These results therefore show sharp inequalities in the school moving process. Over half of children end up in better schools than the one they left, but going to a better or worse school is systematically linked to pupil characteristics. More advantaged individuals are much more likely to make the move to a better school than are other children from less well off backgrounds."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Pupil mobility is a contentious, and highly policy relevant, issue. In this paper we have set out to establish some basic facts about pupil mobility in England using, for the first time, a national database covering all state school children. The results we report aim to fill this large void and offer findings of relevance both to academic debates and to government policy discussions that look at the extent of and inequality in mobility among English school children. Our results show mobility to be quite prevalent, with just over a quarter of a million, or around 4.4 percent of pupils, making non-compulsory school moves in the period we study. The findings show that mobile pupils are more socially disadvantaged than non-mobile pupils and are less likely to have a good prior education record. Moreover, we find that pupils are less likely to move if the school they attend has good average performance levels. Children do, on average, move to better schools. There is some evidence that making the move to schools with superior test score performance is more likely to be the case for children from better off families. Whether or not this benefits them individually is an interesting and important research question, but one we leave to future research since it requires more postswitch data than we currently possess at the national level to be able to address this question.  2001/2002-2002/2003, regardless of whether the move is a normal transition expected for that year group. For non-compulsory school moves we exclude compulsory transitions (see the Appendix for details).
