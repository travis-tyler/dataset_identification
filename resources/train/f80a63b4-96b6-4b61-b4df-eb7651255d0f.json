These findings have since been independently replicated (3, 4) . Although the identification of novel genetic risk factors for AD is a significant advance, these variants occur commonly in the general population and are associated with small effect sizes. Moreover, they are believed to be merely proxies for true AD risk variants. Their clinical utility as standalone predictors of disease risk is therefore likely to be limited (5) . They might, however, be invaluable in the delineation of pathways intrinsic to disease mechanisms or their modifiers in at-risk older individuals. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement component (3b/4b) receptor-1 (CR1) were reported to be associated with greater risk of AD (2) (3) (4) . More recently, the rs6656401 A risk allele of CR1 was also related to greater cognitive decline over time as well as with the extent of neuritic plaque burden at autopsy in older individuals who were nondemented at baseline (6) . Together with a large body of evidence supporting a role for the complement system in modulating AD pathogenesis (7) , these findings suggest that the AD risk variant of CR1 might influence pathways related to brain Ab clearance and/or deposition.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the AD risk variant rs3818361 SNP in CR1 and brain amyloid burden in nondemented older individuals within the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA-NI) (8) . In light of the findings by Lambert et al. (2) in their original GWAS study demonstrating an interaction between this SNP and APOE genotype in influencing risk for AD, it was also of interest to examine the effect of APOE genotype in modifying associations between CR1 and brain amyloid during aging."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Materials", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging is one of the largest and longest-running longitudinal studies of aging in the United States (8) . The community-dwelling unpaid volunteer participants are predominantly white, of upper-middle socioeconomic status, and with an above-average educational level. In general, at the time of entry into the study, participants have no physical and cognitive impairment (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score r24) and no chronic medical condition with the exception of well-controlled hypertension.\nThe BLSA-NI began in 1994. The BLSA participants were initially prioritized for admission to the neuroimaging study on the basis of health considerations and the amount of prior cognitive data available for each individual (8) . At enrollment, participants were free of central nervous system disease (e.g., epilepsy, stroke, bipolar illness, dementia), severe cardiac disease (e.g., myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease requiring angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery), pulmonary disease, or metastatic cancer.\nParticipants in the current report were 57 (mean age 78.5 \u03ee 6.3 years) nondemented individuals in the BLSA-NI, who underwent 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound-B ( 11 PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging scans and genome-wide genotyping. They were ascertained from the initial 61 BLSA-NI participants consecutively assessed with 11 C-PiB from June 2005 to March 2007 and were representative of the entire BLSA-NI with respect to baseline age, sex, race, and education. We excluded individuals with clinical strokes, brain trauma, and those meeting consensus criteria for AD (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) and mild cognitive impairment as determined by consensus case conference (9, 10) . This study was approved by the local institutional review board. All participants provided written informed consent before each assessment.

All the analyses were conducted in SAS 9.2 (Cary, North Carolina). During initial exploratory analyses plotting values of PiB DVR across different brain regions, we observed a striking difference in the variability of PiB distribution between the two groups (i.e., AA/AG vs. GG) in most brain regions.\nWe therefore used generalized least square regression models, which allowed us to investigate the differences in variability of PiB distribution and differences in mean levels of brain amyloid burden between risk (AG/AA) and nonrisk (GG) carriers of the AD variant SNP in CR1 in one unified model. Mean cortical and regional PiB DVRs were used as dependent variables. We used the group variable (coded 0 for GG and 1 for AG/AA) as the main predictor and included age, sex, and race as covariates to adjust for their effects. We first used two separate residual error variance terms (one for each group) and then used likelihood ratio tests to test whether the residual variances were equal between two groups. One residual error variance (pooled) was used for regions that showed statistically nonsignificant differences in variance, and two residual error variances were used for regions that showed statistically significant differences (p o .05) in variance. Once the residual variance terms were determined, the differences in mean levels of brain amyloid burden were then estimated. In the light of previous reports including our own that have shown robust effects of age and APOE e4 status on brain amyloid deposition (11, (21) (22) (23) , we conducted targeted analyses examining whether the effects of age and APOE e4 status on PiB DVRs were different between risk (AG/AA) and nonrisk (GG) groups. In this regression model, the predictors included age, APOE e4 status (e4-positive or e4-negative), CR1 group (AA/AG or GG), interaction between age and CR1 group, and interaction between APOE e4 status and CR1 group. Sex and race were included in the model as covariates. Significant interactions indicate whether the effects of age or APOE e4 status on brain amyloid burden differed between CR1-risk (AG/AA) and nonrisk (GG) groups. To control for potential type 1 error due to multiple comparisons, we report False Discovery Rate adjusted p values (p adj ) on the basis of the method described by Benjamini and Hochberg (24) .\nIn our replication study in the ADNI 11 C-PiB dataset, our main aim was to confirm our findings of differences in brain amyloid burden between CR1 risk and nonrisk groups among BLSA participants. Our replication analyses used a measure of global brain amyloid burden that has been previously validated by ADNI investigators both as a quantitative phenotype in genetic analyses as well as to derive cutoff measures to establish PiB positivity/negativity (17, 25, 26) . In restricting the replication study to a single validated measure of global amyloid burden, we avoided making multiple comparisons across several brain regions in the much smaller ADNI dataset. In the replication analysis, the null hypothesis tested was that our original observation of lower brain amyloid in CR1 risk-carriers was a false positive finding. The p value reported for the replication analysis is therefore for a one-sided t test comparing mean values of global brain amyloid burden between the CR1 risk and nonrisk groups."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample Characteristics", "text": "The two groups (risk carriers, AA/AG; and nonrisk carriers, GG) did not differ significantly in age, sex, number of years of education, or APOE e4 status. Their MMSE scores and domainspecific (memory, language, executive function, visuospatial function, and attention) cognitive performance did not differ significantly. There were a significantly higher number of African American participants in the risk (AG/AA) group (Table 1) . Frequencies of alleles in the rs3818361 polymorphism were G/G in 40 subjects (70.2%), A/G in 15 subjects (26.3%), and A/A in 2 subjects (3.5%). Thus 29.8% of our participants carried the risk A-allele. The frequency of the minor allele (A) in our sample was . 16 , and that of the major allele (A) was .84. There were no significant differences in the age distribution of APOE e4 alleles between the CR1 risk and nonrisk groups ( Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "CR1 and Brain Amyloid Burden", "text": "We observed widespread and statistically significant decreases in brain amyloid burden among carriers of the risk allele (AA/AG) of rs3818361 relative to noncarriers (GG). In addition to differences in mean level of amyloid burden in association with CR1 genotype, we also observed a statistically significant increase in variability in brain amyloid burden in risk noncarriers (GG) of rs3818361 relative to the risk group (AG/AA). These differences were found in mean cortical DVR [ burden between the CR1 risk (AA/AG) and nonrisk (GG) groups were not driven by differences in racial distribution, we repeated the aforementioned analyses after excluding all African-American participants and obtained identical results (Tables S1 and S2 in Supplement 1). To investigate factors responsible for the increased variability in brain amyloid deposition in noncarriers of the CR1 risk allele, we investigated whether APOE genotype modified the effect of CR1 on brain amyloid. We found significant interactions between APOE genotype and CR1 group in several brain regions, indicating differential effects of APOE genotype on amyloid burden for risk versus nonrisk groups in these regions. Among individuals who did not carry the risk allele of rs3818361 (GG), APOE e4 carriers showed greater brain amyloid burden than APOE e4 noncarriers. In contrast, amyloid burden was similar for APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers in the risk (AG/AA) group. we analyzed 11 C-PiB PET data available in 22 cognitively normal older individuals in the ADNI sample. The mean age of this sample (77.1 \u03ee 6.2 years) was similar to that of participants in our own 11 C-PiB PET study. The CR1 risk (n \u00bc 4) and nonrisk groups (n \u00bc 18) were well-matched in age and sex as well as the number of APOE e4 carriers (Table 3 ). Similar to our findings, there were no significant differences in MMSE scores and domain-specific (memory, language, executive function, visuospatial function, and attention) cognitive performance between the CR1 risk and nonrisk groups. Identical to our findings in the BLSA sample, we found that CR1 risk allele carriers showed a significantly lower global brain amyloid burden than nonrisk allele carriers in the ADNI dataset (1.308 \u03ee .308, and 1.619 \u03ee .328, respectively; p \u00bc .049)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our main aim in this study was to examine the relationship between the AD risk variant SNP rs3818361 in the CR1 gene and in vivo brain amyloid burden measured with 11 C-PiB PET in nondemented older individuals. In light of recent GWAS studies that showed a greater risk of AD in carriers of the A-allele of this SNP (2, 27) as well as an interaction between the CR1 and APOE genes in conferring risk for AD, our primary goal was to examine whether the carriers of the risk allele of CR1 had significant differences in brain amyloid burden relative to noncarriers and whether the CR1 \u00c2 APOE interaction might influence brain amyloid deposition in nondemented older individuals. We found widespread and statistically significant decreases in brain amyloid burden in individuals carrying one or two copies of the risk allele (AG/AA) relative to risk noncarriers (GG) in the BLSA sample and also confirmed this finding in an independent sample from the ADNI dataset.\nIn addition, we observed significantly greater variance in brain amyloid deposition in the nonrisk group (GG), an effect that seems to be influenced in part by APOE genotype. Thus, among GG but not AG/AA individuals, APOE e4 carriers exhibited greater amyloid deposition in several brain regions relative to APOE e4 noncarriers (Figure 1) .\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between genetic variation in the CR1 gene and brain amyloid deposition quantified by in vivo PET imaging in nondemented older individuals. Our findings run counter to the direction of effect on brain amyloid deposition observed in nondemented carriers of the APOE e4 allele, the most robust genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. Although the CR1 risk allele was associated with decreased fibrillar amyloid in nondemented individuals in the current study, we and others have demonstrated increased brain amyloid levels in carriers of the APOE e4 allele relative to noncarriers in cognitively normal older individuals (21, 22) . Our present findings also suggest that the CR1 risk allele might modify the relationship between APOE genotype and brain amyloid deposition. This finding is especially relevant against the background of the index GWAS study by Lambert et al. (2) , which demonstrated a differential effect of the CR1 rs3818361 SNP on AD risk between APOE e4 carriers and noncarriers. Our current findings further suggest that the CR1 \u00c2 APOE interaction also influences an alternative phenotype relevant to early changes in AD pathogenesis by showing that this interaction modulates brain amyloid deposition even in nondemented older individuals.\nOur findings merit examination, in light of a recent study by Brouwers et al. (28) , which showed that four CR1 SNPs in two haplotype blocks were associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid Ab 1-42 levels in AD patients-a finding that is similarly counterintuitive in suggesting that CR1-associated risk for AD might not be associated with increased brain Ab accumulation. A recent study, however, did not find an association between other CR1 SNPs associated with AD risk and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Ab (29) , suggesting that these findings indicate a complex relationship between polymorphic variations in CR1 and regulation of brain Ab clearance. Brouwers et al. (28) also showed that the common AD risk association with CR1 might be explained by a low copy number repeat in high linkage disequilibrium with the risk variant that encodes a longer isoform (CR1-S) of the CR1 protein. This longer isoform has an increased number of C3b/C4b cofactor activity sites, which might have a positive effect on Ab clearance through a C3b-mediated mechanism. However, similar to our present findings, this mechanism suggests that CR1-associated risk for AD in older individuals might not be mediated through increased accumulation of Ab in the brain.\nAlternative mechanisms that might mediate the association between CR1 and brain amyloid levels include its role as an inhibitor of complement activity. However, the net effects of CR1-mediated complement modulation on AD pathogenesis are unclear. Such effects might include, for instance, both a deleterious reduction in C3b-mediated clearance of neurotoxic Ab species from the brain as well as a potentially protective effect through limiting immunemediated damage of healthy neurons (30) .\nIt is interesting to note that recent studies examining the effect of APOE genotype on AD risk associated with genetic variation in CR1 have been inconsistent. Although a recent meta-analysis showed no evidence for an interaction between APOE genotype and CR1 in mediating risk for AD (31) , other reports suggest that the increased risk of AD in carriers of the risk variant of rs3818361 is strongest in APOE e4 carriers (2). Our current results suggest a complex interaction between CR1 and APOE that influences brain amyloid levels in nondemented older individuals. Our findings showing widespread decreases in brain amyloid burden in nondemented carriers of an AD risk variant gene might also be relevant to recent efforts aimed at lowering Ab production or enhancing its clearance in asymptomatic individuals at increased genetic risk for AD (32, 33) . It is worth noting in this context that some previous studies suggest that Ab deposition in the brain might be a protective adaptive response to neuronal stress and therapeutic strategies against it might exacerbate the disease process (34) . Our results showing lower brain amyloid burden in nondemented carriers of the AD risk variant CR1 suggest that, at least in this group of older individuals, further lowering brain amyloid levels might be of doubtful clinical benefit. Furthermore, by showing a robust interaction between the CR1 and APOE genes, our findings also suggest that clinical outcomes of such therapeutic approaches in presymptomatic individuals might be determined by complex gene-gene interactions.\nIt must be noted that the participants included in the 11 C-PiB PET study described herein are derived from the BLSA-NI and represent a highly educated and healthy sample of nondemented older individuals. The nondemented individuals in our study remained so over intensive follow-up of more than 10 years after their entry into the BLSA-NI. Our findings might thus suggest robust compensatory mechanisms in at-risk participants in this cohort that serve to maintain cognitive health. We must also acknowledge that, although we were able to independently replicate our main finding of lower brain amyloid in CR1 risk carriers in the ADNI sample, the small number of subjects in the replication analyses did not allow us to test the presence of a CR1 \u00c2 APOE interaction on brain amyloid in this sample.\nOur findings merit consideration in light of a recent study on the effect of the CR1 rs6656401 SNP on neuritic plaque burden in AD. In their study reporting an association between the rs6656401 A SNP in CR1 and higher neuritic plaque burden in the brain, Chibnik et al. (6) studied 553 older individuals who came to autopsy, of whom 220 carried a pathological diagnosis of AD. It is worth noting that the minor allele frequency (MAF) in our current report (.16 ) is comparable to that in their autopsy sample (.17). However, there are a number of methodological differences between our study and that of Chibnik et al. The latter study was based on an autopsy sample of individuals consisting of both pathologically confirmed AD cases as well as non-AD control subjects. It is not clear whether the association of the rs6656401 A SNP with neuritic plaque burden in their study remained significant when the analysis was restricted to healthy control subjects and whether there was a statistical interaction between the CR1 and APOE risk alleles. Another methodological distinction between our current report and theirs is our use of in vivo amyloid imaging to quantify brain fibrillar amyloid burden in a variety of brain regions that are not typically examined in postmortem brain tissue with Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease criteria (35) . It also is notable that the observed MAF in the rs3818361 SNP in our study is comparable to the index GWAS study by Lambert et al. (2) in a European population where the MAF for this SNP among more than 8000 control subjects was reported to be . 19 . Similarly, a recent metaanalysis of studies describing the association of the CR1 rs3818361 SNP with AD risk included six separate cohorts with a range of the MAF among more than 19,000 control subjects being .17-.23 (36) . Nevertheless, replication of our present findings with in vivo amyloid imaging in a larger sample that is more representative of community-dwelling elderly persons and inclusive of individuals with cognitive impairment might be informative."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, our findings suggest a complex effect of the common AD risk variant CR1 on brain amyloid deposition and its modulation by APOE genotype.
