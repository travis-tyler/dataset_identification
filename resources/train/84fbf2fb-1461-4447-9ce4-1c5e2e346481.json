[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "The Lake Champlain Basin Program's management plan for the Lake Champlain Basin has a strong focus on reducing phosphorus loading from non-point sources. In order to quantify how much phosphorus is entering the lake, it is crucial to have an accurate representation of land use for the Basin. Prior to this mapping effort, the most recent land-use data layer was based on circa 1993 satellite imagery. We created an updated digital land-use/land-cover map for the entire Lake Champlain Basin, referred to as LCB 2001. This updated land-use/land-cover layer was generated by using an expert system that integrated the publicly-available 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) with circa 2001 Landsat satellite imagery and additional Geographic Information System (GIS) datasets. A primary focus of this expert system was to improve the mapping accuracy of the agriculture land-use class by better differentiating it from urban open space, including large-lot exurban development. An accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the classification to high-resolution imagery. The overall accuracy of LCB 2001 was 88%. The user's accuracies (indicating the probability that a sample from the land-cover map is correctly classified) for the urban and agricultural classes, which are considered to be the greatest sources of phosphorous, were 84% and 89% respectively. Using LCB 2001, a retrospective classification was performed to generate a revised circa 1992 land-use/land-cover layer (LCB-R 1992). This layer was generated by incorporating existing circa 1996 change-detection information, circa 1992 Landsat satellite imagery, the previously-developed 1993 layer, and NLCD 1992. Comparative analysis of the new 2001 and 1992 land-use/land-cover layers indicated change was most pronounced in three classes: urban (+1.9%), agriculture (-5.4%), and brush (4.5%). The revised 1992 data were processed to make them compatible with NLCD 2001 and to facilitate analysis of land-use change using future NLCD releases. Both layers are stored as digital GIS data. Using the new land-cover/land-use layers and methods developed by Hegman et al. (1999), we calculated non-point source phosphorus loading and export coefficients for the Basin. We then compared phosphorus loads between the two time periods. Two well-known estimation procedures were used: the export method and the loading method. The export method links the Lake's annual phosphorus load directly to the area of three aggregated land-cover/land-use classes: urban, agriculture, and forest. Because precipitation is not factored into this analysis, the export method represents average conditions in the Basin. The loading method is more involved, depending on runoff concentrations of phosphorus from aggregated land-use/land-cover classes and runoff volume. Precipitation is a key factor in the loading method. In this method, runoff concentrations are calculated for each land use based on annual precipitation data collected from across the Basin. Accordingly, the loading-method estimates better represent the actual phosphorus load in a given year. With the loading method, we calculated year-specific estimates of 479,000 kg (1992) and 561,000 kg (2001). These totals reflect actual precipitation levels during corresponding phosphorus sampling periods (calendar year 1991 and hydrological year 2001-2002). The export-method estimates were 754,000 kg (1992) and 780,000 kg (2001). These totals are larger than previous estimates by Hegman et al. (1999) because they reflect average precipitation over a longer time period, and thus a wider range of meteorological conditions. The difference between the export estimates is a better indicator of change in phosphorus loads over time because this method holds everything but LULC constant. According to the export method analysis, developed land, including urban, exurban, suburban land, and roadways, contributed about 53% of the total phosphorus runoff to Lake Champlain in 2001, while agricultural land contributed 39%. The remainder came from forested land uses. These percentages represent a shift from the previous estimates by Hegman et al. (1999), who assigned 51% of the Basin-wide nonpoint source load to agricultural sources and 37% to urban sources. Factors that contributed to the increased proportion of the load attributed to urban sources included corrections for previous underestimates of urban land cover, changes in export coefficients resulting from recalibration of the multiple regression model to a longer time period of monitoring data, and actual land-use conversion. The difference in annual phosphorus load between 1992 and 2001 was about 26,000 kg. In conjunction with the landscape-change analysis, this finding suggests that land-use changes in the Basin have increased phosphorus levels in Lake Champlain, especially conversion of agricultural areas and forests to developed uses. Urban and suburban land types have a disproportionately large effect on phosphorus loading, and phosphorus levels in Lake Champlain could increase even more as additional areas in the Basin are converted to developed uses. While urban land areas are the largest nonpoint source of phosphorus in the Basin overall, the proportion varies greatly among subwatersheds. For example, agricultural sources are still the highest contributor (about 68%) in the Missisquoi Bay watershed in Vermont. The updated phosphorus estimates developed in this report reflect not only the influence of land-use conversion, but also the effect of improved land-use classification and use of phosphorus measurements collected over a longer study period. These analyses will permit managers to target regions of the Basin that currently contribute high phosphorus loads as well as regions that are likely to experience increased loads in the future. This information will be directly relevant to the Pressure-State-Response indicator framework that may soon be available to Basin planners and managers."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 1: Land Cover Mapping", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The land-cover mapping effort focused on developing two datasets for the Lake Champlain Basin: 1) a new circa 2001 land-use/land-cover (LULC) layer (LCB 2001); and 2) a revised circa 1992 LULC layer (LCB-R 1992) that is comparable with LCB 2001 and that resolves some of the technical issues identified with the original 1993 LULC layer (LCB 1993) commissioned by the Lake Champlain Basin Program (LCBP; see Table  1-1 for a list of commonly-used acronyms). An additional criterion was that the data layers be spatially consistent (pixel size, pixel alignment, and coordinate system) with the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001). LCB 2001 andLCB-R 1992 were developed with the understanding that the primary use of these layers would be to update the phosphorous loading coefficients for Lake Champlain. Table 1-1. List of acronyms used in this report."}, {"section_title": "Acronym Previous LULC Mapping Efforts", "text": "Prior to the start of this project there existed two LULC layers that provided complete or nearly complete coverage for the Basin. LCB 1993 was developed by researchers at Mount Holyoke College for the LCBP using circa 1993 Landsat satellite imagery. NLCD 1992, available for only the portion of the Basin that falls within the United States, was developed by the USGS using circa 1992 imagery. LCB 1993 was the layer used to derive the previous phosphorous loading estimates in 1999 (Hegman et al. 1999). Both these layers have noted inaccuracies. In the case of NLCD 1992 these concerns are reflected in the official NLCD accuracy assessment, which reports an overall accuracy of 47% in region 1 (includes Vermont) and 62% in region 2 (includes New York) (USGS 2006). Although the overall accuracy assessment of the LCB 1993 layer was much higher, 85.9% (VCGI 1997), unpublished analyses of the layer reported overall accuracy assessments as low as 65.6% for the Mad River Watershed. The layer has also been noted to incorrectly classify vegetation located in the vicinity or urban areas as urban areas as urbanized land (Figure 1-1 and Figure 1 -2). This problem appears to be due to the reliance of ancillary data depicting urban boundaries. It is unclear to what extent this leads to an overestimation of urban land, but this methodology does result in an unrealistic representation of the landscape. Both LCB 1993 and NLCD 2001 layers also suffer from class confusion in the agricultural classes, with many isolated agricultural pixels often found in upland forested areas (Figure 1-3). Another problem with LCB 1993 was over-representation of water features. LCB 1993 displays many very small tributary streams that may be little more than a meter in width, but its minimum-mapping unit is 30-m pixels. Hence, these small streams end up being represented by a far larger surface area than they actually do. Errors for both NLCD 1992 and LCB 1993 can largely be attributed to the limitations of the methodologies employed at the time. Although the area is highly forested and has been so for decades, it is classified as urban. Figure 1-3. Examples of isolated agricultural pixels in upland forested areas in LCB 1993 (left) and NLCD 1992 (center), when compared with 2003 aerial imagery (right). Patches in this upland forested area in Bolton, VT are erroneously classified as agriculture, despite that this is an isolated area with no recent history of agriculture. Note also the presence of pixels representing a small tributary that is clearly smaller than the width of those pixels in LCB 1993."}, {"section_title": "Classification Scheme", "text": "LULC was mapped in seven categories, with urban land subdivided into urban and urban-open (urban areas dominated by vegetation), resulting in a total of eight classes. Table 1-2 lists the classification scheme, along with class descriptions. The scheme was designed with several objectives in mind. The first was to accurately map features with distinct phosphorous loading coefficients. The second was to adhere as closely as possible to the aggregate classes used in NLCD 2001. The final was to address a concern expressed by some stakeholders that urban land comprised mostly of vegetation would be confused with agriculture due to the similar spectral properties of lawn grasses and agricultural cover types.   LCB-R 1992 was generated by performing a rule-based, retrospective change detection on LCB 2001 using existing change-detection data, Landsat imagery, LCB 1993, andNLCD 1992. An overview of the methods used to generate LCB-R 1992 from LCB 2001 is presented in Figure 1-5.  Consortium 2006). For the mapping zones that intersect the Lake Champlain Basin, NLCD 2001 was developed by NOAA C-CAP. The principal source of data for NLCD 2001 was multi-temporal imagery from the Landsat satellite series. Of the 29 classes, 19 are found within the Lake Champlain Basin. NLCD 2001 was assessed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. Overall, NLCD 2001 was determined to be a highly accurate product at the level of categorical aggregation needed for this project. Table 1-3 presents the results of a preliminary accuracy assessment of NLCD 2001 carried out at the start of this project based on the eight LCP 2001 classes. Producer's accuracies refer to the percentage of pixels of a given category that were actually classified as that category (i.e. measures errors of omission), and user's accuracies refer to the percentage of pixels classified as a given category that really are in that category (i.e. errors of commission). The purpose was to identify possible deficiencies in NLCD 2001. At the time the accuracy assessment was conducted, data were only available for the Vermont portion of the Basin and the data were in \"pre-release\" status. Table 1-3. Accuracy assessment of pre-release NLCD 2001 data for the Vermont portion of the Lake Champlain Basin. 50 reference points were sampled for each aggregate LULC class, aside from barren (13). National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) orthophotographs acquired in August/September 2003 served as the ground truth. The similarity between the row totals and the diagonals of the matrix indicate the level of producer's accuracy and the similarity between the column totals and the diagonals indicate the user's accuracy. Note: this accuracy assessment was based on pre-release data and should not be used as reference for determining the accuracy of NLCD 2001.  Even in its pre-release state, NLCD 2001 appeared to have an acceptable degree of overall accuracy. The principal sources of error were in the agricultural and urbanopen classes. Specifically urban-open land was often misclassified as agricultural land, resulting in an unacceptable user's accuracy (65%) for agriculture and an unacceptable producer's accuracy (72%) for urban-open. Problems of overhanging canopy on roads resulted in values below 80% for the user's accuracy of the forest class and the producer's accuracy of the urban class. The overlay of road networks was used to correct for this problem (see below). All five errors in which forest pixels were misclassified as wetland occurred due to the palustrine forested wetland class (NLCD 2001 class #91) being aggregated to the wetland class. Based on the difficulty of differentiating between forests and forested palustrine wetlands, we decided to aggregate the palustrine forested wetland class with the forested class for this analysis (Table 1-4). As the goal of the project was to maintain as much consistency with NLCD 2001 as possible, the layer was maintained in its original coordinate system: USA Albers Equal Area Conic, USGS Version, NAD83 datum (meters)."}, {"section_title": "Road Networks", "text": "Given the importance of roads as a land cover feature and the fact that the accuracy assessment of the NLCD pre-release data identified problems in which roads were obscured by overhanging tree canopy, road vector data were obtained for the entire study area and were considered the overriding class in a pixel. That is, if a road vector was present in a pixel, it was assigned to the urban class, regardless of the proportion of the pixel it accounted for. Table 1-5 lists the sources from which the road data were obtained. Preprocessing performed on the road data included: 1) projecting the data to the USA Albers Equal Area Conic, USGS Version, NAD83 datum coordinate system, 2) editing the data to resolve overshoots and undershoots at the edges of the three regions, and 3) edits to insure alignment with the Landsat imagery at locations where roads were visible on the imagery. Satellite imagery was acquired to fulfill two purposes: 1) classification refinement and 2) change detection. Complete Landsat coverage of the Lake Champlain Basin (LCB) required three Landsat scenes from the following path/rows: 13/29, 14/29, and 14/30 Landsat scenes were acquired from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium (http://www.mrlc.gov/download_data.asp) and were already corrected for geometric and atmospheric distortions. The scenes acquired were the same ones used to generate NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001. For each path/row an early spring (May) and late summer (August/September) scene was acquired for the 1992 and 2001 time periods. An exception to this was in the case of path 13, row 29 where a July scene had to be substituted for the 1992 year because no May scene existed in the MRLC archives. The scenes obtained from the MRLC Consortium were those used to produce the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) for 1992 and 2001. Table 1-6 summarizes the scenes acquired for this project. Scenes from the 1992 period, acquired in the UTM coordinate system, were geometrically corrected and projected to match their corresponding 2001 scene. The RMS tolerance for the geometric correction was \u00bd a pixel. No fewer than 300 tie points were used for each scene. A second-order polynomial function was used for the geometric model with cubic convolution as the resampling method. Examination of the scenes showed defects consisting of spurious returns. Spurious returns were only noted in two fall scenes from the 1992 time period, 13/29 and 14/30. The spurious returns typically consisted of clumps of 4-6 pixels that have markedly higher returns of one of the following three types when compared to neighboring pixels and the scene in general: bands 1 and 2, band 3, and band 4. This information was used to exclude these pixels from the change-detection process. Five scenes were found to have clouds present: 13/29 -spring 1992, 14/29 -spring 1993, 14/29 -fall 2000, 14/29 -fall 1993, 14/30 fall 1999. Cloud pixels were excluded from the class refinement and change-detection process."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural and Urban Open Space Data", "text": "As agricultural land (particularly pasture) and urban open space land have similar spectral profiles in Landsat imagery, the classification errors identified in the preliminary accuracy assessment of NLCD 2001 (Table 1-3) were unavoidable and could not be resolved using Landsat imagery. In addition the LCBP's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) strongly recommended the use of all available ancillary data sources to improve the classification of agricultural land. The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) maintains digital layers of agricultural land boundaries as part of the Common Land Unit (CLU) database. While CLU data is spatially detailed (3-m tolerance), it lacks attribute data. This is problematic as CLU polygons represent all land owned by someone who participates in USDA programs, regardless of whether that land is actually being used for agriculture. The result is that CLU polygons may represent buildings, woodlots, or brush. Land-cover data that the USDA maintains as part of the CLU-mapping process are not releasable outside of USDA. The need to create an improved CLU layer, one that would more accurately depict agricultural land in addition to developing an urban open space layer, was balanced against the fact that the development of such a dataset would require extensive manual editing and photointerpretation, a time-consuming process. To focus this effort, counties where agricultural land had been replaced by urban land were identified using a combination of US Census (US Census Bureau 2006) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) agricultural census (USDA 2002) data. Increases in the number of households and change in acreage of land in farms were examined for each county that intersected the Basin (Figure 1-6). The assumption was that decreases in land in farms, particularly when there was a corresponding increase in the number of households, would indicate the presence of tracts of urban open land that could easily be confused with agriculture when using Landsat satellite imagery as the basis for classification. Addison, Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle, and Rutland Counties in Vermont were prioritized for improved CLU development and urban open space delineation based upon the analysis in Figure 1-6, the availability of CLU data, and the capacity to leverage previous improvements in the CLU layer carried out by the SAL as part of a separate project. Franklin County in New York and Caledonia County in Vermont did have relatively large reductions in land devoted to farms, but CLU data were not available until late in the project for Franklin County and only a small percentage of Caledonia County falls within the Basin. The Improved CLU layer was generated by removing CLU polygons that were not in agricultural land use, editing CLU polygons that did not accurately depict field boundaries, and digitizing urban open space land. The reference data for this work were the 2003 true-color NAIP orthophotographs. For Addison, Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle, and Rutland Counties in Vermont, the Improved CLU layer consisted of polygons labeled as either \"confirmed agriculture\" or \"confirmed urban open space\" (Figure 1-7). For all other counties, the layer consisted of polygons labeled as \"possible agriculture,\" as the original CLU polygons were used, which indicate the land is owned by a farmer but not necessarily in agricultural land use. It should be noted that no CLU data were available for the Quebec portion of the Basin. However, the need to differentiate between urban open land and agricultural land is less in the Champlain Basin portion of Quebec, given its relatively small amount of suburban and exurban residential development and its very high proportion of working agricultural lands. "}, {"section_title": "LCB 2001", "text": "LCB 2001 was produced largely by improving NLCD 2001 using ancillary data. The process of generating LCB 2001 was comprised of three phases: 1) overlay of roads, 2) expert system classification, and 3) assessment and manual correction ( Figure 1-4). Phase 1 was carried out using the aggregate 8-class version of NLCD 2001 (Table 1-4). The corrected road vector lines were converted to a raster layer with a cell size and alignment matching that of NLCD 2001. The road pixels were incorporated into the NLCD 2001 layer using standard raster overlay procedures in which any pixel in NLCD 2001 that corresponded with a road pixel was reassigned to the urban category. An example of this process is shown in Figure 1  The expert system was employed largely to deal with the accuracy issues surrounding agriculture and urban open land (Table 1-3). Edge effects and registration differences between NLCD 2001 and the Improved CLU layer made simply overlaying the two an unacceptable solution. To overcome this limitation, the expert system was developed and deployed using Definiens Professional software (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany). The expert system took advantage of Definiens Professional's ability to \"segment\" object polygons from image and thematic raster layers. Image object polygons are groups of pixels with similar spectral and spatial characteristics. Image object polygons allow for the inclusion of rules based on complex topological relationships. For this project the image objects were derived from both the spring and fall circa 2001 Landsat satellite scenes, but were constrained to the boundaries of the Improved CLU layer and NLCD 2001. Thus, each object polygon consisted of groups of pixels that were spectrally and spatially similar and share the same attributes with respect to the Improved CLU layer and the NLCD 2001 layer. The rules employed by the expert system are illustrated graphically in Figure 1-9. The expert system first evaluated whether the object fell into the confirmed agriculture or urban-open categories based on the Improved CLU layer. If either of these tests proved true, the object was assigned to the corresponding class. If the test failed, the alternate scenarios were evaluated. For objects originally classified as agriculture in NLCD 2001, the object was assigned to the output agriculture class only if the object bordered an object already classified as agriculture (to deal with edge effects and layer alignment issues) or if the object was also in the Improved CLU layer's possible agriculture category. This rule ran in an iterative loop to compensate for the fact that, once objects were classified as agriculture, they would influence other border objects. The rule only stopped executing once all objects were finished changing their class assignment. If the object was not assigned to the output agriculture class at this stage (those classified as agriculture in NLCD 2001, but not in LCB 2001) it was evaluated using a series of spectral and spatial rules to assign it to the output brush or urban-open classes. This set of spectral and spatial rules applied a fuzzy-class assignment. The object was more likely to be brush the darker it was and the further it was from urban areas. The object was more likely to be urban if it was near urban areas and brighter. For all other classes, the objects adopted the NLCD 2001 class. Following the running of the expert system, the output classification was manually compared to the Landsat imagery and any objects that appeared to be misclassified were reassigned. "}, {"section_title": "LCB-R 1992", "text": "LCB-R 1992 was generated by performing a retrospective change detection on LCB 2001 using circa 1992 imagery, circa 1996 change detection data, and existing LULC (LCB 1993 andNLCD 1992). As with LCB 2001, a rule-based expert system was employed that classified objects based on a combination of reflectance from imagery and thematic layers. Prior to running the expert system, existing change detection data from NOAA C-CAP's change analysis product (NOAA 2007) were incorporated. The C-CAP change analysis product depicts thematic change between circa 1996 and 2001 (NLCD 2001) land-cover products. The limitation of the C-CAP change detection dataset is that errors were not taken into account when the change detection was performed, resulting in unrealistic change patterns in certain cases (e.g. urban in 1996 to forest in 2001). The change patterns that were considered realistic, and were used to reclassify pixels in LCB 2001 to the new class in LCB-R 1992, are listed in Table 1-7.

If the tasseled-cap coefficients for brightness and greenness were virtually identical to a fall circa 1992 Landsat image object, but greenness values were much higher, this would indicate that the object was likely agriculture in 1992. This pattern is logical based on the assumption that haying a field could expose the soil during one time period for a given year, resulting in high brightness and low greenness values, but the presence of hay would give the object a higher greenness values at the other time period in the year. The expert system then effectively flagged the object as \"possibly agriculture in 1992.\" Final LCB-R 1992 class assignment for this object would be contingent on the object containing agricultural pixels from both NLCD 1992 and LCB 1993."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment", "text": "Accuracy assessment was only performed on the LCB 2001 layer due to the lack of available ground truth data for the circa 1992 time period. The ground truth source data for LCB 2001 consisted of 2003 NAIP orthophotos for Vermont, 2003 color-infrared orthophotos for New York, and a high-resolution 2001 IKONOS satellite image for Quebec. Accuracy assessment procedures were performed in accordance with Congalton and Green (1999). A completely randomized sampling would have forced an unmanageable number of ground truth points for the entire Basin to be generated in order to reach Congalton and Green's (1999) recommended minimum sample size of 50 per class due to the overwhelming presence of forest. It would have also led to a situation in which the error matrix would have largely reflected LCB 2001's accuracy with respect to the forest class. As the forest class contributes relatively little to phosphorus loading compared to agricultural and urban areas, the LCB 2001 layer was stratified into forested and non-forested areas for the purposes of sampling. For the forested areas, 500 random sample points were generated while 700 points were generated for the non-forested areas. Of these 1,200 points, 83 had to be discarded due to unavailability of ground truth imagery (Table 1 -8). This was particularly a problem in Quebec, where available high-resolution satellite imagery only covered a small portion of the study area. Each point was assigned a class based on the reference data and compared to its class assignment in LCB 2001. If the class assignment was incorrect, the data were examined to determine if the error was caused by an actual error in the LCB 2001 layer or if it was due to georeferencing errors between the ground truth imagery and LCB 2001. If the analyst had a high degree of certainty, based on the spatial pattern of pixels in LCB 2001, and a correctly classified pixel lay within 45m (the diagonal distance from the center of one pixel to the next), the analyst had the discretion to change the class assignment for the ground truth point.

Note that export results are also reported according to Diagnostic Feasibility Study watersheds (Appendix L), HUC8 watersheds (Appendix M), New York HUC11 watersheds (Appendix N), Vermont HUC12 watersheds (Appendix O), and Basin towns (Appendix P). For LCB-R 1992, a total Basin-wide estimate of 753,781 kg was calculated, with the Missisquoi Bay-VT, Otter Creek-VT, and Main Lake-VT segments contributing the largest amounts by weight (Table 2-10 and Figure 2-3). Burlington Bay, the smallest lake segment, contributed the highest export per unit area, followed by Shelburne Bay and Port Henry-VT. These small watersheds tend to be the most developed regions in the Basin, with high proportions of the URB category. The URB category was the largest phosphorus source in most of the large lake segment; notable exceptions were the Missisquoi Bay and Isle La Motte segments, where AG contributed more. Across the Basin, URB accounted for 50% of the phosphorus load, followed by 42% for AG and about 8% for the FOR category. Figure 2-3. Phosphorus loads for Lake Champlain segments using LCB-R 1992 -export method. The Basin-wide estimate was much larger than the export total of 471,270 kg provided by Hegman et al. (1999), but it undoubtedly reflects the wider range of meteorological conditions inherent in averaged coefficients. Hegman's estimate was based on a single year of phosphorus measurements (1991), which was relatively dry, and subsequent sampling periods recorded higher measurements in most watersheds. In fact, the Basin-wide mean precipitation value for 1991 was 35.8 in, well below the longterm average (38.5 in). The new estimate also likely reflects the better presentation of urban areas in LCB-R 1992; nearly all of the lake segments in this layer had a higher percentage of the URB class compared to LCB 1993. The export results for LCB 2001 demonstrated a similar pattern among lake segments; Otter Creek-VT, Missisquoi Bay-VT, and Main Lake-VT were again the largest contributors by weight while Burlington Bay, Shelburne Bay, and other smaller watersheds had the highest export per unit area (Table 2-11 and Figure 2-4). URB was the single-largest source of phosphorus in all watersheds except the Missisquoi Bay segments and parts of Isle La Motte and South Lake A, where AG was the largest contributor. Basin-wide, URB contributed to more than 53% of the total phosphorus load; AG contributed about 39% while FOR contributed almost 8%. However, the total export estimate of 779,877 kg was more than 26,000 kg larger than the estimate for LCB-R 1992, a substantial increase in the decade between mapping periods. Because we used the same export coefficients with LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 (including outlier watersheds), the primary variables were the maps themselves. Consequently, the increase in total export is likely attributable to land-use changes in the Basin, especially conversion of agriculture and forests to developed uses. In every major lake segment, the proportion of land devoted to the AG category declined while URB increased, and the Basin-wide increase in the URB category was about 0.7%. Although seemingly small, the ultimate effect of this change was an increase of nearly 15,000 ha in the URB category. Combined with the larger magnitude of the URB coefficient, this expansion of the URB land area contributed to the observed increase in total phosphorus export.

Excluding water, the next largest classes are agriculture (14%) and urban areas (5%). There are some considerable differences between LCB 2001 and NLCD 2001 worth noting (Figure 1-11). Urban area was 121% greater in LCB 2001 compared to NLCD 2001 due to the overlaying of road data, a process that is also largely responsible for the 3% decrease in forested area. There were a number of differences in LCB 2001 relative to NLCD 2001 due to refinement of the agricultural class using the Improved CLU layer, including a 16% decrease in measured agricultural land area, a 12% increase in brush area, a 34% decrease in barren land area, and a 297% increase in urban open land. An example of the impact of overlaying roads and using the expert system to refine the agricultural class is presented in Figure 1-12.

Note that estimates of urban land were 23% greater in LCB-R 1992 relative to LCB 1993 and estimates of agricultural land were 5% lower. Without access to imagery from the 1992 period, which is necessary for a detailed comparison, it is impossible to quantitatively assess which layer more accurately depicts LULC in the early 1990s. As pointed out earlier, there are issues with LCB 1993 that could explain the greater estimates for urban, agriculture, and water. However, it is also quite likely that LCB-R 1992 is underestimating change, particularly in the agricultural class where the spectral variability of the class and the lack of circa 1992 CLU data make it difficult to confirm change. There is evidence that a more detailed roads layer, particularly for the New York portion of the Basin contributes, to differences in the urban estimates. Differing techniques for mapping wetlands between the two layers affected both the forest and wetland estimates. The increase in urban land should be accepted with the understanding that, without the Improved CLU ancillary data, it is likely that some of change detected is actually urban-open land being misclassified as agriculture. The relatively small changes in overall LULC over time can be attributed to three factors: 1) a conservative rule for defining change in the expert system, 2) the concentration of change in specific regions occupying a relatively small portion of the Basin, and 3) the inherent challenges of remote sensing-based change detection.  The overall accuracy of LCB 2001 is 88% (Table 1-9). LCB 2001 has an acceptable overall accuracy. From an end user's perspective, which that matters most for calculating phosphorous coefficients, there are several areas that warrant further discussion. The overlaying of roads resulted in an overestimation of the urban class at the expense of forest. The inherent limitations of taking a linear feature, such as a road, and converting it to a raster format, make such overestimations inevitable. Brush proved difficult to classify correctly, largely because it is a class that can appear spectrally similar to both forest and agriculture. Confusion with forest (i.e., assignment of the NLCD 2001 palustrine forest class to forest rather than wetland) largely contributed to the 60% user's accuracy for the wetland class. Although the user's accuracy for the urban-open class is quite low at 69%, most of the confusion occurred with the urban class; because these classes are aggregated for phosphorous modeling, the user's accuracy for the aggregated class would be 87%. A value of 89% for the agricultural class can be considered to be very successful and is likely attributable to implementation of the Improved CLU layer using the expert system. Although no CLU layer was available for the Quebec portion of the Basin, there was no evidence that this data gap reduced accuracy, presumably because the landscape is more homogeneous (i.e., this region is dominated by agricultural land uses and has little topographic variation).

Nutrients and other pollutants from a variety of sources are annually exported to the lake in runoff emanating from its surrounding watersheds, and phosphorus is a particular concern because of its effect on algal growth and lake euthrophication (LCBP 2003). In an initial assessment of nonpoint phosphorus pollution in Lake Champlain, Budd and Meals (1994) estimated the allocation of phosphorus from different land-use categories, finding that agricultural lands export more phosphorus than other land types but that urban lands exert a disproportionately large effect on total export values. In a follow-up assessment, Hegman et al. (1999) refined the analysis of land use and phosphorus export, finding similar results but noting the increased importance of urban areas as more forests and agricultural lands are converted to urban and suburban uses. Hegman et al. based their analysis on land-use data developed from 1993 Landsat satellite imagery, which is now almost a decade and a half old. Consequently, an updated analysis based on more recent and improved land-cover data is needed to provide new basin-wide phosphorus estimates and to further elucidate the relationship between landscape characteristics and phosphorus pollution. In the following section, we present revised phosphorus estimates based on an analysis of the new LULC map for 2001, or LCB 2001, and regression models developed from estimated phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain. For comparison, we also present new phosphorus estimates for the early 1990s using the revised 1992 LULC map, or LCB-R 1992. Both analyses use the estimation methods presented in Hegman et al., including development of separate phosphorus export and loading coefficients for equations predicting the mass of phosphorus annually transported to Lake Champlain. The export method develops coefficients that are representative values for the mass of phosphorus exported per unit area per year (kg/ha/yr); it is based directly on the area of aggregated LULC classes in individual watersheds. The loading method uses coefficients equivalent to runoff concentrations (mg/L) from aggregated LULC classes and interpolated runoff volume based on measured rainfall at stations located throughout the Basin. Note that full descriptions of the analytical methods will not be provided here; for more information see Hegman et al. (1999)."}, {"section_title": "Estimating Export and Loading Coefficients", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Land-use data necessary for estimating new export and loading coefficients were obtained from LCB 2001. The 8 LULC classes represented in the new maps were aggregated into 3 categories that share known or potential functional characteristics: Urban (URB), Agriculture (AG), and Forest (FOR) ( Table 2-1). The original Wetlands category was excluded from these aggregates because wetlands likely serve as phosphorus sinks, rather than sources, in the region (Weller et al. 1996). The Barren and Water categories were also excluded. For comparative analyses, the same aggregated LULC classes were used with LCB-R 1992. these annual estimates were based on a 2-year average of phosphorus measurements from consecutive hydrological years (e.g., the phosphorus load listed for 1993-1994 was the average of measurements for hydrological years 1992-1993 and 1993-1994). However, only 1991 measurements were available for all 30 watersheds; since 1991 only 17 of the largest Basin watersheds from the original 30 have been measured in each hydrological year (Table 2-2). These watersheds constitute 85% (1,715,729 ha) of the Basin. Note that the 30 watersheds analyzed by Hegman et al. constituted 91% of the Basin; excluded areas in the earlier study pertained to watersheds that drain directly into the lake without an identified first-order stream and one small watershed (Little Ausable River) that was not sufficiently well delineated to permit GIS analysis. The watersheds excluded by Hegman et al. were also excluded in this study. See Medalie and Smeltzer (2004) for more information on phosphorus export estimation methods. Most precipitation datasets used in runoff-and loading-coefficient calculations were previously developed by Hegman et al., who compiled annual precipitation measurements from 57 stations in the Basin for the period 1951-1996 and then converted them into a single raster layer representing the mean for the period (IDW method, 12 nearest neighbors, power of 2). Hegman et al. also acquired annual precipitation data (39 stations) for 1991 and used them to produce a precipitation layer that coincided with phosphorus measurements for that calendar year. To match the new LULC datasets, we converted the existing precipitation layers from a cell size of 25x25m to 30x30m. We also acquired annual precipitation data for 2001-2002 (48 stations); data for Vermont and New York were obtained from the National Climate Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/monitoring.html) and data for Quebec were obtained from the National Climate Archive at Environment Canada (www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca). We then used IDW to convert them into an interpolated precipitation layer that coincided with the 2001-2002 phosphorus export estimates from VTDEC. Streamflow data used in runoff-coefficient calculations were also adapted from Hegman et al., who obtained mean annual stream volume (Q) measurements for 11 watersheds with USGS streamwater gauging stations. These data contained readings for observations for 7 to 75 years, and most of the 11 watersheds contained at least 40 years of readings."}, {"section_title": "Statistical and Spatial Analyses", "text": "We used multiple linear regression analysis to develop coefficients for separate export and loading equations.

Accordingly, we initially developed separate regression equations for each of the 6 available sampling periods. LULC summaries from LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 were used for the beginning and ending sampling periods, respectively, but we estimated LULC totals per watershed for intervening sampling periods using linear extrapolation. Assuming a linear rate of change in LULC area totals between 1992 and 2001, we divided the difference between each watershed-specific LULC class by the number of time intervals (5) and then sequentially added this incremental change to each class. This procedure produced a coarse but usable estimate of LULC totals per sampling period. We regressed the area of each aggregated LULC category in each watershed against phosphorus measurements for the 6 available sampling periods, identifying the bestfitting individual model for each actual and extrapolated LULC dataset. All aggregated LULC categories (URB, AG, FOR) were included in final regression models to illustrate the relationship among them, regardless of variable significance. However, the y-intercept was forced through zero. We then averaged the coefficients for the best dataset-specific models to derive a general equation relating phosphorus export to LULC classes. Coefficients were averaged across different LULC datasets only when each regression model contained the same variables. All export coefficient calculations were based on 15 of the 17 watersheds for which phosphorus measurements have been collected continuously during the period 1991-2002. The Missisquoi and Pike watersheds were excluded a priori from these calculations because Hegman et al. (1999) identified them as consistent outliers in their analysis. They demonstrated that the intensive nature of agricultural operations in these watersheds overwhelmed the phosphorus/land-use area relationship. To accommodate highly agricultural watersheds, Hegman et al. used animal-unit data to adjust final phosphorus estimates; watersheds with a disproportionately high number of agricultural animals were assumed to export more phosphorus than predicted by the AG regression coefficient. However, the animal-unit adjustment method was not used in this study because we could not obtain recent animal-unit data for the entire Basin. Instead, we simply adjusted the AG regression coefficient for the Pike and Missisquoi by solving numerically for the coefficient that would produce the observed phosphorus export. Because the Missisquoi and Pike were excluded from all final regression models, we averaged the adjusted AG coefficients to produce a single adjusted value for each watershed."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Runoff Coefficients", "text": "Runoff coefficients necessary for generating LULC-specific runoff volumes (used later in loading models) were developed from historical streamflow data and long-term precipitation data .

The precipitation volume (m 3 ) per aggregated LULC class in each watershed was then calculated by multiplying the area of each class by mean annual precipitation (long-term precipitation surface). Last, the relationship between long-term streamflow and precipitation was examined in a regression equation with annual streamflow as the dependent variable and the precipitation volumes for the LULC classes as independent variables. We performed this analysis with both LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001, developing unique runoff coefficients for each LULC map.

Consequently, we calculated unique loading coefficients for LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 using the phosphorus sampling periods that most closely match them (1991 and 2001-2002, respectively). As with the export method, loading-coefficient calculations were based on 15 watersheds, with the Missisquoi and Pike excluded a priori. First, we estimated the total annual precipitation that fell on each LULC category in each watershed, on a cell-by-cell basis in ArcGIS, using the year-specific precipitation layers. Second, we calculated the runoff volume from each LULC category by multiplying the annual precipitation totals by the runoff coefficients determined for each LULC dataset. We then regressed phosphorus measurements against runoff volume to produce a sampling period-specific equation (i.e., one equation for LCB-R 1992 based on 1991 precipitation data and one equation for LCB 2001 based on 2001-2002 precipitation data)."}, {"section_title": "Variance Analysis", "text": "To confirm the fundamental assumption that the loading method provides a better estimate of year-specific phosphorus pollution, we used the coefficients developed for the export and loading methods to examine the amount of variance between observed and predicted phosphorus estimates. Because the loading method directly incorporates precipitation, presumably it provides a more precise phosphorus estimate (i.e., less variance). If true, this pattern would also support the analytical design that we selected for developing final export coefficients (i.e., calculation of year-specific coefficients for each of the 6 actual or extrapolated LULC datasets by followed by averaging) by demonstrating that annual fluctuations in phosphorus measurements are indeed attributable to a process effect (i.e., precipitation) rather than solely measurement error. Under this scenario, an alternative analytical method that averages phosphorus measurements prior to regression analysis would be biased by the amount of rainfall and runoff that occurred in the years chosen for sampling. Performing regressions on individual sampling years allows some estimation of year-toyear variance in coefficients due to runoff variability; thus, both a range and a mean for desired land-use coefficients can be estimated. Export coefficients could also be weighted according to how close individual sampling years were to the long-term runoff average, producing coefficients that are perhaps more useful from a management perspective because they better represent typical runoff conditions. Using the average export coefficients described above, we calculated predicted phosphorus totals for the set of 15 watersheds used in regression modeling and then calculated the deviation between each estimate and the actual phosphorus measurement. We performed this analysis for both LCB-R 1992and LCB 2001(and the corresponding phosphorus measurements for 1991and 2001-2002 and then calculated the variance in the mean deviations for the two datasets. For the loading method, we performed a similar analysis using a single set of loading coefficients developed by averaging the year-specific regression equations for LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001. Again note, however, that loading coefficients were not averaged prior to calculating final phosphorus estimates; average loading coefficients were used only in the variance analysis to permit standardized comparison of observed and predicted phosphorus values.\nThe variance analysis demonstrated that the loading method provides a much more precise estimate of phosphorus output; variance between observed and predicted phosphorus measurements was lower by an order of magnitude compared to the export method (Table 2-8). This result supports the assumption that the loading method provides a better year-specific assessment of total phosphorus by directly incorporating precipitation. It also supports the assumption that annual variability in phosphorus measurements is primarily a process effect attributable to environmental conditions rather than sampling error. Accordingly, we believe that the analytical approach of calculating a separate set of regression coefficients for each available phosphorus sampling year is appropriate; by treating sampling years as individual data points, this approach creates coefficients that reflect year-specific conditions. Because the export method provides a generalized interpretation of phosphorus output, it is then reasonable to average multiple sets of year-specific coefficients, producing a single set of coefficients that accommodate annual variability in phosphorus measurements. This approach reduces potential bias by focusing on the central tendency of the export coefficients rather than the central tendency of the phosphorus measurements, avoiding an underestimate of the magnitude of annual phosphorus fluctuations. A possible criticism of this approach is that, although annual phosphorus measurements are independent data points, the LULC datasets with which they are matched are not, especially the four extrapolated datasets. However, we believe that a linear rate of land-use change is a reasonable assumption for the 10-year interval between LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001. Furthermore, the LULC datasets were not used as data points in inferential statistics, which would require strict data independence. In this case the key consideration is the effect of annual variability on export coefficients, and extrapolated LULC datasets permit use of the entire set of available phosphorus measurements. Note that the results of the variance analysis also theoretically support use of average loading coefficients, but we instead chose to focus on the utility of the loading method in calculating year-specific phosphorus estimates. Loading coefficients (and corresponding runoff coefficients) developed for individual years produce the best possible estimate of phosphorus loading in those years, providing an informative contrast to the general conditions represented by export method. Consequently, only year-specific loading and runoff coefficients were used in final Basin-wide phosphorus estimates. "}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analysis for the FOR Coefficient", "text": "Although Hegman et al. (1999) found that the FOR coefficient was not significant in regression modeling, they kept this coefficient in their final export and loading equations because it fell within a low range of values identified from previous studies. Because similar non-significant coefficients were possible in this study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the effect of different FOR coefficient values on phosphorus estimates. In conjunction with methods described later in the section \"Applying Coefficients to Estimate Phosphorus Loading to Lake Champlain,\" we first used average export coefficients as calculated above to develop Basin-wide phosphorus estimates. We then substituted the average FOR coefficient with values from the literature and recalculated Basin-wide estimates. Relying on a literature review by Hegman et al. (1999), we used 0.10 kg/ha/yr as a mid-range value for the FOR coefficient and 0.39 kg/ha/yr as a high-range value. We compared the resulting phosphorus estimates, and the contribution of FOR to these totals, to determine the most appropriate FOR value for final Basin-wide phosphorus modeling using the export method.\nThe average FOR coefficient (export method) identified by regression analysis (0.04 kg/ha/yr) produced a predicted phosphorus contribution of about 60,000 kg for both LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001, or almost 8% of the total contribution for these LULC datasets (Table 2-9). Considering that the FOR category changed relatively little during the 10year interval, the similarity of these results was not unexpected and was also observed with the other FOR-coefficient values used for comparison. However, the mid-range literature value of 0.10 kg/ha/yr more than doubled the FOR contribution, to more than 16% for both LULC datasets, and the high-range value (0.39 kg/ha/yr) increased the FOR contribution by 5 times. The high-range value clearly exaggerated the FOR contribution, but we believe that the mid-range value also inflated it unnecessarily; only one FOR coefficient from the 6 year-specific export equations exceeded the mid-range value (0.14 kg/ha/yr for 1995-1996 data) and the remaining coefficients had a value of 0.06 or smaller. Furthermore, the average value of 0.04 corresponds to a value determined previously for the Basin by Hegman et al. (1999) and is within the low-range literature values identified by these authors. We thus decided to use this value in all subsequent phosphorus modeling with the export method. For the loading method, we likewise concluded that the magnitude of the coefficient values identified by regression analysis was appropriate for the contribution of the FOR category to total phosphorus estimates; the FOR values for both LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 (-0.004 and 0.01 mg/L, respectively) were within the low-range literature values reviewed by Hegman et al. (1999). Recognizing the need for a small, positive contribution from the FOR category, however, we substituted the negative value of -0.004 for LCB-R 1992 with a literature value of 0.005 in final Basin-wide phosphorus modeling. We chose this substitute value because it matches the value identified by Hegman et al. (1999) for the same phosphorus sampling period."}, {"section_title": "Export Coefficients", "text": "Export equations developed for individual sampling periods varied widely, especially the URB and AG coefficients (Table 2-3). The FOR coefficient was not significant in any of the models and generally had a much smaller effect on estimated phosphorus, but it was included in the models to illustrate the relative effects of the 3 aggregated LULC categories. represented watershed, and AG and FOR are the areas for the aggregate Agriculture and Forest categories, respectively. \u2022 Underline indicates that a coefficient was significant at p < 0.05; italics indicate that a coefficient was significant at p < 0.10; all other URB and AG coefficients were marginally significant at p < 0.15; no FOR coefficients were significant. \u2022 Export coefficients are expressed as kg/ha/yr. \u2022 Phosphorus export is expressed in kg/yr. The wide range of coefficient values in both the regular and extrapolated sets was likely a reflection of the high annual variability in phosphorus output measurements (Appendix K), which in turn was a function of the variability in annual runoff. This fundamental relationship was particularly evident in the close tracking of measured non-point phosphorus (Figure 2-1) and gauged river flows (Figure 2-2). Not surprisingly, a regression equation linking these variables indicated a strong association (Non-point phosphorus= 0.2285*Flow -1241; R 2 = 0.97). The initial sampling year, 1991, was a period of relatively low flows, and the low phosphorus measurements reflected this pattern. Subsequent sampling periods generally had higher phosphorus totals, in some cases much higher (e.g., 1997-1998), and the magnitude of the URB coefficients roughly followed these fluctuations. The AG coefficient did not follow this pattern as closely, but its highest value coincided with the highest-flow year. Because the dominant interannual variance in phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain is driven by fluctuations in precipitation, this outcome was not unexpected. However, a better predictor of interannual variation might be peak spring runoff volume. Consequently, the use of export coefficients might be improved by taking into account annual runoff conditions. In years with high precipitation, URB and AG coefficients can be much higher than in years with average or low precipitation. This fundamental weakness in the export models drives use of the loading approach and its direct incorporation of runoff.  1991 1993-1994 1995-1996 1997-1998 1999-2000 2001-2002 Phosphorus Load (mt/yr)  1991 1993-1994 1995-1996 1997-1998 1999-2000 2001-2002 Flow (millions of cubic meters per year) Source: Eric Smeltzer, VTDEC The adjusted AG coefficients for the Missisquoi and Pike watersheds also varied widely but roughly showed the same pattern illustrated by total measured phosphorus and stream flow (Table 2-4). Furthermore, they suggest that Basin-wide regression equations under-predict phosphorus export from these watersheds; both adjusted coefficients were about 3 times the magnitude of the regular AG coefficient.  Hegman et al. (1999) reported an URB coefficient of 1.5 kg/ha/yr and an AG coefficient of 0.42 kg/ha/yr (URB/AG ratio = 3.6). Given the range of annual precipitation that they encompass, the average URB and AG coefficients reported here were predictably larger than the values reported by Hegman et al. Although the 1991 coefficients derived in this study, 1.89 kg/ha/yr for URB and 0.37 kg/ha/yr for AG (Table 2-3), were reasonably consistent with Hegman's values, the phosphorus measurements from 1991 represented the lowest phosphorus output among the 6 years of available data. Furthermore, average streamflow for the gauging stations used in this study (see \"Calculation of Runoff Coefficients\" in the Methods section) was 24% higher for the 6 sampling periods compared to the long-term average for the same gauging stations. Because the export method does not directly incorporate annual runoff, the average export coefficients reported in Table 2-3 are probably a little high for modeling average annual phosphorus output from land use/land cover alone. Nonetheless, the URB/AG ratio of 4.1 for average export coefficients in this study (Table  2-3) was quite close to ratio of 3.6 reported by Hegman et al. (based on 27 watersheds). This comparison suggests that, regardless of precipitation and runoff conditions, the fundamental relationship between phosphorus export and landuse/land-cover conditions does not vary substantially. The higher URB vs. AG coefficients in Table 2-3 reflect real differences in the processes exporting phosphorus to Lake Champlain. Variation in the URB/AG ratio for the 6 individual sampling periods probably reflects the precision at which watershed outputs of phosphorus can be measured for a single year, making the ratio somewhat sensitive to small changes in phosphorus output from each watershed. Thus, the most stable way to estimate the ratio is likely through use of average URB and AG coefficients."}, {"section_title": "Runoff Coefficients", "text": "Regression equations relating long-term average streamflow to runoff per LULC category predictably indicated a strong, positive relationship between these phenomena, with R 2 values approaching 100% for both LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 (Table 2-5). \u2022 Where URB is the amount of precipitation (m 3 ) falling on all aggregated Urban land-use categories in each of the 11 gauged watersheds; AG and FOR are the precipitation amounts falling on the aggregated Agriculture and Forest categories, respectively. \u2022 Underline indicates that a coefficient was significant at p < 0.05; italics indicate that a coefficient was significant at p < 0.10. \u2022 Runoff coefficients are unitless (i.e., they represent the proportion of precipitation falling on each watershed that ultimately runs into a first-order stream where flow is measured).

The availability of improved LULC maps was a likely factor in this discrepancy, especially improved delineation of urban areas adjacent to agricultural zones and the corresponding reduction of the AG category. These higheryielding runoff areas, when removed from the AG category, likely decreased the estimated runoff yield from agricultural areas.

In accordance with export results, however, the URB coefficient for LCB-R 1992 was larger than the value reported by Hegman et al., as was the URB/AG ratio (3.3 vs. 2.3). These differences indicate a greater contribution of the URB category to phosphorus loading than previously reported. Better representation of the URB and AG classes in LCB-R 1992 was again the likely factor in this shift. For LCB 2001, the URB/AG ratio (2.1) was slightly lower, but given the expected variance in our estimates, we did not consider this discrepancy noteworthy. Note that average loading coefficients are provided in Table 2-6 for comparison and possible use in subsequent management efforts.

Also, URB was the primary phosphorus contributor in all watersheds except the Missisquoi Bay segments and parts of Isle La Motte and South Lake A, where AG accounted for 55-70% of the estimated load. Basin-wide, URB contributed about 55% of the total load, followed by 38% for AG and about 7% for the FOR category. The total estimated load of 479,238 kg was comparable to the total reported by Hegman for the same period (473,052 kg), even though we used year-specific precipitation totals rather than long-term mean precipitation. This is an important distinction because the annual mean precipitation value for the 1991 sampling period was lower than the long-term precipitation mean for the Basin (35.8 vs. 38.5 in). In fact, use of long-term precipitation data with LCB-R 1992 increased the loading estimate to 516,539 kg. However, we believe that year-specific precipitation provides a more accurate, one-time assessment of actual conditions in the Basin, and all final loadingmethod results reported here are based on year-specific data. The discrepancy between our estimate and Hegman's is likely attributable, at least in part, to use of a substitute FOR coefficient; the original negative value would have reduced the total phosphorus estimate. Additional factors were the larger URB coefficient for LCB-R 1992 (0.20 vs. the Hegman value of 0.16) and the larger volume of Urban land in the updated LULC map.  For LCB 2001, the total loading-method estimate of 561,449 kg was predictably much higher than the LCB-R 1992 total; the annual mean precipitation value for the corresponding sampling period (2001)(2002) was higher (40.7 in) than the 1991 mean (35.8 in), and it was also higher than the long-term precipitation mean (38.5 in) for the Basin. In fact, use of the long-term precipitation averages with LCB 2001 produced a lower total estimate (527,047 kg). Missisquoi Bay-VT, Main Lake-VT, and Otter Creek-VT were again the most important Basin segments, Missisquoi Bay-VT was the largest AG source, and the URB category was the largest contributor to phosphorus loading Basinwide, accounting for more than 46% of total (Table 2- The increase in urban land uses from 1992 and 2001 also contributed to the larger estimate, but this contribution is difficult to determine exactly. This is the one drawback of the loading method; it provides a refined assessment of conditions affecting runoff in a given year but incorporates too many variables to isolate specific causal factors for each lake segment.  "}, {"section_title": "Comparison of 1992 and 2001 Estimates", "text": "A direct comparison of the lake-segment results for LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 better illustrates temporal and spatial patterns and differences between the phosphorus estimation methods (Table 2- 14,. The export-method estimates were much higher than the loading-method results, reflecting the wide annual variation in precipitation that they encompass; on average, the Basin receives a non-point phosphorus load of about 750,000 kg or more. The difference between the two export estimates was smaller, however, and more meaningful; it identified a specific 10-year increase of 26,096 kg/yr in total phosphorus load that is almost certainly a function of land-use change. With all variables constant except for LULC, the estimated export load increased in 19 of 21 lake segments regardless of size and geographic location. This trend mirrored a similar Basin-wide increase in the Urban LULC class. Furthermore, the largest increases in phosphorus export were observed in lake segments with the largest LULC increases (by area) in the URB category, particularly the Main Lake, Otter, and Malletts Bay segments. As more land is converted from agriculture and forests to developed land uses, with a greater volume of impervious surfaces, transport of phosphorus to the lake is more rapid and concentrated. The loading method provides a more precise estimate of the phosphorus load in a given sampling period; in this case, the estimates for both LCB-R 1992 andLCB 2001 were well below the average conditions suggested by the export estimates. The large difference between the total loading estimates further illustrates the direct influence of precipitation on runoff and, ultimately, non-point pollution; the 2001-2002 sampling period was wetter than 1991, helping to produce a loading estimate 17% larger than the earlier one. Land-use change also was an important contributor to this observed pattern, but its contribution to the overall trend cannot be directly isolated from the year-specific loading estimates. However, using the difference in export estimates as a rough indicator (26,096 kg export vs. 82,212 kg loading), about one-third of the loading increase was perhaps attributable to conversion of agricultural lands and forests to urbanized landscapes. Note that the difference between the loading-method result would have been larger if the original, negative value of the FOR coefficient had been used in final phosphorus estimates. This observation demonstrates a potential disadvantage to the use of substitute coefficient values. Although it is important to show the real and important contribution of Forest land-use classes to phosphorus loading, our use of a substitute value to adjust the regression-derived total P outputs to the lake, reduces our ability to more accurately interpret land use changes. Also note the large, negative difference in the loading results for the Missisquoi Bay-QUE lake segment (-12,382 kg/yr), which was attributable to an observed decrease in phosphorus measurements in the Pike watershed between 1991 and 2001-2002. The Pike watershed comprises the western third of the Missisquoi Bay-QUE segment and Agriculture is the dominant land use. In contrast to most of the watersheds in the Basin, however, about 40% less phosphorus was measured in the Pike watershed in 2001-2002 compared to 1991 (Appendix K), despite the higher Basin-wide precipitation totals in the latter sampling period. Consequently, the adjusted AG coefficient (loading method) for the Pike during the 2001-2002 period was only a third of the value for 1991 (0.11 vs. 0.29), resulting in a large decline in estimated phosphorus between the two sampling period. The adjusted AG coefficient for the Pike using the export method was also comparatively low for the 2001-2002 period (Table 2-4), but this value was obscured in the average adjusted coefficient subsequently used in final phosphorus calculations. These observations reinforce the primary distinction between the export and loading methods; the export method provides an assessment of average conditions in the Basin while the loading method focuses on specific conditions in an individual year.   To further assess the influence of LULC change on Basin-wide phosphorus loading patterns, it is informative to consider estimates derived for LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 using the export and loading coefficients previously reported by Hegman et al. (Table  2-15). The same patterns among lake segments were evident, with the Main Lake-VT, Otter Creek-VT, and Mallets Bay segments showing the largest increases between 1992 and 2001, but the magnitude of change in total phosphorus estimates was less than half of that observed with the new export coefficients (13,631 kg vs. 26,096 kg). It is also interesting to note that the observed difference between loading estimates was quite similar to that for export estimates (12,628 kg vs. 13,631 kg) when the same long-term precipitation data were used with both LULC datasets. Clearly, phosphorus estimates are affected by the magnitude of the coefficients used to produce them, and observed differences between estimates will increase as coefficients increase. Consequently, it is important to reiterate that our estimate of LULC-induced phosphorus change (26,096 kg) was based on average conditions in the Basin; in years with belowaverage precipitation, the difference would be lower while in years with aboveaverage precipitation, the difference would be higher. Nonetheless, we believe that average export coefficients produce the best estimate of LULC-induced change because: 1) these coefficients better reflect actual LULC patterns in the Basin than those developed by Hegman et al., especially the relationship between URB and AG; 2) they reflect annual variation in phosphorus measurements; and 3) they permit comparison of temporally-distinct LULC maps in which LULC change is isolated as the primary variable of interest. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Use of the export and loading methods has often been determined by data availability; when specific precipitation and streamflow data are lacking, the export method provides a simple way of estimating phosphorus load from aggregated LULC data (Hegman et al. 1999). Its estimates represent average conditions in a drainage basin at any one time. In contrast, the loading method requires more data but provides a more precise estimate of non-point phosphorus pollution in a particular sampling period. In this study, we used both methods to examine phosphorus loading patterns in the Lake Champlain Basin, taking advantage of new LULC maps that permit analysis of recent and past landscape conditions. We also had the flexibility of using phosphorus measurements collected throughout the Basin at regular sampling intervals, which helped improve modeling by encompassing wide variability in non-point pollution loads and streamflow. We used this information to better gauge the range of precipitationinduced annual fluctuations in phosphorus export. In conjunction with the new LULC datasets, which were spaced approximately 10 years apart, the loading method produced an estimated phosphorus load of 479,238 kg for LCB-R 1992 (precipitation data for calendar year 1991) and a load of 561,449 kg for LCB 2001 (precipitation data for hydrological year [2001][2002]. These figures represent the best possible estimates of actual phosphorus loading in those years; precipitation totals for the closest matching phosphorus sampling periods were used to calibrate them. Accordingly, they can be used as benchmarks in future studies examining annual fluctuations in phosphorus patterns. The average conditions represented by the export estimates make an analysis of land use-driven phosphorus change possible. By calculating average export coefficients and applying them both to the LCB-R 1992 and LCB 2001 LULC datasets, we estimated a 10-year increase in phosphorus levels of 26,096 kg. These results showed that Urban land types play a larger role in phosphorus transfer from land to water than previously demonstrated in the Basin, and presumably this trend is attributable to conversion of agricultural lands and forest to developed uses. The new LULC maps better represent Urban features, especially Urban Open Space and roads, and regression equations produced for both the export and loading methods consistently identified larger coefficients for an aggregated Urban category. These larger coefficients in turn produced larger phosphorus estimates, and our results indicated that the Urban category was the most important source of phosphorus in most lake segments. Agriculture remains an important contributor to phosphorus loading, however, especially in lake segments where animal densities traditionally have been high. For example, the AG category was responsible for 65-70% of the load from Missisquoi Bay, which was the largest single contributor of phosphorus to Lake Champlain. More research is needed to identify the specific contribution of Urban Open Space to phosphorus export. This LULC category is increasing throughout the Basin and could add further to the phosphorus concentrations emanating from developed areas. Although lawns are not as impervious as pavement, structures, and industrial zones, they do not slow runoff as effectively as natural vegetation cover and may contribute directly to phosphorus pollution when fertilizers are excessively applied or poorly timed. Previously, Urban Open Space was most likely lumped with agricultural classes in LULC mapping, and more work is needed to improve discrimination of these land uses. Better classification will likely increase the already high contribution of the Urban category in regression modeling while reducing the phosphorus load erroneously assigned to Agriculture. Animal-unit data should be used to update phosphorus estimates if they become available for the entire Basin. In their earlier study of the Basin, Hegman et al. (1999) used the number of animal units in each watershed to adjust the phosphorus contribution from the AG category. If a watershed contained more animal units than expected from a linear relationship between AG area and the number of animals, its phosphorus estimate was adjusted upwards; if a watershed contained fewer animals than expected, its estimate was adjusted downwards. Because complete, Basin-wide animal-unit data were unavailable for 2001, we adjusted only the Missisquoi and Pike watersheds, which occur in the Missisquoi Bay lake segments. Consequently, we likely underestimated the phosphorus contribution from other watersheds where highintensity agriculture is practiced (e.g., Rock). Furthermore, strategies to reduce phosphorus emissions due to livestock and row-crop agriculture are different, meaning that isolation of these processes from a single, lumped AG coefficient can benefit land managers as they plan for various phosphorus-reduction strategies. We believe that the export and loading methods are both useful in describing the direction and magnitude of phosphorus trends in the Lake Champlain Basin, and they are most useful when their results are interpreted together. Although these methods differ in their applicability and precision, both are improved by more and better source data, and it is our hope that phosphorus measurements continue to be collected throughout the Basin. Multiple years of sampling data are essential for developing more precise estimates and tracking long-term trends. Animal-unit data may help phosphorus modeling if they become available for the entire Basin, and additional research may also help clarify which analytical approaches best represent annual variability in phosphorus pollution."}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "text": "CLU: USDA common land unit boundaries; individual polygons correspond to la distinct piece of land with a common owner, manager, and with a single land cover type.
