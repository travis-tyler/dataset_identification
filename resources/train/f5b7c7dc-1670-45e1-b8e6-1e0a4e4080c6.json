Studies in mice and Drosophila indicate that sleep deprivation promotes \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition in the brain. 1, 2 Further, initial cross-sectional studies in humans demonstrate associations of shorter self-reported sleep duration and poorer sleep quality with greater brain A\u03b2, measured by positron emission tomography scans. 3, 4 Lower sleep efficiency and greater sleep fragmentation, measured by wrist actigraphy, also have been linked to greater brain A\u03b2 burden, measured in cerebrospinal fluid. 5 Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is associated with risk for late onset AD. The APOE \u01904 allele has been linked to a 2-to 3-fold increased risk of AD in heterozygotes (ie, \u01902/\u01904 or \u01903/ \u01904 genotypes) and 10 times the risk in \u01904/\u01904 homozygotes, compared to carriers of the most common APOE genotype, \u01903/ \u01903. 6 Conversely, the \u01902 allele appears to confer some protection against AD. 7 Approximately 20%-30% of the population has one or more \u01904 alleles, placing a substantial proportion of the population at elevated AD risk. 8 Importantly, the APOE \u01904 allele has also been linked to sleep disturbances. APOE \u01904 carriers have been shown to have an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), 9, 10 and studies have found that APOE \u01904 and SDB interact, such that SDB severity is more strongly associated with cognitive impairment among \u01904 carriers than in noncarriers. [11] [12] [13] Studies have also investigated links between APOE and nonrespiratory sleep parameters but primarily in persons with cognitive impairment. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Surprisingly little has been published, however, regarding associations between the \u01904 allele and nonrespiratory sleep parameters, such as sleep duration, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and napping, in cognitively intact samples. In a study of 122 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we reported that 50% of those with sleep duration <7 hours had at least one \u01904 allele, compared to only 21% of those reporting 7 hours sleep, and 24% of those reporting >7 hours (Table 2 of prior paper). 19 Here, we follow-up our initial observation in a sample undergoing neuroimaging assessments and conduct an in-depth study of the association of APOE genotype with self-reported sleep duration, difficulty falling or remaining asleep, and napping in a much larger sample of cognitively unimpaired adults in the BLSA. We hypothesized that those with one or more \u01904 alleles would have shorter sleep duration and greater difficulty falling or staying asleep than those without an \u01904 allele. Because the \u01902 allele is associated with a decreased risk of AD and better sleep may protect against AD, we also investigated whether those with \u01902/\u01902 or \u01902/\u01903 genotypes reported longer sleep duration, better quality sleep, and distinct napping habits.

Further, they cannot be taking ongoing antibiotics, chronic pain medication, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, or histamine H2 blockers.\nOf 1742 participants, we excluded 369 who were missing APOE genotype data and two who were missing self-report sleep data (see below).

Responses were recorded as integers and were used as our measure of sleep duration. Participants were also asked whether they \"often have trouble falling asleep at night or awaken in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep,\" (yes or no). They were also asked if they nap, with response options \"rarely or never,\" \"3-5 times/week,\" \"1-2 times/week,\" or \"daily\"; we recoded responses of \"rarely or never\" as 0 and others as 1.\nIn addition, participants were asked about common symptoms of SDB, which may confound the associations of interest (see Statistical Analyses). Specifically, they reported whether they \"snore often and loudly\" (yes or no) and if they \"often become drowsy or fall asleep during the daytime when you wish to be awake? (e.g. falling asleep watching TV or reading)\" (yes or no)."}, {"section_title": "Other Measures", "text": "At each BLSA visit, participants' height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated in kg/m 2 .

In addition to self-report, diabetes contributed to the vascular burden score if fasting blood glucose was \u2265126 mg dl -1 , hypertension contributed if systolic blood pressure was \u2265140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure was \u226590 mm Hg, and hypercholesterolemia contributed if recorded cholesterol was \u2265200 mg dl -1 ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "We fit two sets of ordinal logistic regression models to determine the association between APOE genotype, our primary predictor, and reported sleep duration, which we categorized as \u22659 hours, 7 or 8 hours, and \u22646 hours. Ordinal logistic regression produces odds ratios (ORs), which represent the odds of being in a shorter sleep duration category. The proportional odds assumption was met for these sleep duration analyses. Our selection of sleep duration categories was based on the National Sleep Foundation's recent recommendation of 7-8 hours sleep duration for adults aged 65 and older. 30 We used these cutpoints rather than the recent American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society recommendations because the latter are restricted to persons aged 18-60 years 31 and would therefore be inappropriate for much of our sample. Next, we fit two sets of logistic regression models to determine the association of APOE genotype with reports of problems falling or staying asleep and reports of napping. For all analyses, we first compared \u01904 allele carriers (\u01902/\u01904, \u01903/\u01904, or \u01904/\u01904 genotypes), who are at elevated risk for AD, with noncarriers. Next, we compared participants at lower AD risk (\u01902/\u01902 or \u01902/\u01903 genotype) or greater AD risk (\u01904 carriers) with those neutral for AD risk (\u01903/\u01903 genotype). Minimally adjusted models (Model 1) were adjusted for age, age squared, race (African American or white), and sex. Fully adjusted models (Model 2) were further adjusted for years of education, BMI, CES-D scores, vascular burden score, and-because APOE genotype has been linked to SDB which often manifests in snoring and daytime sleepiness-we also adjusted for responses to questions about snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. To examine whether this association was stronger in older adults, we repeated analyses in participants aged \u226550 years. Importantly, race/ethnic differences appear to exist in the association between \u01904 genotype and AD risk, with a weaker link among African Americans than in whites. 21, 32 Thus, we explored potential interactions of APOE \u01904 status (\u22651 vs. 0 \u01904 alleles) with race on sleep variables by adding an interaction term (APOE \u01904 status \u00d7 race) to fully adjusted models.

After adjustment for potential confounders, we found that those with one or more \u01904 alleles-and therefore at elevated risk for AD-had a greater odds of reporting shorter sleep duration than those with no \u01904 alleles (\u01902/\u01902, \u01902/\u01903 and \u01903/\u01903 genotypes) and those with the \u01903/\u01903 genotype, which is neutral for AD risk. We also found that those with the \u01902/\u01902 or \u01902/\u01903 genotype and thus at reduced risk of AD, had a reduced odds of reporting napping, compared to those with the neutral \u01903/\u01903 genotype. When we limited analyses to adults aged \u226550 years, the findings concerning sleep duration were stronger, and we found that those with an \u01904 allele had a greater odds of difficulty falling or staying asleep than those without; however, the associations with napping were no longer significant. We also found some evidence for an interaction of APOE \u01904 with race, with trend-level and significant associations of the \u01904 allele with sleep duration among African American but not white participants.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to identify associations of APOE genotype with self-reported sleep duration, difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and napping habits in cognitively intact individuals. A few prior studies have investigated associations between APOE genotype and nonrespiratory sleep/ wake parameters in persons without dementia, although most have not focused on a potential effect of APOE on these sleep parameters per se. For example, Lim et al. 33 showed that greater consolidation of objectively measured rest/activity rhythms buffered against the risk of AD conferred by the \u01904 allele and reduced the effect of \u01904 on density of neurofibrillary tangles. Also, Asada et al. 34 showed in a case-control study that napping duration interacted with APOE \u01904 genotype. Naps longer than 60 minutes were associated with a greater AD risk among \u01904 carriers but not noncarriers, and there was evidence that short naps were associated with reductions in risk of incident AD in both groups. 34 Further, Tsapanou et al. 35 reported that \u01904 genotype was associated with self-report measures of SDB-related phenomena (snoring, shortness of breath during sleep/ headache on waking) but found no associations with measures of sleep quality or adequacy or of daytime sleepiness. In a particularly relevant recent pilot study (n = 31), Drogos et al. 36 found that \u01904 carriers had poorer sleep efficiency, as measured by actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG) and shorter sleep duration and greater wake after sleep onset and REM sleep, measured by PSG, than noncarriers; they detected no associations, however, of APOE \u01904 status with self-reported sleep measures. In addition, it should be noted that a number of genome-wide association studies have been performed examining variants associated with sleep duration. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Polymorphisms in or near APOE were not identified in these studies; however, it is worth noting that only some polymorphisms associated with specific genes (eg, Pax8 and ABCC9) were replicated between studies.\nOur results speak to the intriguing possibility that APOE \u01904 truncates sleep duration and increases sleep onset latency and fragmentation. In light of prior support for a causal link between sleep deprivation and AD progression, 1,2 if APOE \u01904 shortens sleep, it would be plausible that APOE exerts its effect on AD risk at least in part by shortening sleep duration, complementing the aforementioned findings concerning rest/activity consolidation as a moderator of the effect of \u01904 on AD risk. 33 It is also plausible that, rather than directly affecting sleep, APOE genotype modulates vulnerability to sleep disturbance. Indeed, findings that anticholinergic medication use is associated with greater sleep disturbance in cognitively normal \u01904 carriers than in noncarriers support the notion that the sleep of \u01904 carriers is more easily perturbed. 18 If disturbed sleep does promote amyloid burden and AD risk, our findings might suggest that APOE \u01904-positive individuals with sleep disturbance receive special clinical attention with the goal of optimizing nighttime sleep duration and thereby reducing the risk of AD. 33 Our findings in analyses that included both younger people and those aged 50 years and older also raise the possibility that the APOE \u01902 allele reduces the likelihood of regular napping. If napping has a negative impact on brain health, our findings that the \u01902 allele is associated with reduced napping may suggest that reduced napping is a mechanism through which \u01902 protects against AD. Although self-report of napping has been linked to a reduced risk of cognitive decline, 42 when naps have been measured by actigraphy, longer naps have been tied to poorer performance on neuropsychological tests, 43, 44 and napping 3 days per week or more has been linked to amyloid deposition. 5 When we limited our analyses to participants aged 50 years and older, however, the association between APOE \u01902 and napping was no longer significant. Whether this was due to reduced statistical power or a specific effect of \u01902 on napping in younger people only is unclear and could be especially important if an effect of naps on cognition and brain health varies by age. Further research is needed to clarify the role of the \u01902 allele in these associations.\nImportantly, we identified a potential interaction between the APOE \u01904 allele and race with regard to sleep duration. Although this should be interpreted cautiously given the nonsignificant interaction term in the model, between-race differences have been noted in associations between APOE \u01904 genotype and cognitive outcomes, 21 and it is unclear whether sleep disturbance may play a role in these associations. In light of the growing interest in sleep as a potential risk factor for AD and in race/ethnic disparities in AD, further studies in this domain are warranted. This study's strength is its large community-dwelling sample with well-characterized cognitive status and APOE genotyping. However, several limitations warrant consideration. First, our sleep measures were limited to self-report. Studies of APOE and sleep in large samples that include actigraphy or PSG would clarify whether the associations we observed between APOE and nonrespiratory sleep parameters also arise when sleep is measured objectively. Also, although our participants were considered to be free of MCI or dementia, we are unable to rule out the possibility that \u01904 carriers had, on average, a higher level of A\u03b2 deposition in their brains. Because A\u03b2 deposition leads to sleep loss in AD mice 45 and Drosophila, 2 observed differences in sleep duration, onset and maintenance difficulties, and napping between \u01904 carriers and noncarriers may be explained at least in part by preclinical AD. Moreover, reports of reduced nighttime sleep duration and greater daytime napping may be attributable to SDB. We adjusted for SDB risk factors and markers (BMI, snoring, and excessive daytime sleepiness), but residual confounding by SDB may explain our results. If napping does in fact reflect SDB, this would still be of interest: although the \u01904 allele has been linked to a greater risk of SDB, 9,10 it has not yet been established that \u01902/\u01902 and \u01902/ \u01903 genotypes protect against SDB. Studies with PSG in large samples with APOE genotyping are needed to further examine this possibility. Additional studies are also needed to clarify the nonrespiratory polysomnographic correlates of APOE genotype in cognitively normal populations. Although a study of persons with MCI found that \u01904 carriers obtain less REM sleep than noncarriers, 16 little is known about whether APOE genotype affects REM or slow-wave sleep in those without impairment. Such findings would be important as they might indicate sleep-specific mechanisms by which APOE affects AD risk.\nIn summary, our results indicate an association of APOE genotype with nonrespiratory sleep parameters: sleep duration, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and napping, and suggest that the association with sleep duration may differ between African Americans and whites. Findings provide further support for an important link between sleep and AD risk that warrants further study using objective sleep measures.
