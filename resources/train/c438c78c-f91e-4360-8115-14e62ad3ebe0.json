Such a characterization is especially important for neurodegenerative diseases, as therapeutic intervention is most likely to be effective in the preclinical 5 disease stages prior to significant neuronal damage. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, brain changes evident in structural, functional, and metabolic imaging may occur more than a decade before the onset of cognitive symptoms (Bateman et al., 2012) , with cortical amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation being one of the earliest changes (Jack et al., 2013; Sperling et al., 2014a; Villemagne et al., 2013) . Such 10 brain changes can be measured using neuroimaging techniques and can be tracked over time at the individual level via longitudinal studies.\nGiven the focus on preventing and delaying the onset of incurable neurodegenerative diseases, the emphasis of clinical trials has shifted to studying clinically normal individuals with positive biomarkers, for example those exhibiting brain 15 amyloid in the case of AD, in order to identify early intervention opportunities in the preclinical stages of disease (Sperling et al., 2014b) . It is important to determine the temporal trajectories of hypothesized biomarkers in the early disease stages in order to better understand their associations with disease progression.\nCurrent neuroimaging methods allow for the characterization of the brain at 20 the mm 3 level, generating hundreds of thousands of measurements that can be used as potential biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the temporal trajectories of these voxelwise measurements can provide clues into disease mechanisms by identifying the earliest and fastest changing brain regions.\nChanges in voxelwise neuroimaging measurements over time are commonly 25 studied using linear mixed effects models (Bernal-Rusiel et al., 2012 Ziegler et al., 2015) . Univariate linear mixed effects models use time or age to characterize changes in a single imaging measure. However, time or age may not be the appropriate metric for measuring disease progression due to variability across individuals. While covariates can be included in linear mixed effects 30 models to account for this variability, choosing the correct set of covariates is difficult and covariates generally have a more complicated association with disease progression than the assumed linear relationship of linear mixed effects models. Instead, this variability can be accounted for by aligning individuals in time based on their longitudinal biomarker profiles within a multivariate 35 framework. This is the premise of the Disease Progression Score method, which has been applied to studying changes in cognitive and biological markers related to Alzheimer's disease (Jedynak et al., 2012 Bilgel et al., 2014) . It is assumed that there is an underlying progression score (PS) for each subject visit that is an affine transform of the subject's age, and given this PS, it is possible 40 to place biomarker measurements across a group of subjects onto a common timeline. The affine transformation of age removes across-subject variability in baseline biomarker measures as well as in their rates of longitudinal progression.\nEach biomarker is associated with a parametric trajectory as a function of PS, whose parameters are estimated along with the PS for each subject. This allows 45 one to \"stitch\" data across subjects to obtain temporal biomarker trajectories that fit an underlying model ( Fig. 1 ).\nPrevious approaches have used certain cognitive measures, such as ADASCog (Caroli and Frisoni, 2010; Yang et al., 2011) , MMSE (Doody et al., 2010) or CDR-SB (Delor et al., 2013) as a surrogate for disease progression to delineate 50 the trajectories of other AD-related cognitive measurements. These methods operate with the assumption that disease progression is reflected by a single cognitive measurement rather than a profile of multiple measurements, and therefore are inherently limited in their characterization of disease evolution. Younes et al. (2014) fitted a piecewise linear model to longitudinal data assuming 55 that each biomarker becomes abnormal a certain number of years before clinical diagnosis, and this duration was estimated for each biomarker to yield longitudinal trajectories as a function of time to diagnosis. A quantile regression approach was employed by Schmidt-Richberg et al. (2015) to align a sample of cognitively normals and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) with a sample of MCI and AD,"}, {"section_title": "60", "text": "and then to estimate biomarker trajectories. These approaches assume that all individuals are on a path to disease and require knowledge of clinical diagnosis.\nTherefore, they are not suitable for studying the earliest changes in individuals who have not converted to a clinical diagnosis. Donohue et al. (2014) applied a self-modeling regression model within a multivariate framework to characterize the longitudinal trajectories of a set of cognitive, CSF, and neuroimaging-based biomarkers. This approach allows for across-subject variability only in the age of onset, not in progression speed. Models incorporating fixed effects as well as individual-level random effects have been proposed to study ADAS-Cog (Ito et al., 2011; Schiratti et al., 2015b) and regional cortical atrophy (Schiratti et al., 70 2015b), and Schulam et al. (2015) used a spline model that incorporates longitudinal clustering and modeling of individual-level effects to study trajectories of scleroderma markers. These mixed effects models take into consideration each measure separately rather than using them within a unifying framework. Others have used event-based probabilistic frameworks to determine the ordering of 75 changes in longitudinal biomarker measures as well as the appropriate thresholds for separating normal from abnormal measures (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014) . These methods characterize longitudinal biomarker trajectories in a discrete framework rather than a continuous one. Schiratti et al. (2015a) proposed an extension to their earlier approach to model multiple measures 80 together. Biomarker trajectories are assumed to be identical except for a shift along the disease timeline, and this assumption prevents hypothesis testing regarding rate of change across biomarkers. Furthermore, biomarkers are assumed to be conditionally independent given the subject-level random effects, but this assumption is not realistic when biomarkers are voxel-based neuroimaging 85 measurements.\nHere, we adapt the disease progression score principle to studying longitudinal neuroimaging data by making substantial innovations to the progression score model and parameter estimation procedure. First, voxelwise imaging measures constitute the biomarkers in the model, and are analyzed together in a multi-90 variate framework. Studying progression at the voxel level rather than using region of interest (ROI)-based measures allows for the discovery of patterns that may not be confined within any given ROI. Second, since voxelwise imaging measures have an underlying spatial correlation, we incorporate the modeling of the spatial correlations among the biomarker error terms. Modeling spatial 95 correlations makes the inference of the subject-specific progression scores less susceptible to the inherent correlations among the voxels. Third, we incorporate a bivariate normal prior on the subject-specific variables that define the relationship between age and PS. The prior allows a better modeling of the variance within individuals and enables the incorporation of individuals with a single 100 visit into the model fitting procedure. Fourth, instead of using an alternating least-squares approach for parameter estimation as presented by Jedynak et al. (2012) , we formulate the model fitting as an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which guarantees convergence to a local maximum and allows for an efficient model fitting framework for a large number of biomarkers. Finally, we 105 present a statistical framework for comparing the onset and rate of progression across different regions. This paper extends our previous approach for analyzing longitudinal voxelwise imaging measures using the progression score framework by incorporating a prior on the subject-specific variables, presenting a hypothesis testing framework for determining biomarker ordering, and performing an 110 extensive validation of the method (Bilgel et al., 2015c) .\nWe first show using simulated data that the model parameters are estimated accurately and that modeling spatial correlations improves parameter estimation.\nWe then apply the method to distribution volume ratio (DVR) images derived from Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging, which show the distribution 115 of cerebral fibrillar amyloid. Models fitted using data for 104 participants with a total of 300 PiB-PET visits reveal that the precuneus and frontal cortex show the greatest longitudinal increases in fibrillar amyloid, with smaller increases in lateral temporal and temporoparietal regions, and minimal increases in the occipital cortex and the sensorimotor strip.

Based on a qualitative evaluation of our estimated trajectories, we found that amyloid accumulation in the precuneus is followed by cingulate and frontal cortices, then by lateral parietal cortex, followed by insula and lateral temporal cortex. We observed minimal amyloid accumulation in visual cortex, hippocampal formation and the sensorimotor strip, which agrees with previous 465 reports that these regions accumulate amyloid in later stages of AD (Braak and Braak, 1991) . Previous reports have highlighted precuneus as an early amyloid accumulator (Mintun et al., 2006; Rodrigue et al., 2012) as well as frontal, cingulate, and parietal regions (Jack et al., 2008) . Contrary to our finding highlighting precuneus as the earliest cortical accumulator, a study of cognitively 470 normal adults found that the right medial frontal cortex accumulates amyloid the earliest, closely followed by bilateral precuneus based on cross-sectional voxelwise analyses (Villeneuve et al., 2015) . We presented regional trajectories averaged bilaterally in this work; however, hemisphere-specific trajectories were consistent with our bilaterally-averaged trajectories and we did not observe that medial 475 frontal cortex precedes precuneus. Further studies with larger samples will be instrumental in elucidating the regional progression of amyloid accumulation.\nOne of the strengths of our model for the progression scores s is that there are no a priori assumptions on the global form of s(t), which can be thought of as an underlying function that describes the evolution of progression score 480 over time. Instead, the model makes linear local approximations to s(t) per individual. The linear form we use makes the EM approach analytically tractable and enables the discovery of the global form of s(t). On the other hand, the linear relationship we assume between s and t is also a limitation since it may be an oversimplification over long follow-up durations. In order to capture dynamics 485 over longer periods more accurately, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the progression scores s and time t, and select an appropriate function to link these variables.\nAnother limitation of our model is the assumption of linear biomarker trajectories. This assumption is not reflective of the fact that voxelwise DVR has a theoretical minimum of 1 (while in practice, there are DVR values lower than 1 due to noise). Furthermore, several studies of longitudinal amyloid deposition have found evidence for a ceiling effect in amyloid deposition in late AD, suggesting a sigmoid trajectory for amyloid levels (Villemagne et al., 2013; Villain et al., 2012) . Our use of a linear rather than sigmoid trajectory inevitably results The spatial covariance functions we used in our analyses are covariance functions of strictly stationary isotropic processes. The underlying spatial noise process is affected by the PET scanner, image reconstruction algorithm, radiotracer delivery and binding in different brain regions, kinetic parameter 505 estimation algorithm, and registration methods used to bring all scans in alignment. To accurately model these influences on noise, complex noise spatial covariance models are needed. In this work, we made simplifying assumptions on the noise properties to facilitate the study of longitudinal trajectories of amyloid images. As a result of these simplifications, our model does not accurately 510 capture noise properties; however, by eliminating the inaccurate assumption of independence across voxels, our approach improves the accuracy of the estimated trajectories and progression scores. Refined spatial noise models incorporating non-stationarity and anisotropy may further improve the estimation accuracy.\nOur model can be applied to studying higher resolution images. To reduce 515 computational memory burden, it may be necessary to impose sparsity on the spatial correlation matrix, which can be done by imposing a correlation value of 0 at large distances. The sparsity property of the correlation matrix can be taken advantage of to yield Cholesky decompositions using less memory and time."}, {"section_title": "520", "text": "In conclusion, the progression score model allows for extracting summary scores from longitudinal data for each scan. In this work, we have extended the progression score model proposed by Jedynak et al. (2012) to voxelwise imaging data by accounting for spatial correlations and enabling efficient handling of the large number of voxels through the EM framework. The incorporation of a prior 525 on subject-specific variables allowed for the inclusion of individuals with a single visit in the model. Our method can be extended to the analysis of other types of imaging data, and in cases where a summary score such as mean cortical DVR is not available, the progression score estimates can be highly informative for progression staging.
