[{"section_title": "", "text": "In 1990, 36,027 Ph.D.s were graduated from U.S. universities, the largest number of doctorates ever awarded. The doctorates were distributed among the seven broad fields as follows: life sciences (6,613), education (6,484), social sciences (6,076), physical sciences (5,859), engineering (4,892), humanities (3,820), and professional/other fields (2,283). Women earned 13,061 doctoral degrees in 1990, the largest number of any year. Their 36 percent share of the cohort was the same as in 1989. Despite gains in many fields, women continued to be underrepresented in physical sciences and engineering, accounting for 18 percent and 8 percent of 1990 doctorates in these fields, respectively. In 1990, 9,398 Ph.D.s were awarded to non-U.S. citizens (1,654 to permanent residents and 7,744 to temporary residents). Foreign nationals received 28 percent of all doctoral degrees, the highest proportion ever. Moreover, they earned 57 percent of the degrees in engineering and 40 percent of the degrees in physical sciences. Median Years to Degree for Doctorate Recipients, by Broad Field for Selected Years, 1960 In academic year 1990 (July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990), 36,027 Ph.D.s were graduated from U.S. universities.' This is the largest number of doctorates ever awarded in the more than three decades that these data have been collected. This year also marks the peak for various subpopulations within the overall group of recipients. For instance, both men and women received the highest number of doctorates of any year-22,966 and 13,061, respectively. The number of foreign citizens (9,398) earning doctorates in the United States was also the greatest number ever. In addition, the median total elapsed time from baccalaureate to doctorate remained at its record high of 10.5 yea-rs in 1990; and registered, or enrolled, time grew to 7.0 years. The median age of recipients was 33.9 years in 1990, the oldest cohort ever. Selected statistics from the 1989-90 Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) are presented in this report, along with trend data from the comprehensive Doctorate Records File (a virtually complete data bank on doctorate recipients from 1920 to 1990). The body of the report discusses highlights of these data. Supplementary tables on 1990 doctorates are displayed in Appendix A, and 1980-1990 data are displayed in Appendix B. Technical notes are in Appendix C, and the survey questionnaire is included in Appendix D. Recent Summary Reports have included special sections that analyze important trends in the survey results. This year's special section focuses on U.S. minorities during the period 1975 to 1990. It presents trends in the number of doctorates and findings on gender differences, fields of specialization, and immediate postgraduation plans. In addition, it examines several factors that may contribute to persistence in graduate school: the educational attainment of parents; the institutions granting baccalaureate and doctorate degrees to Ph.D. recipients; the length of time it took to earn the Ph.D.; and financial considerations such as sources of support in graduate school and education-related debt. Seven broad fields are profiled in the text of Summary Reports. Readers should note that these fields may differ from those reported by federal sponsors of the survey. For a list of subfields that make up each broad field, see the inside back cover of this report and the specialties list in Appendix D.

For the fifth consecutive year, the number of students earning doctoral degrees increased. This rise occurred after a plateau that characterized the first half of the 1980s. The trend line of the number of Ph.D.s awarded shows a dramatic rise in the 1960s, peaking initially at 33,755 in 1973. (See Figure 1 and Table 1.) A decline then occurred through 1978, after which the number of Ph.D.s stabilized around 31,200 annually through 1985. Although the number of doctorates increased more than three and a half times between 1960 and 1990, some groups of recipients increased while others declined proportionately. For example, the proportion of women increased from 11 percent (1,042) in 1960 to 36 percent (13,061)    Field of Doctorate The growth in the total number of doctorates awarded obscures differences among the seven broad fields. Figure 2 shows the trend in doctorate production from 1960 to 1990 for each of the seven broad fields. (See also Table 3 on rage 10.) The field of life sciences3 continued its upward trend in 1990 and exceeded the field of education for the second consecutive year in the number and proportion of degrees awarded: 6,613 Ph.D.s (or 18 percent). This number contrasts sharply with the 1,729 Ph.D.s awarded in the life sciences in 1960, although the proportion of life science degrees is the same for both years. Within life sciences, health sciences grew from 4 percent to 14 percent of the field over the period, while biological sciences decreased from 72 percent to 66 percent and agricultural sciences declined from 24 percent to 20 percent. The upsurge in the field of nursing largely accounted for the growth in health sciences over the last decade. In 1980, doctorates in nursing comprised 13 percent (77)4 of health sciences Ph.D.s, and in 1990 they comprised 28 percent (267). (See Appendix Table B-1.) The number of doctorates in both physical sciences and engineering has increased fairly steadily over the last decade, recovering from their declines which characterized the period from 1965 to 1980. In 1990, these two fields reached all-time highs in the number of degrees awarded, 5,859 and 4,892, respectively. (See Table 3 on page 10.) The proportion of doctorates in engineering was also the highest in 1990, at 14 percent of all doctorates, while physical sciences, at 16 percent, was still well below its 1960 proportional high of 22 percent. Professional/other fields' was the one broad area that grew in most years, steadily climbing upward from 241 recipients in 1960 to 2,283 in 1990. It also showed a proportionate increase, growing from 3 percent in 1960 to 6 percent in 1990. \"\"Life sciences\" is an umbrella term that covers the biological, agricultural, and health sciences.\u00b0D ata on nursing are not available for years before 1979.

FIGURE 2 Doctorate recipients, by broad field, 1960-1990. 4 1 5 1985 1990 While degree production has grown in numbers since 1960, the distribution by fields has shifted. Humanities exhibited a downward trend in proportionate shares since 1960, falling from 16 percent to 11 percent over the period, with 3,820 degrees awarded in 1990. The 6,076 doctorates received in social sciences in 1990 was a return to the 1960 level of 17 percent, but this represents a drop from 19 percent a decade ago. Similarly, the field of education with 6,484 degrees and 18 percent in 1990 has fallen since 1980, when it represented 24 percent of the Ph.D.s, although it has not returned to the 1960 level of 16 percent. (Numbers used in this discussion can be found in Table 3 on page 10.) The characteristics of recipients in the various fields have also changed since 1960. In that year, about 87 percent of new physical science doctorates and 77 percent of new engineering doctorates were U.S. citizens. In 1990, the U.S. percentages were about 60 and 43, respectively. Another change in the overall characteristics of the recipients is the increasing participation of women in certain fields. Women significantly increased their proportion among life sciences doctorates, from 9 percent in 1960 to 37 percent in 1990. They also increased their presence in professional/other fields: in 1960 women represented 15 percent of the recipients; in 1990 they received 36 percent of the doctorates. (See Table 2 page 6.)"}, {"section_title": "Gender", "text": "The record number of doctorates awarded in 1990 was attributable to an increase in the numbers of both men and women earning the Ph.D. Men achieved their largest number of degrees ever this year, 22,966. The number of men earning the doctorate began a 13-year decrease in 1973; since 1986, however, men have increased their doctorate production each year. (See Table 2.) This increase can be explained by the influx of foreign men earning degrees; in 1990, foreign male Ph.D.s earned 7,496 degrees (or 35 percent of all doctorates awarded to men). Women also reached their highest number ever this year, 13,061. In comparison to men, however, women have increased both their number and proportion of doctorates in almost every year from inception of the SED (1958) through 1986. Since then their number has continued to grow but their proportion stayed at about 35 percent through 1988, rising to 36 percent in 1989 and 1990. The increase in the number of degrees awarded to women also was related to the increased numbers of foreign doctorates, although to a lesser extent than for men. In 1990, foreign women earned 1,902 Ph.D.s (or 15 percent of all degrees awarded to women). Since 1960, women have experienced significant gains in fields in which they have been typically underrepresentedsuch as physical sciences, life sciences, and engineeringand more moderate growth in social sciences and professional/other fields where they have been typically well represented. In humanities and education, the number of doctorates earned by women has remained relatively stable since 1984. Among men, the number of Ph.D.s in the fields of physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences began to fall after peaking in 1971. The decrease in these fields corresponded to the decline in the total number of men who received doctorates during much of the 1970s and 1980s. The number of men who received Ph.D.s in life sciences showed a more moderate decline than in the other two fields and has been relatively stable over the last two decades. The decline in the number of men who rec,eived degrees in social sciences and professional/other fields began later, in 1977. The number of doctorates awarded to males in social sciences declined through 1988 but recovered somewhat in 1989 and 1990, and the number awarded to men in professional/other fields has grown in the last five years. Over the last seven years, decreases occurred in the number of men receiving doctorates in humanities and education; however, some improvement was apparent this past year, when their number in both fields showed some growth. (See Figure 3 for doctorate recipients by gender and broad field at five-year intervals.) It is evident from both Table 2 and Figure 3 that the gender gap has narrowed in all fieldsin some cases because women increased their numbers dramatically, and in others because the number of men decreased while the number of women grew. Nevertheless, disparities between the sexes remain in certain disciplines. (See Appendix Table A-3.) The data indicate that, despite numerical gains, women are still underrepresented proportionately in physical sciences and engineering (82 percent male versus 18 percent female in physical sciences, and 92 percent male versus 8 percent female in engineering). In life sciences, women earned 37 percent of all doctorates in 1990, although they outnumbered men in the subfield of health sciences, where they constituted 62 percent of Ph.D.s. This proportion was largely the result of the number of women earning Ph.D.s in nursing, a traditionally female-dominated area; 43 percent of health science Ph.D.s awarded to women were in nursing. (See Appendix Table A-1 for numbers in each specialty.) In both social sciences and humanities, on the other hand, the gap between the numbers of men and women receiving doctorates has narrowed considerably. While in 1960 women received only 13 percent of all social science doctorates and 16 percent of all humanities doctorates, they received 46 percent of doctorates in each of thnse fields in 1990. Education was the only broad field in 1990 where womenearning 58 percent of the doctorateswere more numerous than men. The number of female education doctorates was 3,736 in 1990, and the number of men was 2,748. In contrast to the t,-o previous years, however, the number of degrees in this field increased for both men and women in 1990. Among U.S. citizens only, the proportion of women doctorates is higher than the proportion of women doctorates for all citizenship groups combined. In 1990, U.S. citizen women were 43 percent of all U.S. doctorates (compared with 36 percent of women doctorates for all citizenship groups). The data confirm that U.S. women represent higher proportions in all fields as well. In 1990, they represented 21 percent of U.S. citizen doctorates in physical sciences, 13 percent in engineering, and 41 percent in life sciences (compared with respective percentages of 18, 8, and 37 for all citizenship groups combined). In contrast, the proportion of U.S. women in 1960 was lower than all women in physical sciences (3 percent versus 4 percent) and engineering (0.2 percent versus 0.4 percent). In life sciences that same year, U.S women and all women doctorates represented the same proportion of the field (9 percent). In 1990, U.S women also showed greater proportions than all women doctorates in social sciences (52 percent versus 46 percent), humanities (47 percent versus 46 percent), and education (60 percent versus 58 percent). In 1960, the proportion of U.S. women was the same as the proportion of all women in social sciences (13 percent), humanities (16 percent), and education (19 percent).\nWhile men still outnumber women in Ph.D. attainment, women in every racial/ethnic group have demonstrated tremendous growth since 1975, both in number and in proportion of degrees earned (Table S- (11). Smaller gains were made in health sciences, economics, and history. Although black male recipients still show their highest concentration in education, as do their female counterparts, they have branched out into other areas. Education was also the most common field in 1990 among Native Americansboth male and femaleas it was in 1975. By a slight margin, Hispanic men in 1990 favored social sciences over education, their field of choice in 1975. Hispanic women were clustered in education this year but showed large numbers in social sciences, too (in 1975, most degrees were in humanities, closely followed by education). Asians were the only minority group to prefer engineering and the sciencesengineering among men and life sciences among women.   The institutions for black doctorate recipients merit additional comment. Particularly interesting are the 20 leading baccalaureate-granting schools of black Ph.D.s. Seventeen of these schools are \"historically black colleges and universities\" (HBCUs),19 the only exceptions being Wayne State University, City University of New York-City College, and New York University. Howard University was the leading baccalaureate institution for blacks who received Ph.D.s between 1986 and 1990."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ".  1990 1960 1965 1970 1975 Year Professional/Other 196019651970197519801985 Year NOTE: See Table 2 for the number of doctorates in selected years, 1960-1990.

This may signal that the earlier decline in the numbers has ended, although the proportion of doctorates earned by U.S. citizens continued its decline. In 1960, 88 percent (8,469) of doctorates were granted to U.S. citizens and 12 percent (1,176) to non-U.S. citizens. By 1990, the U.S. percentage was 72 percent (24,190 Ph.D.$), and the non-U.S. percentage had grown to 28 percent (9,398 Ph.D.$). It is evident from Figure 4 and Table 3 that temporary visa-holders have largely been responsible for the rise in non-U.S. Ph.D.s, especially during the last decade. In 1960, temporary residents earned only 897 Ph.D.s, or 9 percent of all doctorates in this country; in 1990, they earned 7,744, or 23 percent of all doctorates. Growth has been more moderate among permanent visa-holders who earned Ph.D.s, although both the number and proportion of doctorates in this group have increased in recent years. In 1960 this group was awarded 3 percent (279) of all doctorates, and last year they received 5 percent (1,654). Table 3 also displays percentages of U.S. and non-U.S. citizens for the seven broad fields. Although the number of doctorates granted to U.S. citizens increased in each of the fields between 1960 and 1990, the U.S. share of degrees decreased in every field.

The decreases in the life and social sciences, however, were less significant: 10 points (from 82 percent to 72 percent) and 8 points (from 88 percent to 80 percent), respectively. The proportion of U.S. citizens in professional/other fields dropped 18 points over the  period (from 89 percent to 71 percent).

(See item 13 of the questionnaire in Appendix D.) Changes in elapsed time signify different graduate school enrollment patterns for the two measures. The growth of RTD means that students are spending more time enrolled in graduate school. When TTD grows more than RTD, it means that students are also increasing their time out of graduate schooleither by delaying their entrance into a graduate program or by dropping out for some period(s) of time prior to the completion of the program.7 By either dimension, time-to-degree has increased over the last three decades: by 32 percent for RTD and by 19 percent for TTD. Figure 5 shows that RTD fluctuated throughout the 1960s before beginning a steady increase in 1969: RTD rose  I   I  r   1960  1965  1970  1975  1980  1985  1990 Year NOTE: See Table 5 for median years to degree.

FIGURE 5 Median years to degree for doctorate recipients, all fields combined for selected years, 1960-1990. &Total time-to-degree (TTD) is a gross measure and refers to the number of years elapsed between earning the baccalaureate and the doctorate. Registered time-to-degree (RTD) is a net measure of time lapse and is derived by subtracting the years a recipient was not in graduate school between earning a baccalaureate and a Ph.D. The medi,an rather than the mean is used as the measure of central tendency because the distribution is skewed. 'For a thorough treatment of issues surrounding changes in time-to-degree, see H. Tuckman, S. Coyle, and Y. Bae, On Time to the Doctorate: A Study of the Increased Time to Complete Doctorates in Science and Engineering, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1990. from a median 5.3 years in 1960 to 7.0 years in 1990, an all-time high and an increase of 1.7 years. TTD declined from a median 8.8 years to a median 7.9 years between 1960 and 1970, after which it also began a steady rise to a high of 10.5 years in 1988, where it remains. While all broad fields experienced the basic pattern of lengthening registered and total time-to-degree between 1960 and 1990, the origin and size of the change varied by field. (See Table 5.) In general, recipients in social sciences and in nonsciences experienced longer time lapses than did Ph.D.s in natural sciences. In 1960, the seven broad fields varied in RTD by up to 1.5 years, ranging from 5.0 years for physical sciences and engineering to 6.5 years for education. By 1990 the spread had widened, with engineering doctorates showing the shortest RTD at 6.0 years and humanities showing the longest at 8.3 years. Evaluation of RTD and ITD for the various demographic groups reveals quite noticeable differences for all fields combined. Table 6 shows that both RTD and TrD were longer for women than for men; and they were longer for U.S. citizens than for foreign citizens. Differences between the groups were much smaller when the fields were disaggregated because time to degree is primarily field-related as described in the previous paragraph. It should be noted that the 1990 median time-to-degree estimates for humanities doctorates may overstate the situation in those fields. Bowen, Lord, and Soso.' developed alternate statistical analyses involving the use of the baccalaureate-year cohort rather than the Ph.D.-year cohort as the base for estimating the median. Using this method to compute time to doctorate for degree recipients in the humanitres, Bowen and his colleagues reported the following: estimates of the median generated from the Ph.D. cohort will be sensitive to the rate of change in the size of the baccalaureate cohort;9 the recent dramatic upward trend in ITD for humanists based on Ph.D.-year cohort is approximately double the comparable trend derived from the baccalaureate-year cohort;'\u00b0 and the estimates will not differ from those generated using Ph.D.-year cohorts in periods in which the annual number of baccalaureate-year doctorates remains stable. 8Bowen, W., G. Lord, and J.A. Sosa, \"Measuring Time to the Doctorate: A Reinterpretation of the Evidence,\" published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Vol. 88, pp. 713-717, February 1991, Washington, D.C.). 90ther things being equal, the median will vary inversely with the direction of change, increasing when the size of the baccalaureate cohort decreases and decreasing when the size of this cohort increases. The authors report that recent trends in the size of baccalaureate cohorts may have produced a difference of two years between the alternative estimates of TTD. '\u00b0Based on baccalaureate-year cohorts alternatively truncated at 8, 10, and 12 years, the authors report increases in TTD for the period-1966 to 1982 of roughly 15 to 20 percent; the comparable increases for Ph.D.-year cohorts were 38 to 42 percent. (op. cit., p. 716).  Calculations such as those performed by Bowen et al. may extend the understanding of the behavior underlying patterns of Ph.D. production in any field. Taken together, various methods and studies\" regarding time to the doctorate serve as indicators of time-to-degree trends or models for analyzing doctoral completion rates. *Includes mathematics and computer sciences."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "\"For another analysis of time to doctorate, see M.

Humanities' decrease of 12 percentage points in academe was largely balanced by increases in industry and \"other.\" Industry also accommodated the 14-point dropoff in physical sciences and the 17-point decline in life sciences. Engineering declined the least of any field in academe, falling only 1 point since 1970. It is interesting to note that although still well below the proportions of 1970, the percentages of Ph.D.s in physical sciences, humanities, and professional/other fields who plan to work in academe have grown since 1980. Further disaggregation of the data by gender (see Table 11)' reveals a consistent pattern of diminishing proportions of new Ph.D.s employed in academe. From 19\"O to 1990, the percentage of men with commitments in the academic sector decrused from 66 percent to 48 percent, and the percentage of women fell from 82 percent to 57 percent, while their proportions grew in all other sectors. In the industrial sector, the proportion of men increased 9 points, although their actual number dropped from 2,492 in 1970 to 2,006 in 1990. Meanwhile, the proportion of women in industry more 13Because researchers are primarily interested in the employment situation of doctorates within this country, the discussion of new Ph.D.s' employment commitments is restricted to U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the aggregatethe group most likely to be long-term trmbers of the U.S. labor force. Table 11, however, displays employment sector data separately for U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents. \" Table 11 also displays employment sector data by citizenship groups: U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents. The discussion in this report, however, is limited to U.S. citizens and permanent residents in the aggregate.  Table 12 presents a frequency distribution of doctorates among \"primary\"' sources of graduate school support. In 1990, 48 percent of new Ph.D.s reported colleges and universities and 40 percent reported personal sources as the main providers of their support. Another 5 percent of doctorates reported primary support from the federal government,'6 and 7 percent stated that most of their support came from \"other\" sources. Table 12 further compares the primary sources of support of new Ph.D.s in 1990, by broad field, gender, and citizenship. Doctorates in some fields relied on certain sources more than those in other fields: 78 percent of recipients in physical sciences, 69 percent in engineering, and 55 percent in life sciences reported university sources as their primary source. In the other broad fields, 78 percent of Ph.D.s in education, 54 percent in professional/other fields, 52 percent in social sciences, and 48 percent in humanities reported personal sources as their primary source of support."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "-", "text": "Differences among the demographic groups were largely related to field rather than to demographic group. For example, the majority of men received univei sity support, while women relied more on personal sources. This difference can be explained by the fact that men were most concentrated in physical sciences and engineering (fields with high frequencies of university support) and women were most concentrated in social sciences and education (fields with high frequencies of personal support). (For a discussion of the sources of support of U.S. minorities, see page 33 in the special section of this report.) 1990, the sources of support question on the survey was revised to request participants to indicate primary and secondary sources of support. Thus, the designation of primary is the choice of the survey respondent. From 1987 to 1989, doctorate re-ipients were asked to estimate the percentage of the support they received from various sources. See tne technical notes in Appendix C for rates of nonresponse regarding this question. '6The reader should note that federal research assistantships (RAs) are aggregated with university support in this year's report. It is believed that many recipients of this type of support may not realize the original source of their finding and therefore report this support as university RA instead of federal RA. Consequently, percentages for university support appear higher and federal support lower than in previous reports, making it inadvisable to compare this year's results with those from earlier years.

Because 18 percent of the survey respondents in 1990 filled out a superseded questionnaire which had different debt level categories than the 1990 form, it is not possible to compute median debt levels for this year's report. Of the 33,113 respondents to the debt question in 1990, half reported finishing their doctoral programs with debt related to their college education; 16 percent of the 33,113 respondents owed less than $5,000; 12 percent owed between $5,001 and $10,000; and 22 percent owed $10,001 or more. Figure 7 and Table 13    In Table 14, percentage and level of debt are displayed by demographic group. The percentages of men and women with debt were similar: 49 percent of men and 50 percent of women. Men and women also had approximately the same percentages in each category of debt. Disaggregated by citizenship, the data show U.S. citizens reporting not only the greatest frequency of debt (57 percent, compared with 29 percent of temporary residents and 39 percent of permanent residents), but also much higher debt-25 percent in the $10,001 or more category versus 12 percent of temporary residents and 16 percent of permanent residents in this category. (For a discussion of the indebtedness of U.S. minorities, see page 34 of the special section in this repqrt.) The collection of racial/ethnic data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates affords an opportunity to monitor the educational progress of minorities at the doctoral level. This section of the report presents trends in the overall number of doctorates earned by each American racial or ethnic group during the period 197515 to 1990, as well as findings on their gender differences, fields of specialization, and immediate postgraduation plans. In addition, it examines several factors that may contribute to persistence in graduate school: the educational attainment of parents; the institutions granting baccalaureate and doctorate degrees to Ph.D. recipients; the length of time between receipt of the baccalaureate and the Ph.D.; and financial considerations such as sources of support in graduate school and education-related debt. Data are reported on five American racial/ethnic groups: Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and whites. Ethnicity takes precedence over race in this analysis; respondents claiming Hispanic heritage are designated as Hispanic regardless of racial identification (see items 9 and 10 on the survey form in Appendix D, page 95). Only U.S. citizens are included in the discussion, and naturalized citizens are aggregated with native-born Americans.

In 1990, 59.2 percent of Asian Ph.D.s were naturalized, an increase of almost 5 percentage points since 1975. The percentage of naturalized citizens among blacks also rose over the period-from 2.3 percent to 7.6 percent. This means that native-born blacks suffered an even greater e,ecline (21.6 percent) in doctoral awards than did the group as a whole (17.1 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Field of a ,torate", "text": "As can be seen in Table S-2 (page 40), Asian Ph.D.s in 1990 continued to concentrate heavily in engineering and the natural sciences, while the other minority groups clustered in social sciences and nonscience fields. Engineering was the preferred field for 24.6 percent of Asians in 1990, followed closely by life sciences at 24.1 percent. These were the favored areas of study in 1975 as well. Among the other minorities in 1990, education led by a large margin-selected by 50.7 percent of blacks, 38.7 percent of Native Americans, and 24.6 percent of Hispanics. Nevertheless, the proportions in education have declined noticeably since 1975, while those in other fields, especially social sciences, have grown. In 1990, almost one-fourth of both Native Americans and Hispanics and more than one-fifth of blacks majored in social sciences. An encouraging finding for blacks is that, despite a 17.1 percent decline since 1975 in their total annual number of doctoral awards, their numbers of Ph.D.s have increased in four of the seven broad fields: engineering (from 11 to 28), life sciences (from 56 to 63), social sciences (from 153 to 172), and professional/other fields (from 42 to 52). Figure S-2 approaches these data from another perspective and displays the racial/ethnic composition of the seven fields. It is evident that since 1975, Asia.ns, Hispanics, and Native Americans have increased their share of doctorates in every field. Particularly notable is the 8.0 percent share of engineering doctorates received by Asians in 1990, up from 3.7 percent in 1975. Meanwhile, the proportions of doctorates awarded to Hispanics rose from 1.1 to 3.7 percent in social sciences and from 1.5 to 3.6 percent in humanities. Blacks exhibited only moderate change over the period but nevertheless increased their presence in engineering, social sciences, professional/other fields, and humanities (the latter despite a decline in the number of 'grees). At the same time, however, blacks' share of education doctorates decreased from 9.2 percent to 7.7 percent."}, {"section_title": "Par -nts' Education", "text": "Unlike the other minoritieswho frequently selected large, state-supported, predominantly white universitiesblacks were often attracted to smaller, predominantly black schools, especially at the undergraduate level; 59.9 percent of black Ph.D.s in 1975 and 38.8 percent in 1990 earned their baccalaureates at HBCUs. Moreover, with the establishment of new doctoral programs at some of these schools, the percentage of black Ph.D.s earning their doctorates at HBCUs has increased (9.9 percent in 1990 versus 2.5 percent in 1975). In fact, the two schools that awarded the largest numters of Ph.D.s to blacks between 1986 and 1990 are HBCUsHoward University and Clark Atlanta University. The presence of supportive role models, a sense of community and history, and a comfortable social climate are some of the reasons given by black students for their HBCU preferences.2\u00b0T ime-to-Degree Time-to-degree, in the aggregate, was longest among black and Native American Ph.D.s in 1990 and shortest among Asian Ph.D.s (Table S-6, page 46). This was true for both measures: TTD (total time elapsed between the baccalaureate and doctorate) and RTD (time actually registered in school between the two degrees). Blacks held the longest TTD (a median 16.5 years) and Native Americans the longest RTD (8.3 years). Asians experienced both the shortest TTD (9.2 years) and the shortest RTD (6.8 years). The medians for Hispanics and whites were in the middle range. As for all recipients (see earlier discussion on page 12), time-to-degree has been on the rise for minority Ph.D.s, although the data from 1975 revealed a few surprises. Blacks in 1975 experienced the longest TTD (a median 12.4 years), as they did in 1990; yet while their 1990 RTD was the second longest, their 1975 RTD (5.9 years) was the shortest. Meanwhile, Asian Ph.D.swho took the least amount of time to earn their degrees in 1990displayed the longest RTD (6.5 years) and the second longest TTD (10.3 years) in 1975. However, their RTD grew only slightly over the period, and their TTD was actually shortened by a year. Time-to-degree increased the most among blacks and Native Americans (4 years in 'ITD and over 2 years in RTD) while among Hispanics, ITD grew by 2 years and RTD by 1.5 years. It must be noted, however, that a strong correlation exists between field of doctorate and time-to-degree, with science Ph.D.s taking less time to complete than nonscience Ph.D.s. This accounts, at least in part, for the wide range of overall medians among the racial/ethnic groups. Because Asians tended to cluster in the sciences, their overall TTD and RTD medians were generally shorter than those for the other minority groups, who concentrated in nonscience fields where time-to-degree is longer. When fields were disaggregated, blacks and Native Americans still showed somewhat longer medians than the other groups, but differences were greatly moderated. Moreover, all groups exhibited the same pattern of shorter medians for science degrees and longer ones for nonscience degrees. For example, while blacks' TID in education was a median 19.6 years in 1990, it was only 8.2 years in physical sciences. Additionally, Asian Ph.D.swho held the shortest TTDs in science and engineering fieldshad a TTD of 19.3 years in education. The gaps in RTD narrowed even more when field of doctorate was controlled, and differences among the racial/ethnic groups all but disappeared in physical sciences, engineering, life sciences, and education."}, {"section_title": "Primary Source of Support", "text": "Table S-7 (page 47) presents data on the primary sources of graduate school support for U.S. racial/ethnic groups. While the majority of Asians in 1990 (54.4 percent) received their primary support from colleges and universities, personal sources were most frequently cited by the other groups: 62.7 percent of blacks, 59.5 percent of Native Americans, 48.1 percent of whites, and 47.5 percent of Hispanics.

University support was the second most frequently reported source for all groups but Asians. Among those Ph.D.s primarily supported by the university, Asians and whites were more likely to be research assistants (RAs) than teaching assistants (TAs), while blacks and Hispanics were more often TAs. Native Americans reported being RAs and TAs in equal proportion. Except among blacks, federal suppoe was the third most frequently indicated source, followed by \"other\" sources (e.g., nonfederal fellowships, business/employer funds, foreign government); the percentages of blacks primarily supported by federal and \"other\" sources were the same. Because type of graduate support is highly correlated with field of doctorate, disaggregation of these data by field reveals a very different picture. Although some distinctions among the racial/ethnic groups remain, the general pattern is one of primary support from the university in physical sciences, engineering, and life sciences, and support from personal sources in all other fields. For example, the proportions of Ph.D.s in physical sciences who indicated major support from the university were large for all groups, ranging from 64.7 percent of Hispanics to 82.1 percent of Asians. In education, all groups were heavily self-supported; percentages of Ph.D.s reporting personal sources as their pr:mary means of support ranged from 70.8 percent of Asians to 85.7 percent of Hispanics."}, {"section_title": "Indebtedness", "text": "The majority of U.S. citizen Ph.D.s in 1990 reported debt related to their undergraduate and graduate education (Table S-8, page 48). However, while the margin was slim among Asians, Native Americans, and whites (approximately 55 percent of each group indicated debt), proportions of indebted Ph.D.s were notably higher among Hispanics (69.0 percent) and blacks (61.8 percent). In addition, over one-third of all Hispanic Ph.D.s and about one-fourth of Ph.D.s in the other racial/ethnic groups owed more than $10,000 by the time they graduated. Hispanic social scientists displayed the largest percentages of Ph.D.s with debt (77.0 percent) and owing more than $10,000 (46.0 percent). Percentages for black social scientists were similar. In general, the social sciences exhibited the highest frequencies for both indebtedness and debt level above $10,000, although Asian Ph.D.s owed more in life sciences.

Hispanics and blacks in education were exceptions, however, with 64.3 percent and 54.3 percent, respectively, reporting debt. Additionally, a third of all Hispanic doctorates in education and more than a fifth of all black doctorates in the field reported debt above $10,000.

Conversely, Asians displayed the largest proportion of Ph.D.s planning to continue their education (36.7 percent), while only 10.7 percent of blacks had such plans. (These differences are largely explained by field preferences: Asians clustered in science areas where postdoctoral study is common; blacks concentrated in education where employment is most likely.) For all groups, however, there has been a noticeable shift toward further study over the last 15 years. Academe continues to be the principal employer of new Ph.D.s in the U.S. labor force. In 1990, more than half of every group except Asians reported academic commitments. Asians were more likely to be employed in industry (42.8 percent versus 36.6 percent in academe). Government hired 10 to 11 percent of every racial/ethnic group except Native Americans (4.0 percent). \"Other\" sectors (mainly nonprofit organizations and elementary/secondary schools) employed a significant 28.3 percent of blacks, only 9.1 percent of Asians, and approximately 18 percent of the other groups. Although academe is still the largest employer of new Ph.D.s, the percentage of each group reporting academic commitments has declined since 1975, albeit with some fluctuation. Proportions in the industrial sector, on the other hand, have increased substantially, especially among Asians, Native Americans, and whites. Blacks and Hispanics experienced their greatest proportional growth in \"other\" sectors, although both groups showed small increases in industry as well. Hispanics also increased their share in government, the only group to do so. It is important to realize that numerical changes do not always parallel proportional shifts. Since 1975, for example, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans have increased their numbers of Ph.D.s in every employment sector, regardless of the changes in proportions; this is reflective of the overall growth in their numbers of doctoral awards during the period.

Therefore, the discussion of postgraduation plans in this report is limited to Ph.D.s who reported \"definite\" commitments at the time of survey completion. from 6.3 percent to 9.4 percent. Significantly, this growth occurred at a time when the overall number of Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens declined by 10.7 percent. However, while gains were exhibited by Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics, blacks suffered a 17.1 percent decrease in their number of Ph.D.sa result of the more than 50 percent decline in degrees earned by black men. Black women, in contrast, increased their number of Ph.D.s by 45.6 percent. Women in the other minority groups also made progress over the period, especially Hispanics and Native Americans, who have now approached parity with their male counterparts. In 1990, Asian Ph.D.s continued to be most concentrated in engineering and the natural sciences while the other minorities clustered in social sciences and nonscience fields. Engineering was the field of choice for almost one-fourth of Asians, who earned 8.0 percent of all engineering doctorates granted to U.S. citizens that year. Education was the field selected most frequently by the other minorities (50.7 percent of blacks, 38.7 percent of Native Americans, and 24.6 percent of Hispanics), although there were also significant percentages of these groups in social sciences. Despite an overall decline since 1975, blacks still increased their numbers of doctorates in engineering, life sciences, social sciences, and professional/other fields. Black men, too, earned more degrees in a few fields, most notably engineering. While 73.8 percent of Asian Ph.D.s in 1990 had at least one parent with some college education, only half of the other minorities reported parents at that level. , and the longest RTD was held by Native Americans (8.3 years). Asians experienced both the shortest TTD and the shortest RTD (9.2 years and 6.8 years, respectively). Differences were moderated, however, when field of doctorate was controlled, with a general pattern among all groups of shorter times-to-degree in science and engineering fields and longer ones in nonscience fields. While colleges and universities were the primary source of graduate school support for the majority (54.4 percent) of Asian Ph.D.s in 1990, personal sources (including loans) were cited by 62.7 percent of blacks, 59.5 percent of Native Americans, and 47.5 percent of Hispanics. As with time-to-doctorate, variations among the groups can be largely explained by the field preferences of Ph.D.s; Asians tended to cluster in science and engineering fields where university support is most abundant, while the other groups were more concentrated in nonscience areas where university support is less available. The groups with the highest frequencies of indebted Ph.D.s in 1990 were Hispanics (69.0 percent) and blacks (61.8 percent)compared with approximately 55 percent of Asians and Native Americans. In addition, more than one-third of Hispanic Ph.D.s owed over $10,000 by the time they graduated, as did about onefourth of the other minorities. Hispanic social scientists reported the largest proportions of Ph.D.s with debt and owing more than $10,000. Because education and social 37 sciences are the areas in which Hispanics and blacks are most concentrated, their high percentages in these fields convert to significant numbers of indebted Ph.D.s. Although there has been a noticeable shift toward further study over the past 15 years, more than half of each minority group in 1990 planned to be employed after graduation. Black Ph.D.s were the most likely to be employed (89.3 percent), and Asian Ph.D.s were the most likely to continue their education (36.7 percent).

Other Professional Fields             Tables, 1990   Table titles and headings are generally self-explanatory, but a few terms need special definition or explanation. The survey questionnaire is presented at the back of the report. Institutions Granting Doctorates, by Major Field, 1990 Tables A-1 and A-2: These tables display data for the most recent year by subfield of doctorate. The subfields correspond to the fields on the questionnaire's Specialties List located at the back of this report. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, general\"contain individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not included among the specialty fields. Table A-1 presents data by doctoral specialty and gender. Table A-2 displays doctoral specialty by citizenship and race/ethnicity. See the explanatory note on Table A-4 for further description of the racial/ethnic variable and changes that have been made to the question over the years. Table A-3: These are three 2-page tables: one contains data about all doctorate recipients in the most recent year, and the other two present data by gender. Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. Terms requiring definition are as follows: Median Age at Doctorate: One-half received the doctorate at or before this age. A recipient's age is derived by subtracting the year of birth from the calendar year of doctorate. Months are not included in the computation. Percentage with Master's: The percentage of doctorate recipients in a field who received a master's degree in any field before earning the doctorate. Median Time Lapse: \"Total Time\" refers to total calendar time elapsed between the year of baccalaureate and the year of doctorate; \"Registered Time\" refers to the total time registered in a university between baccalaureate and doctorate. Months are often not indicated by the recipient, and are, therefore, not included in the computation of time-to-doctorate. Each year's doctorate recipients provide information on postgraduation employment or study plans in response to items 20 and 21 on the survey form. Since the questionnaire is filled out around the time the doctorate is received, these planned activities can be subject to change. However, comparisons with data from the longitudinal Survey of Doctorate Recipients have shown these data to be a reasonable predictor of actual employment status in the year following the doctorate (see the discussion on \"definite\" postgraduation plans in the Technical Notes in Appendix C). Postgraduation plans of the doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), or \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown.\" The sum of these lines totals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 48.7 percent of all chemists had postdoctoral study plans, 42.7 percent planned to be employed, and 8.6 percent did not report their postgraduation plans; these total 100.0 percent. The study and employment rows are further subdividedshowing that 21.7 percent of all the chemists planned to pursue postdoctoral fellowships; 25.3 percent, research associateships; 1.0 percent, traineeships; and 0.8 percent, some other form of postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided; the percentages, listed by type of employer, show that a total of 42.7 percent planned employment. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who have definite postgraduation plans (item 20: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who are still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item 20: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Status Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines, \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study,\" add to give the percentage having \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines, \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment,\" add to give the percentage having \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by work activity and by region of employment are based on those who have definite employment commitments. They exclude those still seeking employment and those planning postdoctoral study as described above. Unfortunately, questionnaire revisions in 1990 appear to have resulted in a higher rate of nonresponse to the item on work activity than in previous years. In 1990, the nonresponse rate was 14.0 percent, compared to 6.2 percent in 1989. Nonresponse was especially high among recipients planning to work in educational institutions, thereby affecting the percentages in teaching and administration. groupings displayed may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the SED. See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables; see the questionnaire's Specialties List at the back of the report for the names and codes of the subfields included. In 1977, the item on race/ethnicity in the survey questionnaire was revised to coincide with the question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Sumtnoty Report 1977. Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to 54 S Asian in 1978. In 1980, two survey revisions were made: (1) the category Hispanic was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category (prior to 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race). However, when the data were compiled, all persons who checked Native American, Asian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minority-group category; and those whose responses were black as well as any other category were designated as black. Beginning with the 1982 survey, this item was revised to separate questions on racial and ethnic groups. Respondents are first asked to check one of the four racial group categories (Native American, Asian, black, or white) and then to indicate Hispanic heritage. For purposes of analysis, all respondents who indicated Hispanic heritage, regardless of racial identification, are included in one of three Hispanic groups. The remaining survey respondents are then counted in the respective racial groups. Doctorate recipients indicate multiple sources of support. In this table, a recipient counts once in each source category from which he or she received support. Since students indicate multiple sources of support, the vertical percentages sum to more than 100 percent. Federal research assistantships (RAs) are aggregated with university support in this year's report. The inconsistency of federal RA data from one year to the next has led to the conclusion that many recipients of this type of support may not have realized the true source of their funding and, therefore, reported this support as university RA instead of federal RA. Consequently, percentages for university support appear higher and federal support lower than in previous reports, making it inadvisable to compare this year's results with those from earlier years. The data should be interpreted as follows: 110 male doctorate recipients in the physical sciences reported financial support from National Science Foundation fellowships during graduate school.

Field groupings may differ from those in reports published by federal sponsors of the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). See inside the back cover for a description of field groupings as reported in these tables. The \"general\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, general\"contain individuals who either received the doctorate in the general subject area or did not indicate a particular specialty field. The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not included among the specialty fields. The seven tables in Appendix A present additional information about the most recent cohort of Ph.D.s by field of doctorate. In 1977 the item on race/ethnicity in the survey questionnaire was revised to coincide with the question format recommended by the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and adopted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use in federally sponsored surveys; an explanation of the effect of these changes is detailed on page 13 of Summary Report 1977. Changes in the OMB guidelines prompted the moving of persons having origins in the Indian subcontinent from the white category to Asian in 1978. In 1980 two survey revisions were made: (1) the category Hispanic was subdivided into Puerto Rican, Mexican American, and \"other\" Hispanic to provide more detail for users of the racial/ethnic data, and (2) respondents were asked to check only one racial category (prior to 1980, doctorate recipients could check more than one category to indicate their race). However, when the data were compiled, all persons who checked Native American, Asian, or Hispanic and also checked white were included in the minority-group category; and those whose responses were black as well as any other category were designated as black. Beginning with the 1982 survey, this item was revised to separate questions on racial and ethnic groups. Respondents are first asked to check one of the four racial group categories (Native American, Asian, black, or white) and then to indicate   1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 TOTAL  1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 D.s between 1986 and 1990, the rates of nonresponse to baccalaureate institution were 1.3 percent for Asians, 0.9 percent for blacks, 1.1 percent for Hispanics, and 1.0 percent for Native Americans."}, {"section_title": "CITIZENSHIP", "text": "2.

Because doctorate recipients sometimes complete the survey form months ahead of their actual graduation, it is not possible to determine the final postgraduation plans of many recipients. It is quite likely, however, that some of those Ph.D.s who indicated \"negotiating\" or \"seeking\" found positions by the time of graduation. Because the final outcomes are unknown, data on postgraduation plans in this report are restricted to the group of Ph.D.s with known \"definite\" plans: with such plans, the percentages in the U.S. labor force a year after graduation were also quite high (98.5 percent of permanent residents and 94.8 percent of temporary residents). Additionally, 94.4 percent of all graduates with immediate postgraduation plans in academe and 90.7 percent of those with plans in industry were working in the same sectors one year later. 8. 68.4 percent in life sciences, 62.1 percent in social sciences, 59.9 percent in humanities, 68.4 percent in education, and 70.7 percent in professional/other fields.
