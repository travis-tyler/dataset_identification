[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Site 10 at Naval Magazine Indian Island is an approximately 3.7-acre inactive landfill. The site was used as the primary landfill for the island from about 1945 until the mid-1970s, receiving paints, batteries, trash, and materials. In a memorandum to Washington State Department of Ecology, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW) stipulated that a new tidal study would be conducted to recalculate tidal influence lag-time in each groundwater monitoring well at Site 10.\nGroundwater levels and specific conductance in five monitoring wells, along with marine waterlevels (tidal levels) in Port Townsend Bay, were monitored every 15 minutes during a 2-week period to better understand nearshore groundwater-seawater interactions at Site 10. Time series data were collected from April 17 to May 3, 2018, a period that included neap and spring tides.\nVertical profiles of specific conductance were measured once in the screened interval of each well prior to instrument deployment to determine if a freshwater/saltwater interface was present in the well prior to instrument deployment. Profiles where measured during an ebbing tide at approximately the top, middle, and bottom of the saturated thickness within the screened interval of each well. The landward-most well, MW10-8 and coastline wells MW10-10, MW10-11 and MW10-12R, had a uniform specific conductance in the range of fresh or brackish water. Landfill monitoring well MW10-6 showed the highest uniform specific conductance profile also in the range of brackish water.\nLag times between minimum spring-tide levels and minimum groundwater levels in wells ranged from about 0 to 4 hours. Results of lag times showed a logical increase in lag time as the distance increases from the shoreline to each monitoring well.\nThe specific-conductance time-series data showed minimal change in the screened interval of each well. Fluctuation of specific conductance in each well was unique but no sharp groundwater saltwater interface was observed. Increases in specific conductivity concurrent with spring low tides were measured in coastline wells, suggesting shoreward transport of high specific conductivity landfill leachate rather than seawater intrusion.\nBased on all the data collected during this investigation, the optimal time for sampling monitoring wells at Site 10 would be during a 0-4-hour period following the predicted low-low tide."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Indian Island is an approximately 5-mile long island located in Port Hadlock, Jefferson County, Washington. Naval Magazine (NAVMAG) Indian Island occupies the island in its entirety ( fig. 1 ). The facility primarily is used for handling and storage of naval ordnance. The Site 10 Northend Landfill is an inactive landfill approximately 3.7 acres in size. The site was used as the primary landfill for Indian Island from about 1945 until the mid-1970s. Materials reportedly disposed of in the landfill include paint, paint thinners, paint strippers, oil, lead and zinc batteries, asbestos, submarine nets, metal parts, polyurethane resins, zinc-plating slag, residential trash, ash, and drums of unidentified liquid wastes (SCS Engineers, 1987) . The Record of Decision (ROD; URS, 1995) remedies were implemented in 1995, and remedial activities were completed in May 1997. Operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities were initiated in June 1997 and continue through the most current round of groundwater monitoring (round 39, June 2016). From youngest to oldest, the four principal geologic units exposed on Indian Island are recent alluvium (mixture of relatively loose gravel, sand, and silt); Vashon Till (dense sandy silt with gravel); Vashon Advance Outwash (dense sand with gravel); and Tertiary Bedrock (sandstone and shale). The thickness of debris and fill in the Site 10 Northend Landfill ranges from 4 to 10 feet (ft), and the landfill is underlain by Vashon Advance Outwash sand. Site 10 groundwater occurs at depths less than 10 ft below land surface in the Vashon Advance Outwash and the lower part of landfill debris. Because Site 10 is located adjacent to Port Townsend Bay, groundwater flow directions change in response to semidiurnal tidal fluctuations. However, fresh groundwater flows into Site 10 from uplands to the south, so the net groundwater flow direction from Site 10 is toward Port Townsend Bay. Site 10 groundwater is too saline to be a drinking water source.\nBased on discussions and agreements between Washington State Department of Ecology and Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW) in May 2016, the Navy agreed to a new tidal study to determine the tidal influence lag-time in each groundwater monitoring well at Site 10 ( fig. 2 ). To support these efforts, refined information is needed on the interaction of groundwater with seawater in response to tidal fluctuations at this nearshore site. The results of this investigation can be used to ensure that groundwater monitoring is done at an optimum time to assess contaminant concentrations in groundwater that originated at Site 10. The optimal time is presumed to be when groundwater in a well is the least mixed with seawater, conditions indicative of seaward flow of groundwater.\nThe shape and position of the fresh water-salt water interface in unconfined coastal aquifers varies greatly. Interface geometry is mainly influenced by local geology of the aquifer matrix, groundwater hydraulic gradient and range of tidal fluctuation. At Site 10 with a tidal sandy beach, tide and wave actions lead to the formation of an intertidal circulation cell that complements the structure of the subterranean estuary (brackish zone) between sea water and fresh water (Buquet and others, 2015) . The vertical and horizontal shifting between the seawater and freshwater occur during the spring-neap tidal cycle. "}, {"section_title": "Objectives and Scope", "text": "The overall objective of this report is to describe the data collection and analysis that has led to a better understanding of nearshore groundwater-seawater interactions at Site 10 as driven by as much as 13-ft tidal fluctuations in the adjacent Port Townsend Bay (Lincoln, 2000) . The specific objective of this project was to determine the optimal time during the semi-diurnal and the neap-spring tidal cycles to sample groundwater for freshwater contaminants in Site 10 monitoring wells. To achieve that objective, tidal lag times were estimated for Site 10 nearshore monitoring wells and when during the tidal cycle the proportion of fresh groundwater relative to seawater in the wells is the largest was determined. Under the assumption when the tidal cycle reaches a lower-low level specific conductivity of the groundwater would be the lowest representing the least amount of seawater intrusion influence.\nThe scope of this investigation included the collection of continuous conductivity, temperature, and depth data in five groundwater monitoring wells, and in nearby Port Townsend Bay during a 2-week monitoring period that included a complete spring (maximum tidal change) to neap (minimum tidal change) cycle. The scope of the data analyses included the calculation of tidal lag times, defined as the time between when a maximum or minimum tide occurred and when a subsequent maximum or minimum water level occurred in the nearshore wells, and the identification of when, during both the semi-diurnal cycle and the neap-spring tidal cycle, the measured wells have the greatest proportion of fresh groundwater."}, {"section_title": "Field Data Collection", "text": "On April 17, 2018, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) field team installed non-vented conductivity-temperature-depth sensors (herein referred to as CTDs) in the five Site 10 monitoring wells (table 1) All sensors were calibrated and checked for accuracy in the USGS Field Services Unit prior to deployment, including three-point calibration checks on the CTDs using 250, 12,890 and 50,000 microsiemens per centimeter at 25 \u00b0Celsius (\u00b5S/cm) specific-conductance standards. The range of the calibration check was based on specific conductance that may be measured in near shore groundwater monitoring wells and is binned as (URS Consultants. Inc., 1997):\n\u2022 Freshwater: specific conductance less than 1,000 \u00b5S/cm;\n\u2022 Brackish: specific conductance between 1,000 and 10,000 \u00b5S/cm;\n\u2022 Saline/saltwater: specific conductance greater than 1,000 and 10,000 \u00b5S/cm. To make vertical profiles, a multi-parameter sonde equipped with pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance sensors was deployed. The multi-parameter sonde was calibrated prior to collecting measurements. The sonde was used to confirm the CTD temperature and specific conductance measurements prior to deployment. The multi-parameter sonde was used to collect synoptic vertical profile of water quality within the screened monitoring well intervals by lowering the sensor to the bottom and stopping at pre-determined intervals until parameters stabilized. Verification of water-column height above a transducer was done by collecting a depth to water less than 1 minute before the scheduled sample collection."}, {"section_title": "Datum", "text": "The datum used in this report is Port Townsend Bay Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) tidal level at NOAA tidal station 9444900 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2018). In 2012, the Navy contracted a survey of the monitoring wells (top-of-casing) and two control points, CP1 and CP2, referencing mean sea level (MSL). CP2 survey information states that vertical control was derived from photogrammetric survey control referencing Port Townsend Bay MLLW tidal level at NOAA tidal station 9444900 (Sealaska Environmental, 2012) . The difference between NOAA tidal station 9444900 MSL and the MLLW datum is 5.00 ft (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=9444900); therefore, a +5.00 ft offset was added to discrete and continuous monitoring well water-level data to reference NOAA tidal station 9444900 MLLW datum. The elevation of the marine pressure transducer was not surveyed, but the approximate elevation (referenced to the MLLW tidal datum) was estimated by calculating the difference between daily maximum and minimum marine level monitoring data and predicted NOAA data which resulted in a mean difference of 7.77 ft. This difference was applied as the offset value to all 15-minute barometric pressure-adjusted time series marine water level monitored data to bring down to the MLLW datum."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CTD Sensor Deployment and Vertical Water-Quality Profiling", "text": "All wells were accessed and depth-to-water measurements (table 2) were made using an electric tape. A vertical water-quality profile was collected at the top, middle, and bottom within the screened monitoring well interval. A calibrated multi-parameter sonde was inserted into each well before installation of the CTD sensor. The tide was ebbing to a low of -0.40 ft below MLLW during the profile measurements. The CTDs were lowered and secured at approximately mid-depth of the well screened interval for each monitoring well (table 3) . Because of the relatively rapid tidally induced water-level changes in the monitoring wells, a final manual depth-to-water measurement was made immediately before the first scheduled water-level measurement recorded by the CTD in each well. Each CTD was programmed to record data at 15-minute intervals. Table 2 . Water levels measured during deployment and retrieval of the conductivity-temperature-depth sensors and a pressure logger in five Site 10 Naval Magazine Indian Island, Port Hadlock, Washington, monitoring wells and in Port Townsend Bay. A water-level data logger was deployed offshore in the marine water approximately 250 ft west of MW10-12R to measure tidal levels. The transducer was anchored in place at a fixed location on the marine floor, with a buoy attached to the anchor to facilitate retrieval. The transducer was deployed at a time (1154 Pacific Daylight Time [PDT] ) and location when the marine water depth was 5.5 ft, a depth that ensured the transducer would remain submerged at the predicted lowest tide during the deployment. The predicted tide at that time for the nearest reporting site at Port Townsend, Washington (NOAA Station 9444900) was about -0.4 ft below MLLW.\nBecause the transducer and CTDs were non-vented, a barometric pressure data logger was installed onshore in the immediate area to collect atmospheric pressure data used to correct non-vented marine and groundwater-level data."}, {"section_title": "CTD Sensor Retrieval and Sonde Measurements", "text": "On May 3, 2018, a USGS field team retrieved CTDs from five monitoring wells and a waterlevel data logger in Port Townsend Bay. All wells were accessed and depth-to-water measurements were recorded prior to the final 15-minute CTD measurement (table 1). Immediately after CTD retrieval, the multi-parameter sonde was lowered to the CTD measurement elevation in each well to measure water quality. The CTD retrieval likely agitated the water column in the well, so an exact match between CTD and sonde measurements was not expected. It was clear after review of the sonde and CTD comparison of specific conductance values that the sonde specific conductance probe was not fully submerged in well water after the MW10-6 CTD was retrieved (table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Time-Series Data Processing", "text": "The 15-minute time-series data from the CTDs were downloaded in the field. Groundwater and marine time-series water-level data were measured with non-vented pressure transducers and adjusted for changes in atmospheric pressure by subtracting the measured atmospheric (barometric) pressure from pressure transducer measurements for each 15-minute value, with due consideration of units."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Synoptic Water-Quality Data", "text": "Water-quality measurements made by the CTDs and the multi-parameter sonde during deployment and retrieval of the CTDs did not compare in some wells (table 3) . Variation between the two data sets was expected due to slightly different measurement elevations on April 17 when the sonde could be lowered only to just above the CTD, and due to agitated well water when the sonde measurements followed CTD retrieval on May 3. Upon deployment at wells MW10-8, MW10-10, and MW10-11 the CTD/sonde comparison showed a greater than 30 percent difference, whereas when retrieved CTD/sonde comparison difference at MW10-10 remained at 25 percent. A three-point calibration check (100, 1,000 and 12,890 \u00b5S) was done for each CTD and the multi-parameter sonde 1 day before deployment, which showed that all instrumentation was calibrated with in less than or equal to 3 percent. This calibration data indicated that the sonde data was considered good-quality data, whereas CTD specific conductance values were poor. The poor comparison between the sonde and CTD data during field measurements and the unexpected drift and steps in specific conductance data trends (figs .3-5) provides evidence of poor CTD quality data, particularly in MW10-11 ( fig. 6 ).\nThe CTD conductivity probe in well MW10-6 did not equilibrate to groundwater conditions once positioned at deployment depth for multi parameter sonde comparison. Air bubbles in the CTD conductivity sampling port were likely the cause. It seems that the bubbles eventually dissolved in solution after approximately 16 hours at 0215 on April 18, 2018. At that time the CTD started logging temperature and specific conductance data but the comparison to the sonde data collected April 17, 2018 was poor.\nThe vertical water-quality profile data indicated little variation across the saturated screened interval prior to CTD sensor deployment (table 4). The tide was ebbing to a low of -0.4 ft at 1145 PDT followed by flooding up to 0.38 ft (above MLLW) when the profiles were measured. During this spring tide period, groundwater in the most landward well MW10-8 was fresh across the entire screened interval with specific conductance ranging from 484 to 504 \u00b5S/cm. Groundwater in the coastline wells also had uniform profiles within each screened interval ranging in either brackish or fresh water. Specific conductance in MW10-12R ranged from 2,043 to 2,055 \u00b5S/cm, whereas groundwater across the entire screened interval of both MW10-11 and MW10-10 ranged in specific conductance from 406 to 828 \u00b5S/cm. The vertical groundwater profile of MW10-6 located in the landfill was uniformly brackish ranging from 5,295 to 5,341 \u00b5S/cm. The conversion from specific conductance to salinity cannot be made precisely without additional data, but ambient Puget Sound water with specific conductance of about 45,000 \u00b5S/cm would have a salinity of about 29 parts per thousand, and brackish water with a specific conductance of about 5,000 \u00b5S/cm would have a salinity of about 3 parts per thousand (Moore and others, 2017) .\nOverall, the vertical profile data indicate a uniform specific conductivity within the screened interval of each monitoring well, so no freshwater/saltwater interfaces were present in any of the well screens. Thus, when sampling for contaminants in the wells, a mid-screen sampling location is considered the best location.

The head difference line is the difference between tidal level and groundwater level at each time step representing the hydraulic gradient relative to zero where positive is coastline groundwater flow direction and negative is landward groundwater flow direction. Specific conductance is referenced to the secondary y-axis with different yaxis ranges for each figure.\nGroundwater levels fluctuated semi-diurnally in concert with, but attenuated in time and magnitude with, the semi-diurnal tides. The lowest groundwater levels measured in all shallow wells were associated with the spring tides around April 21 when the tidal levels were lowest. Groundwater and tidal levels are referenced to feet above mean lower low water (MLLW) on the primary y-axis with a fixed range (-2.00 to 12.00 feet above MLLW).

Groundwater levels in monitoring wells, as well as tidal levels, exhibited two diurnal highs and lows throughout the entire spring to neap to spring period monitored. Each semi-diurnal low-low tidal level was followed by a low-low groundwater level in the wells. The time durations between the tidal and groundwater low-lows were calculated as the tidal lag times for each well. Over the duration of the entire time series, tidal lag times ranged from 0 to 4 hours. The longest tidal lags (2.25-4 hours) were measured in the most landward well, MW10-8, whereas tidal lags between 0-1.5 hours were measured in all other Site 10 wells Table 5 .

Through semi-diurnal tidal cycles and across neap and spring tidal periods, specific conductance in all wells remained within either fresh or brackish water.\nGroundwater with the highest specific conductance was consistently measured at MW10-6, in the interior of the landfill. That brackish water most likely is due to landfill leachate rather that marine water intrusion because the wells seaward of MW10-6 all had consistently lower specific conductance, and specific conductance would generally increase when water-level (head) differences between groundwater and marine water became less than 0, indicating landward flow ( fig. 3 ). As expected, groundwater within the well upgradient of the landfill (MW10-8) was consistently fresh, and specific conductance slightly increased when head differences indicated landward flow ( fig. 4) , likely due to mixing with some landfill leachate. Groundwater in two of the shoreline wells (MW10-10 and MW10-11) also was consistently fresh, whereas groundwater in the shoreline well MW10-12R was consistently brackish. Unexpectedly, there was essentially no reversal of the hydraulic gradient to landward at wells MW10-11 and MW1-12R, although there was a daily or twice daily reversal at well MW10-10 (figs. 5 and 8) during the monitored period. Among these three shoreline wells, there was no consistent pattern of when and in what direction specific conductance changed in concert with tides, suggesting that the tidally induced movement of landfill leachate with variable specific conductance, rather than seawater, was responsible for the diurnal changes in specific conductance. Overall, seawater intrusion appears to be minimal at Site 10 monitoring wells, so changes in specific conductance should not be a major consideration of when to best sample undiluted groundwater. Seawater intrusion most likely is limited by the steep groundwater gradient seaward driven by immediate topographic relief south of Site 10.\nThe freshwater-saltwater interface geometry at Site 10 is greatly influenced by the local steep groundwater gradient inducing a high degree of horizontal force on the interface creating a steep geometry. A sharp specific conductivity interface from freshwater or brackish to saltwater was not measured during screen interval profiling nor captured over the spring-neap tidal cycle by time-series data providing evidence that the interface remains a distance both horizontally and vertically away from the monitored depth of all wells at Site 10."}, {"section_title": "Consideration of Atmospheric Conditions During Sampling", "text": "Atmospheric conditions can greatly influence predicted tidal fluctuations (Opatz and Dinicola, 2018) .

Forecast conditions to consider avoiding would be high winds from the north and exceptionally low barometric pressure associated with a storm front (Opatz and Dinicola, 2018) . Those conditions have the potential to create less coastward groundwater flow caused by higher low-low tidal levels than predicted during groundwater sampling."}, {"section_title": "Optimal Times for Groundwater Sampling", "text": "With all data considered, the optimal steps for sampling the coastline monitoring wells and landfill monitoring well MW10-6 at Site 10, along with other sampling period considerations would be to in following summary list:\n\u2022 Check the local forecast for stable atmospheric pressure and wind conditions on the scheduled day of sampling.\n\u2022 Sample coastline well MW10-12R centered on a 0-0.75-hour period after the predicted spring lower-low tide.\n\u2022 Sample coastline well MW10-10 centered on a 0.25-1-hour period after the predicted spring lower-low tide.\n\u2022 Sample coastline well MW10-11 centered on a 1-1.5-hour period after the predicted spring lowlower tide.\n\u2022 Sample background well MW10-8 three hours following the predicted spring low-low tide \u2022 Position sampling point at mid screen of each monitoring well.\nThe specific time period listed to sample each well are periods when groundwater in the wells is most representative of coastward groundwater flow."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Groundwater and tidal levels were monitored at Site 10 inactive landfill on Naval Magazine Indian Island for estimating lag times between minimum spring-tide levels and minimum groundwater levels in wells for determining when groundwater sampling would be least impacted my saltwater intrusion.
