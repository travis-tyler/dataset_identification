[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "New bachelor's degree recipients represent a small but essential component of the U.S. elementary/secondary teacher workforce. In 1999-2000, nearly all (98 percent) of the approximately 3.4 million K-12 teachers in the United States had earned a bachelor's degree, and of those, about 5 percent had first earned the degree between 1998 and 2000. 1 As increasing numbers of baby-boomer teachers reach retirement age in the coming years (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future [NCTAF] 2003), new college graduates will continue to be an important source of new teachers. Beyond the rate at which new graduates enter teaching, their retention-which is associated with their professional preparation and early teaching experiences (NCTAF 2003)concerns educators and policymakers who staff the nation's schools. Moreover, it is important to assess interest in teaching among graduates who do not teach immediately following bachelor's degree receipt. The proportion of these graduates who become teachers later in their working lives may strongly affect the effort involved in staffing the nation's schools. This study uses data from the 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01), the spring 2001 follow-up of bachelor's degree recipients who were first surveyed as part of the 1999National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2000, to examine teaching and teaching-related behavior among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients as of 2001. 2 It also compares teaching rates among this cohort with those of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients as of 1994. The analysis uses standard t tests to determine statistical significance of differences between estimates, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to detect trends.

Among those who received a bachelor's degree in 1999-2000, 12 percent had taught in a K-12 school between receipt of the degree and the 2001 interview ( figure A and table 1). This 12 percent of graduates includes 9 percent who had state certification, 1 percent who had prepared (completion of a teacher education program or student teaching assignment) but were not certified, and 3 percent with neither certification nor preparation. 3 Another 3 percent of all graduates were certified or had prepared to teach but had not taught as of 2001.\nWorking as an educator was common among 1999-2000 graduates: at the time of the 2001 interview, 18 percent of graduates who were working described their occupation as \"educator,\" a proportion exceeded only by the proportion who worked in business or management (Bradburn et al. 2003). However, \"educator\" was defined broadly, including those who taught at the preschool and postsecondary levels, educators who worked in nonschool settings (e.g, private music teachers, religious educators associated with places of worship), instructional aides, substitute teachers, as well as those who taught any of grades K-12 in an elementary, middle, secondary, or combined school. Defining \"teacher\" more narrowly, as those who taught any of grades K-12 excluding instructional aides and long-and short-term substitute teachers, 12 percent of graduates had taught in a K-12 school at some point between receiving the 1999-2000 bachelor's degree and the 2001 interview ( figure 1 and table 1).

Overall, 16 percent of women in this cohort had taught by 2001, compared with 8 percent of men (table 1). Women were also more likely than men to have prepared to teach without having taught by 2001 (4 percent vs. 2 percent). As has also been the case historically (Frankel and Stowe 1990;Gray et al. 1993), among 1999-2000 graduates, Asian/Pacific Islanders were less likely than their Black, White, or Hispanic peers to have taught by 2001. 4 \nElementary/secondary students and teachers have differed from each other in terms of gender and race/ethnicity for decades. Two-thirds of public elementary/secondary school teachers were women in 1976, 69 percent were women in 1986, and 79 percent were women in 2001 (Snyder, Tan, and Hoffman 2004). Although the population of elementary/secondary level students has become increasingly diverse in the last 25 years in terms of race/ethnicity, elementary and secondary school teachers are, and have been for some time, largely White. In 1976, three-quarters of public elementary/secondary school students were White (Grant and Eiden 1980). By 1986, the percentage who were White had declined to 70 percent , and by 2001, 60 percent of elementary/secondary school children and youth were White (Snyder, Tan, and Hoffman 2004). Among public school teachers, in 1976, some 91 percent were White, in 1986, some 90 percent were White, and in 1999-2000, approximately 84 percent were White (Snyder and Hoffman 2003). 6 As has been the case for well over a century (Cremin 1961;Tyack 1974), among 1999-2000 college graduates, women were more likely than men to have taught and to have prepared to teach. Overall, 16 percent of women in this cohort had taught by 2001, compared with 8 percent of men (table 1). Furthermore, women were more likely than men to have taught regardless of certification or preparation. Women were also more likely than men to have prepared to teach without having taught by 2001 (4 percent compared with 2 percent).

Combined with the specter of teacher shortages in the early 1990s, ambitions to encourage high achieving college graduates to teach spurred the development of such programs as Teach for America (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman 2004;Raymond, Fletcher, and Luque 2001). In recent years, legislators addressed this issue in the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires teachers of core academic subjects to be highly qualified in those respective subjects by 2005-06. Other characteristics of teachers' education and qualifications also interest policymakers. For example, the attention to teachers' academic achievement and desire to expand the pool of potential teachers have also increased researchers' and policymakers' attention to the role of community colleges in the preparation of K-12 teachers (Blair 2003).\nTeachers' academic preparation, both in general and in the specific fields they teach, has been the object of intense interest among researchers and policymakers for many years (Murnane et al. 1991;NCTAF 1996NCTAF , 1997NCTAF , 2003Weaver 1983).

In recent years, legislators addressed this issue in the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires teachers of core academic subjects to be highly qualified in those respective subjects by 2005-06. Thus, the undergraduate academic experiences of graduates, and whether they differ with teaching status, are important issues for educators and policymakers. This section presents estimates of the proportion of graduates who pursued teaching in terms of the types of postsecondary institutions they attended, their achievement as measured by their college entrance examination (CEE) scores and grade point averages (GPAs), and the fields of study in which they majored as undergraduates."}, {"section_title": "Institutions Attended", "text": "Between 12 and 13 percent of 1999-2000 graduates had taught as of 2001 (table 2), regardless of the type of institution in which they began postsecondary education. However, the type of institution from which 1999-2000 graduates received the bachelor's degree was associated with whether they had taught by 2001. Graduates of non-doctorate-granting institutions (whether public or private not-for-profit) were more likely than graduates of other types of institutions to have taught by 2001 (14-17 percent vs. 11 percent or less).\nCollege graduates begin and complete their undergraduate education in types of institutions that vary enormously in terms of their mission, the student populations they serve, their revenue sources, and so on. Institutions that typically do not grant 4-year degrees, including community colleges and private junior colleges or vocational/technical schools, are to a large degree oriented toward preparing students for the labor market or for completion of a 4-year degree at another institution. Public and private 4-year institutions vary in, among other characteristics, the degree to which faculty focus on teaching or research and the types of degrees they grant (e.g., doctorate-granting versus non-doctorate-granting). Given the teacher shortages experienced in the past decade and increased attention to teachers' academic preparation, the role of community colleges in the preparation of K-12 teachers has received increasing attention among researchers and policymakers (National Science Foundation 1998;Recruiting New Teachers 2002;SERVE 2000;Townsend and Ignash 2003). In more than 20 states, community colleges offer teacher education programs at the associate's, and a few at the bachelor's, degree level (Blair 2003). Furthermore, the prevalence of community college attendance among college graduates in general-20 percent of all 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients first enrolled in a public 2-year institution (Bradburn et al. 2003)-has led educators and policymakers to pay greater attention to the role of nearly all community colleges in preparing K-12 teachers. Bachelor's degree recipients who begin in 2-year institutions typically complete many of their required general education courses in those institutions before transferring to a 4-year institution to complete their major field of study requirements. Thus, especially for elementary grade teachers, much of their undergraduate-level education in academic subjects may be undertaken in community colleges. In fact, bachelor's degree recipients who had begun their postsecondary education in a lessthan-4-year institution were as likely as other graduates to have taught in the first year after completing the bachelor's degree. Among bachelor's degree recipients who began postsecondary education at a 2-year institution, 13 percent taught during the first year after obtaining a bachelor's degree (table 2). Similarly, 12 percent of individuals who began at 4-year public and private not-for-profit institutions taught in the first postbaccalaureate year. At some point in their history, many public universities began as, or merged with, normal schools or teachers' colleges, that is, institutions dedicated to the preparation of elementary and, to some degree, secondary school teachers (Altenbaugh and Underwood 1990;Herbst 1989). Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that the type of institution from which graduates received their bachelor's degrees was associated with whether they had taught by 2001. Graduates of nondoctorate-granting institutions (whether public or private not-for-profit) were more likely than graduates of other types of institutions to have taught by 2001 (14-17 percent compared with 11 percent or less)."}, {"section_title": "College Entrance Examination (CEE) Scores and Undergraduate Grades", "text": "For at least two decades, policymakers and education researchers have stressed the importance of improving both the quality of K-12 teaching and the training/qualifications of those who teach the nation's children. Since the early 1980s, researchers have noted that college graduates who become teachers tend to have lower college entrance examination (CEE) scores than those who do not become teachers (Henke et al. 1996;Murnane et al. 1991;Schlecty and Vance 1983;Weaver 1983). Comparisons of graduates' undergraduate grade point averages (GPAs), however, indicate either that there were no differences between graduates who later taught at the K-12 level and those who did not, or that those who later taught had higher GPAs than their nonteaching peers (Book, Freeman, and Brousseau 1985;Frankel and Stowe 1990;Gray et al. 1993;Henke et al. 1996). These two measures of academic achievement were again associated, in opposite directions, with 1999-2000 graduates' having taught by 2001. Overall, bachelor's degree recipients who had taught were more likely than those who had not taught to have CEE scores in the lowest level of the CEE score distribution (figure B). 5 Graduates' cumulative undergraduate GPAs were positively related to having taught, and specifically to having been certified and taught. 5 However, relatively large proportions (24 to 31 percent) of graduates did not have test scores available for analysis. Additional analyses, related to these results and discussed in the technical appendix, indicate that findings concerning CEE scores may be confounded by the large proportions of graduates with missing scores.\nFor at least two decades, policymakers and education researchers have stressed the importance of improving both the quality of K-12 teaching and the training and qualifications of those who teach the nation's children (Education Commission of the States 1983;Holmes Group 1986;NCTAF 1996NCTAF , 1997NCTAF , 2003; National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983). In particular, teachers' academic achievement has been associated, in some research, with their students' academic achievement (e.g., Ehrenberg and Brewer 1995;Wayne and Youngs 2003). Two measures of teachers' academic achievement that have been used are their college entrance examination (CEE) scores and undergraduate grade point averages (GPAs). Each of these measures has advantages and disadvantages as an indicator of what teachers, or other college graduates, know and are able to do. CEEs measure entering postsecondary students' academic skill levels. These scores are of limited utility as measures of college graduates' achievement because these examinations are taken before graduates' postsecondary enrollment (or at least before their enrollment in a 4-year-institution). However, these scores provide the only measure of graduates' academic skills on a common metric. In contrast to CEE scores, GPAs are more contemporary measures of graduates' academic performance, but are not standardized among or within institutions. In addition, they are known to vary among graduates who major in different fields of study, and graduates' propensity to teach is also related to undergraduate major (Henke et al. 1996). Despite their limitations as measures of graduates' academic achievement, and in the absence of a valid and commonly taken measure of academic "}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary vi", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Major Field of Study", "text": "Not surprisingly, education majors were more likely than graduates who had majored in other fields both to have taught, regardless of certification or preparation, and to have prepared to teach if they had not taught (figure 3 and table 2).

Another 6 percent taught with preparation but not certification, and 13 percent had prepared but not taught as of the 2001 interview. After education majors, humanities majors were most likely to have taught by 2001 (17 percent), followed by social sciences majors (9 percent).\nFor some time, researchers and policymakers have paid particular attention to the depth of teachers' postsecondary education in the fields they teach (Ingersoll and Gruber 1996;NCTAF 1996NCTAF , 1997Seastrom et al. 2002;Wayne and Youngs 2003). As of 2001, 38 states (and Puerto Rico) required teachers to have a bachelor's degree with a major or minor in an academic content area to be certified (U.S. Department of Education 2002). 10 Furthermore, recent federal legislation requires that teachers in schools receiving certain types of federal funding be highly 10 These states did not necessarily require all teachers to have a major or minor in an academic content area. In some cases, only middle or high school teachers were required to have them. . This section examines the degree to which graduates who studied various academic fields as undergraduates became elementary and secondary school teachers or prepared to do so. B&B:2000/01 data indicate, not surprisingly, that education majors were more likely than graduates who had majored in other fields both to have taught, regardless of certification or preparation, and to have prepared to teach if they had not taught. Two-thirds of education majors had taught by 2001, and 56 percent had taught with certification (figure 3 and table 2). Another 6 Had not taught, was neither certified nor prepared percent taught with preparation but not certification, and 13 percent had prepared but not taught as of the 2001 interview. Following education majors, humanities majors were most likely to have taught-17 percent had done so by 2001. Humanities majors were followed by social sciences majors, 9 percent of whom had taught. The B&B:2000/01 data also indicate that although education majors were considerably more likely than graduates who had majored in other fields to have taught and prepared to teach, many graduates who had taught by 2001 had not majored in education. About one-half (48 percent) of graduates who had taught had majored in education, 22 percent had majored in the humanities, 14 percent had majored in the social sciences, and 8 percent had majored in mathematics, computer science, or the natural sciences (table 3). Among graduates who had taught with certification by 2001, about one-fifth (19 percent) were humanities majors, one-tenth were social sciences majors, and 7 percent majored in mathematics, computer science, or a natural science. About 30 percent of those who taught with preparation but not certification were humanities majors, another 10 percent were social sciences majors, and about 10 percent were mathematics, computer science, or natural sciences majors. In addition, 16 percent of those who had prepared to teach but not yet taught were humanities majors, another 16 percent were social sciences majors, and 11 percent were mathematics, computer sciences, or natural sciences majors. The level of the school in which graduates taught in their first teaching jobs since college graduation was associated with the fields in which they had majored as undergraduates. Among this cohort of graduates, 61 percent of those who first taught in elementary schools had majored in education as undergraduates, in contrast to 31 percent of those who first taught in secondary level schools. About one-third (32 percent) of teachers among this cohort who began teaching in secondary schools majored in the humanities, compared with 18 percent of those who began in elementary schools and 7 percent of those who began in combined schools. About 40 percent of teachers in the cohort who had first taught in combined schools after completing their bachelor's degrees had majored in education (44 percent) and the social sciences (39 percent).

Overall, working as an aide or substitute teacher was not common among graduates who had not taught as of 2001. Among those who had not held a regular teaching position as of 2001, however, those who had become certified or who had prepared to teach were far more likely than those who had not prepared to teach to work as an aide or substitute (tables 4 and 5).

Also, those who had scored in the lowest level of the CEE score distribution were more likely than those in the upper three levels (7 percent compared with 3-4 percent) to have worked as an aide or substitute. Working as an aide or substitute teacher was not observed to vary with graduates' cumulative undergraduate GPAs. As with regular teaching positions, working as an aide or substitute teacher was related to undergraduate field of study. Approximately one-fourth of education majors who had not held regular teaching positions had worked as an aide or substitute as of 2001, a higher proportion than those observed in all other major fields. Social sciences and humanities majors were more likely than business/management or mathematics/computer science/natural sciences majors to have worked in these positions (5-7 percent vs. 1-2 percent).

Improving new teachers' experiences in their first few years in the classroom is believed to be key to retaining more teachers (NCTAF 2003;National Governor's Association 2000;Veenman 1984).\nAlthough new college graduates' attrition from teaching is no more frequent than their attrition from other occupations held within the first year of completing the bachelor's degree (Henke and Zahn 2001), from the perspectives of some education policymakers and administrators, attrition remains a concern because of its implications for the cost and quality of the teacher workforce (Ingersoll 2001;NCTAF 2003). Recruiting students into teacher education programs, training them, and then recruiting new teachers, hiring them, and providing support and training for new teachers all cost valuable resources (NCTAF 2003). In addition, students' achievement is positively correlated with their teachers' years of experience (Murnane and Phillips 1981;Rockoff 2004;Wayne and Youngs 2003). New teachers, by definition, have the least seniority in their schools and districts, and therefore, it has been asserted, receive the most difficult teaching assignments (NCTAF 1996).

Consequently, improving teachers' experiences in their first few years on the job is believed to be key to retaining more teachers (NCTAF 2003;National Governor's Association 2000;Veenman 1984). Policy efforts related to this goal include providing new teachers with such support as mentor teachers, reduced teaching loads, and targeted professional development programs.

Previous research indicates that teachers in high-minority enrollment schools differ from teachers in lower-minority enrollment schools in a number of ways, some of which may be related to teachers' perceptions of the support they receive and to their need for support. For example, teachers in urban or high-minority enrollment schools are often less experienced and less qualified than teachers in other schools (Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff 2002;NCTAF 1996). Such teachers may feel the need for support more strongly than other teachers. x"}, {"section_title": "Comparisons With 1992-93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "The percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had taught in a K-12 school within about a year of receiving a bachelor's degree increased from 10 percent to 12 percent between 1994 and 2001 (table 13). This increase occurred primarily among graduates who were certified to teach: in 1994, some 7 percent of graduates had taught with certification, 1 percent with preparation but no certification, and 2 percent with neither certification nor preparation, compared with 9 percent, 1 percent, and 3 percent, respectively, in 2001. 11 The increase in certified teachers among recent bachelor's degree recipients was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion who had prepared to teach but had not taught within a year of completing the bachelor's degree. In 1994, some 5 percent of 1992-93 graduates had prepared to teach but not yet taught, whereas in 2001, some 3 percent of 1999-2000 graduates had done so. This increase in the likelihood of teaching occurred among both men and women and among Whites. Among Black bachelor's degree recipients, the proportion who had taught increased from 9 percent in 1994 to 13 percent in 2001 and the proportion who taught with certification increased from 4 percent to 8 percent in the same time period. Teaching status 1 year after receiving a bachelor's degree appeared to have changed over time among American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, or graduates of other racial/ethnic groups. However, these estimates were associated with large standard errors, due to small samples, and the apparent differences were not statistically significant. Graduates were less likely to have prepared to teach but not taught in 2001 than in 1994 regardless of the type of postsecondary institution they first attended (table 14). In addition, graduates who began postsecondary education in private not-for-profit or public 4-year institutions were more likely to have taught overall and with certification in 2001 than in 1994. Graduates who received their degrees from public 4-year nondoctorate-granting institutions were more likely to have taught overall and with certification in 2001 than in 1994, and they were less likely to have prepared to teach but not taught. Graduates with CEE scores in the lowest and middle levels of the CEE score distribution were more likely to have taught overall and with certification in 2001 than in 1994. Furthermore, 1999-2000 graduates with scores in the lowest level were less likely than their 1992-93 counterparts to have neither prepared nor taught (77 percent vs. 82 percent) within a year of completing their degrees. Similarly, graduates whose cumulative undergraduate GPAs fell between 2.75 and 3.74 were more likely to have taught overall and with certification in 2001 than in 1994. In addition, graduates whose GPAs were 2.75 or higher were less likely to have prepared but not taught in 2001 than in 1994. Graduates who had majored in education, the humanities, and the social sciences were more likely to have taught overall and with certification in 2001 compared with 1994. In addition, whereas one-fourth of 1992-93 graduates with education majors had prepared to teach but not taught as of 1994, 13 percent of 1999-2000 graduates had done so as of 2001. xi"}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report examines elementary/secondary teaching and teaching-related behavior among college graduates who received a bachelor's degree from U.S. postsecondary institutions in academic year 1999-2000. 1 It is based on data from the 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01), a spring 2001 follow-up of bachelor's degree recipients from the 1999National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2000. This is the second Baccalaureate and Beyond cohort that has been surveyed by the National Center for Education Statistics. The first study examined 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients from the 1992-93 NPSAS, with follow-ups in 1994, 1997, and 2003. This report discusses teaching in elementary and secondary schools, preparing to teach at the elementary/secondary level, and considering teaching among 1999-2000 college graduates as of 2001 (i.e., within about a year of completing the bachelor's degree). It examines whether graduates who differed in demographic characteristics (gender and race/ethnicity) and undergraduate academic characteristics (types of institutions attended, college entrance examination scores, undergraduate grade point averages, and major fields of study) also differed in terms of teaching and teaching-related behaviors as of 2001. The report also compares teaching and teaching-related behaviors of the 1999-2000 cohort as of 2001 with those of the 1992-93 cohort as of 1994.

Newspapers across the country have published accounts of elementary/secondary teacher shortages (Associated Press 2003;Booth 2002;Coeyman 2001;Coleman 2001;Ross 2001;Sack 2001;Schulhofer-Wohl 2001;Schulhofer-Wohl and Hetzner 2001;Seymour 2001). Whether attributed to high rates of attrition among new teachers, larger enrollments, or programs to reduce class size, such articles note that many school districts find staffing classrooms with trained teachers to be a significant challenge. Reported shortages often occur in specific subject areas-bilingual education, special education, mathematics, and science-that are harder to staff regardless of the overall teacher supply (Kuchera 2002;Lindelof 2003;Melendez and Go 2002;Rossi and Grossman 2002). Schools that serve high proportions of low-income, low-achieving, or racial/ethnic minority students have difficulty attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2004). Almost simultaneously, newspapers have also reported that substantial proportions of teachers in many districts have faced the possibility of layoffs in recent years, attributing these layoffs to state and local budget shortfalls in the wake of a more slowly growing national economy (Banchero and Sherlock 2003;Murphy 2003;Rado and Keilman 2003). In at least some districts, news reports indicate that the teachers most recently hired are the first to be laid off (Walsh and Nixon 2004). Administrators in these districts have been reported to speculate that laid off teachers who find jobs in other industries may not return to teaching once state and local governments' fiscal crises ease and the demand for teachers again rises (Walsh and Nixon 2004). New bachelor's degree recipients represent a small but essential component of the U.S. elementary/secondary teacher workforce. In 1999-2000, nearly all (98 percent) of the approximately 3.4 million K-12 teachers in the United States had earned a bachelor's degree, and of those with a bachelor's degree, approximately 5 percent had first earned a bachelor's between 1998 and 2000. 1 Approximately 11 percent of all teachers had less than 3 years of teaching As increasing numbers of baby-boomer teachers are expected to reach retirement age in the coming years, new college graduates will continue to be an important source of new teachers (National Commission for Teaching and America's Future [NCTAF] 2003). Beyond new graduates' rate of entry into the profession, their potential for retention, which is affected by their levels of preparation and early teaching experiences, is of significant interest to educators and policymakers responsible for staffing the nation's schools (NCTAF 2003). Moreover, it is important to assess interest in teaching among graduates who do not teach immediately following bachelor's degree receipt. The proportion of these graduates who become teachers later in their working lives may strongly affect the ease with which the nation's schools are staffed."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": "This report uses data collected as part of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Studies (B&B) in 1994 and 2001 to examine teaching, preparation to teach, and other steps taken toward a teaching career by 1992-93 and 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients. All participants in the B&B studies were first interviewed as part of the respective National Postsecondary Student Aid Studies, which were conducted in 1992- 93 and 1999(NPSAS:93 and NPSAS:2000. The earlier B&B cohort was interviewed again in 1994, and the later one in 2001 (B&B:93/94 and 2000/01). 3 For most respondents, the B&B interview took place approximately 1 year after they graduated, but the time frame was somewhat longer for those who graduated early in the academic year. For convenience, the terms \"a year later\" or \"after a year\" are used in this report, although the actual time frame is not exactly 12 months for all graduates. The NPSAS studies sampled about 1,100 institutions. Each sampled institution provided a list of its students, and from these lists of students, a nationally representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary education institutions, including undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students, was derived. Each NPSAS sample of undergraduates represents more than 16 million undergraduates who were enrolled at some time between July 1 and June 30 of the respective survey year. The sampling frames for NPSAS were built from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systems Institutional Characteristics (IPEDS-IC) file for 1990-91 and 1998-99, respectively. From the lists of students provided by sampled institutions, about 12,500 students were selected for participation in the B&B sample in 1992-93 and 11,600 students in 1999-2000. Of the sampled students, approximately 10,000 students completed interviews in each first followup data collection. Students who, during the B&B interview or from transcripts, were determined not to have earned a bachelor's degree during the relevant academic year (of whom there were 760 in 1992- 93 and 70 in 1999-2000) were excluded from the final sample. The unweighted response rate for B&B:93/94 was 92 percent (the weighted response rate was not reported) and the overall weighted response rate for B&B:2000/01 was 74 percent. The data presented in this report cover the 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The bachelor's degree recipients interviewed in each study represent the approximately 1.2 million bachelor's degree completers in each of the 2 years. Thus far, analyses of the 1992-93 cohort's teaching experiences (Henke, Chen, and Geis 2000;Henke et al. 1996) have focused on graduates' location within a hypothetical teacher pipeline. However, because the 2001 follow-up of 1999-2000 college graduates differs from the 1994 data collection in several ways, this report discusses graduates' status vis-a-vis elementary/secondary teaching somewhat differently in order to facilitate comparisons over time. 4 In this report graduates' teaching status is defined in terms of both \u2022 whether they had taught (not including working as a substitute teacher or teacher's aide), and \u2022 whether they had a) become certified to teach or b) prepared to teach (that is, completed a teacher education program or a student teaching assignment) but not yet been certified. Given the nature of and variation in some state requirements for teacher certification, graduates' probability of being certified to teach within a year of completing a first bachelor's degree may vary with the state in which they reside or teach. Differences among states in requirements for certification may lead to state-by-state variation in graduates' perceptions of the difficulty of becoming certified to teach. Such differences in graduates' perceptions could influence their decisionmaking regarding whether to pursue a certificate before teaching in a private school (where certificates are not required by the state). Thus, state policies, as well as individual graduates' personal inclinations, may affect their teaching status within a year after completing a bachelor's degree. The analysis uses standard t tests to determine statistical significance of differences between estimates, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to detect trends. All differences noted are statistically significant at the p<.05 level. When relevant to the discussion, the report points out apparent differences that do not reach statistical significance. More details regarding the data, definitions of variables, and statistical techniques used are available in the appendices to this report."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The report discusses teaching among recent college graduates in two major sections. The first section begins by describing the demographic and undergraduate academic characteristics of 1999-2000 baccalaureate degree recipients who taught and/or prepared to teach by 2001. The section then examines how the characteristics of graduates differ with teaching status. It continues by discussing graduates' teaching-related experiences: working as a teacher's aide or substitute teacher, having considered teaching, and having applied for teaching. It concludes by discussing the teaching experiences of graduates who taught. The second section of the report compares the teaching status of 1999-2000 graduates in 2001 with that of 1992-93 graduates in 1994. Differences between the cohorts are compared both in the aggregate and within subgroups defined by demographic and undergraduate academic characteristics. Appendix A presents definitions of the variables used in the analysis and appendix B discusses the B&B:2000/01 data in greater detail as well as the methodology used in the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Taught", "text": "Had not taught achievement for postsecondary students or college graduates, these measures have been used consistently to study teachers' academic skill levels and to compare their skills with those of other college graduates. Since the early 1980s, researchers have noted that college graduates who became teachers tended to have lower CEE scores than those who did not become teachers (Murnane et al. 1991;Schlecty and Vance 1983;Weaver 1983). Comparisons of graduates' undergraduate grade point averages (GPAs), however, indicated either no difference between graduates who later taught at the K-12 level and those who did not, or that those who later taught had higher GPAs than their nonteaching peers (Book, Freeman, and Brousseau 1985;Henke et al. 1996). Among 1999-2000 graduates, CEE scores and undergraduate GPAs continued to be associated with whether they had taught by 2001, although again in opposite directions. 8 As was found among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients with test scores available for analysis (Henke et al. 1996), among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients with test scores, those with higher CEE scores were less likely than those with lower scores to have taught. Graduates with higher scores were also less likely than those with lower scores to have taught with certification. In this study, the data also indicate that among all bachelor's degree recipients, teachers were more likely than nonteachers to have test scores available for analysis. 9 Whereas one-fourth of teachers did not have CEE scores available for analysis, 31 percent of nonteachers did not (figure 2). Among bachelor's degree recipients with CEE scores, teachers were more likely than nonteachers to have CEE scores in the lowest level of the cohort's test score distribution. Graduates' cumulative GPAs, however, were positively related to having taught and specifically to having been certified and taught (table 2). This finding is also consistent with past research:sStudies of 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients 1 year after graduation found positive associations between preparing to teach and undergraduate GPAs (Frankel and Stowe 1990;Gray et al. 1993;Henke et al. 1996). Although there is some evidence that teachers' academic achievement positively affects their students' achievement, good measures of teachers' academic achievement are difficult to obtain. The measures used in this study, teachers' CEE scores and their undergraduate GPAs, are not ideal because teachers take CEEs years before they begin their teaching careers and because GPAs have no single scale and vary among undergraduate majors and institutions. As previous research has demonstrated consistently, these two measures of achievement result in contradictory findings regarding achievement and teaching: graduates' scores were negatively related to teaching while GPAs were positively related to teaching.\nTaught, certified Respondent taught in any of grades K-12 (not including substitute teaching or teacher's aide position) since graduation and was certified by at least one state at the probationary or regular level. Taught, prepared, but not certified Respondent taught in any of grades K-12 (not including substitute teaching or teacher's aide position) since graduation and had prepared to teach without certification. In B&B:2000/01, graduates who had prepared to teach were defined as those who had completed either a teacher education program or a student teaching assignment as of 2001. In B&B:93/94, those whose undergraduate transcript included student teaching credit were defined as having prepared to teach.

Among graduates who had not taught, those who had begun their postsecondary education in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than those who began in public 4-year institutions to have considered teaching (40 percent compared with 35 percent). Generally, the proportion of graduates who had not taught, but had considered teaching, ranged from 34 to 40 percent regardless of the type of institution from which they received their 1999-2000 degrees, their CEE scores, and their cumulative undergraduate GPAs. 11 As was observed with respect to teaching as of 2001, Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were less likely than Black and White graduates to have considered teaching (29 percent compared with 45 and 37 percent, respectively). 12 In addition, undergraduate major field of study was related to having considered teaching in some ways that were similar to its relationship with teaching as of 2001: humanities and social sciences majors were more likely than business/management, education, and mathematics/computer science/natural sciences majors to have considered teaching. 13 Otherwise, characteristics that were associated with teaching-gender, type of degreegranting institution, CEE score, cumulative GPA in undergraduate major field of study-were not associated with having considered teaching. In addition, the type of postsecondary institution in which graduates had begun postsecondary education, which was not associated with whether graduates had taught, was associated with their having considered teaching (if they had not taught).

In addition, although the proportion of graduates of private for-profit institutions appears to be greater (49 percent), there was no statistical evidence to support the conclusion that this proportion was different from those observed among graduates of other institution types. 12 Although it appears that Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were also less likely than Hispanic graduates to have considered teaching, this difference was not statistically significant. 13 Note that because a large proportion of graduates who had majored in education had already taught or prepared/become certified to teach, fewer education majors merely considered teaching. In addition, some graduates who majored in education taught at the prekindergarten or postsecondary levels, in adult schools (i.e., schools for adults who have not yet completed secondary education), or other settings outside elementary/secondary education. These graduates may well have reported that they did not consider elementary/secondary education. recipients who had not taught as of 2001, but who had at least considered teaching, were asked whether they had applied for a teaching position since completing the 1999-2000 degree. 14 Of 14 Respondents who had not taught as of 2001, and a) were certified to teach, b) had completed a teacher education program or had completed a student teaching assignment, or c) had considered teaching were asked whether they had applied for a teaching position.  4 The 2.2 percent of graduates who began in other types of institutions (public less-than-2-year, private not-for-profit less-than-4-year, and private for-profit institutions) are included in the total row, but excluded from this variable. 5 Includes 4-year degree-granting institutions. 6 Derived from institution-or agency-reported SAT or ACT scores, where available.

Among those who had prepared to teach, 43 percent had applied, compared with 7 percent among those who had only considered teaching. 15 Of the demographic and undergraduate academic characteristics examined in this report, graduates' CEE and undergraduate majors were associated with whether those who had not taught but had at least considered teaching had applied for a teaching position. Nonteachers who had at least considered teaching were less likely to have applied to teach if their CEE scores were in the highest level among 1999-2000 graduates than if their scores were in the lower levels (6 percent compared with 9 to 10 percent). On the other hand, nonteaching graduates who had majored in education were more likely than those in other majors to have applied (26 percent compared with 10 percent or less). Thus, applying for a teaching position in the year following college graduation was associated with relatively few of the undergraduate academic characteristics observed in this study."}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Not Applying", "text": "Among graduates who had not taught but had indicated some interest in teaching (that is, had prepared to teach, worked as a substitute teacher or teacher's aide, or reported considering teaching), 91 percent had not applied for a teaching position (table 7). These graduates were asked why they had not applied, and interviewers coded their responses into up to three reasons for not applying into the following specific categories: graduate was not interested in teaching, graduate thought/felt that teaching conditions were poor, graduate wanted a higher salary than s/he thought available in teaching, graduate already had another job, graduate had received an offer for a better job, graduate was unable to pass required tests, graduate had not yet taken the required tests, graduate was not yet certified, and all other reasons. It appears that some of these graduates may have intended to apply for a position when they had become certified to teach or had reached some milestone on the way to certification: Onefourth had not applied because they were not yet certified, and 7 percent had not applied because they had not yet taken the required tests. Some nonteachers who had at least considered teaching appeared to have rejected the profession because it no longer appealed to them or other careers seemed more appealing. Onefifth reported that they were not interested in teaching (presumably they had considered the profession previously but were no longer interested at the time of the interview). In addition, 13 Reason for not applying for teaching position Reason for not applying for teaching position percent indicated that they wanted a higher salary than that available in teaching, 3 percent had received a better job offer, and 2 percent cited poor teaching conditions. Men and women differed in their reasons for not applying for teaching positions. Men were more likely than women to report that they did not apply because they were not interested in teaching or wanted higher salaries (23 and 17 percent compared with 17 and 9 percent, respectively). Women, on the other hand, were more likely than men (30 percent versus 19 percent) to report that they had not applied because they were not yet certified, perhaps indicating an intention to teach in the future. The types of postsecondary institutions in which graduates first enrolled and from which they received their bachelor's degrees were also related to their reasons for not applying for teaching positions. Graduates who began postsecondary education in public 4-year institutions were more likely than those who began in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions to not apply because they were not yet certified. At the same time, graduates who began in public 4-year institutions were less likely than those who began in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions to not apply because they were not interested in teaching. Those who received their degrees from public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions were more likely than those from doctorate-granting institutions not to have applied because they were not certified (34 percent compared with 23 and 17 percent, respectively). Similarly, in private not-for-profit institutions, those who graduated from non-doctorate-granting institutions were more likely than their counterparts from doctorate-granting institutions to have given this reason for not applying for teaching positions (28 percent compared with 17 percent). Although graduates' test scores were associated with their reasons for not applying to teach, their undergraduate grades appear not to have been. The higher graduates' CEE scores, the more likely they were to not apply for a teaching position because they were not interested in teaching or wanted a higher salary. For example, one-fourth of graduates with scores in the highest level did not apply because they were not interested in teaching, compared with 18 percent of those with scores in the lowest level. Graduates' scores were inversely related to not applying because they were not yet certified. Graduates' majors in college were associated with some of the reasons they gave for not applying for teaching positions. Mathematics, computer science, and natural sciences majors were more likely than humanities and social sciences majors to have not applied for a teaching position because they wanted higher salaries. Mathematics, computer science, and natural sciences majors and business and management majors were also more likely than \"other\" 16 majors to have not applied for this reason. Education majors were more likely than those who majored in business and management; mathematics, computer science, and the natural sciences; and \"other\" majors to have not applied because they were not yet certified (43 percent compared with 16 to 23 percent). In addition, those who majored in the humanities, social sciences, and \"other\" fields were more likely than mathematics, computer science, and natural sciences majors to have not applied because they were not yet certified. However, no difference was detected among graduates of different majors in the likelihood of not applying to teach because they were not interested in teaching. Thus, graduates with some of the characteristics that were associated with teaching and preparing to teach (i.e., being a woman; receiving the bachelor's degree from a non-doctorategranting institution; having higher CEE scores; majoring in education, the humanities, or social sciences as an undergraduate) were more likely than other graduates to report that they had not applied for a teaching position because they were not yet certified or had yet to achieve milestones related to certification. To the degree that this reason indicates an inclination to teach once certified, these results are consistent with those observed with respect to teaching and preparing to teach."}, {"section_title": "Sector of School Where First Taught After 1999-2000 Bachelor's Degree", "text": "Among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients who had taught as of 2001, 91 percent had taught in a public school and 9 percent in a private school in their first teaching job after receiving the bachelor's degree (table 8).

For example, in 1999-2000, 80 percent of teachers with less than 3 years of teaching experience taught in public schools, compared with 91 percent of teachers with more than 20 years of experience. 18 Compared with both all 1999-2000 teachers and all less experienced 1999-2000 teachers (i.e., those with 3 or fewer years of teaching experience), 1999-2000 college graduates who had taught as of 2001 were more likely to have taught in a public school.

In addition, graduates with CEE scores in the highest level of the score distribution were more likely than their peers to have first taught in a secondary school (48 percent compared with 25 to 32 percent) and less likely to have first taught in an elementary school (48 percent versus 64 to 71 percent). Teachers who majored in education as undergraduates were more likely than their peers who majored in other fields to have first taught in an elementary school: 78 percent of education majors first taught in an elementary school, compared with 48 to 56 percent of graduates who majored in other fields. Similarly, education majors were less likely than those who majored in other fields to have first taught in a secondary school (19 percent versus 34 to 50 percent). These differences may reflect, at least in part, many states' requirements that middle-or secondarygrade teachers have undergraduate majors in an academic discipline (rather than in education) for state certification (U.S. Department of Education 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Subjects Taught in First Teaching Job After 1999-2000 Bachelor's Degree", "text": "In the 2001 interview, graduates who had taught reported all of the subjects that they had taught in the first teaching job they held after receiving the bachelor's degree. Reflecting, in part, the distribution of teachers among elementary, secondary, and combined schools, about 30 percent taught elementary or early childhood education; about one-fourth taught English, reading, or writing; about one-fifth taught mathematics; 17 percent taught science; and 15 percent taught social studies or history (tables 10a-b). 20 Eight percent or less taught each of several other subjects. 21 20 School level and teaching field are correlated to a limited degree. Teachers in elementary schools may teach specific subjects (e.g., mathematics, science, reading, art, PE, etc.) or specific populations (e.g., special education students, LEP students, bilingual/ESL classes, etc.). In addition, the NCES definition of elementary-level schools, provided in appendix A, includes schools that serve grades 6 through 8, many of which have departmentalized organization. 21 Total sums to more than 100 percent because some graduates taught more than one subject. The 2.2 percent of graduates who began in other types of institutions (public less-than-2-year, private not-for-profit less-than-4-year, and private for-profit institutions) are included in the total row, but excluded from this variable. 4 Includes 4-year degree-granting institutions. 5 Derived from institution-or agency-reported SAT or ACT scores, where available.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01).  Women were twice as likely as men (36 percent compared with 16 percent) to have taught elementary or early childhood education, and more likely than men (28 percent compared with 20 percent) to have taught English, reading, or writing. Men were more likely than women to have taught in health or physical education in their first teaching jobs after receiving the bachelor's degree (15 percent compared with 3 percent). Just as first teaching in an elementary or secondary school was associated with graduates' CEE scores, so was teaching elementary/early childhood education. The higher graduates' CEE scores, the less likely they were to have taught elementary/early childhood education in their first teaching jobs. In addition, graduates with scores in the highest level of the CEE score distribution were more likely than other graduates to have taught art, drama, or music in their first teaching jobs. Graduates with scores in the highest level were less likely than others to have taught health or physical education in their first teaching jobs. These data indicate no significant association between the proportion of graduates who taught a foreign language or mathematics in their first teaching job and graduates' CEE scores. Among those who taught, graduates' cumulative undergraduate GPAs were associated with the fields they taught in their first teaching jobs after graduation. For example, graduates with lower cumulative undergraduate GPAs were more likely to have taught elementary or early childhood education in their first jobs: nearly 40 percent of those with GPAs between 2.25 and 2.74 taught this subject, compared with 25 percent of those who had GPAs of 3.75 or higher. Graduates with higher GPAs were more likely than those with lower GPAs to have taught art, drama, or music or English, reading or writing. These data did not indicate a relationship between the proportion of graduates who taught mathematics, science, and social studies or history and graduates' cumulative undergraduate GPAs. In their first teaching jobs, graduates often, but not always, taught subjects related to the fields in which they had majored as undergraduates. For example, among new social sciences graduates who taught, 30 percent taught social studies or history in their first teaching jobs, and graduates in no other field were more likely to have taught social studies in their first teaching jobs. Likewise, education majors were more likely than any other major to have taught elementary/early childhood education in their first teaching position (42 percent compared with 29 percent or less), and humanities graduates were more likely than others to have taught art, drama, or music. Mathematics, computer science, and natural sciences majors were more likely than graduates in other majors, with the exception of education majors, to have taught mathematics in their first teaching jobs. Similarly, humanities graduates were more likely than all but education majors to have taught English, reading, or writing. 22 Most graduates were certified in the subjects they had taught in their first teaching jobs after receiving the 1999-2000 degree. Eighty-five percent of those who had taught elementary or early childhood education classes-in which a teacher teaches multiple subjects to the same group of students for all or most of the school day-were certified in elementary or early childhood education (figure 4). Among graduates who had taught the core subjects of Elementary/early childhood education"}, {"section_title": "Percent", "text": "English/reading/writing, mathematics, science, and social studies/history, 74 to 80 percent were certified in those areas. Graduates who had taught elementary/early childhood education were more likely than those who taught all other fields (except special education and social studies/history) to be certified in their respective subject. In turn, those who had taught special education and social studies/history were more likely than those who had taught art/music/drama, foreign languages, health/physical education, or vocational/occupational education to be certified in their respective subjects."}, {"section_title": "Satisfaction with Teaching", "text": "Graduates who had taught after receiving the 1999-2000 bachelor's degree were asked to indicate whether they were very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, or not satisfied with seven aspects of their most recent teaching jobs, and this section focuses on the proportion of teaching graduates who were very satisfied with each of these aspects. About three-fifths were very satisfied with the support they had received from their school's administration, a higher proportion than were very satisfied with all other aspects except their school's learning environment (table 11). More than one-half (56 percent) of teachers among 1999-2000 graduates were very satisfied with their school's learning environment, and one-half were very satisfied with their class size. Graduates were least likely to be very satisfied with society's perception of the teaching profession: whereas 16 percent were very satisfied with this aspect of teaching, onethird or more were very satisfied with each of the other six aspects of teaching. Some characteristics of the schools in which they had most recently taught were associated with graduates' satisfaction with various aspects of teaching. Graduates who had most recently taught in private schools were more likely than those who had most recently taught in public schools to be very satisfied with all seven aspects of teaching included in the interview. The level of the school in which they had most recently taught was associated with teachers' satisfaction with some aspects of their jobs. New teachers who had most recently taught at an elementary school were more likely than those who had most recently taught at a secondary school to report that they were very satisfied with student motivation, the school's learning environment, student behavior, and class size. The proportion of graduates who were very satisfied with their students' motivation, students' behavior, or class size did not vary significantly with the proportion of students who were of minority background in the schools where graduates had most recently taught. However, teachers' satisfaction with some aspects of their jobs was related to the proportion of minority students who were enrolled in their schools. The greater the proportion of minority students, the less likely teachers were to be very satisfied with their school's learning environment, parent support, society's perception of the profession, and the support they received from their school administration. Teachers' responses indicate their subjective sense of satisfaction with various aspects, which may vary with teacher characteristics as well as school or student characteristics. Previous research indicates that teachers in high-minority enrollment schools differ from teachers in lower-minority enrollment schools in a number of ways, some of which may be related to teachers' perceptions of the support they receive and to their need for support. For example, teachers in high-minority enrollment schools are often less experienced than teachers in other schools (NCTAF 1996). Such teachers may feel the need for support more strongly than other teachers, and therefore be more likely to feel that the support they receive is inadequate."}, {"section_title": "Whether School Helped New Teachers", "text": "Between three-fourths and four-fifths of graduates agreed that the school in which they had most recently taught had been effective in helping new teachers with four aspects of teaching: student discipline, instruction, curriculum, and adjusting to the school environment (table 12). Teachers in public schools were less likely than their peers at private schools to agree that their schools had helped new teachers with discipline and instruction effectively. In addition, whereas four-fifths (82 percent) of those who first taught in elementary schools believed their schools had been effective in helping new teachers with instruction, three-fourths (74 percent) did so in secondary schools. As observed vis-a-vis teachers' satisfaction with some aspects of their schools, as the percentage of minority students in the school rose, the proportion of teachers who agreed that their schools had been effective in helping new teachers with discipline, curriculum, and adjusting to the school environment declined. For example, in schools with less than one-fourth minority enrollment, 76 percent of teachers agreed that the schools had been effective in helping new teachers with discipline. In contrast, in schools with at least three-fourths minority students, 63 percent of teachers agreed that the schools had been effective in helping new teachers with discipline. Again, these differences may reflect teacher characteristics as well as school or student characteristics.    The 2.2 percent of graduates who began in other types of institutions (public less-than-2-year, private not-for-profit less-than-4-year, and private for-profit institutions) are included in the total row, but excluded from this variable. 2 Includes for-profit 4-year degree-granting institutions. 3 Derived from College Board-, institution-, or student-reported SAT or ACT scores, where available. 4 Derived from institution-or agency-reported SAT or ACT scores, where available.

Furthermore, 1999-2000 graduates with scores in the lowest level were less likely than their 1992-93 counterparts to have neither prepared nor taught (77 percent versus 82 percent) within a year of completing their degrees. Similar changes were observed over time among some subgroups of graduates defined by their cumulative GPAs. Graduates whose cumulative undergraduate GPAs fell between 2.75 and 3.74 were more likely to have taught and to have taught with certification in 2001 than in 1994. In addition, graduates whose GPAs were 2.75 or higher were less likely to have prepared but not taught in 2001 than in 1994. Graduates who had majored in education, the humanities, and the social sciences were more likely to have taught and to have taught with certification in 2001 than in 1994. Finally, one-fourth of 1992-93 graduates with education majors had prepared to teach but not taught as of 1994, compared with 13 percent of 1999-2000 education majors as of 2001. In summary, graduates were slightly more likely to have taught in 2001 than in 1994. This slight increase appears to have been driven by an increase in the proportion of graduates who had prepared to teach and then actually taught in the year following bachelor's degree receipt. This cohort difference was observed both overall and within some subgroups of graduates."}, {"section_title": "THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Teaching continued to be a common occupation among 1999-2000 graduates, 12 percent of whom had taught in a K-12 school within 1 year of completing their bachelor's degree. Moreover, teaching was associated with various demographic and academic characteristics in predictable ways. As has been the case for generations, teaching continued to attract women graduates more often than their male counterparts in the 21st century. Among graduates, women were more likely than men to have taught (regardless of their level of preparation) and to have prepared to teach. Women who had not taught were more likely than their male counterparts to have expressed some interest in teaching by having worked as a substitute teacher or teacher's aide or considered teaching by 2001. Among graduates who had expressed such interest in teaching but had not applied for a teaching position, women were less likely than men to report that they had not applied because they were not interested in teaching or wanted higher salaries. They were more likely than men to have not applied because they were not yet certified, however. In addition to gender, choosing and preparing to teach were associated with graduates' racial/ethnic background. Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were less likely than Black, Hispanic, and White graduates to have taught and to have substitute taught or worked as a teacher's aide. Among graduates who had not taught, Asian/Pacific Islanders were less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to have considered teaching. College graduates begin and complete undergraduate education in a wide variety of types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from institutions that do not grant 4-year degrees to those whose primary mission is to provide instruction and confer bachelor's and master's degrees to those with a strong emphasis on basic research as well as undergraduate and graduate education. Recent policy discussions have focused on ways in which community colleges, although they typically do not grant the bachelor's degrees required by all states for an initial teaching credential, contribute to the preparation of elementary and secondary teachers. Some have suggested that community colleges could be fertile grounds for teacher recruitment. The B&B:2000/01 data indicate that, as of 2001, the type of institution in which graduates began their undergraduate education was not associated with whether they taught in the year following college graduation. Regardless of the type of institution in which they began their postsecondary education, 12 to 13 percent of all graduates had taught within a year of completing the bachelor's degree. The type of postsecondary institution from which graduates had received the 1999-2000 bachelor's degree, however, was associated with teaching (or movement toward it) among graduates. In general, graduates of public and of non-doctorate-granting institutions were more inclined toward teaching, that is, more likely to have taught, prepared to teach, and so on, than graduates of private and doctorate-granting institutions, respectively. As in the past, academic achievement was associated with teaching, although the two measures of academic achievement used in this study were related to teaching in opposite ways. Graduates' cumulative undergraduate GPAs were positively associated with teaching and with teaching with certification. However, the difference was not great: whereas 14 percent of graduates with GPAs of 3.75 or above had taught within a year of completing their bachelor's degrees, 9 percent of graduates with GPAs below 2.75 did so. Among graduates with CEE scores available for analysis, the B&B:2000/01 data indicate that CEE scores were negatively associated with teaching. Graduates with higher scores were less likely than those with lower scores to have taught and to have taught with certification. Among graduates who had not taught but had at least considered teaching, those with scores in the highest level were less likely than others to have applied for a teaching position by 2001. Among those with some interest who did not apply for teaching positions, those with higher scores were more likely than those with lower scores to not apply because they were not interested in teaching or wanted a higher salary. How well these variables indicate graduates' academic skills and abilities are unclear for a number of reasons, however. Although nearly all sampled graduates had GPAs available for analysis, nearly one-third of graduates had either not taken a CEE or did not have a score available for analysis. In particular, nonteaching graduates were less likely than teaching graduates to have scores available for analysis. 23 CEE scores represent achievement prior to attending 4-year institutions, and thus do not measure any value added by attendance at those institutions. GPAs are not standardized among or within institutions. To the extent that states and professional organizations develop other measures of teachers' academic skills and achievement in response to NCLB and other legislation or policy initiatives, it will be possible to measure more directly the relationship between the curricula they are required to teach and those they have mastered themselves. Legislation has already mandated that teachers of core academic subjects meet state standards for academic preparation in those subjects. Given this policy context, these data indicate that although graduates who had majored in education were consistently more likely than others to teach, prepare to teach, consider teaching, and so on, graduates in other fields also engaged in these activities. Seventeen percent of humanities majors had taught by 2001, as well as 9 percent of social science majors. In fact, one-fifth of all graduates who had taught by 2001 had majored in the humanities as undergraduates, one-tenth in the social sciences, and 7 percent in mathematics, computer science, or a natural science. Among graduates who had not taught, at least one-half of humanities and social sciences majors had considered teaching, worked as a substitute teacher, or worked as a teacher's aide. The proportion of graduates who pursued teaching in the year following graduation varied little between 1994 and 2001. In both 1994 and 2001, approximately 15 percent of those who had graduated in the previous academic year (i.e., 1992-93 or 1999-2000, respectively) had taught or prepared to teach in an elementary or secondary school. By 2001, slightly more graduates (12 percent versus 10 percent in 1994) had taught in the year after receiving the bachelor's degree, and slightly more (9 percent versus 7 percent in 1994) had taught with certification. Whereas 3 percent of graduates had prepared or were certified to teach, but had not taught, by 2001, some 5 percent had done so by 1994. These differences over time tended to persist within subgroups of graduates, that is, regardless of their demographic or academic characteristics 1999-2000 graduates tended to be slightly more likely than 1992-93 graduates to have taught within a year of completing the bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Current/most recent teaching job, very satisfied with learning environment CGENVMNT", "text": "With respect to the school in which the currently or most recently taught, respondents who had taught were asked \"In your most recent teaching job, are/were you very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, or not satisfied with the school learning environment?\" Very satisfied Somewhat satisfied Not satisfied"}, {"section_title": "Current/most recent teaching job, very satisfied with society's perception CGESTEEM", "text": "With respect to the school in which the currently or most recently taught, respondents who had taught were asked \"In your most recent teaching job, are/were you very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, or not satisfied with how society feels about the teaching profession?\" Very satisfied Somewhat satisfied Not satisfied"}, {"section_title": "Current/most recent teaching job, school helped new teachers with instruction CGINSTRC", "text": "With respect to the school in which the currently or most recently taught, respondents who had taught were asked \"Do you agree or disagree that your school is/was effective in helping new teachers with instructional methods?\" Agree Disagree"}, {"section_title": "Current/most recent teaching job, very satisfied with student motivation CGMTVTN", "text": "With respect to the school in which the currently or most recently taught, respondents who had taught were asked \"In your most recent teaching job, are/were you very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, or not satisfied with student motivation to learn?\" Very satisfied Somewhat satisfied Not satisfied"}, {"section_title": "Current/most recent teaching job, very satisfied with parent support CGPARSUP", "text": "With respect to the school in which the currently or most recently taught, respondents who had taught were asked \"In your most recent teaching job, are/were you very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, or not satisfied with support from parents?\" Very satisfied Somewhat satisfied Not satisfied"}, {"section_title": "First teaching job, school level FRLEV97", "text": "Level of first school where teacher began teaching after receiving the 1999-2000 bachelor's degree.

The 1994 data were combined with 1997 data into the B&B:93/97 DAS, which was used to generate the 1994 estimates presented in this report. The NPSAS:93 and NPSAS:2000 samples, while representative and statistically accurate, were not simple random samples. Instead, the survey samples were selected using a more complex three-step procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. Postsecondary institutions were initially selected within geographic strata. Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit) and degree offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3year, 4-year non-doctorate-granting, and 4-year doctorate-granting). 3 All analyses in this report are weighted to compensate for unequal probability of selection into the B&B samples. The weights used, the B&B panel weight for each cohort, were based on the respondents who participated in both the NPSAS and B&B interviews for each cohort and, therefore, also adjust for nonresponse. The B&B:93/97 DAS includes multiple weights so that analyses can be run as of 1994 or 1997. For the B&B:93/94 analyses included in this report, the panel weight for the 1994 follow-up (BNBWT1) was specified as the weight. The B&B:2000/01 DAS contains only one weight, which corresponds to BNBWT1, and applies it automatically to all estimates requested from it. Data quality evaluations included both online data editing procedures and post-data collection editing. The online data editing ensured that the data collected fell within legitimate ranges. Also, where feasible, responses were crosschecked against those of related items. After data collection, the data were cleaned and edited using several steps including verification of one-way frequencies for each item, cross-tabulations of related items, standard variable recoding and formatting (such as dates), determination of outlier values, and logical imputations. After the CATI data were cleaned and edited, composite variables for specific data analyses were created and subjected to similar cleaning and checking procedures.

First, the 1994 data collection included a measure of when graduates had first taught at the K-12 level. Using this information, some analyses of 1992-93 graduates' teaching excluded graduates who had taught before completing the 1992-93 degree or who had been certified to teach at least 1 year before completing that degree (for example, Henke, Chen, and Geis 2000;Henke et al. 1996). Approximately 3 percent of 1992-93 graduates fell into this category. The B&B:2000/01 data do not include information on when graduates had first taught or were first certified. Therefore, the analyses presented in this report include graduates who had taught before receiving the bachelor's degree, because they could not be excluded. Second, the 1994 Follow-up included the collection of graduates' transcripts from the degree-granting postsecondary institution. Information regarding whether 1992-93 graduates had completed a student teaching assignment was obtained from these transcripts. B&B:2000/01 did not include the collection of transcripts and instead relied on graduates' reports of whether they had completed a student teaching assignment. The net effect of this difference is unknown. Third, nonteachers among 1992-93 graduates were asked in 1994 whether they had ever been certified to teach. In 2001, however, 1999-2000 graduates who had not taught were not asked whether they had ever been certified to teach. In 2001, nonteachers were asked whether they had done anything to prepare to teach, and if so, whether they had, for example, completed a teacher education program or completed a student teaching assignment. Fourth, the two surveys asked graduates who had neither taught nor done anything to prepare for a teaching position slightly different questions regarding whether they considered teaching. In 1994, 1992-93 graduates who had neither taught nor prepared to teach were asked whether they were \"considering teaching.\" In contrast, in 2001In contrast, in , 1999In contrast, in -2000 graduates were asked whether they had \"considered teaching.\" Taking these four differences into account, the teaching status variable was created to enable the generation of comparable estimates regarding graduates K-12 teaching status 1 year after receiving their bachelor's degrees. In most tables of the report, particularly tables 13 and 14, graduates who had neither prepared to teach nor taught were combined into one category, regardless of whether they had considered/were considering teaching, in order to facilitate comparisons over time. The proportion of 1999-2000 graduates who had considered teaching as of 2001 is presented in table 6 but should not be compared with the proportion of 1992-93 graduates who were considering teaching at the time of the 1994 interview. For both cohorts follow-up data collection began after the end of the academic year immediately following bachelor's degree receipt: on June 15, 1994 for the 1992-93 cohort and on July 9, 2001 for the 1999-2000 cohort. Therefore, graduates who completed a 1-year graduate teacher preparation program in the year immediately following degree receipt would be included in the prepared or teaching categories of the status variable. Graduates who were pursuing master's degrees or teacher certification in a year of graduate study beyond the bachelor's degree would be categorized as \u2022 having taught if they had taught in the ensuing year, not including student teaching; \u2022 having prepared if they had completed a student teaching assignment as of 2001 (for 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients) or had a transcript record of having completed a student teaching assignment (for 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients), or \u2022 having done neither if they met none of these criteria."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The statistics in this report are estimates derived from a sample. Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples, not on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is likely to represent a population difference. Table B-1 contains estimated standard errors that correspond to the estimates presented in table 14 of this report. Additional standard errors for estimates provided in this report can be obtained from the B&B:93/97 and B&B:2000/01 Data Analysis Systems (DASs) or from the NCES website. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data. Nonsampling errors due to interview and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures. Adjustment of weights for various levels of survey/interview nonresponse was discussed above and is further described in the studies' methodology reports, also cited above. In addition, weighted item response rates were calculated for all variables used in this report. The weighted item response rates were calculated by dividing the weighted number of valid responses by the weighted population for which the item was applicable. With the exception of the variables listed in table B-2, all variables used in this report had a weighted item response rate of at least 90 percent. Of the variables listed in table B-2, all but six-CRLEV97, CRPMIN97, FRLEV97, FRTYPE97, SATACTQ2, and TSATDER-had low weighted response rates largely because they applied to a small proportion of the sample. That is, because applicability could not be determined for respondents with incomplete interviews, those respondents are considered to have indeterminate responses. Incomplete interviews thus make up a relatively high proportion of the indeterminate responses for those items. However, it is highly likely that the majority of cases with incomplete interviews would have been excluded from each of these items if these cases' information for these items had been gathered. When incomplete interviews are excluded from the calculation of the item response rates, the response rates for these variables are 92 percent or higher. Therefore, for these variables, it is unlikely that reported differences are biased because of missing data. Four of the remaining variables-the level of the school at which the respondent taught during the current or most recent teaching job (CRLEV97), the percentage of minority students enrolled in that school (CRPMIN97), the level of the school at which the respondent taught during the first teaching job since receiving the bachelor's degree (FRLEV97), and the sector of that school (FRTYPE97)-were derived by matching graduates' reports of the schools in which they had taught with NCES universe survey data on public (1997-98 Common Core of Data, CCD) and private (1997-98 Private School Survey, PSS) schools. Respondents had invalid data on these variables for reasons other than not completing the interview, not knowing the name/location of the school(s) in which they taught, or refusing to respond. In some cases the school code that was believed to match a respondent's school was not correct, in other cases the code appeared to be valid but could not be matched to the CCD or PSS. In other cases, the "}, {"section_title": "TESATDER", "text": "College entrance examination score 69.1 \u2020 \u2020 Not applicable. These variables apply to all sample cases. NOTE: Weighted item response rates were calculated by dividing the total weighted number of valid responses by the total population for whom the question was applicable. Bias analyses were conducted for variables with a weighted item response rate below 85 percent. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01). Item response rate respondent's school could be matched to a school on the CCD/PSS file, but the CCD/PSS file did not include data on the particular school variable (e.g., percentage minority enrollment in the school). Bias analyses were conducted to determine whether the cases that did not have data on these variables differed from those who did. After removing legitimate skips (those in the analysis sample for whom the question did not apply) and sample members who did not complete the interview (but who were unlikely to have been eligible for these items because most sample members had not taught), cases with missing and nonmissing responses were compared with each other with respect to several variables: gender (GENDER), race/ethnicity (RACE1), undergraduate major (BMAJORS3), cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA2), and degree-granting institution type (BSECTOR9). Each of these comparison variables had a response rate of 97.8 percent or higher. These comparisons indicated that graduates who taught and who had data on these school characteristics were more likely than those without school data to be women; to be White, non-Hispanic; to have been graduated from public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions; to have majored in education; and to have had a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.75 or higher. As demonstrated in the report, graduates with these characteristics were more likely than other graduates to have taught and prepared to teach. Graduates who taught and for whom school characteristics data were available were less likely than those without such data to be Asian/Pacific Islander (or, for FRLEV97 and FRTYPE97, other unspecified race/ethnicity); to have been graduated from a private for-profit institution or a private not-for-profit doctorategranting institution (except for FRLEV97 and FRTYPE97); to have majored in business and management, mathematics/computer science/natural sciences, social sciences, or another unspecified major; or to have a GPA of 2.25 to 2.74. Thus, it is possible that bias was introduced into the analyses of teachers according to these characteristics of the schools in which they taught. Bias analyses were also conducted on the remaining two variables-SATACTQ2 and TSATDER, which indicate graduates' CEE scores for the 1992-93 and 1999-2000 cohorts, respectively-because relatively high proportions of graduates had no CEE score available for analysis. B&B:93/94 graduates did not have scores available for analysis because they had not taken a CEE or because neither they nor their NPSAS institution reported a CEE score. B&B:2000/01 graduates did not have scores available for analysis either because they had not taken a CEE or because their degree-granting institutions did not have a score on record and no score was available from the administering agency because they were older than the files purchased for matching. B&B:2000/01 graduates were not asked to report CEE scores in either the NPSAS or B&B interview. Among 1992-93 graduates, those with CEE scores were more likely than those without scores to be men. Those with scores were also more likely to be White and less likely to be Hispanic. In terms of academic characteristics, graduates with CEE scores were more likely to have begun in a 4-year institution and less likely to have begun postsecondary education in a lessthan-4-year institution. Graduates who had a CEE score available for analysis were more likely than graduates without scores to have received bachelor's degrees from doctorate-granting institutions, and less likely to have received them from private 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions. Compared with graduates who did not have CEE scores available for analysis, graduates with CEE scores were more likely to have majored in mathematics or the physical sciences, and less likely to have majored in business/management or an \"other\" field. Finally, those who had CEE scores available for analysis were less likely than those who did not have them to have cumulative undergraduate GPAs in both the lowest and the highest GPA categories. Some similar relationships were found between those with and without CEE scores among 1999-2000 graduates. Compared with those who did not have CEE scores available for analysis, graduates with scores were more likely to be White and less likely to be American Indian, Black, or Hispanic. Graduates with scores were also more likely to have begun postsecondary education in 4-year institutions and more likely to have received the bachelor's degree from doctorategranting institutions. Graduates with scores were more likely than those without scores to have GPAs between 2.75 and 3.24 and less likely to have GPAs of 3.75 or higher. Finally, graduates with scores were more likely to have majored in business/management and less likely to have majored in education or the social sciences. Thus, for both cohorts not having test scores available for analysis was not a random occurrence, and the estimates regarding graduates' scores may be biased."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the B&B:93/97 and B&B:2000/01 Data Analysis Systems (DASs). 4 The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables from the B&B data. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors 5 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B1 contains estimated standard errors that correspond to the estimates presented in table 14 and that were generated by the B&B:93/97 and B&B:2000/01 DASs.

Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, 6 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: (3) where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 8 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error, the probability of which is denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 selected for findings in this report indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced no more than one time out of twenty when there was no actual difference in the quantities in the underlying population. When we test hypotheses that show t values at the .05 level or smaller, we treat this finding as rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities. However, there are other cases when exercising additional caution is warranted. When there are significant results not indicated by any hypothesis being tested or when we test a large number of comparisons in a table, Type I errors cannot be ignored. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When the either of the two situations described in the previous paragraph was encountered in this report, comparisons were made when p < .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p < .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p < .05. 9 For example, in a comparison of males and females, only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racial/ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be p< .05/10, or p< .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race/ethnicity, there are six racial/ethnic groups (American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; White, non-Hispanic; and other), so substituting 6 for j in equation 4, "}, {"section_title": "Linear Trends", "text": "While most descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using Student's t statistic, some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories.
