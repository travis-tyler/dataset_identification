Overview\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) sponsors the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education in order to collect data on public and private elementary and secondary schools in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey for NCES. SASS provides data on the characteristics and qualifications of teachers and principals, teacher hiring practices, professional development, class size, and other conditions in schools across the nation.\nSASS is a large-scale sample survey of K\u201312 school districts, schools, administrators, teachers, and library media centers in the United States. It includes data from the public and private sectors. Therefore, SASS provides a wide range of opportunities for analysis and reporting on elementary and secondary educational issues.\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS data products include eight restricted-use data files: Public School District, Public School, Public School Principal, Public School Teacher, Public School Library Media Center, Private School, Private School Principal, and Private School Teacher. Data users can link these files together for additional analytical opportunities. The 201112 SASS data will also appear in PowerStats (http://nces.ed.gov/datalab/sass), which allows users to create tables and regressions.\nBackground\nIn the early 1980s, education policymakers became increasingly aware of the need for studies that would provide national data on public and private schools, their programs, teachers, and staffing levels. Such data would inform policymakers about the status of teaching and education, identify the areas that most need improvement, and clarify conflicting reports on issues related to policy initiatives, such as teacher shortages.\nThe first attempt to address these concerns began in 1983 with a series of five surveys:\n\u2022 The Survey of Teacher Demand and Shortage was conducted in 1983\u201384 among public and private schools and included questions on teacher demand and incentive plans for teachers.\n\u2022 The Public School Survey\u2014School Questionnaire was conducted in 1984\u201385 to provide descriptive information about public schools (e.g., enrollment and number of teachers), as well as data on use of teacher incentive plans, volunteers, and computers.\n\u2022 The National Survey of Private Schools\u2014School Questionnaire was conducted in 1985\u201386 to provide parallel information about private schools.\n\u2022 The Public School Survey\u2014Teacher Questionnaire was conducted in 1984\u201385 to provide information about teacher characteristics, qualifications, incentives, and opinions concerning policy issues.\n\u2022 The National Survey of Private Schools\u2014Teacher Questionnaire was conducted in 1985\u201386 to provide parallel information about private school teachers.\nDue to methodological and content-related problems within these surveys and the increasing demands for more and better education data, NCES initiated a redesign of its elementary/secondary education surveys in 1985, which resulted in the Schools and Staffing Survey.\nUnder a contract with NCES, the RAND Corporation redesigned the elementary/secondary education surveys to collect information relevant to their expanded purposes and to correct the methodological difficulties affecting them. SASS was designed to provide a national snapshot of America\u2019s public and private schools, with the first administration in the 1987\u201388 school year. In order to achieve high\n\n\f2\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nresponse rates and to maintain consistency in procedures across the different SASS questionnaires, NCES selected the U.S. Census Bureau to collect and process the data.\nAfter the 1987\u201388 administration of SASS, the survey was conducted again during the 1990\u201391, 1993\u2013 94, 1999\u20132000, 2003\u201304, 2007\u201308, and 2011\u201312 school years. During the 6-year hiatus between the 1993\u201394 and 1999\u20132000 administrations, NCES examined the purpose, direction, and use of the survey. Toward this purpose, NCES commissioned 12 papers from experts that included recommendations regarding improving and expanding the scope and utility of SASS. These papers are compiled in The Schools and Staffing Survey: Recommendations for the Future (NCES 97\u2013596) by John E. Mullens and Daniel Kasprzyk. Many of the recommendations in this report were considered for inclusion in SASS, but only some of them were implemented. Factors\u2014such as the burden on the respondent, the need to test new items, how well the recommendations fit into the overall vision for SASS, and cost constraints\u2014had to be balanced in the SASS survey redesign.\nAs a result of this redesign, the 1999\u20132000 SASS implemented a new set of questionnaires. The questionnaires for public charter schools were designed to collect some of the same data as the four-year longitudinal survey, the National Study of Charter Schools, funded by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (renamed the Institute of Education Sciences in 2002). By including public charter schools in SASS, public charter school data could be directly compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d public school data for the first time. The availability of a complete universe, or sampling frame, for public charter schools made this development feasible in 1999\u20132000. Public charter schools that met the definition of a SASS school were sampled at 100 percent for the 1999\u20132000 SASS.1\nThe 2003\u201304 SASS did not continue the practice of including all eligible charter schools. Instead, the 2003\u201304 SASS drew a sample of charter schools. The public charter school frame used for the 1999\u20132000 SASS was out-of-date and the 2001\u201302 Common Core of Data (CCD) frame for charter schools was considered to be incomplete. Moreover, funding to continue administering a separate questionnaire for public charter schools was not available. The sampling of public charter schools continued for the 2007\u2013 08 and 2011\u201312 SASS, with an expanded sample size for the 2011\u201312 SASS to improve national estimates. Public charter school data are included with traditional public school data, as has been done since the 2003\u201304 SASS.\nWhile SASS included Bureau of Indian Education-funded (BIE)2 schools since its inception in the 1987\u2013 88 through 2007-08 collections, SASS has treated BIE-funded schools inconsistently over time. For the first administration of SASS, BIE-funded schools were included in the public school frame and treated like other public sector schools throughout the survey lifecycle. For the 1990\u201391 SASS, a sample of BIEfunded schools was drawn from a list of BIE-funded schools. The BIE-funded schools in the SASS sample were identified as a separate school sector with separate data files. From the 1993\u201394 SASS through the 2007\u201308 SASS, BIE-funded schools that met the definition of a SASS school were sampled at 100 percent. Due to funding constraints, BIE-funded schools were not sampled for the 2011\u201312 SASS and therefore are not included in the data files.\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS provides valuable data for educators, researchers, and policymakers on public school districts (Local Education Agencies); public (including public charter) and private schools, principals, and\n\n1 A school was eligible for SASS if it had students in any of grades 1\u201312 and was in operation during the SASS data collection year. 2 The Office of Indian Education Programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was renamed and established as the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) in 2006. BIE-funded schools were referred to as BIA schools in the documentation for SASS administrations prior to 2007\u201308.\n\n\fChapter 1. Overview 3\nteachers; and public school library media centers. Chapter 2 includes details on the changes to questionnaires since the 2007\u201308 SASS.\nPurpose and Content of the Survey\nThe overall objective of SASS is to collect the information necessary for a comprehensive picture of elementary and secondary education in the United States. The abundance of data collected permits detailed analyses of the characteristics of schools, principals, teachers, school libraries, and public school district policies. The linkage of the SASS questionnaires enables researchers to examine the relationships among these elements of education. The 2011\u201312 SASS consisted of five types of questionnaires: a school district questionnaire, principal questionnaires, school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, and a school library media center questionnaire. The principal, school, and teacher questionnaires were modified slightly between the public school versions (Principal Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, Public School Questionnaire (With District Items), and Teacher Questionnaire) and private school versions (Private School Principal Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, and Private School Teacher Questionnaire) to refer to either the public or private sector correctly. The Private School Questionnaire also incorporated the Private School Universe Survey (PSS) items that were collected at the same time as SASS in 2011\u201312.3 The School Library Media Center Questionnaire was administered to public (including public charter) schools in 2011\u201312.\nSchool District Questionnaire (Form SASS-1A)\nThe purpose of the 2011\u201312 School District Questionnaire was to obtain information about school districts. The applicable sections for private schools (e.g., comparable sections on hiring, etc.) were added to the Private School Questionnaire. Public charter schools and schools that were the only school in the district received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) rather than the School District Questionnaire. The Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) included all of the items included on the School Questionnaire in addition to selected items from the School District Questionnaire.\nThe 2011\u201312 School District Questionnaire had these seven sections:\n\u2022 Section I\u2014General Information About This District obtained information on grades offered, enrollment, counts of students by race, participation in the National School Lunch Program, the number of days in the school year, full-time equivalent (FTE) counts of all teachers employed by the school district, counts of teachers by race/ethnicity, number of short-term substitute teachers, policies to encourage teacher attendance, existence of a teacher/principal union, length of contract year for teachers/principals, number of principals in the district, tenure system for principals, and presence of a district-wide library media center coordinator.\n\u2022 Section II\u2014Recruitment and Hiring of Staff collected information on recruitment incentives, newly hired teachers and principals, training or development for aspiring school administrators, dismissal of teachers from the previous school year, and reasons for dismissals.\n\u2022 Section III\u2014Principal and Teacher Compensation collected data on salary schedules, benefits, and pay incentives.\n3 The 2011\u201312 school year was a survey year for both SASS and the Private School Universe Survey (PSS). PSS is administered by NCES every 2 years to all private K\u201312 schools in the United States. The SASS Private School Questionnaire included all of the PSS questions so that private schools selected for SASS would not be asked to complete two separate questionnaires.\n\n\f4\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Section IV\u2014Student Assignment obtained information about the availability of choice and magnet programs in the district, whether school boundaries were adjusted the previous year, and the existence and monitoring of homeschooled students.\n\u2022 Section V\u2014Graduation Requirements collected data on high school graduation instructional requirements, community service requirements, and other assessments necessary for graduation.\n\u2022 Section VI\u2014Migrant Education obtained information about the enrollment of migrant students and the services provided for them.\n\u2022 Section VII\u2014District Performance collected data on Adequate Yearly Progress.\nPrincipal and Private School Principal Questionnaires (Forms SASS-2A and SASS-2B)\nThe purpose of the 2011\u201312 principal questionnaires was to obtain information about principals/school heads. The questionnaire appeared in two versions that contained minor variations in phrasing to reflect differences between public and private schools in governing bodies and position titles in the schools. The 2011\u201312 Principal Questionnaire and Private School Principal Questionnaire had these 10 sections:\n\u2022 Section I\u2014Principal or School Head Experience and Training obtained information about principal work experience, previous positions held, and licensure/certificate in school administration.\n\u2022 Section II\u2014Principal or School Head Education and Professional Development focused on education level, major fields of study, and professional development.\n\u2022 Section III\u2014Goals and Decision Making obtained attitudinal information about educational goals and principal\u2019s influence on school governance.\n\u2022 Section IV\u2014Teacher and Aide Professional Development collected information on professional development opportunities and activities for teachers and instructional aides.\n\u2022 Section V\u2014School Climate and Safety obtained information on expulsions and suspensions, security practices, programs to encourage student achievement, health and safety issues at the school, parent or guardian participation in school events, and school resources to encourage parental involvement.\n\u2022 Section VI\u2014Instructional Time collected information about the approximate amount of time that third and/or eighth grade students spent in core academic subjects, and the approximate amount of time that third grade students spent in select non-academic subjects during the most recent full week of school.\n\u2022 Section VII\u2014Working Conditions and Principal Perceptions collected information on time spent on school-related activities and interacting with students, percentage of time spent on various activities, contractual number of working days, union representation (for public school principals only), formal evaluation process for principals, and plans to remain a principal.\n\u2022 Section VIII\u2014 Teacher and School Performance collected information about barriers to dismissal of poor-performing teachers, frequency of informal and formal evaluations of teachers, information included in formal evaluation of teachers, impact of evaluation on teacher compensation, and Adequate Yearly Progress.\n\u2022 Section IX\u2014Demographic Information obtained information about the principal\u2019s gender, race/ethnicity, age, and salary.\n\u2022 Section X\u2014Contact Information obtained the principal\u2019s name and contact information.\nSchool Questionnaire (Form SASS-3A)\nThe purpose of the 2011\u201312 School Questionnaire was to obtain information about public schools.

The 2011\u201312 School Library Media Center Questionnaire had these four sections:\n\n\f8\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Section I\u2014Facilities, Services, and Policies obtained information about the scheduling of classes and activities, times of day the library is available to students, availability for community members, frequency of student use, programs offered, and policies of the library media center.\n\u2022 Section II\u2014Staffing collected information about the number of full- and part-time paid staff, number of professional staff with master\u2019s degree or certification for classroom teaching, use of volunteers, and whether staff are shared with another school.\n\u2022 Section III\u2014Technology and Information Literacy obtained information about the different technology resources in the school, such as computer work stations, online databases, DVD players, laptops, etc. Questions also ask about whether an information literacy curriculum is followed and who teaches it.\n\u2022 Section IV\u2014Last School Year\u2019s Collections and Expenditures collected information about the size of and expenditures for the library media collection.\nTarget Populations, Estimates, and Respondent Status\nTarget Populations\nThe target populations for the 2011\u201312 SASS are described below. For more information on sampling, see chapter 4.\n\u2022 School districts. The target population included school districts that operated one or more schools, employed elementary and/or secondary level teachers, and were in operation in the 2011\u201312 school year; for example, public school districts, state agencies that operated schools for special student populations (such as inmates of juvenile correctional facilities), domestic schools under the Department of Defense (DoD), and cooperative agencies that provided special services to more than one school district. Entities that authorized public charter schools were not included, unless they were also public school districts. Public school districts that governed a public charter school sampled for SASS were sent a School District Questionnaire. All sampled public charter schools or single-school districts received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items). The Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) contains items from both the School\nQuestionnaire and the School District Questionnaire. The SASS sample design selected the\nschool first and consequently sampled the districts associated with the sampled schools. \u2022 Schools. The target population included traditional public, public charter, and private schools\nwith students in any of grades 1\u201312 or in comparable ungraded levels and in operation in the 2011\u201312 school year. Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools were not included. \u2022 Principals. The target population included principals of the targeted school populations. \u2022 Teachers. The target population included teachers in the targeted school populations who taught students in any of grades K\u201312 or in comparable ungraded levels in the 2011\u201312 school year. \u2022 School library media centers. The target population included school library media centers, libraries, or resource centers in traditional public and public charter schools that have such a facility. A school library was defined as an organized collection of printed and/or audiovisual and/or computer resources which is administered as a unit, is located in a designated place or places, and makes resources and services available to students, teachers, and administrators.\nThe sampling frame for public schools was an adjusted version of the 2009\u201310 Common Core of Data (CCD), which reflects the population of public schools in the 2009\u201310 school year. CCD includes traditional public schools, public charter schools, DoD-operated domestic military base schools, and special purpose schools, such as special education, vocational, and alternative schools. Schools outside of the United States, schools that teach only prekindergarten, kindergarten, or postsecondary students, and Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools were deleted from the CCD frame prior to sampling for\n\n\fChapter 1. Overview 9\nSASS. Public schools that closed in school year 2009\u201310 or were not yet opened were not included. Prior to stratification and sampling, CCD schools were collapsed to match the SASS definition of a school. The purpose and operations of this collapsing activity are discussed in chapter 4.\nThe sampling frame for private schools is based on a dual frame approach, as described further in chapter 4, since the list frame does not provide complete coverage. The list frame was based on the 2009\u201310 PSS, updated with private school organization lists and state lists collected by the Census Bureau in the summer of 2010. An area frame was used to find schools missing from the list frame, thereby compensating for the incomplete coverage of the list frame. The area frame was also based on the 2009\u2013 10 PSS, but no updates were made.\nThe sampling frame for the teacher questionnaires consisted of lists of teachers provided by school districts or schools in the SASS sample. Teachers were defined as any staff who taught a regularly scheduled class to students in grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels. Census Bureau staff requested the Teacher Listing Form (TLF) or an electronic list of teachers from districts or schools for all traditional public, public charter, and private schools in the SASS sample to obtain a complete list of all the teachers employed at each school. The form included space for schools to indicate the following: the teacher\u2019s assignment (subject matter), full- or part-time status, and level of experience. The sample of teachers was selected from all of the sampled schools for which a Teacher Listing Form or an electronic list of teachers was collected.\nAll districts,4 principals, and library media centers from sampled schools were also surveyed for SASS.\nEstimates\nSASS was designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public primary, middle, and high schools and related components (e.g., schools, teachers, principals, school districts, and school library media centers); national estimates for public schools with combined grade levels and for public charter schools and related components (e.g., schools, teachers, principals, and school library media centers); and national, regional, and affiliation strata estimates for the private school sector (e.g., schools, teachers, and principals). The affiliation strata for private schools were:\n\u2022 Catholic\u2014parochial; \u2022 Catholic\u2014diocesan; \u2022 Catholic\u2014private; \u2022 Baptist; \u2022 Jewish; \u2022 Lutheran; \u2022 Seventh-Day Adventist; \u2022 Other religious; \u2022 Nonsectarian\u2014regular; \u2022 Nonsectarian\u2014special emphasis; and \u2022 Nonsectarian\u2014special education.\n4 Four dependent charter schools within two regular districts that contained only charter schools were included in the school sample. Due to operational error, the associated districts themselves were not sampled or mailed a District Questionnaire. In addition, there were 40 dependent charter schools sampled that were the only school sampled from their associated regular school district. Due to operational error, the associated districts were not mailed a District Questionnaire. These 42 districts were classified as noninterviews on the Public School District data file.\n\n\f10\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nComparisons between public and private schools are possible only at the regional and national levels because private schools were selected for sampling by affiliation strata and region rather than by state.\nThe teacher survey was designed to support comparisons between new and experienced teachers (three years or less of experience vs. more than three years of experience) at the state level for public school teachers and at the regional or affiliation strata level for private school teachers. Comparisons between teachers by race/ethnicity, detailed experience level (first year, second and third year, fourth or more years) and by full-time or part-time status are possible at the national level. The school library media center survey was designed to produce estimates at the state level for public schools.\nRespondent Status\nThe number of respondents that were sampled, determined to be in-scope for SASS, and completed the interview is presented in the table below. These data are based on how respondents are organized into data files, rather than on which questionnaire respondents received. Sampled respondents are those who were selected for participation in SASS for each respondent type. Sampled respondents were classified as in-scope if they were deemed eligible for SASS during the screening operation or data collection period. Interviews are in-scope respondents that completed their questionnaire. Cases were classified as having completed the questionnaire if specific items as well as a specific percentage of items had responses; these criteria differ by questionnaire. For details on sampling, see chapter 4. For details on in-scope and out-of-scope cases and on determining how many sampled respondents completed interviews (i.e., final interview status), see chapter 7.\n\n\fChapter 1.

A three-year cycle was maintained for the first three data collections but proved too frequent to incorporate the analysis of the previous SASS in the next one. Six years separated the 1999\u20132000 SASS from the previous one, due to a major redesign of the survey. Following this SASS redesign, it was determined that four years provided the best balance between data needs and operational needs. The 1999\u20132000, 2003\u201304, 2007\u201308, and 2011\u201312 SASS were conducted on four-year intervals.\n\nContents\n\nThis report contains chapters on the following topics: changes in SASS design, content, and methodology from 2007\u201308; preparation for the 2011\u201312 SASS; frame creation and sample selection; data collection; response rates and bias analysis; data processing; weighting and variance estimation; and data quality.\n\n\f12\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nInformation in the chapters is supported by the following appendixes:\nA.

Changes in SASS Sample Design, Content, and Methodology From 2007\u201308 to 2011\u201312\nAfter the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the U.S. Census Bureau worked together to improve the sample design, survey content, and data collection methodology for the 2011\u201312 SASS. This chapter describes the changes implemented in the 2011\u201312 SASS.\nSample Design Changes\nChanges to the Sample Design for 2011\u201312 SASS\nIn response to changing needs in education data (i.e., emerging need for more robust statistics for middle schools and high-poverty schools), the 2011\u201312 SASS introduced a revised stratification of public schools in the sample design. To improve the efficiency of the 2011\u201312 SASS sample design and ensure that the new as well as existing sampling goals as reflected in the revised stratification were met, the school and teacher sample allocations were optimized. While no stratification changes were made to the private school sample design, the private school and teacher sample allocations were optimized in conjunction with the public sector samples. This section discusses how the sample design and sample allocation were modified and the research that was done to inform these changes. Details on the sampling design and goals for the 2011\u201312 SASS are discussed in chapter 4.\nAfter the 2007\u201308 SASS, researchers addressed the emerging issues in education and how to improve the SASS sample design to inform them. Researchers investigated four methods, each of which is introduced in this paragraph and then discussed in greater depth in the individual sections below. First, researchers investigated methods for incorporating a proxy for school poverty in the sample design. Second, they assessed the impact of removing Career and Technology Centers and Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools from the 2007\u201308 stratification design. Third, they conducted a precision analysis to evaluate how well the 2007\u201308 sampling allocation would meet the 2011\u201312 SASS analysis goals using the proposed stratification. Finally, they produced and evaluated a new sample allocation using the 2011\u201312 SASS stratification design.\nThe following is a summary of the changes made to the public school sample design:\n\u2022 Four school levels (primary, middle, high, and combined) were used in the traditional public school stratification rather than three (elementary, secondary, and combined); three school levels continued to be used for stratifying public charter and private schools.\n\u2022 Eligibility for the National School Lunch Program, which is a proxy measure for school poverty, was added as a sorting variable for all public schools.\n\u2022 Career and Technology Centers (CTC) and schools with high American Indian (HAI) enrollment were not stratified separately from other public schools.\n\u2022 Bureau of Indian Education-funded (BIE) schools were excluded from the sampling frame. \u2022 Delaware was removed from the special district strata where all districts in these selected states\nhad at least one school in sample. \u2022 Districts governing public charter schools sampled for SASS received the School District\nQuestionnaire. In 2007\u201308, these districts only received a School District Questionnaire if a\n\n\f14\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nregular public school in the district also was in the SASS sample. All public charter schools still received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items).5\nThe following change was made to the teacher sample design:\n\u2022 The Teacher Listing Form (TLF) item asking whether or not the teacher was expected to be teaching in the school the subsequent school year was removed from the TLF and thus was not used for selecting the teacher sample.\nSampling High-Poverty Schools\nIn order to evaluate the efficiency of sampling public schools by poverty status in the 2011\u201312 SASS, the Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI) performed several analyses on the 2007\u201308 SASS data. A complete report of the analysis is in \u201cAppendix C. Poverty Analysis for SASS 2011\u201312 Public School Sample.\u201d ESSI examined the coefficients of variation (CV) of key analysis variables, such as grade level, then conducted a regression analysis of the CV associations. Response rates of high-poverty and nonhigh-poverty public schools were also compared to determine if differential sampling rates were needed to produce reliable estimates of high-poverty and non-high-poverty schools. ESSI also examined the sampling rates for high-poverty and non-high-poverty public schools. These tests were done to determine how well high-poverty public schools were represented in the 2007\u201308 SASS sample, using two definitions for high-poverty schools: (1) schools with at least 50 percent of enrolled students approved for the free or reduced-price lunch program, and (2) schools with at least 75 percent of enrolled students approved for the free or reduced-price lunch program. These two definitions of high-poverty schools were used to examine the distribution of high poverty across several reporting domains, as well as the distribution of key analysis variables, as defined by NCES. Because no standard definition of poverty in the SASS target population is currently in use by NCES or the research community, this analysis incorporated two definitions to ensure the results reported here were not sensitive to a particular definition.\nThe analyses showed that the representation of high-poverty schools in the SASS sample could be improved. The regression models revealed that high-poverty schools sometimes had less precise estimates (i.e., larger CVs) than non-high-poverty schools. Improving how well high-poverty schools are represented in the sample should reduce the CVs. The response rates were comparable for high- and nonhigh-poverty schools; therefore, the SASS sample did not need to be explicitly controlled by using poverty as a stratification variable. Instead, ESSI recommended using the free or reduced-price lunch variable as a sort variable prior to sample selection to improve the representation of high-poverty schools in the 2011\u201312 SASS sample. This approach should improve high-poverty estimates without increasing the overall public school sample size or noticeably reducing the reliability of non-high-poverty school estimates, which would likely occur if poverty was added as a sampling stratum. This recommendation was implemented for the 2011\u201312 SASS.\n\n5 There were two regular districts that contained only charter schools. The schools within these districts were part of the school sample and received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items), however due to operational error, the associated districts themselves were not mailed a District Questionnaire. In addition, 40 regular school districts only had a single dependent charter school sampled. These schools received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) and due to operational error, the associated districts were not mailed a District Questionnaire. These 42 districts were classified as noninterviews on the Public School District data file.\n\n\fChapter 2. Changes in SASS Sample Design, Content, and Methodology From 2007\u201308 to 2011\u201312 15\nSampling Career and Technology Centers and Bureau of Indian Education Schools\nESSI investigated the impact on the public school sample if Career and Technology Centers (CTC) and Bureau of Indian Education-funded (BIE) schools were included on the sampling frame but not sampled at higher rates. A complete report of the investigation is in \u201cAppendix D. Bureau of Indian EducationFunded Schools and Career and Technology Centers Sampling Change.\u201d For the analysis, the 2007\u201308 SASS public school sampling frame was used to produce a new sample reflecting the proposed stratification changes. To achieve this, the stratification proposed for the 2011\u201312 SASS was applied to the 2007\u201308 SASS sampling frame and sample, which were used to determine the number of schools on the frame and the number of schools sampled within each new stratification level. These sample counts were used to calculate the probability of selection for each school on the frame.\nThe analysis for CTC schools indicated that the number of these schools expected to be sampled under the new stratification would be larger than the number originally sampled in the 2007\u201308 SASS. This increase in sample size was most likely the result of CTC schools having a larger median full-time equivalent count of teachers than other public schools, resulting in a higher probability of selection, on average, for CTC schools compared to other public schools. After adjusting for nonresponse, the revised sampling stratification resulted in a 22 percent increase in the number of responding CTC schools compared to the 2007\u201308 SASS. This increase appeared to have a minor impact on the sampling of other public schools, given that there was only a 0.01 percent change in the expected number of other public schools that would respond.\nThe analysis for BIE schools indicated that there would be a large difference between the new expected sample counts and the original sample counts. If BIE schools were sampled, rather than taken with certainty, it was expected that around 50 BIE schools would be selected. In comparison, there were 178 BIE schools selected for the 2007\u201308 SASS. After controlling for nonresponse, there was an expected drop of 73 percent in responding BIE schools from the 2007\u201308 SASS to the 2011\u201312 SASS, which reflects the change from certainty sampling to probability sampling. While this drop in the number of BIE schools was expected given their very small population size, this would prevent producing national estimates for BIE schools. BIE schools could be represented in the overall public school estimates if they were sampled with public schools. However, doing so would cause a break in the reporting trends, given that SASS public school estimates have not included BIE schools since the 1990\u201391 SASS. NCES determined not to alter the definition of a public school by sampling the BIE schools with the public schools and causing a break in reporting trends; instead, BIE schools were excluded from the 2011\u201312 SASS entirely. This decision is expected to have no noticeable impact on public school CVs.\nPrecision Analysis of the 2007\u201308 SASS\nESSI evaluated the precision of statistics for selected key variables from the 2007\u201308 SASS. In conjunction with NCES, ESSI identified the key variables within each respondent type (i.e., school districts, schools, principals, teachers, and school library media centers). The precision analysis was designed to determine whether the 2011\u201312 SASS sample design was expected to achieve the desired level of precision for the selected key variables and domains using the 2007\u201308 SASS data as a proxy. To accomplish that, the analysis computed coefficients of variation (CV) for statistics on the key variables and examined whether the CV was at or below 15 percent within expected levels of representativeness (e.g., national, regional, or state/affiliation strata levels). Below is a summary of the analysis and the implications for the 2011\u201312 SASS sample design. The full report is located in \u201cAppendix E. 2011\u201312 SASS Redesign\u2013\u2013Precision Analysis.\u201d\nFor the selected key variables, the precision goal was not consistently met for each of the respondent types in the 2007\u201308 SASS. For public sector estimates, ESSI recommended that additional sample be\n\n\f16\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nconsidered for middle schools to achieve state-level estimates as well as for public charter schools to achieve school-level estimates at the national level. High schools also did not consistently meet the expected level of precision, which warranted additional sample in targeted states, such as North Dakota, that frequently exhibited higher CVs than other states.\nAmong public school teachers, estimates for first-year teachers did not consistently achieve the 15 percent CV target at the state level for traditional public school teachers and at the national level for public charter school teachers. The evaluation determined that additional first year teachers should be sampled to achieve the 15 percent CV target. As a result, the teaching experience item on the Teacher Listing Form was modified to include a response category for first year teachers. These teachers were then sampled at an appropriate rate. For both public school principals and teachers, consideration of race/ethnicity in the sampling design was recommended to improve the precision of 2011\u201312 estimates as compared to 2007\u2013 08 SASS estimates and to broaden the levels of analysis. Race/ethnicity estimates can only be produced at the national level because there is no practical method for schools to report reliable race/ethnicity on teachers and principals, allowing them to be sampled at adequate rates to produce reliable estimates at the state level. This recommendation was rejected for this reason.\nFor all private sector (i.e., private school, principal, and teacher) estimates, the sampling goals were met or exceeded. Overall, it may be possible to reduce the sample size or selectively reduce it by affiliation strata given the over-performance of the school-level variables and the generally low CVs for teacherlevel estimates.\nSample Allocation for the 2011\u201312 SASS\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS school sample optimization process used standard errors from the 2003\u201304 and 2007\u201308 surveys along with collection cost data from the 2007\u201308 survey to minimize the standard errors for a fixed cost. For a fixed overall sample size of 14,000 schools, the procedure determined that the optimum allocation was 3,000 private schools, 750 public charter schools, and 10,250 traditional public schools. For traditional public schools, sample was allocated to grade levels within states with the following goals:\n\u2022 Maintain a 15 percent CV for primary schools, 20 percent CV for middle schools, and 10 percent CV for high schools.\n\u2022 Set the sample size for combined schools to a point that will not negatively impact state totals. \u2022 Select no more than 60 percent of schools from any particular grade level within state.\nFor private schools, the goal was to maintain CVs of no more than 15 percent for affiliations and for grade levels at the national level. Once sample sizes for affiliation by grade level were determined at the national level, sample was allocated to regions within affiliation and grade level proportional to size. For public charter schools, sample was allocated to grade level with the goal of maintaining 10 percent CVs nationally. Sample was further allocated to states proportional to size, which is defined as the cumulative square root of the number of teachers at the school.\nFor teachers in traditional public schools, average cluster sizes per school were set with the goal of producing CVs at the state by grade level with CVs of 15 percent, 20 percent, and 15 percent, respectively, for primary, middle, and high schools. For private school teachers and public charter school teachers, the same goals as for the school sample allocation were applied.\nSee chapter 4 for further details on the sample allocation and stratification.\n\n\fChapter 2.

During telephone follow-up, interviewers called schools with one or more outstanding questionnaires to remind staff to complete and return them. During field follow-up, local Census Bureau field representatives contacted schools via telephone or personal visits. Several changes were implemented to improve the efficiency of the data collection methodology. These changes included attempts to collect the Teacher Listing Form (TLF) from districts, using an internet-based Control Center to help facilitate communications with school staff about school-level questionnaires, using an internetbased instrument to collect data from public and private school teachers, mailing the School District Questionnaire to all school districts that had one of their charter schools in sample for SASS,6 and beginning data collection at a later date. These changes are discussed in-depth in the individual sections below.\nTeacher Listing Form\nThe Teacher Listing Form (TLF) collects the name and selected information for every SASS-eligible teacher in SASS sampled schools. In the 2007\u201308 SASS, the TLF was mailed to all sampled schools at the beginning of the school year. For the 2011\u201312 SASS, school districts were asked in advance whether they would be able to provide an electronic file of teachers; if they indicated they would be able to, they were asked to do so at the start of data collection. If the school district indicated that they would not be able to do so, then the paper TLF was mailed to the individual schools at the start of data collection. Later during data collection, paper TLFs were mailed to schools if their school district did not provide a list of teachers. Although schools were not specifically asked to provide an electronic file of teachers, the option to upload a file of teachers was available in the Control Center (discussed below).\nIn addition to the methodological change regarding how the teacher lists were collected, two changes were made in the information requested on the TLF. In the 2007\u201308 SASS, an item was added that asked whether or not the teacher was expected to be teaching in the school the subsequent school year. This item was added in an attempt to increase the number of leavers and movers (i.e., teachers who left the teaching profession and teachers who began teaching in a different school from the prior school year) in\n6 There were two regular districts that contained only charter schools. The schools within these districts were part of the school sample and received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items); however, due to operational error, the associated districts themselves were not mailed a District Questionnaire. In addition, 40 regular school districts only had a single dependent charter school sampled. These schools received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) and due to operational error, the associated districts were not mailed a District Questionnaire. These 42 districts were classified as noninterviews on the Public School District data file.\n\n\f36\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nthe Teacher Follow-up Survey sample. However, the item was not effective,7 so the question was not included for the 2011\u201312 TLF. Additionally, the teacher experience categories were expanded to include a separate category for teachers who were in their first year of teaching. For more information on teacher sampling, see chapter 4.\nInternet-Based Control Center\nAs was done with the 2007\u201308 SASS, a survey coordinator was established, if possible, at the school. Survey coordinators functioned as the main contact for all survey operations within the school. Having one point of contact expedited the process of following-up on outstanding questionnaires and was less burdensome to the school. During the 2011\u201312 SASS, survey coordinators were established in approximately 76.5 percent of sampled schools.\nFor the 2011\u201312 SASS, the survey coordinator was given access to a SASS \u201cControl Center.\u201d The Control Center was used to display which questionnaires were received and which had not been completed. When Census Bureau staff called survey coordinators to check on the status of questionnaires, both the Census Bureau staff and the school staff could access the Control Center to see which questionnaires had not been completed. The Control Center also enabled survey coordinators, as well as Census Bureau staff, to request a replacement questionnaire for any questionnaire that was lost or damaged.\nInternet-Based Teacher Questionnaires\nThe Teacher and Private School Teacher Questionnaires were primarily internet-based for the 2011\u201312 SASS. The 2011\u201312 SASS was the first time that internet-based Teacher and Private School Teacher Questionnaires were offered. Once teachers were selected for the survey, they were mailed an invitation to complete the internet-based questionnaire. They were later mailed a reminder letter that provided instructions to complete the internet-based questionnaire and informed them that they could request a paper version of the questionnaire to complete. All sampled teachers who had not yet completed the survey were eventually mailed a paper questionnaire as a final attempt to collect their data. The date at which they were mailed a paper questionnaire was dependent on when they were selected for sample. Of the teachers sampled for the survey, 45.5 percent of public school teachers and 30.7 percent of private school teachers completed the survey via the internet-based questionnaire. The telephone center staff completed 0.6 percent of public school teacher and 0.6 percent of private school teacher interviews using the internet-based questionnaire. The paper questionnaire was completed by 24.5 percent of public school teachers and 27.5 percent of private school teachers\nChapter 5 on data collection provides additional details on the methodology for the 2011\u201312 SASS, as well as a brief evaluation of the methodology.\nInterviewing Districts With a Dependent Charter School in Sample\nFor the 2007\u201308 SASS, school districts governing sampled public charter schools were not intentionally sampled. Most of these districts were still sampled though because one of their traditional public schools was included in the school sample for SASS. For the 2011\u201312 SASS, all schools sampled as public charter schools received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items), as they had in the 2007\u2013\n7 In 2007\u201308 SASS, teachers were stratified by the expecting to leaver variable. However, during TFS sampling, it was observed that a strong majority of movers and leavers did not come from the expected to leave teacher stratum. Therefore, the variable was determined to be ineffective in predicting which teachers would become movers or leavers in TFS.\n\n\fChapter 2. Changes in SASS Sample Design, Content, and Methodology From 2007\u201308 to 2011\u201312 37\n08 SASS, and districts associated with these charter schools were also sampled and sent the School District Questionnaire.\nLater Start to Data Collection Schedule\nFor the 2007\u201308 SASS, data collection began on August 28, 2007, with the mail-out of the initial school package. For the 2011\u201312 SASS, data collection for the school-level questionnaires was originally scheduled to start on September 12, 2011. Data collection was scheduled to begin later in 2011 than it did in 2007 to allow time for all schools to begin their school year prior to receiving the questionnaire package. The initial mail-out for the 2011\u201312 SASS was delayed until October 11, 2011, due to delays in receiving OMB clearance to conduct the data collection. The data collection follow-up activities for the school-level questionnaires were originally scheduled to end on March 30, 2012, but were extended until May 4, 2012. School-level questionnaires continued to be accepted and keyed until May 18, 2012. Data collection follow-up activities for teacher questionnaires were originally scheduled to end on May 11, 2012, but were extended until June 1, 2012. The internet instrument remained active and paper questionnaires were accepted until June 22, 2012. See chapter 5 for a detailed description of the data collection schedule and methodology.\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank.\n\n\f39\n\nChapter 3. Preparation for the 2011\u201312 SASS\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the U.S. Census Bureau continually work to improve the questionnaire content and procedures for the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). Prior to the administration of the 2011\u201312 SASS, the data collection methodology and survey content were examined, tested, and improved. Exhibit 2 presents a summary of the research conducted. The full reports are included as appendixes F through H.\n\nExhibit 2.

For the 2007\u201308 SASS, the initial package of materials mailed to selected schools included the TLF as well as the School Questionnaire, Principal Questionnaire, and School Library Media Center Questionnaire (for public schools only). After the packages were mailed, a Census Bureau interviewer called the school to verify basic information and remind the appropriate school staff member to complete the TLF and return it as soon as possible. The Census Bureau continued to remind school staff to complete the TLF in subsequent reminder phone calls that occurred during the first three weeks of October 2007. A local Census Bureau field representative contacted schools that had not returned their completed TLF from mid-October through mid-November 2007. Schools that did not complete the TLF during or prior to the field follow-up operation were reminded to complete the TLF and other outstanding questionnaires during subsequent phone calls that took place from late November 2007 until early February 2008. Although this methodology was successful in obtaining a sufficient TLF response rate (86.7 percent for public schools and 83.3 percent for private schools, respectively), the Census Bureau sought to collect the TLF information more efficiently.\n\nThe Census Bureau proposed that many school districts could provide an electronic list of teachers at the beginning of the school year for all of the schools selected in their district, which would reduce the response burden for sampled schools, allow Teacher Questionnaires to be mailed out earlier in the school year, eliminate the need for a separate field follow-up operation for the TLF, and reduce the amount of data keying for the TLF. Therefore, the Census Bureau conducted a field test of the newly proposed collection methodology for the TLF. A complete report of the methodology and detailed findings is in \u201cAppendix F. Summary of the 2009 Field Test Findings and Recommendations for the 2011\u201312 SASS.\u201d The 2009 field test examined the feasibility of:\n\n\f40\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Collecting the teacher data electronically; and \u2022 Collecting teacher data from districts with sampled schools rather than from each individual\nschool.\nThe following sections present a summary of this research.\nField Test Sampling Plan\nThe Census Bureau planned to sample 100 districts of varying sizes and approximately 500 associated schools for the field test. The sample was intended to mimic past SASS district samples in terms of geographic dispersion, district enrollment sizes, and grade levels offered. The resulting sample contained 100 public school districts from 37 states. The Census Bureau sampled medium and large districts (those with enrollment of more than 2,200 students) more heavily than smaller districts.\nAfter the sample of 100 districts was drawn, the Census Bureau sampled approximately 500 schools from these districts. The number of schools selected from each district varied considerably depending on the total enrollment size of the district and the number of schools affiliated with the district. The variation in the number of schools selected in each district was determined based on the proportion of schools selected from districts of varying sizes from the 2007\u201308 SASS.\nAmong the schools sampled for the field test, the enrollment size varied considerably. The overall distribution of schools by enrollment size approximated that of the 2007\u201308 SASS school sample. In addition, the distribution of the sampled schools by school levels (elementary, secondary, combined) was similar to that of the 2007\u201308 school sample.\nField Test Methodology\nThe field test was designed to address the issues of feasibility (i.e., could and would the districts provide data), file format (the software containing the data), and data quality (accuracy of data from districts versus schools). To address the issues of feasibility and file format, the Census Bureau split the district sample into two distinct panels:\n\u2022 Panel 1\u2014Districts were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers in any format convenient for them. The Census Bureau provided an Excel template, but did not encourage its use.\n\u2022 Panel 2\u2014Districts were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers using the Excel template provided; however, any format was accepted.\nTo address the issue of data quality (accuracy of data), the Census Bureau collected teacher list information from the sampled schools in addition to teacher lists from the districts. Schools were divided into three treatment groups. Within each group, they were divided again by whether the school\u2019s district was in panel 1 or panel 2. The three groups are listed below.\n\u2022 Group A\u2014Schools were asked to provide an electronic teacher list. Within this group, half the schools were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers in any format convenient for them. The other half of the schools were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers using the Excel template provided.\n\u2022 Group B\u2014Schools were asked to verify and correct, as necessary, a traditional TLF that was preprinted with the information the district had provided. Schools received the same treatment regardless of their district\u2019s panel (whether the district was asked to provide list in Excel format or any format convenient for them).\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2011\u201312 SASS\n\n41\n\n\u2022 Group C\u2014Schools were asked to provide information on the traditional paper TLF. Schools received the same treatment regardless of their district\u2019s panel (whether the district was asked to provide list in Excel format or any format convenient for them).\n\nThe field test utilized a mail-based survey approach with telephone follow-up. Prior to the initial mail-out, Census Bureau staff called the school districts in order to determine the best person to receive the initial letter. The district and school initial letters were mailed in late November 2009. Reminder letters were mailed two weeks later. Census Bureau interviewers contacted districts and schools by telephone to remind them to upload their electronic list during January 2010. As lists were received, a verification mail-out and telephone follow-up were conducted on a flow basis from December 2009 through March 2010 for schools selected to verify the data the district provided for their school. After the field test, the Census Bureau contacted some of the districts by telephone for additional feedback. Table 2 presents the response rates for each district and school group.\n\nTable 2.\n\nUnweighted response rates (in percentages) for teacher lists, by district and school group: 2009 SASS field test\n\nRespondent type and group Districts (all districts: response rate=72.0)\n\nDistrict group\n\nElectronic list\u2014 Electronic list\u2014\n\nany format\n\nExcel template\n\n64.0\n\n80.0\n\nSchools (all schools: response rate=52.7)\n\nElectronic list\n\n25.4\n\n49.0\n\nSchools asked to verify pre-populated TLF\n\n51.5\n\n46.1\n\nSchools asked to complete a paper TLF\n\n82.4\n\n74.0\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) Field Test, 2009\n\n(previously unpublished tabulation).\n\nKey Findings From the Field Test\n\nThere are two components to the evaluation of the field test data. For the first component, Census Bureau staff evaluated the district response rates to assess the feasibility of collecting an electronic list of teachers from school districts. Analysis of the response rates provides strong evidence that the districts are both willing and able to provide TLF information in an electronic format in a timely manner. The overall district response rate, including districts that were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers in any format and districts that were asked to provide the list in Excel, was 72 percent. Table 2 shows that the districts that were asked specifically to provide the lists in an Excel spreadsheet responded at a higher rate (80 percent) than the districts that were asked to provide the list in any electronic format (64 percent). This suggests that asking for a common and familiar file format results in greater participation than a more flexible, but perhaps more ambiguous, request. To further examine the feasibility of collecting an electronic list of teachers from school districts, Census Bureau staff contacted some of the respondents and nonrespondents after the end of data collection to ask debriefing questions, including questions about file format, missing information, and whether nonresponding districts were able to provide teacher information. Two districts provided a file in a format other than Excel. Census Bureau staff asked these districts whether they could provide an Excel file if requested. One of the districts said they would be able to provide a file in Excel in the future, while the other could only provide a .pdf file. Census Bureau staff asked three districts that provided a file that was missing some of the requested information why they did not provide the information and from whom the information could be obtained. Two of the districts simply forgot to include some of the requested information; however, the third district could not provide current information for subject taught, full- or part-time status, or expected teaching status for the following year. Census Bureau staff asked 12 districts that did not provide a file if they have the ability to\n\n\f42\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nprovide at least some of the information electronically. Eleven of the 12 districts indicated that they could provide an electronic list of teachers. The results of the debriefing telephone calls indicated that most districts could provide the information requested in an Excel file.\nFor the second component of the field test evaluation, Census Bureau staff evaluated the quality of the data by comparing the list pair, that is, the teacher list for each school provided by the district and the corresponding school. These responses were verified either through independent or dependent verification. Sixty pairs of independently-provided district and school lists were compared. Census Bureau staff contacted schools and districts to verify any discrepancies between the two lists. Among these, 32 percent of the school lists and 23 percent of the district lists were determined to be more accurate overall. The remaining 45 percent of the lists provided by schools and districts were determined to be equally accurate. An additional 128 lists were verified through dependent verification. Sampled schools in the dependent verification group received a paper TLF prepopulated with the information the district provided. The schools were asked to verify the information provided and correct it if necessary. In 40 percent of these lists, the district list and school list were determined to be equally accurate.\nTeacher discrepancies mainly consisted of either the school or district not having an updated roster of current teachers (including name changes from marriage), teachers being included who do not meet the SASS definition of a teacher, or the district not including a teacher for the sample school because the teacher works at more than one school. These mistakes seemed to happen because either the school or district did not respond consistently with the directions provided. Overall, considering teacher coverage as well as other data needed for sampling, the test indicated that the school and district data were at the same level of quality.\nThe results of these two evaluation components provide evidence that the new methodology is likely to provide comparable data in a timelier manner at a lower cost in the 2011\u201312 administration of the SASS compared to the 2007\u201308 SASS.\nChapter 2 provides details on the changes in the methodology between the 2007\u201308 and the 2011\u201312 SASS implementations. Chapter 5 provides details on the methodology for the 2011\u201312 SASS as well as a brief evaluation of the methodology.\nResearch on SASS Content\nNew items were proposed for the School District Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, Principal Questionnaire, and Teacher Questionnaire. These items were tested with appropriate school or district personnel in order to gather feedback.\nCognitive Interviews\u20142010\nThe Census Bureau contracted with ICF Macro to conduct a series of cognitive interviews to test newly proposed questions as well as some of the 2007\u201308 SASS questions for the 2011\u201312 SASS. The purpose of these interviews was to gather feedback on proposed and current questions for the district, school, principal, and teacher questionnaires, report the findings, and make recommendations for revisions, if necessary, to the items. A complete report of the methodology and detailed findings is in \u201cAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items Summary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010.\u201d\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2011\u201312 SASS\n\n43\n\nMethods\nIn the spring and summer of 2010, ICF Macro conducted a series of cognitive interviews with school district personnel, principals, and teachers. ICF Macro obtained participants from three sources: (1) a list provided by NCES of schools and educators in the prior SASS sampling frame; (2) a list purchased from an outside vendor; and (3) an ICF Macro database of educators. ICF Macro sent an e-mail to potential participants describing the study and offering an incentive to those who agreed to participate. Interested personnel who contacted ICF Macro by e-mail or telephone were screened and scheduled for an interview. ICF Macro conducted the interviews by telephone. The length of the interview averaged 45 to 60 minutes for each questionnaire. Before each interview, ICF Macro e-mailed a copy of the proposed items to the participant. Respondents for the teacher, principal, and school questionnaires were asked to print the materials, but not to review the items before the interview. Respondents for the district questionnaire were asked to review the items before the interview to make sure they had the information they would need to respond.\nICF Macro interviewed 12 school district representatives from 11 states to obtain their feedback on 15 items from the district questionnaire. Three representatives were from small districts (1,000 or fewer students), seven were from medium districts (1,001\u20133,500 students), and two were from large districts (3,500 or more students). District personnel answered questions that related to the following topics: teacher attendance, teacher hiring and dismissal, teacher compensation, high school diploma requirements, prekindergarten students, and participation in the National School Lunch Program. District personnel then responded to questions about their ability and willingness to provide information about the selected schools, including the grade range, operating status, principal\u2019s name and e-mail address, and a list of teachers. Nine of the questions were newly proposed questions while the remaining six were existing questions from the 2007\u201308 SASS. Four of the newly proposed questions were included on the 2011\u201312 School District Questionnaire, which contained 57 questions.\nICF Macro interviewed 12 principals to obtain their feedback on seven items in the school questionnaire and one item in the library media center questionnaire. Principals represented four elementary schools, four middle schools, and four high schools in eight states and the District of Columbia. Six of the principals worked in charter schools, five worked in public schools, and one worked in a private school. Principals answered questions that related to the following topics: admission requirements, programs and services offered, teaching vacancies, and the availability of the school library or library media center to community members. The charter school principals also answered questions about their school\u2019s origin and governance structure. Three of the questions were newly proposed questions for the school questionnaire, one of the questions was a newly proposed question for the library media center questionnaire, and the remaining four questions were existing questions from the 2007\u201308 SASS. All of the tested questions were included on the applicable questionnaire. The 2011\u201312 School Questionnaire contained 58 questions; the School Library Media Center Questionnaire contained 27 questions.\nICF Macro interviewed 12 additional principals to obtain their feedback on 14 items in the principal questionnaire. Principals represented four elementary schools, four middle schools, and four high schools in eight states and the District of Columbia. Principals answered questions that related to the following topics: licensure, educational goals, school accomplishments, school programs, parent participation, time use, and teacher evaluations. Thirteen of the questions were newly proposed questions or included new subitems, the remaining question was an existing question from the 2007\u201308 SASS. Thirteen of the newly proposed questions were included on the questionnaire, which contained 58 questions.\nICF Macro interviewed 16 teachers, including at least one teacher from every grade level in K\u201312, to obtain their feedback on 22 items in the teacher questionnaires. Teachers were selected from traditional public schools, public charter schools, and private schools in 10 states. The teachers interviewed had a\n\n\f44\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nwide range of experience; however, all teachers interviewed had earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and most also had a master\u2019s degree. Teachers answered questions that related to the following topics: teaching experience, class organization, teacher preparation, certification, evaluations, and compensation. Ten of the questions were newly proposed questions or included new subitems, the remaining questions were existing questions from the 2007\u201308 SASS. Nine of the newly proposed questions were included on the questionnaire, which included 87 questions.\nKey Findings From Testing Questionnaire Items\nSchool District Questionnaire\nICF Macro recommended wording modifications for about half of the items tested. The main findings included the following:\n\u2022 While about half of the participants were able to provide a count of short-term substitute teachers eligible to teach in their district, one participant did not have access to the number of available substitutes and two participants misinterpreted the item.\n\u2022 Participants had some difficulties answering items regarding the criteria used in considering applicants for teaching positions in their district. In some cases, participants were unsure how to respond regarding criteria that are required for state certification but are not specifically considered by the district. Other difficulties stemmed from criteria that they consider for some, but not all, applicants.\n\u2022 In general, participants were able to respond to the items regarding teacher dismissals. \u2022 Most participants were able to respond to the items regarding the salary schedule for teachers;\nhowever, some were not sure whether to include stipends that teachers receive for education or special certifications. \u2022 Most participants were able to answer the items regarding pay incentives for teachers; however, some were unsure how to respond regarding incentives that the state provides and whether to include incentives given to other school staff members. \u2022 Most participants indicated that they did not have an \u201calternative compensation system\u201d for employees; however, when answering the subsequent item, many indicated that they did offer permanent increases to base salary or a cash bonus for performance, certification, professional development, or hard-to-staff subjects. \u2022 When answering the item regarding the number of years of science instruction required for a standard diploma, most participants could not distinguish between \u201cScience\u201d and \u201cPhysical or biological sciences.\u201d \u2022 The majority of participants were able to respond to the items regarding the National School Lunch Program; however, it was noted that the list of students approved for free or reduced-price lunches is constantly being updated.\nSchool Questionnaire\nICF Macro recommended wording modifications for about half of the school questionnaire items tested. The main findings included the following:\n\u2022 Participants were unsure how to respond to some of the items regarding admission requirements (e.g., schools that requested students\u2019 academic record or standardized test results responded \u2018yes\u2019 even though these are used to determine academic level rather than deciding whether to admit students).\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2011\u201312 SASS\n\n45\n\n\u2022 Participants had different interpretations of the two items on extended day programs for academic assistance or enrichment. Some participants could not distinguish between these items.\n\u2022 Participants had different interpretations of how to answer the item on teacher vacancies when considering if, when, and how the position was filled.\n\u2022 Two thirds of participants did not accurately distinguish between the answer categories of \u201cNo positions in this school\u201d and \u201cNo vacancy in this field\u201d when responding to the item on the difficulty in filling teacher vacancies. Other participants had trouble distinguishing between the different classifications of science courses (biology or life sciences, physical sciences, and other natural sciences).\n\u2022 Participants were able to answer the items regarding charter schools correctly. \u2022 Several participants thought the wording of the question asking whether the library media center\nis open to community members was confusing.\nPrincipal Questionnaire\nICF Macro recommended wording modifications for many of the principal questionnaire items tested. The main findings included the following:\n\u2022 Participants were able to answer the item asking if they hold a license in \u201cschool administration\u201d without any problems.\n\u2022 Participants felt that there was significant overlap between the educational goals presented in the questionnaire.\n\u2022 Participants interpreted the school accomplishment items differently, and many did not know when it was appropriate to answer, \u201cnot applicable.\u201d\n\u2022 While many of the items regarding parent or guardian participation were clear, participants had different interpretations of a written contract between school and parent.\n\u2022 Participants often considered observations when responding to the items that ask about the frequency of formal evaluations, even when the observations were not part of a formal evaluation.\n\u2022 Participants were unsure whether to include informal observations when providing the number of observations that are typically conducted prior to completing a teacher evaluation. Some participants provided the average number of observations, while others provided the maximum.\n\u2022 For some participants, the number of informal or formal teacher evaluations may vary due to other circumstances, such as if the teacher is struggling.\nTeacher Questionnaire\nICF Macro recommended wording modifications for many of the teacher questionnaire items tested. The main findings included the following:\n\u2022 Many teachers had trouble responding correctly to the item asking what year they began teaching in their current school. For some teachers, this stemmed from not reading the instruction on how to answer if they had a break in service of one year or more. For another teacher, it was due to her teaching in multiple schools at the same time.\n\u2022 Several participants thought the item asking about the number of years they have been teaching in public or private schools and the item asking how many of those years they worked full-time and how many they worked part-time could be combined.\n\u2022 About half of the participants misunderstood the term \u201clooping.\u201d \u2022 Participants were unsure whether to consider courses that included content on a particular\nteaching method or only courses where that teaching method was the main focus when answering items regarding the courses they\u2019ve taken.\n\n\f46\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Several participants had problems when answering the items regarding their teaching certificate. Difficulties arose from entering multiple content areas and not knowing which grade range box to mark when they only taught a subset of the grades listed.\n\u2022 One participant included informal evaluations when responding to the item asking how often she is formally evaluated.\nKey Findings From Questions Concerning Data Collection\nIn addition to testing district questionnaire items, ICF Macro asked school district representatives questions about collecting data on principals, teachers, and schools and about improving participation. A summary of the findings is below.\nPrincipal Contact Information\n\u2022 Most participants indicated that they would be willing to provide the names and e-mail addresses of the principals in their district.\n\u2022 Most participants also indicated that their district had a public website with principal e-mail addresses.\n\u2022 Depending on the district, the final list of schools and principals would be available between May and August 1.\n\u2022 Participants would be willing to provide principals\u2019 names and e-mail addresses over the phone for up to about 10 schools.\n\u2022 Participants would also be willing to provide principals\u2019 names and e-mail addresses via e-mail, fax, or by uploading a file to a secure website.\nTeacher Contact Information\n\u2022 Most participants would be willing to provide a list of all teachers working at their schools and would be able to identify those teachers who were in their first year of teaching.\nGrade Range and Closing Information for Schools\n\u2022 All participants would be willing and able to provide the grade range of schools in their district and be able to identify whether any of the schools had closed.\nIdeas for Increasing Participation\n\u2022 To increase survey participation, participants suggested providing a specific due date for when districts should respond, including a \u201cpress release\u201d with more information about the survey, or providing more information about how participants\u2019 privacy would be ensured.\nCognitive Interviews\u20142011\nThe Census Bureau contracted with ICF Macro to conduct a second series of cognitive interviews for the 2011\u201312 SASS. The purpose of these interviews was to gather feedback on proposed questions for the principal and teacher questionnaires, report the findings, and make recommendations for revisions, if necessary, to the items. A complete report of the methodology and detailed findings is in \u201cAppendix H. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items Summary of Findings and Recommendations, May 2011.\u201d\n\n\fChapter 3. Preparation for the 2011\u201312 SASS\n\n47\n\nMethods\nIn the spring of 2011, ICF Macro conducted a second series of cognitive interviews with principals and teachers. ICF Macro obtained participants from a list purchased from an outside vendor. ICF Macro sent an e-mail to potential participants describing the study and offering an incentive to those who agreed to participate. Interested personnel who contacted ICF Macro by e-mail or telephone were screened and scheduled for an interview. Recruitment focused on school districts with experience using student test score outcomes or growth as a criterion in principal and teacher evaluations. ICF Macro conducted the interviews by telephone. The length of the interviews averaged 15 to 20 minutes for the principal questionnaire and 25 to 30 minutes for the teacher questionnaire. Before each interview, ICF Macro emailed a copy of the proposed items to the participant. Respondents were asked to print the materials, but not to review the items before the interview.\nICF Macro interviewed nine principals to obtain their feedback on 1 question with 3 subitems in the principal questionnaire. Principals represented two elementary schools, four middle schools, and three high schools in seven states. Principals answered questions regarding their performance evaluations.\nICF Macro interviewed nine teachers, including four elementary school teachers, three middle school teachers, and two high school teachers, to obtain their feedback on four questions in the teacher questionnaire. The teachers were recruited from four different states. Teachers answered questions relating to their performance evaluations and certifications.\nKey Findings From Testing Questionnaire Items\nPrincipal Questionnaire\nICF Macro recommended wording modifications for one of the three items tested and one of the answer options. The main findings included the following:\n\u2022 Principals were able to answer the item asking whether they were or would be rated in a formal evaluation. Participants generally had the same interpretation of a \u201cformal evaluation.\u201d\n\u2022 Some participants for whom student test score outcomes or test score growth are not specifically included as an evaluation criterion in their formal evaluation responded that they were because these are measures of their school\u2019s performance, which is used as an evaluation criterion.\n\u2022 Most of the participants that reported being formally evaluated once a year indicated that their annual evaluation included several meetings.\nTeacher Questionnaire\nICF Macro recommended wording modifications for one of the items tested and two of the answer options. They also recommended an additional instruction for two of the items. The main findings included the following:\n\u2022 Participants had similar views regarding what was meant by an \u201cinformal\u201d evaluation. \u2022 One participant noted that the answer options for the item asking how often the teacher is\ninformally evaluated were not mutually exclusive. This participant is informally evaluated multiple times a year, but no formal evaluations are required. \u2022 Participants generally understood the item regarding the inclusion of student test score outcomes or test score growth as an evaluation criterion in their formal evaluations.\n\n\f48\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Most participants did not have any difficulty in correctly answering the items regarding their certification(s).\nThe NCES used the feedback from the cognitive interviews to improve the SASS questionnaires. Chapter 2 discusses the changes made to the 2007\u201308 questionnaires for the 2011\u201312 SASS. The SASS questionnaires are available on the NCES website. \u201cAppendix B. Questionnaire Availability\u201d provides the website and instructions for accessing electronic files of the final 2011\u201312 SASS questionnaires.\n\n\f49\nChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures\nThis chapter discusses how the sampling frame was created and how cases were sampled for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The first major section discusses the creation of the frame for public and public charter schools, including schools deleted, added, and otherwise edited. Next, the public and public charter school sampling procedure is described. This is followed by a description of the district sampling. The next major section covers the private school frame creation and sampling. The final major section discusses teacher sampling.\nPublic and Public Charter School Sampling Frame and Sample Selection\nPublic and Public Charter Frame Creation\nThe foundation for the 2011\u201312 SASS public and public charter school frame was the 2009\u201310 Common Core of Data (CCD) non-fiscal file. CCD is based on administrative data collected annually by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) from each state education agency and from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). For the 2009\u201310 school year, state education agencies used their administrative record data to report information for 103,968 schools. NCES and the state education agencies worked cooperatively to ensure comparability between the elements reported. CCD is believed to be the most complete public school listing available. The frame includes regular and nonregular traditional public schools (special education, alternative, vocational, or technical), and public charter schools.\nDue to an accelerated survey schedule, the preliminary 2009\u201310 CCD file was used as the basis for the SASS sampling frame rather than the final version. When the final CCD file became available, the two files were compared and any major updates were added to the frame. A number of updates were made, primarily to contact information and enrollment and teacher counts.\nIn SASS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more of grades 1\u201312 or the ungraded equivalent; and is located in one or more buildings. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building. If these schools had different administrations (i.e., principals), then they were treated as different schools.\nThe SASS definition of a school was generally similar to CCD with some exceptions. CCD included some schools that did not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1\u201312 or the equivalent ungraded levels. In some instances, school records on CCD were actually offices that oversee special types of programs that include classroom instruction or the school record on CCD may have provided funding and oversight only; these records were deleted from the sampling frame for SASS and the appropriate instruction-providing program was added. SASS collapsed CCD schools where the location address and phone number were the same on the assumption that the respondent would consider this to be all one school. (Further discussion of this issue is provided later in this Public and Public Charter Frame Creation section under \u201cSchool Collapsing.\u201d) CCD required only that schools have an assigned administrator, but since SASS allowed schools to define themselves, Census Bureau staff observed that schools generally reported as one entity in situations where the administration of two or more schools on CCD was the same. SASS was confined to the 50 states plus the District of Columbia and excluded territories and overseas schools. In 2011\u201312, SASS also excluded Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools.\n\n\f50\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTo illustrate, some examples of the differences between SASS and CCD are presented below:\n\u2022 In California, CCD listed the Special Education program at each County Office of Education as a school, whereas SASS tried to determine which special education programs were operated by each office.\n\u2022 Homebound school programs (i.e., students confined to home due to a long-term illness or condition) that are publicly-supported were included in CCD but not SASS.\n\u2022 Schools overseas that are operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) were included in CCD but not in SASS.\n\u2022 Multiple CCD schools at the same address and with the same phone number were considered one school in SASS.\n\u2022 Multiple CCD schools each with a unique administrator who reports to the high school principal were considered one school in SASS if the respondent said the school covered multiple CCD grade ranges.\nFrame Deletions\nSince CCD and SASS differ in scope and their definition of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modified in order to provide better coverage and a more efficient sample design for SASS. The following types of school records were deleted from the CCD during the creation of the SASS sampling frame:\n\u2022 There were 2,124 schools that were closed as of the 2009\u201310 school year and deleted from the frame. These schools were identified by the status code found on the CCD file. They are carried on the CCD for 1 additional year for completeness but are clearly designated as not operating.\n\u2022 There were 1,788 schools located outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia that were deleted. These schools were identified as having a FIPS state code of 58 (overseas DoD), 60 (American Samoa), 66 (Guam), 69 (Northern Marianas), 72 (Puerto Rico), or 78 (U.S. Virgin Islands). Note that 173 BIE-funded schools (FIPS state code = 59) were also excluded from the sampling frame. Domestic DOD schools located within a state (FIPS state code = 61) were not deleted from CCD because they were eligible for SASS.\n\u2022 There were 381 Homebound, Adult, or nonschool entities that were deleted. These schools and programs were clerically identified from a list of schools from the CCD that had \u201cHOMEBOUND,\u201d \u201cTARGETED SERVICES,\u201d \u201cPSYCHOANALYTIC,\u201d or \u201cADULT\u201d in the name. Since they did not provide classroom instruction to K\u201312 students, they were not eligible for SASS.\n\u2022 There were 1,633 schools that offered kindergarten or less as the highest grade that were deleted. These schools were identified using the school\u2019s highest grade offered as provided on CCD.\nSchool Collapsing\nThere were 2,468 school records that were \u201ccollapsed\u201d into other school records at the building level and deleted. Past data collections have shown that there are sampled schools that report survey data for the entire building when there is one head principal instead of reporting only for the part of the school that has been sampled. This issue occurs most often in certain states, in rural areas, or in schools that offer grades K\u201312 in the same building with one head principal. The problem lies in the conflicting definition of a school as held by the schools themselves and as reported by states to CCD. The schools often consider themselves one cohesive unit while the state does not. For accounting or other administrative purposes, the states artificially split these schools by grade level and report them as two or three separate schools.\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 51\nIf a CCD school within the associated school districts is selected for SASS, then the school often reports for all of grades K\u201312. This caused substantial over-reporting in SASS reports of state aggregates, such as enrollment and teacher counts, because these schools were sampled based on the particular grade range as reported on CCD but these schools then responded based on a much broader grade range (matching how they perceived themselves). In other words, these schools had unrecognized multiple chances of selection for sampling. The unrecognized chances of selection refer to the fact that regardless of which CCD record in the building was selected, the school was likely to report for the whole building. Thus, the entity that reports could be selected via multiple CCD records. In the past, SASS data were edited after the field data collection to conform to the CCD grade range. This method was costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, many school respondents have reported they do not keep records at the school level as reported on CCD, making it difficult for them to respond to SASS in this manner. For this reason, it was decided for the 2003\u201304 SASS and continuing through the 2011\u201312 SASS to collapse the CCD records whenever it was believed that this problem was likely to occur.\nCensus and NCES jointly determined a set of rules for school collapsing to apply during frame creation. In order to make the sampling frame more consistent with the school\u2019s actual grade range, these potential problem schools were identified and collapsed to the appropriate building level. When the school records were collapsed together, the student and teacher counts, grade range, and name as reported to CCD were all modified to reflect the change. Schools collapsing were required to match on a keyword in the name, as well as address and phone number, have contiguous grade ranges, and be of the same school type. Based on previous data collection experience, in a few states the rules were modified to require matching on only two of three of the contact information variables\u2014name, address, and phone number. These states were Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.\nFrame Additions\nThe following types of school records were added to the original CCD while creating the SASS sampling frame:\n\u2022 Ninety records that were listed on CCD as districts with no associated school records were determined to be newly-opened schools, based on the name (e.g., included \u2018school\u2019 or \u2018academy\u2019), teacher, and enrollment counts, and were added.\n\u2022 A total of 115 school records, primarily alternative, special education, and juvenile justice facilities, identified by contacting the deleted county or regional administrative units in California (20 schools), Pennsylvania (29 schools), New York (60 schools), and other states (6 schools), were also added.\nAfter the adding, deleting, and collapsing of school records, the SASS school sampling frame consisted of 90,527 traditional public and 5,079 public charter schools. From this point on, this is considered the 2011\u201312 SASS sampling frame. Table 3 shows the totals by state during each step in the frame creation process.\n\n\f52\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 3.\n\nTotal number of public and public charter school records during each step in the frame creation process, by school type and state: 2011\u201312\n\nSchool type and state Total\n\nPreliminary 2009\u201310 CCD1 file\n103,968\n\nAfter deletions (ineligible and duplicate school\nrecords) 97,869\n\nAfter additions (nontraditional schools in certain\nstates) 98,074\n\nFinal public school universe (after collapsing procedure) 95,606\n\nBIE-funded2 schools Domestic DoD3 schools\nCharter schools (included in the state totals below)\n\n173 60\n5,356\n\n0 59\n5,105\n\n0 59\n5,105\n\n0 59\n5,079\n\nAlabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n1,628 516\n2,368 1,148 10,290\n\n1,587 516\n2,337 1,109 10,050\n\n1,595 516\n2,337 1,109 10,075\n\n1,595 516\n2,337 977\n10,075\n\nColorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida\n\n1,818 1,178\n247 241 4,255\n\n1,752 1,120\n216 221 3,906\n\n1,756 1,120\n216 222 3,913\n\n1,671 1,120\n216 222 3,913\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n2,608 291 755\n4,457 1,990\n\n2,439 290 734\n4,270 1,943\n\n2,440 290 734\n4,270 1,944\n\n2,440 290 721\n4,147 1,944\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n1,503 1,466 1,565 1,678\n670\n\n1,428 1,411 1,500 1,464\n647\n\n1,428 1,412 1,500 1,464\n647\n\n1,266 1,373 1,500 1,464\n643\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n1,475 1,887 4,207 2,491 1,097\n\n1,436 1,834 3,750 2,314 1,094\n\n1,436 1,834 3,750 2,314 1,094\n\n1,436 1,834 3,690 2,204 1,094\n\nMissouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire\n\n2,458 840\n1,145 663 494\n\n2,370 832\n1,069 656 473\n\n2,370 838\n1,069 656 473\n\n2,123 570 909 656 452\n\nNew Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n2,632 866\n4,769 2,614\n533\n\n2,582 834\n4,690 2,557\n492\n\n2,584 834\n4,750 2,557\n492\n\n2,584 762\n4,750 2,557\n378\n\n\fChapter 4.

Using this file required the correction of variables necessary for sampling or conducting the survey, such as grade range, enrollment, teacher count, enrollment by race, school county code, school name, address information, and phone number. The following section outlines the steps taken to correct those variables.\n\nIf the school\u2019s grade range was missing from the CCD file, two methods were used to resolve the issue:\n\n\u2022 taking data from earlier CCD files or SASS data; and \u2022 assigning a generic grade range based on the school\u2019s name;\n\nThe enrollment, teacher count, and enrollment by race were imputed for schools missing this information by applying one of the methods listed below in the following hierarchical order:\n\n\u2022 pulling information from previous CCD data for that school; \u2022 extrapolating from current CCD student-teacher ratios and averages for the state; or \u2022 using data that were collected in the 2007\u201308 SASS for that particular school.\n\n\f54\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nThe school\u2019s grade range was edited so as to drop grades that had no enrollment or less than three students in a given grade. This procedure was not applied to schools with less than 50 students. Correction of the grade range was important for stratification.\nIn instances where the school name implied considerably fewer grades than it actually offered, the name was modified to eliminate inappropriate descriptions. These schools were identified by comparing the school\u2019s name to the grades currently offered. If the name differed considerably from the grade range (e.g., the name contained \u201cHigh School,\u201d but the grades offered were K\u201312), then the name was modified accordingly.\nDue to time constraints, missing address information and phone numbers were filled in after the school sample was selected. These fields were not crucial to the selection of the school sample.\nDistrict Frame Creation\nAs described in the sampling section later in this chapter, the district sample is primarily derived from their association with sample schools. However, a district frame was constructed for weighting and benchmark tables as described in Chapters 8 and 9. The public school district frame consisted of those districts that were operating within the United States and that oversaw at least one school on the 2011\u201312 SASS school universe file. The 2009\u201310 CCD included 18,439 district records, of which 16,839 were presumed to be eligible for SASS according to these rules. The following types of records were deleted from the 2009\u201310 CCD district file:\n\u2022 sixteen districts listed on the CCD file that operated outside of the United States; \u2022 a total of 196 Bureau of Indian Education districts; and \u2022 districts on the CCD file that were presumed not to operate schools. Comparing the district file to\nthe school file identified 1,388 districts without at least one corresponding school. These district records appeared to be administrative units rather than schools, as described previously in the Frame Additions section.\n\n\fChapter 4.

For the most part, the goals of the sample design remained the same as they had been in the 2007\u201308 SASS, but with clarification about what coefficient of variation (a measure of the sampling variation, where the standard error is divided by the estimate) was desired for each grade level, state, or affiliation. A full description of the sample allocation research is located in \u201cAppendix E. 2011\u201312 SASS Redesign\u2013\u2013Precision Analysis.\u201d\n\nThe general goals were:\n\n\u2022 Use the 2009\u201310 CCD school file as the sample frame with exceptions noted in the previous \u201cPublic and Public Charter Frame Creation\u201d section.\n\u2022 Produce state estimates of public school characteristics. \u2022 Produce state/primary school, state/middle school, and state/high school estimates of the number\nof public schools and associated public school characteristics. \u2022 Produce national estimates of combined-grade public schools, meaning schools that offer grades\nthat span both elementary and secondary levels. \u2022 Produce national estimates by various geographic designations (e.g., region and locale) and\nschool characteristics for public schools. \u2022 Produce national and regional estimates of public charter schools and selected school\ncharacteristics.\n\nIn addition, the sample allocation research had the following goals:\n\n\u2022 Produce state/primary, state/middle, and state/high school estimates of the number of public schools and associated public school characteristics with CVs of 15 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 57\n\n\u2022 Produce national combined school estimates of the number of schools and associated public school characteristics with CVs of 30 percent or less.\n\u2022 Produce estimates for overall public sector (including charter) schools by state with CVs at or below 10 percent.\n\u2022 Optimize the allocation of remaining public schools, up to the maximum sample size of 11,000 using 2007\u201308 SASS data collection cost information.\n\u2022 Allocate 750 charter schools optimally to the charter school strata with CVs at or below 15 percent.\nThe district sample was designed to produce state estimates. No specific precision requirements were imposed. However, in four states\u2014Maryland, Florida, Nevada, and West Virginia\u2014the CVs were observed to be quite high. In consideration of the high sampling rate of districts in those states (80 percent or more of districts were in sample), low CVs were expected. Consequently, it was decided that all districts in those states should be in sample.\n\nSampling Methodology\nThe SASS sample is not a simple random sample, but rather is a stratified probability proportionate to size (PPS) sample. The first level of stratification for public schools was to group schools into three domains as follows: (a) schools in Maryland, Florida, Nevada, and West Virginia, where at least one school from each school district in the state was selected as described in the following \u201cSample Selection\u201d section about districts; (b) public charter schools; and (c) all other traditional public schools.\n\nThe second level of stratification varied within the three school domains identified above. Type A schools were stratified first by state and then school district. Type B schools were stratified by state (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, the remaining Western states, Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, the remaining Midwestern states, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, the remaining Southern states, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and the remaining Northeastern states). The type C schools were stratified by state (all remaining states including the District of Columbia).\n\nEach of the school domain/state groups was then stratified by grade level. For charter schools, three levels (elementary, secondary, and combined) were defined as described below:\n\nElementary: lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade \u2264 8;\nSecondary: lowest grade \u2265 7 and highest grade \u2264 12; and Combined: lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade > 8, or school is ungraded.8\n\nFor the other traditional public school types, four levels were defined as described below:\n\nPrimary: Middle: High: Combined:\n\nlowest grade \u2264 4 and highest grade \u2264 8;\nlowest grade \u2265 5 and highest grade \u2264 8;\nlowest grade \u2265 7 and highest grade \u2265 9; and lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade \u2265 9, or school is ungraded.4\n\n8 Ungraded schools refer to schools that serve students whose grade levels are not defined as grades 1 through 12, but serve students of an equivalent age range. For example, special education centers and alternative schools often classify their students as ungraded.\n\n\f58\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS sample was allocated so that state-level estimates of primary, middle, and high traditional public schools and national estimates of combined public schools could be made. The sample was allocated to each state by grade range and school type (traditional public and public charter). A full description of the allocation procedure is located in \u201cAppendix I. School and Teacher Sample Allocation Procedure.\u201d\nSample Sort\nTo facilitate the calculation of school district weights, it was important that within a stratum all schools belonging to the same school district were listed together. This could have been achieved by sorting first by the school district\u2019s identification variable (LEA ID). However, to increase the efficiency of the school sample design, it was better to sort by other variables before LEA ID. To achieve both these goals, the ZIP Code variables were recoded to make them the same for every school within a stratum/school district. After the ZIP Code was recoded, traditional public and public charter schools were sorted by the following variables:\n1. school stratum code, combinations of A, B, and C, and level, as defined in the \u201cSampling Methodology\u201d section above;\n2. state; 3. locale code:\n11 = city, large: territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more;\n12 = city, mid-size: territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000;\n13 = city, small: territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 100,000;\n21 = suburb, large: territory inside an urbanized area and outside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more;\n22 = suburb, mid-size: territory inside an urbanized area and outside a principal city with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000;\n23 = suburb, small: territory inside an urbanized area and outside a principal city with population less than 100,000;\n31 = town, fringe: territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from an urbanized area;\n32 = town, distant: territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area;\n33 = town, remote: territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles from an urbanized area;\n41 = rural, fringe: Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an urban cluster;\n42 = rural, distant: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster;\n43 = rural, remote: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 10 miles from an urban cluster;\n4. recoded ZIP Code (all schools in stratum/district had the same value for this variable); 5. district ID as defined on CCD; 6. recoded percent eligible for free or reduced price lunch and as defined as\n1 = less than or equal to 75 percent of enrollment; 2 = more than 75 percent of enrollment;\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 59\n7. school\u2019s highest grade offered (in descending order); 8. recoded percent of enrollment that has race and ethnicity other than white non-Hispanic (in\ndescending order) and defined as 1 = less than 5.5 percent non-white or Hispanic enrollment, 2 = at least 5.5 percent but less than 20.5 percent non-white or Hispanic enrollment, 3 = at least 20.5 percent but less than 50.5 percent non-white or Hispanic enrollment, and 4 = at least 50.5 percent non-white or Hispanic enrollment; 9. total enrollment (in serpentine sort order, which was defined as enrollment being sorted first in ascending then descending order within the other sort variables); and 10. CCD school ID.\nThis sort order differed slightly from the sort used in previous SASS administrations. Percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was added as the first sort below district ID in order to achieve a better representation of high poverty schools. All other sort variables remained the same as for the 2007\u201308 SASS.\nThe first four sort variables allowed a geographic balance to be achieved within locale for each state. The fifth variable guaranteed that schools within a district and school stratum stayed together. The sixth variable controlled for the selection of high poverty schools. The seventh variable (school\u2019s highest grade) controlled for the sampling of schools with an unusual highest grade (for example primary schools with highest grade of 4). The eighth variable (recoded minority) allowed a balance with respect to race/ethnicity. The ninth variable (school enrollment) also encouraged a balance with respect to school size.\nSample Selection\nSchools\nWithin each stratum, schools were systematically selected using a probability-proportionate-to-size (PPS) algorithm. The measure of size used for the schools was the square root of the number of full-time equivalent teachers reported for each school or imputed during sampling frame creation. Any school with a measure of size greater than the sampling interval (the inverse of the rate at which the sample is selected) was included in the sample with certainty and automatically excluded from the probability sampling operation. This means that schools with an unusually high number of teachers relative to other schools in the same stratum were automatically included in the sample. In Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia, the school probabilities of selection within each school district were analyzed. If the pattern of probabilities (i.e., the sum of the probabilities of schools within school district and grade level) did not guarantee that a school would be sampled from that school district, then the school with the highest probability of selection was included in the sample with certainty. This guaranteed that all school districts in these states would have at least one school in sample; the subsequent section on district sampling discusses the reason for this. This produced a public school sample of 11,000 (750 public charter schools and 10,250 traditional public schools).\nTable 5 shows the selected sample sizes for traditional public schools. Table 6 shows the selected sample sizes for public charter schools. Each selected public and public charter school was also in sample for the principal and the school library media center surveys, so no additional sampling was needed.\n\n\f60\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 5.\n\nSelected sample sizes for traditional public schools, by school level, the total number of sampled schools, and the percentage of the frame in sample, by state: 2011\u201312\n\nState Total\n\nPrimary 2,813\n\nSchool level\n\nTotal Percent of state\u2019s\n\nMiddle\n\nHigh Combined sampled schools frame in sample\n\n2,559\n\n3,567\n\n1,311\n\n10,250\n\n11.34\n\nAlabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n50\n\n67\n\n69\n\n34\n\n30\n\n21\n\n43\n\n50\n\n50\n\n48\n\n94\n\n23\n\n35\n\n42\n\n52\n\n14\n\n135\n\n105\n\n304\n\n50\n\n220\n\n13.77\n\n144\n\n29.33\n\n215\n\n12.17\n\n143\n\n15.08\n\n594\n\n6.43\n\nColorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida\n\n51\n\n56\n\n38\n\n21\n\n43\n\n84\n\n88\n\n12\n\n25\n\n23\n\n20\n\n15\n\n23\n\n7\n\n14\n\n6\n\n81\n\n63\n\n148\n\n59\n\n166\n\n10.95\n\n227\n\n20.60\n\n83\n\n42.56\n\n50\n\n37.88\n\n351\n\n10.10\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n75\n\n69\n\n29\n\n29\n\n26\n\n22\n\n21\n\n5\n\n44\n\n50\n\n44\n\n14\n\n88\n\n80\n\n62\n\n20\n\n59\n\n63\n\n72\n\n33\n\n202\n\n8.46\n\n74\n\n28.57\n\n152\n\n22.19\n\n250\n\n6.09\n\n227\n\n12.00\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n51\n\n45\n\n53\n\n10\n\n45\n\n47\n\n72\n\n12\n\n56\n\n53\n\n54\n\n51\n\n54\n\n40\n\n80\n\n21\n\n68\n\n52\n\n41\n\n6\n\n159\n\n12.65\n\n176\n\n13.13\n\n214\n\n14.11\n\n195\n\n14.06\n\n167\n\n25.97\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n48\n\n37\n\n93\n\n23\n\n50\n\n53\n\n47\n\n32\n\n93\n\n73\n\n125\n\n50\n\n56\n\n51\n\n180\n\n57\n\n32\n\n35\n\n50\n\n12\n\n201\n\n14.41\n\n182\n\n10.27\n\n341\n\n10.39\n\n344\n\n16.98\n\n129\n\n11.80\n\nMissouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire\n\n67\n\n64\n\n75\n\n33\n\n30\n\n24\n\n47\n\n15\n\n58\n\n52\n\n61\n\n25\n\n30\n\n29\n\n64\n\n18\n\n29\n\n27\n\n43\n\n7\n\n239\n\n11.50\n\n116\n\n20.35\n\n196\n\n21.56\n\n141\n\n22.74\n\n106\n\n24.15\n\nNew Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota\n\n82\n\n77\n\n109\n\n45\n\n32\n\n43\n\n77\n\n25\n\n102\n\n84\n\n104\n\n37\n\n77\n\n71\n\n27\n\n11\n\n34\n\n15\n\n46\n\n40\n\n313\n\n12.51\n\n177\n\n25.62\n\n327\n\n7.09\n\n186\n\n7.51\n\n135\n\n35.71\n\nOhio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n90\n\n72\n\n90\n\n27\n\n43\n\n31\n\n39\n\n19\n\n50\n\n56\n\n75\n\n21\n\n68\n\n70\n\n58\n\n37\n\n40\n\n30\n\n38\n\n4\n\n279\n\n8.42\n\n132\n\n8.94\n\n202\n\n17.06\n\n233\n\n7.40\n\n112\n\n37.09\n\n\fChapter 4.

Districts in four states were selected differently than those in the remaining states, so the sampling procedure for most states is described first followed by the sampling procedure for the exceptional states. In addition, public charter schools that operate independently of the local school districts are included as school districts as well as schools. Charter schools that do not operate independently are referred to as dependent and are not included as school districts since they are considered to be part of their governing school districts.\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 63\nDistricts Outside Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia\nDuring the initial design development of SASS, consideration was given to selecting the school districts first and then selecting schools within these districts. It was hypothesized that doing this would reduce the reliability of both school and teacher estimates but might improve the reliability of school district estimates. Simulations done on the reliability of school district estimates when the districts were selected first confirmed the loss of reliability in school and teacher estimates. The simulations also showed that selecting schools first would produce only slightly less accurate district estimates. For these reasons, the SASS sample design selects the schools first.\nTherefore, the school district sample consists of the set of districts associated with the SASS public school sample. This provides the linkage between the district and the school. Table 7 provides the number of school districts selected by state. This can be compared with the number of districts on the frame in each state as presented earlier in table 4. In parts of Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, some of the districts were dropped and the sampled schools were instead associated with their Supervisory Unions. This was done because there was evidence indicating that the Supervisory Union, rather than the school districts, handled the day-to-day administration of the schools.\nDistricts inside Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia\nIn 2010, a study was done for each state to assess the reliability of SASS school district estimates. The study showed that standard errors from Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia were high relative to the sampling rate. To reduce the standard errors, all school districts in these states were defined as school sampling strata. This placed all districts in each of these four states in the school district sample, thus reducing the standard error to zero, if all districts respond. Delaware was dropped from this list because all charter schools in Delaware are operated independently of the school districts, necessitating the sampling of all charter schools if a zero variance were to be achieved. It was decided this was impractical and too burdensome.\n\n\f64\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 7.\n\nNumber of sampled public school districts (includes charter school districts), by state: 2011\u201312\n\nState\n\nDistricts\n\nState\n\nDistricts\n\nTotal\n\n5,714\n\nIndependent charter schools\n\n(included in the state totals)\n\n301\n\nAlabama\n\nMissouri\n\n161\n\n104\n\nMontana\n\n77\n\nAlaska Arizona Arkansas\n\n43\n\nNebraska\n\n99\n\n168\n\nNevada\n\n20\n\n96\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n59\n\nCalifornia Colorado\n\n375\n\nNew Jersey\n\n230\n\n70\n\nNew Mexico\n\n69\n\nConnecticut Delaware\n\n121\n\nNew York\n\n199\n\n26\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n93\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n18\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n82\n\nFlorida\n\n74\n\nOhio\n\n264\n\nGeorgia Hawaii\n\n96\n\nOklahoma\n\n99\n\n1\n\nOregon\n\n116\n\nIdaho\n\n75\n\nPennsylvania\n\n207\n\nIllinois Indiana\n\n181\n\nRhode Island\n\n38\n\n153\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n57\n\nIowa Kansas\n\n115\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n66\n\n106\n\nTennessee\n\n74\n\nKentucky\n\n112\n\nTexas\n\n309\n\nLouisiana\n\n69\n\nUtah\n\n54\n\nMaine Maryland\n\n94\n\nVermont\n\n54\n\n25\n\nVirginia\n\n88\n\nMassachusetts\n\n137\n\nWashington\n\n143\n\nMichigan Minnesota\n\n261\n\nWest Virginia\n\n54\n\n213\n\nWisconsin\n\n147\n\nMississippi\n\n81\n\nWyoming\n\n41\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), \u201cPublic School District Sample Data File,\u201d 2011\u201312.\n\nPrivate School Frame Creation and Sample Selection\n\nPrivate List and Area Frame Creation\n\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS private school sample consisted of schools selected from a list frame and an area frame. The SASS private school sample size was 3,000 of which 2,748 schools were from the list frame and 252 were from the area frame. The area frame serves as coverage improvement since the list frame is believed to contain some undercoverage of private schools.\n\nList Frame\n\nMost of the SASS private school sample comes from a list frame, which is a frame constructed from matching various sources of private school lists. The starting point for the 2011\u201312 SASS list frame was the 2009\u201310 Private School Survey (PSS) list frame. In order to provide coverage of private schools founded since 2010 and to improve coverage of private schools existing in 2010, the Census Bureau collected membership lists in the summer of 2010 from private school associations and religious denominations. The associations were asked to include schools that met the PSS school definition when\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 65\nthey provided lists. The 50 states and the District of Columbia were also asked to provide lists of private schools meeting the PSS definition of a school. Schools on private school association membership lists and the state lists were compared to the 2009\u201310 PSS list frame. Any school that did not match a school on the 2009\u201310 PSS list frame was added to the existing list frame as a list frame birth. Schools found to be out-of-scope in 2009\u201310 PSS (usually because they had closed) were deleted from the frame. This is the usual method that is followed to create a revised PSS list frame every two years.\nThis updating process was conducted specifically for the development of the 2011\u201312 PSS list frame, but was used as the starting point for the sampling frame for SASS private schools. To create the SASS sampling frame, schools with a highest grade of kindergarten, which are schools by the more expansive PSS definition but not the SASS definition, were deleted.\nArea Frame\nDue to time constraints, the Census Bureau did not have time to wait for the 2011\u201312 PSS area frame schools to be identified. The PSS area frame operation was conducted several weeks after data collection began for the 2011\u201312 SASS. Consequently, the 2009\u201310 PSS area frame was used as the area frame for the 2011\u201312 SASS.\nTo create the 2009\u201310 PSS area frame, the United States was divided into 2,062 primary sampling units (PSUs). Each PSU consisted of a single county, independent city, or cluster of geographically contiguous areas with a minimum population of 20,000 according to population projections for 1988, which was when the PSUs were first formed. To avoid having PSUs covering too large a land area, the minimum population standard was relaxed in sparsely-populated areas.\nA total of 124 distinct PSUs were in the 2009\u201310 PSS area sample. The eight largest PSUs were selected with certainty, and 116 PSUs were selected to represent the remainder of the country. These 116 PSUs are termed noncertainty since they were not selected with certainty.\nArea frame schools in the 2009\u201310 PSS in certainty PSUs were removed from the SASS area frame and moved to the list frame. In addition, the updated 2011\u201312 PSS list frame picked up some of the area frame schools. These two frames were then unduplicated, with the duplicate schools being dropped from the area frame. Schools that could be defined as only teaching kindergarten as the highest grade or only teaching adult education or postsecondary were also removed from the area frame.\nThe strata for selecting the PSUs were defined the same as for the 2007\u201308 PSS area frame design. Initially, 16 strata were created as had been done for prior cycles of PSS. The strata include region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), metro/nonmetro status, and high/low percentage of students enrolled in private schools within metro/nonmetro status (i.e., above or below the median enrollment within each metro/nonmetro status). The high/low cutoffs were then adjusted so as to more nearly equalize the expected variance between the two strata. The purpose of this was to try to lower the PSS or SASS standard errors resulting from the PSU sampling.\nSample sizes were determined for each metro/nonmetro status within each region, proportional to the sum of the square root of the PSU estimated PSS private school enrollment. Some adjustments were made so that each sample size was an even number and that sample size was evenly distributed between the high and low percent private enrollment groups. This was done in order to have an even number of cases in each stratum (with a minimum of two) for pairing purposes for the PSS or SASS variance estimation.\nWithin each of the 124 PSUs, the Census Bureau attempted to find all private schools eligible for PSS as part of the PSS area frame operation. A block-by-block listing of all private schools in a sample of PSUs\n\n\f66\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nwas not attempted. Rather, regional office field staff created the frame by using yellow pages, local Catholic dioceses, religious institutions, local education agencies, and local government offices. Once the area search lists of schools were constructed, they were matched with the PSS list frame school universe. Schools not found on the list frame were considered part of the area frame.\nPrivate School Frames\nThe list and area frames were modified to fit the SASS definition of a school and to meet the needs of the sampling procedure. Specifically, certain records that were expected to be ineligible for SASS deleted. Variables needed for sampling were imputed.\nFrame Deletions\nThe following types of records were deleted from the PSS list and area frames to create the SASS private school list and area frames:\nFrom the list frame:\n\u2022 schools added from the 2011\u201312 early childhood center (ECC) frame (a PSS operation whereby states are specifically asked for schools with kindergarten as the highest grade);\n\u2022 schools from the 2009\u201310 PSS list frame with kindergarten as the highest grade level; and \u2022 schools that were determined to be out-of-scope for the 2009\u201310 PSS list frame (i.e., closed, pre-\nkindergarten only, not providing classroom instruction).\nFrom the area frame:\n\u2022 schools from noncertainty PSUs of the 2009\u201310 PSS area frame that were added to the 2011\u201312 PSS list frame;\n\u2022 schools with kindergarten as the highest grade level; and \u2022 schools that were determined to be out-of-scope for the 2009\u201310 PSS area frame (i.e., closed, pre-\nkindergarten only, not providing classroom instruction).\nFrame Variable Imputation\nSome school records that were missing information needed during the school sample selection. The school grade range and affiliation variables were used in stratifying schools during the private school sampling process. The number of teachers was used to form the measure of size in the private school sampling process. Finally, the number of students was used in sorting private school records during sampling. Values were assigned for any of these variables if the data were missing in the manner discussed below.\nThe school\u2019s grade range was assigned in one of three ways:\n\u2022 taking information from earlier PSS data; \u2022 using the school\u2019s name to assign a generic grade range; or \u2022 assigning a grade level of combined (both elementary and secondary levels), as a last resort.\nThe school\u2019s affiliation stratum was assigned by\n\u2022 using information from earlier PSS data;\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 67\n\u2022 using the school\u2019s name to assign an association membership; and \u2022 assigning the rest to the \u201cNonsectarian-regular\u201d category.\nThe school\u2019s student and teacher counts were imputed in one of the following ways:\n\u2022 using previous PSS data for that school; or \u2022 using current SASS frame student-teacher ratios and averages by grade level and affiliation.\nSample Allocation\nThe goals for the 2011\u201312 SASS private school sample size allocation for the most part remained the same as the 2007\u201308 goals:\n\u2022 Produce detailed private school affiliation group estimates for each of the 11 affiliations. \u2022 Produce national private sector school-level estimates (i.e. elementary, secondary, and\ncombined). \u2022 Produce estimates for national and regional public versus private sector comparisons.\nAs part of the sample allocation for 2011\u201312 SASS, research was undertaken on the private school allocation. The sample was allocated to affiliation and grade level optimally using 2007\u201308 SASS data collection cost information and variances on selected key reporting variables.\nThe goal of the sample allocation was to produce CVs at the affiliation level of 8 percent or less. Exceptions were made for affiliations where this standard was believed to produce an excessive burden on the schools in the affiliation due to unusually high sampling rates. No specific CV requirements were imposed for region or grade level.\nList Frame Methodology\nThe list frame was partitioned into an initial set of cells using affiliation (11 groups), grade level (three groups), and Census region (four groups). These cells were defined using the 2009\u201310 PSS data. For any records with missing values for variables used in the assignment, the data were imputed.\nThe first level of stratification was school affiliation (11 groups):\n\u2022 Catholic\u2013\u2013parochial; \u2022 Catholic\u2013\u2013diocesan; \u2022 Catholic\u2013\u2013private; \u2022 Baptist; \u2022 Jewish; \u2022 Lutheran; \u2022 Seventh-Day Adventist; \u2022 Other religious; \u2022 Nonsectarian\u2013\u2013regular; \u2022 Nonsectarian\u2013\u2013special emphasis; and \u2022 Nonsectarian\u2013\u2013special education.\n\n\f68\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nWithin each affiliation, schools were stratified by grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined schools). The definitions are provided below:\nElementary: lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade \u2264 8; Secondary: lowest grade \u2265 7 and highest grade \u2264 12; and Combined: lowest grade \u2264 6 and highest grade > 8, also includes ungraded 9 schools.\nWithin affiliation/grade level, schools were stratified by four Census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.\nThe private school sample size selected from the list frame was 2,748 schools. Table 8 shows the allocated sample sizes by selected characteristics.\n\n9 Ungraded school refers to schools that serve students whose grade levels are not defined as grades 1 through 12, but serve students of an equivalent age range. For example, special education centers and alternative schools often classify their students as ungraded.\n\n\fChapter 4.

Within each stratum, sorting took place on the following variables:\n\n1. state (one for each state and the District of Columbia); 2. highest grade in the school; 3. locale code (based on 2000 Census geography):\n\n\f70\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n11 = city, large: territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more;\n12 = city, mid-size: territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000;\n13 = city, small: territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population less than 100,000;\n21 = suburb, large: territory inside an urbanized area and outside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more;\n22 = suburb, mid-size: territory inside an urbanized area and outside a principal city with population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000;\n23 = suburb, small: territory inside an urbanized area and outside a principal city with population less than 100,000;\n31 = town, fringe: territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from an urbanized area;\n32 = town, distant: territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area;\n33 = town, remote: territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles from an urbanized area;\n41 = rural, fringe: Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an urban cluster;\n42 = rural, distant: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster;\n43 = rural, remote: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 10 miles from an urban cluster;\n4. ZIP Code; 5. enrollment as reported in the 2009\u201310 PSS (or imputed); and 6. PIN number (the PIN number is a unique number assigned to identify the school on PSS).\nArea Frame\nThere were 252 area frame schools identified as being in-scope in the 2009\u201310 PSS area frame within noncertainty PSUs that had not already been added as part of the 2011\u201312 PSS list frame updating operation. All of the 252 area frame cases (in the noncertainty PSUs) remained in the area frame and were in sample. All area frame schools were included in the sample due to the high variance associated with the area frame cases. Results of the sample optimization determined that all area frame cases should be included in order to minimize the private school CVs in SASS.\nSample Selection\nList Frame\nWithin each stratum, private schools in the list frame were systematically selected using a probability proportionate to size algorithm. The measure of size used was the square root of the 2009\u201310 PSS number of teachers (in full-time equivalent counts) in the school. Any school with a measure of size larger than the sampling interval was excluded from the probability sampling process and included in the sample with certainty.\nTable 9 shows the number of private schools that were sampled from the list frame and the percentage of the frame that was sampled for each affiliation stratum. Table 10 shows the number of private schools\n\n\fChapter 4.

These lists were transmitted electronically rather than collected on the paper Teacher Listing Form (TLF). Lists that could not be collected from public school districts electronically\n\n\f72\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nwere collected directly from the schools on paper TLFs, primarily by mail. Lists of teachers for private schools were collected directly from schools, primarily on paper TLFs. The paper TLFs were keyed by staff at the National Processing Center (NPC). Both the electronic lists and the lists keyed from paper were sampled on a weekly basis throughout the data collection period.\nAlong with the names of its teachers, sampled schools or their school districts were asked to provide the following descriptive characteristics of each teacher:\n1. teacher experience: teachers in their first year of teaching were classified as beginning; those in their 2nd or 3rd year of teaching were classified as early career; teachers with 4\u201319 years of experience were classified as mid-career; and teachers with 20 or more years of teaching were classified as highly experienced;\n2. teaching status: part-time or full-time; and 3. subject matter taught: teachers were classified as special education, general elementary, math,\nscience, English/language arts, social studies, vocational/technical, or other.\nStratification\nWithin each sampled school, teachers were stratified by experience. The strata include beginning teachers, early year teachers, mid-career teachers, and highly experienced teachers and are defined above.\nSample Allocation\nThe goals of the teacher sampling were as follows:\n\u2022 Oversample beginning and early career teachers to ensure that there would be enough teachers in both the 2011\u201312 SASS and the 2012\u201313 Teacher Follow-up Survey. These teachers were oversampled by a factor of 1.5.\n\u2022 Select a minimum of one and a maximum of 20 teachers per school. \u2022 Minimize the variance of teacher estimates within school stratum by attempting a self-weighting\ndesign; that is, attempts were made to equalize the teacher weights within stratum. This constraint was relaxed to accommodate the other goals of teacher sampling. \u2022 Select an average of three to nine teachers per school depending upon grade range, state, and sector. The average teacher sample size was limited to this to avoid overburdening the schools, while allowing for a large enough teacher sample to meet the reliability requirements as discussed further in this section.\nPrior to the 2011\u201312 SASS, research was conducted to determine if the average cluster sizes met certain goals for reliability:\n\u2022 For traditional public schools, set the cluster sizes so as to produce state estimates for primary, middle, and high schools with coefficients of variation (CVs) of 15 percent, 20 percent, and 15 percent, respectively.\n\u2022 For charter schools, set the cluster sizes so as to achieve national estimates for elementary, secondary, and combined schools with CVs of 20 percent or lower.\n\u2022 For private schools, set the cluster sizes so as to produce CVs of 10 percent or lower by affiliation stratum.\nA full description of the sample allocation research is located in \u201cAppendix E. 2011\u201312 SASS Redesign\u2014Precision Analysis.\u201d\n\n\fChapter 4. SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 73\n\nBefore teachers were allocated to strata, schools were first allocated an overall number of teachers to be selected. This overall sample size was chosen so as to equalize the teacher weights within school stratum (i.e., state/level for public schools, association stratum/level/region for private schools). Teacher weights within stratum were not always equalized, however, due to the minimum and maximum constraints.\n\nTables 11 and 12 provide the average number of teachers to be selected within each public and private school. Table 11 lists the averages for private schools and public charter schools, broken by their three grade levels (elementary, secondary, and combined). Table 12 lists the averages for traditional public schools, which are broken by the four grade levels (primary, middle, high, and combined) and state.\n\nTable 11.

SASS Frame Creation and Sample Selection Procedures 75\n\nFor a given school, the teacher sample size was chosen to equalize the teacher weights within a school stratum. Since the school sample was selected proportional to the square root of the number of teachers in the school, an equally-weighted teacher sample within a school stratum was obtained by selecting ti teachers in school i.\n\nti = Wi*Ti(C/Y)\n\nwhere:\n\nWi is the school weight for school i (the inverse of the school selection probability).\n\nTi is the number of teachers in school i, as reported on the Teacher Listing Form.\n\nC\n\nis the average teacher cluster size in the frame/grade level category (see tables 11\n\nand 12).\n\nY is the simple average of the school\u2019s base-weighted number of teachers over all\n\nschools in the school stratum.\n\nGiven the number of teachers selected in each school, ti, teachers were allocated to the teacher stratum, j, where j indicates the level of experience, in the following manner.\n\nt ij\n\n=\n\nti *Tij\nE\n\n*K j\n\n\u2211 Tij * K j\n\nj=A\n\nwhere:\n\nKj is the oversampling factor for the particular teacher stratum, j\n\nTij is the number of teachers from stratum j in school i\n\ntij\n\nis the number of sample teachers selected from school i and stratum j\n\nThe values of K that were applied to the teacher sampling were fixed for first year and second or third year teacher strata (1.5 for public and private schools). The values for experienced teacher strata were fixed at 1.0. To make sure a school was not overburdened the maximum number of teachers per school was set at 20. When the number of sampled teachers exceeded 20 in a school, the sample size, ti, was reduced proportionally in all strata to achieve a final sample size of 20.\n\nSample Selection\n\nTeacher records within a school and teacher stratum code were sorted by the teacher subject code, and the teacher line number code. The teacher line number is a unique number assigned to identify the teacher within the list of keyed teachers. Within each teacher stratum in each school, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. Table 13 shows the number of teachers selected as described above.\n\n\f76\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 13.

The planned sample was computed based on universe files of teacher counts from 2 years prior (CCD for public, PSS for private) instead of reported teacher counts from the school just prior to data collection. Also, the response rate for the completed Teacher Listing Forms may be lower than expected, changing the number of schools from which to select sampled teachers. About 30 percent of the in-scope private schools and 23 percent of the in-scope public schools did not provide teacher lists. For these schools, no teachers were selected. A factor in the teacher weighting was used to adjust the weights to reflect the fact that some schools did not provide teacher lists. These factors may cause the overall average number of teachers per school to be slightly different from the target numbers.\n\nTo reduce the variance of teacher estimates, one goal of the teacher selection was to make the teacher sample self-weighting (i.e., have equal probabilities of selection), within teacher and school stratum, but not across strata. The goal was generally met. However, since the sample size of teachers in some schools was altered due to the minimum constraint (i.e., at least one teacher per school) or maximum constraint (i.e., no more than either twice the average stratum allocation or 20 teachers per school), this goal was not fully achieved in all schools.\n\nField Sampling Activities\n\nOnce a sampled school or district was contacted in the screener or the District Call Operation, the grade range was verified. Occasionally, the grade range differed considerably due to a difference in the school\u2019s actual grade range and how it was reported on the sampling frame. When a considerable difference occurred and the school reported fewer grades than expected, the sampled school was considered to have split into two or more schools. In this instance, the responding school was asked to provide a list of all of the schools that covered the sampled grade range. Consequently, one school was randomly subsampled from the list of schools covering the expected grade range. The school base weight was adjusted upward accordingly as described in chapter 8. If the school reported having more grades than expected, the respondent was interviewed, and the sampling frame was reviewed to see if the responding school corresponded to more than one sampling frame record. When this occurred, the sampled school was considered a merged school, and the base weight was adjusted downward to account for the fact that the respondent could have fallen into the sample through more than one sampling frame record.\n\n\f77\nChapter 5. Data Collection\nThe 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) utilized a combination of mail-based methodology and internet reporting for questionnaires, with telephone and in person field follow-up. The majority of data collection operations for school districts were conducted independently from the collection of schoollevel data; however, some school districts, as determined by the district contact calling operation, were asked to provide a list of teachers for their schools in sample. School data collection included: the Teacher Listing Form (unless the district was responsible for providing the teacher list); Principal Questionnaire or Private School Principal Questionnaire; School Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, or Public School Questionnaire (With District Items); School Library Media Center Questionnaire (for public schools only); and Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire. At the beginning of data collection, the Census Bureau mailed both districts and schools a package containing the appropriate questionnaire(s) and letter(s) that introduced the survey and provided them with usernames, passwords, and the URL for the Control Center. Once logged in to the Control Center, districts were asked to upload electronic teacher list(s), if applicable. Schools were asked to complete the screener interview to verify their address, grade range, and school type (e.g., traditional public, private, public charter, etc.), and to establish a survey coordinator.10 The Control Center also gave schools the option to upload an electronic teacher list. Telephone interviewers and field representatives contacted nonrespondents as necessary. An overview of the purpose and content of each questionnaire is discussed in chapter 1. The changes in methodology from the 2007\u201308 SASS are described in chapter 2. This chapter describes the data collection activities in detail. Exhibit 3 on the following page shows how cases flowed from one data collection activity to the next. Each rectangle contains the name of the data collection activity and the date(s) it occurred. The ovals contain the conditions that determined whether a school or individual respondent was included in the following data collection activity. If all appropriate questionnaires were complete or resolved (i.e., the respondent refused or was out-of-scope), data collection activities for the school or district ended. A brief evaluation of the methodology is included at the end of this chapter.\n10 The role of the survey coordinator was to be the main contact person at the school. A survey coordinator\u2019s duties included facilitating data collection by passing out questionnaires to the appropriate staff, reminding the staff to complete them, and collecting the questionnaires to return to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\f78\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit 3.

Data Collection 79\n\nOverview of School District Data Collection\n\nAdvance Work With School Districts\n\nCensus Bureau staff contacted school districts prior to the beginning of data collection for two reasons. First, staff contacted districts regarding the SASS because some districts require researchers to submit a research application to conduct research in their schools. There were 210 school districts with three or more schools sampled for the SASS that were known to have a formal approval process. School districts with two or less schools selected to participate were not contacted prior to data collection. These efforts began in February 2011 and continued through September 2011. Application packages generally included a cover letter, a standard proposal for research, a consent form, an IRB Exemption form, and copies of the SASS questionnaires. District-specific application forms, as well as other required forms, were included for some districts. Once data collection began, Census Bureau staff continued to follow-up with the school districts regarding the application\u2019s status and submitted applications to five additional districts that reported that they required approval. The background, methods, findings, and recommendations of this operation are reported in \u201cAppendix J. Report on Results of Special Contact Districts.\u201d\n\nAll school districts were contacted during a district contact calling operation. This was a multifaceted five-week operation that began in mid-June 2011. During this operation, telephone interviewers called public school districts to introduce the survey and verify the district\u2019s name, address, phone number, and number of schools (if it was suspected to be a one-school district). Then they attempted to establish a contact person for the School District Questionnaire and determine whether the district was willing and able to provide an electronic list of teachers for their selected school(s) in the fall. If the district agreed to provide an electronic list, the interviewer determined the appropriate contact person to receive the request. The interviewer verified the selected schools\u2019 names, grade ranges, and operational statuses. Finally, the interviewer attempted to collect the names of the selected schools\u2019 principals and their e-mail addresses.\n\nTiming of School District Data Collection\n\nThe schedule for the school district data collection is presented in table 14.\n\nTable 14.

The purpose of the district contact calling operation was to verify the district\u2019s name and address; determine whether the sample school was the only school in the district; collect the contact information for the person to whom the district questionnaire should be mailed; determine if the district would provide an electronic teacher list for each sampled school and, if so, collect the contact information for the person to whom the request should be mailed; verify the grade range for each school in sample; and collect the principal names and email addresses for each school in sample.\nCensus Bureau interviewers at the Jeffersonville Telephone Center called sampled school districts using a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instrument. Upon reaching a school district staff member, the interviewer verified the district\u2019s name and address. Next, some traditional public schools were verified as being \u201cone-school districts,\u201d that is, the only school in the district. During the district contact operation, 1,349 schools were identified as being a \u201cone-school district\u201d status, a public charter school, or a Career and Technical Center school. These schools received the SASS Public School Questionnaire (With District Items), which contains the questions from the School Questionnaire in addition to some items from the School District Questionnaire (see chapter 2 for a more detailed explanation of this questionnaire). After verifying the district name, address, and \u201cone-school districts,\u201d interviewers obtained the contact information for the best person to receive the School District Questionnaire.\nInterviewers asked the district staff member whether their district would be willing to provide an electronic teacher list for the sampled school(s) within their district. This feature of data collection was implemented in an attempt to reduce the burden on sampled schools and receive teacher lists earlier in data collection. If the district agreed to provide the teacher lists, the interviewer obtained the name and contact information for the person most appropriate to receive the request.\nInterviewers then verified each sampled school\u2019s grade range. If the grade range differed entirely (i.e., the actual grade range did not overlap with the expected grade range) or if the grade range differed significantly from the expected grade range, then more information was obtained. In situations where the school served significantly fewer grade levels than expected, the interviewer asked questions to determine if the anticipated grade range was covered by more than one school in the local community. These situations could arise due to an error in the source file or because the original sampled school split into two or more schools. Once the information for these additional schools was recorded, the CAPI instrument randomly selected one of the schools to participate in the survey. In those cases, the CAPI instrument was updated with the sampled school\u2019s information, and the interviewer proceeded to collect the principal name and email for the newly selected school. In situations where the reported grade range was significantly more than expected, the interviewer probed for a reason. For example, the source file may have been incorrect or the sample school may have merged with another school. In either instance, the school remained in sample for the SASS. If the grade range differed by no more than one grade at\neither end of the range (e.g., a school with grades 3-5 was reported as having grades 2\u20135), then the\ninterviewer recorded the new grade range of the school.\nIn previous SASS administrations, respondents reported that questionnaires or packages that are addressed to an individual rather than a title (e.g., School Principal) are more likely to reach the correct respondent, and therefore receive attention in a timely manner. As a final step, the interviewers obtained the principal\u2019s name and e-mail address for each school in sample.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 81\nQuestionnaire Mailings and Reminder Letters\nOn October 11, 2011, the Census Bureau\u2019s National Processing Center (NPC) mailed an introductory letter and the School District Questionnaire to 4,686 sampled school districts.11 Schools in one-school districts received the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) in lieu of the School District Questionnaire and School Questionnaire. The letter introduced the survey, informed the district that one or more schools in the district were selected to participate, and asked the district to complete and return the questionnaire within two weeks. The reverse side of the letter contained frequently asked questions, such as the purpose of SASS, the time estimate for participating, and the confidentiality and collection authority information. The packages were addressed to the contact person whose name had been provided in the district contact calling operation, or, if no name had been provided, to the \u201cDistrict Administrator.\u201d Eligible respondents for the School District Questionnaire included any knowledgeable school district employee. In some school districts, several staff members provided the data.\nDistricts who indicated that they were willing and able to provide electronic list(s) of teachers for their selected school(s) also received a letter that introduced the survey, explained the purpose of the teacher list, and provided instructions for uploading the file. A total of 4,102 districts were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers. In the majority (86 percent) of the districts, the contact person was the same for the School District Questionnaire and the teacher list. These individuals received one package containing a letter that provided the information for both the School District Questionnaire and the teacher list. The Evaluation of Methodology, Methods of Collecting Teacher Lists section provides more information on districts\u2019 response to the request for the electronic lists of teachers.\nThe NPC mailed reminder letters to contact persons who were responsible for the School District Questionnaire on October 31, 2011. On November 23, 2011, districts that had agreed to provide a teacher list for their selected school(s) but had not provided it were sent a letter thanking them for their assistance and informing them that the Census Bureau would be requesting the information from the selected school(s). On November 28, 2011, the NPC mailed a second copy of the School District Questionnaire to each school district that had not returned the original form. Another reminder letter was mailed on January 30, 2012.\nTelephone Nonresponse Follow-up of School Districts\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s Jeffersonville Telephone Center (JTC) conducted two telephone nonresponse follow-up operations for school districts. The first was primarily to follow-up with districts that agreed to provide an electronic list of teachers but had not yet responded. This follow-up operation occurred from October 24 to November 18, 2011. During this operation, telephone interviewers called the contact person whose name had been provided during the district contact calling operation, or, if that person was not available, they attempted to reach another district staff member who was able to provide a list of teachers. If the contact person for the electronic list of teachers was also responsible for completing the School District Questionnaire, the telephone interviewer reminded him or her to complete and return the questionnaire as well.\n11 Four dependent charter schools within two regular districts that contained only charter schools were included in the school sample. Due to operational error, the associated districts themselves were not sampled or mailed a District Questionnaire. In addition, there were 40 dependent charter schools sampled that were the only school sampled from their associated regular school district. Due to operational error, the associated districts were not mailed a District Questionnaire. These 42 districts were consequently classified as noninterviews on the Public School District data file.\n\n\f82\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTelephone nonresponse follow-up for school districts that had not returned the School District Questionnaire occurred from December 12, 2011 to January 13, 2012. During this operation, telephone interviewers called the contact person whose name had been provided during the district contact calling operation, or, if no name had been provided, they attempted to reach another knowledgeable respondent. A knowledgeable respondent was someone in the district office who was familiar with issues such as student enrollment, staff professional development, and teacher hiring. The purpose of the telephone nonresponse follow-up operation was to find out the status of School District Questionnaires that the Census Bureau had not received and to encourage district staff to participate. Interviewers were equipped with School District Questionnaires to use if the respondent indicated that he or she was willing to complete the questionnaire over the phone.\nField Nonresponse Follow-up for School Districts\nField nonresponse follow-up for school districts occurred from February 13 to March 30, 2012. During this operation, field representatives contacted the district contact person or a knowledgeable respondent by telephone or personal visit in order to determine the status of School District Questionnaires that the Census Bureau had not received and to encourage district staff to participate. Field representatives were given a labeled School District Questionnaire for each district they were assigned so that they could provide a replacement questionnaire if necessary. Field representatives encouraged district respondents to return their questionnaire by mail or made an appointment to pick up the completed questionnaire.\nAfter field nonresponse follow-up, the Census Bureau continued to accept complete questionnaires by mail through May 15, 2012.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 83\nOverview of School Data Collection\nThe NPC sent sampled schools an advance letter in June 2011 to identify cases with invalid addresses prior to the beginning of data collection. Data collection activities began in October 2011. These included:\n\u2022 mailing the initial package of school-level questionnaires12 and a letter with information for accessing the Control Center, instructions for completing the screener interview, and instructions for distributing the questionnaires to the appropriate school staff members;\n\u2022 telephoning the school and completing the screener interview to verify school information and establish a survey coordinator;\n\u2022 mailing a second package of outstanding school-level questionnaires to the survey coordinator, if one was established, or to the school principal;\n\u2022 sampling teachers from the Teacher Listing Form or electronic teacher list and mailing invitations to complete the Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire online;\n\u2022 mailing a letter to the survey coordinator asking them to remind teachers to complete their questionnaire;\n\u2022 telephoning the survey coordinators or individual respondents to remind them to complete and return the questionnaires;\n\u2022 mailing a reminder letter to teachers; \u2022 mailing a paper Teacher Listing Form (TLF) to schools whose districts agreed to provide the\nteacher list, but did not provide an electronic list of teachers; \u2022 mailing a letter to the survey coordinators thanking them for their assistance and informing them\nthat the individual survey respondents would be contacted; \u2022 mailing a reminder letter to principals who had not completed their Principal Questionnaire; \u2022 mailing a paper Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire to all teachers\nwho were initially invited to complete the questionnaire online; \u2022 telephoning the survey nonrespondents to attempt to complete the questionnaire over the\ntelephone; and \u2022 contacting nonrespondents by telephone calls or personal visits from field representatives.\nControl Center\nThe SASS Control Center is an internet application that the Census Bureau designed to serve many functions for sampled schools, school districts, and telephone interviewers. Each school and district received an individual username and password. District respondents were able to view a list of schools sampled in their district and upload their teacher list(s) (if applicable). School respondents were able to complete the screener interview and could upload their teacher list (if applicable). School respondents, district respondents, and interviewers could use the Control Center to view the status of questionnaires and request replacement questionnaires.\n12 School-level questionnaires included: Principal Questionnaire or Private School Principal Questionnaire; School Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, or Public School Questionnaire (With District Items); and the School Library Media Center Questionnaire (for public schools only). The Teacher Listing Form was included for private schools and for public schools in districts that did not agree to provide an electronic list of teachers.\n\n\f84\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nOverall Timing of School Data Collection\n\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS principal, school, school library media center, and teacher data were collected during the 2011\u201312 school year. Table 15 summarizes the specific data collection activities and the month(s) when each occurred. Details on the flow of cases into each follow-up operation and the response rates by questionnaire are presented later in this chapter.\n\nTable 15.

The letter briefly introduced the survey, alerted the principal that SASS would be conducted beginning in the fall, and asked the principal to contact the U.S. Census Bureau if their school\u2019s name and address were not correct. Name and address corrections received by telephone were applied to the sample file prior to the initial mailout. In addition, staff researched addresses and telephone numbers for schools that had their letters returned by the United States Postal Service (USPS) as undeliverable as addressed.\n\nThe NPC mailed the initial school packages to school principals on October 11, 2011 using USPS Priority Mail. The envelope\u2019s label included the NCES and SASS logos on the left-hand side. The package contained the following:\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 85\n\u2022 a letter to the principal that introduced the survey and requested that the principal designate a survey coordinator;\n\u2022 a CD-ROM of the Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2011; and \u2022 an envelope to give to the designated survey coordinator. This envelope contained:\no a letter to the survey coordinator that introduced the survey and provided instructions; o the Teacher Listing Form (TLF) (for all private schools and for public schools whose\ndistrict did not agree to provide the teacher list); o the School Questionnaire, Public School Questionnaire (With District Items), or Private\nSchool Questionnaire; o the Principal Questionnaire or Private School Principal Questionnaire; o the School Library Media Center Questionnaire (for public schools only); and o a pre-addressed, postage-paid return envelope for each questionnaire.\nThe NPC mailed a second package of school-level questionnaires to schools with one or more questionnaires outstanding on November 7, 2011. If a survey coordinator was established, the package was addressed to this person; otherwise, it was addressed to the school principal. These packages only contained questionnaires that the Census Bureau had not received. There were two versions of the cover letter that accompanied this package. The letter for the survey coordinator requested that the questionnaires be distributed to the appropriate staff, collected by the coordinator, and returned to the Census Bureau as soon as possible; the letter for the principal requested that the questionnaires be distributed to the appropriate staff to complete and return as soon as possible. Both the principal and coordinator letters provided the website, username, and password for the Control Center so that the recipient could check the status of their school\u2019s questionnaires. Amish and Mennonite schools received a third version of the letter that provided NCES\u2019 address in lieu of the Control Center information so that respondents could write with any questions about the survey.\nThe NPC mailed teacher invitations to complete the Teacher Questionnaire over the Internet on a weekly basis as teachers were sampled from the completed electronic teacher lists or paper Teacher Listing Forms. In schools where a survey coordinator was established, the Census Bureau conducted a test to determine the most effective distribution method for teacher invitations. For each weekly teacher sample, schools with a survey coordinator were split into two groups. In schools randomly assigned to treatment group 1, the survey coordinator received a letter that described the purpose of the Teacher Questionnaire and asked the coordinator to distribute the enclosed invitations to the selected teachers. In schools randomly assigned to treatment group 2, the survey coordinator received a letter that described the purpose of the Teacher Questionnaire and informed them that the invitations were sent directly to the selected teachers. In both groups, the letter asked the coordinator to follow-up with the teachers, whose names were listed on the back of the letter, to remind them to complete the internet questionnaire. In schools where a survey coordinator was not established, the NPC mailed the teacher invitations directly to the sampled teachers. In Amish and Mennonite schools, the NPC mailed a paper Private School Teacher Questionnaire directly to the selected teachers. The results of this test are discussed in the evaluation section of this chapter.\nThe NPC sent a letter and a paper Teacher Listing Form to schools in nonresponding districts that had been asked for an electronic teacher list on November 23, 2011. At the same time, their districts were sent a letter thanking them for their assistance with the survey and informing them that schools would be contacted directly for the teacher list.\nDuring the telephone reminder and non-response follow-up operations (discussed in detail in the next section), coordinators and individual respondents were able to request a replacement questionnaire if their previous questionnaire(s) had been misplaced, damaged, or not received. Coordinators and teachers could request a paper Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire for teachers who\n\n\f86\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\npreferred to complete a paper form instead of completing the internet questionnaire. The NPC mailed the replacement questionnaires within approximately 14 days of the request.\nThe NPC mailed a reminder letter to teachers who had not completed their internet questionnaire on January 17, 2012. The letter included instructions for completing the internet-based Teacher Questionnaire and told teachers that they could request a paper Teacher Questionnaire if they preferred. Teachers sampled for the Teacher Questionnaire after early January received the reminder letter approximately 10 days after their initial invitation. Teachers in Amish and Mennonite schools who had not completed their paper questionnaire were sent a letter reminding them to complete their questionnaire.\nThe NPC mailed a letter to survey coordinators in schools with one or more outstanding questionnaires on February 2, 2012. The letter thanked the survey coordinator for their help and alerted them that the U.S. Census Bureau would begin following-up with the individual survey respondents. At the same time, the NPC mailed a letter to principals who had not yet completed their Principal Questionnaire to remind them to complete and return their questionnaire. The NPC mailed a reminder letter and a paper Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire to teachers who had not completed their questionnaire online.\nOn March 19, 2012, the NPC sent a reminder package to all nonresponding teachers who were not sent a paper questionnaire in February. The package contained a reminder letter and a paper Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire. Teachers sampled after early March received a paper questionnaire approximately 10 days after they received the reminder letter. The initial package for teachers sampled after mid-April contained a letter with instructions to complete the internet-based questionnaire and a paper questionnaire, as the remaining time in the school year did not permit staggered mailings. The NPC sent these teacher packages via FedEx.\nSchools with only one questionnaire outstanding, excluding the Teacher Listing Form, were sent a reminder letter with the outstanding questionnaire instead of being included in the field nonresponse follow-up operation. If the outstanding questionnaire was a school-level questionnaire (Principal Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, or School Library Media Center Questionnaire), the NPC sent it via FedEx on March 27, 2012. If the outstanding questionnaire was a Teacher Questionnaire, the NPC sent it via FedEx on April 17, 2012.\nTelephone and Field Follow-up Operations\nTrained telephone interviewers and/or field representatives contacted survey coordinators and individual respondents during the data collection process. There were three telephone follow-up operations: the screener follow-up operation, the reminder operation, and the nonresponse follow-up operation. After the telephone follow-up operations, local Census Bureau field representatives contacted nonrespondents. Each follow-up operation is described in detail in the following sections.\nTelephone Screener Follow-up Operation\nThe screener interview served several purposes: it verified the school\u2019s name, address, school type, and grade range in order to determine if the school was in-scope for the SASS, verified that the respondent received the package of questionnaires, and established a survey coordinator. The letter included in the initial mailing requested that the principal or designated survey coordinator access the Control Center or call the Census Bureau to provide basic information about their school by completing the screener interview. The Census Bureau\u2019s Jeffersonville Telephone Center (JTC) in Jeffersonville, IN used the Control Center to conduct the screener operation. The JTC accepted incoming telephone calls in response to the letter, and then contacted schools from October 24 to November 11, 2011.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 87\nThe interviewer first verified the school\u2019s name and address, then asked if the expected school type (i.e., public or private) was correct. If the school\u2019s type was not as expected, the interviewer provided the respondent with six categories from which to choose: public, private, public charter, Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), homeschool, or only web-based instruction.13 Public charter schools were considered public schools; BIE, homeschools, and schools with only web-based instruction were out-of-scope for SASS. If the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d designation was incorrect, the school was out-of-scope for the SASS.\nNext, the interviewer verified the school\u2019s grade range to confirm that the school in question was the correct school. Since interviewers verified the grade ranges of public schools during the district contact calling operation, there was no sampling during the screener interview. If the grade range differed entirely or significantly from the expected grade range, then the interviewer followed the same procedures as in the district contact calling operation to determine whether the school had split into multiple schools or if multiple schools had merged into one school. In either instance, the school remained in-scope.\nIf the school met the out-of-scope criteria, then all of the questionnaires associated with the school were out-of-scope. If, on the other hand, the school was determined to be eligible for the survey, then the interviewer continued the screener interview with a series of questions to verify that the school received the package and to establish a survey coordinator. In cases where interviewers were unable to establish a survey coordinator, they attempted to establish a TLF contact person if the school was responsible for the TLF. The interviewer stressed the importance of returning the TLF as soon as possible.\nTelephone Reminder Operation\nThe JTC conducted the reminder operation from November 28, 2011, to February 3, 2012. Interviewers contacted all schools with one or more outstanding questionnaires. Interviewers spoke with the survey coordinator to determine the status of all outstanding questionnaires and to remind the coordinator to have the appropriate staff complete and return them as soon as possible. If a survey coordinator had not been established during the screener operation, interviewers contacted the principal. Interviewers began asking about the status of the Teacher Questionnaires approximately two weeks after the NPC mailed the initial letter inviting the teacher to complete the Teacher Questionnaire over the Internet. Interviewers used the Control Center to determine the status of the questionnaires and to submit paper questionnaire requests for teachers and re-mail requests for other respondents who needed replacement questionnaires. Interviewers recorded the status of questionnaires (e.g., respondent will mail, respondent has mailed, etc.) on paper call logs after each contact.\nTelephone Nonresponse Follow-up Operation\nThe JTC conducted the telephone nonresponse follow-up operation from February 13 to March 16, 2012. Interviewers used the Control Center to determine which questionnaires had not been completed. Interviewers attempted to contact the individual survey respondents14 to complete the appropriate questionnaire over the telephone. Interviewers used the Internet Teacher Questionnaire to complete the Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire; all other forms were completed on\n13 Definitions of school types are provided in \u201cAppendix A. Key Terms for SASS.\u201d Homeschools are not included in SASS. Organizations or institutions that provide support for homeschooling but do not offer classroom instruction for students also are not included. 14 Interviewers tried to speak with the library media specialist or librarian for the School Library Media Center Questionnaire; the principal for the Principal Questionnaire or Private School Principal Questionnaire; a knowledgeable respondent for the School Questionnaire, Private School Questionnaire, or Public School Questionnaire (With District Items); and the sampled teacher for the Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire.\n\n\f88\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\ntelephone versions of the paper questionnaires. Interviewers documented the outcome of each telephone call on paper call logs.\nField Nonresponse Follow-up Operations\nThe field nonresponse follow-up operation occurred from March 26 to June 1, 2012. Schools were included in this operation if the Teacher Listing Form (TLF) was outstanding or if there were two or more school-level or teacher questionnaires outstanding. During the first three and a half weeks of field followup, schools with outstanding TLFs were the highest priority for field representatives. Schools that had completed the TLF and had only one school-level or teacher questionnaire outstanding were sent the remaining questionnaire by FedEx in lieu of field follow-up.\nDuring the field nonresponse follow-up operation, trained field representatives contacted survey coordinators and individual respondents via telephone calls and/or personal visits to determine the status of all outstanding questionnaires and to urge the respondents to participate. Field representatives received a package of labeled questionnaires for each school in their workload so that they could provide replacement questionnaires if respondents had not received, had misplaced, or had damaged their questionnaires. Field representatives made additional contacts via telephone calls and/or personal visits to obtain completed questionnaires or to verify that the respondent returned the questionnaire by mail. Each time field representatives contacted a respondent they updated the outcome code for the appropriate questionnaire(s) and entered any applicable notes in the case management system on their laptop computer.\nThere was a staggered closeout schedule for the different questionnaire types during the field nonresponse follow-up operation. The closeout for TLFs was originally scheduled for April 6, 2012; however, due to a low completion rate, follow-up was extended until April 18, 2012. Follow-up on the Private School Questionnaires concluded on April 27, 2012. Follow-up on all other school-level questionnaires concluded on May 4, 2012. Follow-up on the Teacher Questionnaires continued until June 1, 2012. Completed Teacher Questionnaires were accepted through June 22, 2012.\nAccepting Refusals\nPrior to the initial mail-out, the Census Bureau applied to some school districts to conduct SASS in their schools (as discussed earlier in this chapter). If the school district denied permission for their schools to participate, Census Bureau staff classified the schools as \u2018District Refusals\u2019 and those schools were not contacted. Other school districts refused on behalf of their school(s) during the course of data collection. These refusals were classified as \u2018District Refusals\u2019 and the Census Bureau ceased data collection activities for these schools.15\nThe Census Bureau contacted nonrespondents by mail, telephone, and personal visits. During these follow-up efforts, some school staff members expressed that they or their school did not wish to participate in the survey. Respondents who refused by mail were contacted by telephone or field staff to try to determine the reason they were reluctant to participate and respond to their concerns. Respondents who refused by telephone were removed from the telephone operation. Many respondents said that they are too busy or do not have the time to complete their questionnaire; therefore, telephone interviewers or field representatives contacted the respondents in later follow-up operations in case they were then able to complete the survey. Respondents from both schools and their districts were only classified as \u2018Hard\n\n15 If a school district refused during data collection, but some of the related school and/or teacher questionnaires had already been completed and returned by respondents, these interviews were not discarded due to district refusal.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 89\n\nRefusals\u2019 and not contacted again if they adamantly refused either by using a strong tone or words, contacted NCES directly, or sent a strong e-mail to Census Bureau headquarters staff.\n\nResponse Rates\n\nTable 16 shows the unweighted response rates of each questionnaire by month. These rates differ from the unweighted final response rates as those were determined after the data were edited and completeness checks were performed.\n\nTable 16.

The total teacher sample was drawn by 5/15/12;\n\ntherefore, response rates beginning on 6/5/12 reflect the response rate for all sampled teachers.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), \u201cSchool\n\nControl Database,\u201d 2011\u201312.\n\nEvaluation of Methodology\nAs noted, the 2011\u201312 SASS utilized a primarily mail-based data collection strategy with telephone and field follow-up operations. There were elements of the data collection methodology that were successful as well as elements that had a few glitches that either need to be improved upon or completely rethought. The following sections discuss these elements.\n\n\f90\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nControl Center\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS methodology incorporated the use of an internet application called the Control Center, which allowed both respondents and telephone interviewers to review the status of questionnaires, complete the screener interview, and request replacement questionnaires. The Control Center also allowed the appropriate respondent (school or district) to provide an electronic list of teachers securely. Overall, the Control Center worked well; however, some features need to be improved.\nThe Control Center permitted school principals, survey coordinators, and telephone interviewers to view the status of each questionnaire. In prior administrations of the SASS, reminder letters to the survey coordinator stated that one or more questionnaires were outstanding. The missing questionnaires were not listed due to the time that lapses between when letter preparations begin and when respondents receive the letters. For the 2011\u201312 SASS, reminder letters to the survey coordinator asked them to login to the Control Center to see the up-to-date status of their school\u2019s questionnaires. For the most part, this feature worked as intended and was helpful for respondents. One issue that staff should address for the next SASS is the amount of time between when teachers are sampled and when the Teacher Questionnaires are added to the list of questionnaires in the Control Center. Teachers were added as soon as they were sampled, which was approximately two weeks before their initial invitations were prepared and mailed. This caused some survey coordinators and interviewers to request paper questionnaires for teachers before the NPC mailed their initial invitation to complete the internet questionnaire. The Census Bureau recommends that the Control Center be used to provide the up-to-date status of questionnaires to school staff and telephone interviewers, but that teachers not be added to the Control Center until one week after their initial invitation is mailed.\nThe initial letter sent to school principals and survey coordinators asked them to provide basic information about their school by completing the screener interview through the Control Center. The screener interview is used to verify the school\u2019s address, ensure that the school is in-scope for the SASS, and establish a survey coordinator. By having a self-screening option through the Control Center, respondents could complete the interview at a time that was convenient for them. This feature also reduced the number of schools that the telephone interviewers needed to contact during the screener follow-up operation, therefore reducing data collection costs. Approximately 1,450 schools completed the screener interview through the Control Center before the screener follow-up operation began. The Census Bureau recommends that future iterations of SASS use the Control Center to allow school staff to complete the screener interview online.\nThe feature of the Control Center that allowed respondents to request replacement questionnaires worked well, but the turn-around time for mailing out the questionnaire(s) needs to be reduced. Census Bureau staff process replacement questionnaire requests weekly and the NPC mailed the questionnaires the following week. During this time, the telephone center interviewers were still making follow-up calls to respondents that had requested questionnaires but had not received their replacement yet. The Census Bureau recommends that the turnaround time be shortened with a suspension of follow-up calls to allow ample time for the respondent to receive the questionnaire before follow-up calls resume.\nThe Control Center included a feature that allowed the appropriate respondent (school or district) to provide an electronic list of teachers over a secure server. This feature worked as intended; however, early in the data collection, check-in staff encountered challenges with correctly checking in the electronic lists that districts provided. This caused significant delays in processing the teacher lists and getting the teacher questionnaires to the teachers in a timely manner. The Census Bureau recommends that electronic lists of teachers be requested primarily from schools; if electronic lists are requested from districts, a new procedure for checking in the lists needs to be developed and tested.\n\n\fChapter 5. Data Collection 91\nMethods of Collecting Teacher Lists\nThe Teacher Listing Form (TLF) response rate was a concern throughout the entire data collection period. The final unweighted response rate was 9.5 percentage points lower for public schools and 13.0 percentage points lower for private schools than it was in the 2007\u201308 SASS.\nThere are a couple of possible reasons that the response rate for the TLF was lower during the 2011\u201312 SASS than it was in the 2007\u201308 SASS. One possible reason is that the Census Bureau requested electronic teacher lists from school districts. This methodological change was introduced in an attempt to reduce the response burden on public schools and collect a higher percentage of teacher lists early in the school year. Collecting the majority of teacher lists early in data collection is important so that teacher invitations can be mailed, allowing teachers sufficient time to complete their questionnaire. A large percentage of districts indicated that they could provide an electronic list of teachers; however, less than half of these districts (approximately 46 percent) provided the list(s). The majority of the teacher lists received for public schools were provided by the school, either by completing the paper TLF or submitting an electronic list of teachers. Districts provided 39.6 percent of the total lists received whereas schools provided 60.4 percent. Schools in districts that agreed to provide a list of teachers but did not provide it by mid-November were asked to complete the paper TLF; however, these schools did not receive the request until late November, which reduced the amount of time available to collect the list from the school.\nThe lower response rates may also be the result of eliminating a separate field follow-up operation for the TLF. During the 2007\u201308 SASS, a TLF field follow-up operation was conducted in late fall. During this operation, the 2007\u201308 unweighted response rate for public school TLFs increased by 29.9 percentage points, resulting in an unweighted response rate of 83.0 percent, which was close to the final unweighted response rates of 86.7 percent. The unweighted response rate for private school TLFs increased by 26.9 percentage points, resulting in an unweighted response rate of 80.5 percent, which was close to the final unweighted response rate of 83.3 percent. The 2011\u201312 SASS omitted this TLF field follow-up operation under the assumption that the larger school districts would providing the teacher lists for many schools, resulting in a sufficient response rate early on in data collection. Due to the continued low response rate, schools from which a teacher list had not been received were identified as the highest priority at the beginning of the Field Follow-up operation and the time-frame during which teacher lists were accepted was extended an additional one and a half weeks.\nThe Census Bureau recommends that the earlier TLF field follow-up operation be reinstated so that the majority of TLFs can be collected in the fall and invitations can be sent to teachers. The Census Bureau also recommends that electronic teacher lists should be requested only from schools rather than from districts in order to ensure accurate processing of lists received. Finally, the Census Bureau recommends the consideration of additional methods of collecting lists of teachers, such as accepting schools\u2019 websites as a source to create a teacher list. Late in the data collection, many schools reported that their website includes a list of their teachers. While the Census Bureau was aware that teachers were often listed on school websites, this information was not being used because it is unknown whether the teacher information is current and the school has not consented to the use of their website for obtaining a teacher list. Since the TLF response rate was still low when the field non-response follow-up began, the Census Bureau implemented a new procedure allowing school websites to be used as a source for obtaining the teacher list. The field representatives were instructed to collect the URL that contained the teacher names and the contact information of the person who gave permission to use the website as the source. Field representatives were successful in obtaining 179 websites.\n\n\f92\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nInternet Teacher Questionnaires\nAnother innovation for the 2011\u201312 SASS was that the Teacher Questionnaire and the Private School Teacher Questionnaire were available online. Approximately 46 percent of sampled public school teachers and 31 percent of sampled private school teachers completed their survey online. Invitation letters were initially mailed asking sampled teachers to complete the survey online. Paper questionnaires were only initially sent to teachers in Amish or Mennonite schools. Paper questionnaires could be requested through the Control Center and were mailed to non-responding teachers later in the data collection process. It is recommended that use of the online questionnaire be continued for future rounds of SASS.\nGuidelines for Accepting Refusals to Participate\nIn this and previous iterations of SASS, determining when to accept a case as a refusal has not been clearcut. The entire data collection period lasts nine months, which often leads to some respondents feeling harassed. On numerous occasions, respondents have had to refuse multiple times in order to be removed from the survey. Census Bureau headquarters staff coded cases as refusals when the situation warranted. It is recommended that respondents be coded-out as a refusal if they still refuse after one conversion attempt. This will reduce incidents where respondents feel harassed and decrease follow-up costs; however, the noninterview rate may be higher earlier in the data collection process.\nTeacher Invitation Packaging\nWhile planning for the 2011\u201312 SASS, Census Bureau staff wondered whether asking the survey coordinator at the school to distribute the invitations for the Teacher Questionnaire or Private School Teacher Questionnaire to sampled teachers would result in a higher response rate than sending the invitations directly to the teachers. Two treatment groups were established:\n\u2022 Treatment group 1\u2014Teacher invitations to complete the survey over the Internet were mailed to the survey coordinator. The package included a letter to the coordinator asking the coordinator to deliver the invitations to the sampled teachers and remind the teachers to complete their survey.\n\u2022 Treatment group 2\u2014Teacher invitations to complete the survey over the Internet were mailed directly to the sampled teachers. The coordinator received a separate letter informing them that the Census Bureau sent the invitations to the teachers and asking them to remind the teachers to complete their survey.\nSchools with survey coordinators were randomly assigned to a treatment group after teachers were sampled. Treatment group 1 included 24,781 teachers; treatment group 2 included 24,731 teachers. The response rate for teachers in treatment group 1 was slightly higher than the response rate for teachers in treatment group 2 (80.9 percent and 77.8 percent, respectively). It is recommended that teacher invitations be sent to the survey coordinator.\n\n\f93\nChapter 6. Response Rates\nThis chapter presents the survey response rates for the 2011\u201312 SASS. First, the unit response rates are presented in detail. Next, the item response rates for each survey type are summarized. Following these sections, the nonresponse bias analyses that were conducted on both the unit and the items for this SASS are described, and major findings are presented.\nSurvey Response Rates\nUnit response rates are the rate at which the sampled units respond by substantially completing the questionnaire. Unit response rates can be calculated as unweighted or weighted. The unweighted response rates are the number of interviewed sampled units divided by the number of eligible (in-scope) sampled units, which include respondents plus nonrespondents but not ineligible (out-of-scope) units. The weighted response rates are the basic-weighted number of interviewed cases divided by the basicweighted number of eligible cases. See chapter 8 for further discussion of the weighting.\nThe unweighted, weighted, and weighted overall (across all stages of selection, in the case of teachers) response rates for each data file and the Teacher Listing Forms are listed in table 17. The geographic variation in response rates can be examined by looking at each state's response rate. Table 18 provides public school response rates by state for districts, schools, principals, teachers, and school library media centers. Table 19 provides private school response rates by private school affiliation for schools, principals, and teachers. The unweighted response rates provide a general indication of the success of the data collection effort while the weighted response rates provide a measure of the quality of the data and the potential for nonresponse bias.\n\n\f94\n\nDocumentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 17.

Response Rates\n\n99\n\nItem Response Rates\n\nItem response rates indicate the percentage of respondents that answered a given survey question, or item. Weighted item response rates are produced by dividing the number of sampled cases responding to an item by the number of sampled cases eligible to answer the item and adjusted by either the basic or final weight. The final weight for each sampled unit is the base weight adjusted for unit nonresponse and then ratio adjusted to the frame total. See chapter 8 for further discussion of the weighting.\n\nFor most items, a counted response is any item that is not missing and the value of the associated imputation flag is 0. See chapter 7 for detailed information on imputations.\n\nFor the SASS, the basic weighted item response rates ranged from 57.4 percent to 100 percent, and the final-weighted item response rates ranged from 53.4 percent to 100 percent. For all eight SASS data files, between 93.8 and 100 percent of the items had a base-weighted response rate of 85 percent or higher, and between 92.4 and 98.9 percent of the items had a final-weighted response rate of 85 percent or higher.\n\nTable 20 provides a brief summary of the basic weighted item response rates, and exhibit 4 provides information about the SASS items that have a base-weighted response rate below 70 percent. Similarly, Table 21 provides a brief summary of the final-weighted item response rates, and exhibit 5 provides information about the SASS items that have a final-weighted response rate below 70 percent.\nTable 20.

Response Rates\n\n101\n\nNonresponse Bias Analysis\n\nA comprehensive nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the 2011\u201312 SASS. The analysis evaluated the extent of potential bias introduced by nonresponse at both unit and item levels, and the extent to which noninterview weighting adjustments mitigated bias at the unit level.\n\nUnit-Level Nonresponse Overview of Methodology\n\nBecause NCES Statistical Standard 4-4 requires analysis of unit nonresponse bias for any survey stage with a base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent, both 2011\u201312 SASS teacher data files were evaluated for potential bias. Comparisons between the frame and respondent populations were made before and after the noninterview weighting adjustments were applied in order to evaluate the extent to which the adjustments reduced or eliminated nonresponse bias. The following section explains the methodology and summarizes the conclusions.\n\nAs outlined in appendix B of the NCES Statistical Standards (U.S. Department of Education 2003), the degree of nonresponse bias is a function of two factors: the nonresponse rate and how much the respondents and nonrespondents differ on survey variables of interest. The mathematical formulation to estimate bias for a sample mean of variable y is as follows:\n\nB(yR ) =\n\nyR\n\n\u2212\n\nyT\n\n=\n\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb\n\nnM nT\n\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f6( y R\n\uf8f8\n\n\u2212\n\nyM\n\n)\n\nwhere\n\nyT = the estimated mean based on all eligible sample cases\n\nyR = the estimated mean based only on respondent cases\n\nyM = the estimated mean based only on nonrespondent cases nT = the estimated number of cases (i.e., nT = nR + nM )\n\nnM = the estimated number of nonrespondents\n\nnR = the estimated number of respondents\n\nA variable-free estimate of the bias, referred to as a relative bias, was used to compare biases across all\n\nvariables included in the analysis. The relative bias for an estimated mean using only the respondent data,\n\nyR , is calculated using the following formula:\n\nRelB\n\n(\n\nyR\n\n)\n\n=\n\nB\n\n( yR\nyR\n\n)\n\nRelative bias was estimated for variables known for respondents and nonrespondents. There are a number\n\nof variables available for each data file from the 2011\u201312 SASS sampling frames. The variables used are\n\npresented in exhibit 6.\n\n\f102 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit 6.

Response Rates\n\n103\n\nThe following steps were followed to compute the relative bias. First, the nonresponse bias was estimated and tested to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level. Second, noninterview adjustments were computed, and the variables listed above were included in the nonresponse models. The noninterview adjustments, which are included in the weights (see chapter 7 for more detail), were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate unit nonresponse bias for variables included in the models. Third, after the weights were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias. For this comparison, nonresponse bias was calculated as the difference between the base-weighted sample mean and the nonresponse-adjusted respondent mean, which evaluates the effectiveness of each noninterview adjustment in mitigating nonresponse bias. Sample units found to be ineligible for SASS were excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe tables included in this chapter outline the summary statistics of the bias analysis findings for each questionnaire by sector.

For all respondents, 32 percent of the variable categories at the national level and 5 percent of affiliation estimates were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments. After the adjustments, none of the categories at the national level or of the affiliation estimates were significantly biased. Table 48 reveals that for national estimates, bias was substantially reduced for most items while some affiliation-level estimates showed some bias even as their significance was reduced. In particular, estimates of Jewish schools remained severely biased after weighting, with the mean relative bias above 25 percent. Estimates from the area frame remained moderately biased after weighting, with the mean relative bias in the range of 10 to 25 percent.

For all respondents, 26 percent of the variable categories at the national level and 5 percent of affiliation estimates were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments. After the adjustments, 2 percent of categories at the national level and 2 percent of affiliation estimates were significantly biased. Table 51 reveals that for national estimates, bias was substantially reduced for most items while some affiliation-level estimates remained biased. In particular, estimates of Jewish, Lutheran, and area frame schools remained moderately biased after weighting, with the mean relative bias in the range of 10 to 25 percent.

Response Rates\n\n117\n\nAdditional Bias Analysis for Public School Teachers\u2014Cities\n\nDue to the low response rate for public school teachers located in cities, additional bias analysis was conducted for teachers with a locale code of city. Public school city teachers had a teacher listing form response rate of 68.0 percent and a teacher response rate of 71.8 percent, for an overall response rate of 48.8 percent. This low response rate prompted the need for additional bias analysis.\n\nTo conduct the additional unit nonresponse bias analysis, first the same comparison as had been conducted for all public school teachers was conducted for city public school teachers in isolation. Second, some key estimates were analyzed cross-tabulated by city size. Last, key estimates were crosstabulated by grade level.\n\nTables 52 through 63 contain summary statistics of the findings. Tables 52 through 57 apply to the teacher listing form. Tables 58 through 63 apply to teachers from schools which provided teacher listing forms.\n\nTable 52.

For city teacher national items, 70 percent of variable categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments, and 28 percent after adjustments. For cross-tabulated items by city size, 100 percent of large city categories, 23 percent of midsize city categories, and 15 percent of small city categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments. After adjustment, 85, 54, and 100 percent of variable categories were significantly biased. For cross-tabulated items by grade level, 67 percent of primary school, 78 percent of middle and high school categories, and 11 percent of combined school categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments. After adjustment, 11 percent of combined and high school and no primary and middle school categories were\n\n\f120 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nsignificantly biased. The overall conclusion is that weighting adjustments substantially reduced nonresponse bias for national city item categories as well as for categories by grade level. With regard to city size, bias was reduced slightly, but not eliminated, for large cities, and increased substantially for midsized and small cities. For this reason, data users should avoid analyzing city public school teachers by city size.\n\nTable 58.

For city teacher national items, 43 percent of variable categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments, and 5 percent after adjustments. For cross-tabulated items by city size, 76 percent of large city categories, 6 percent of midsize city categories, and 18 percent of small city categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments. After adjustment, 24, 12, and 6 percent of variable categories were significantly biased. For cross-tabulated items by grade level, 25 percent of primary and middle school categories, 50 percent of high school categories, and 38 percent of combined school categories were significantly biased before nonresponse weighting adjustments. After adjustment, 13 percent of primary and high school and no middle school and combined school categories\n\n\fChapter 6. Response Rates\n\n123\n\nwere significantly biased. The overall conclusion is that weighting adjustments substantially reduced nonresponse bias for national city item categories as well as for categories by grade level. With regard to city size, bias was reduced but not eliminated for large cities, increased for midsized cities, and was substantially reduced for small cities. For this reason, data users should avoid analyzing city public school teachers by city size.\nItem-Level Nonresponse\nOverview of Methodology\nThe item bias analysis examined the overall response rate for each item on all SASS data files. The analysis included examining the item response rates by the characteristics listed in exhibit 7 below, using the final weight for all in-scope sampled units. If the overall response rate for the item fell below 70 percent, the item will be footnoted in NCES publications with \u201cItem response rate fell below 70 percent\u201d as a method of cautioning the user that the low item response rate introduces some potential for bias in the imputation procedure. For any characteristic where the item response rate was less than 85 percent, a more detailed analysis was done by the characteristics listed in exhibit 7.

Data Processing\nData processing includes all activities related to the management of the sampled cases and their outcomes and those activities involved in capturing, transmitting, and editing the data provided by the respondents. As a result, the very first data processing step is to assign an appropriate outcome code for each case. Given the various ways respondents could have provided the survey information (e.g., paper questionnaire, telephone, internet questionnaire, in-person interview), the Census Bureau also had to use a variety of methods to assign the appropriate outcome code for each questionnaire.\nAll paper questionnaires that were received in Jeffersonville, Indiana were transmitted to the Census Bureau clerical processing staff who assigned a check-in code using the Automatic Tracking and Control (ATAC) system. The data from completed paper questionnaires were captured (converted from paper to electronic format) and sent to Census Bureau analysts in weekly waves of reformatted SAS datasets, by questionnaire type. The data from the SASS teacher questionnaires completed on the Internet were retrieved daily from the instrument by Census Bureau programming staff and assigned a check-in code (\u201cnet code\u201d) based on the items completed by the respondent. These data were combined with the reformatted paper questionnaire data into SAS datasets for data review, and a status code was assigned to each record based upon its ATAC code or net code. Field Representatives (FRs) used the Census Bureau\u2019s Case Management system to track cases in their workload as well as assign an outcome code indicating the status (e.g., unable to contact, refusal, out of scope, etc.) of each questionnaire.\nData processing procedures were created specifically for each type of questionnaire: public school, private school, school district, public school principal, private school principal, public school teacher, private school teacher, and library media center. Data were not mixed across these types, with one exception. The Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) (SASS-3Y) included questions for the school district and the school. Therefore, during processing, the data from the SASS-3Y were split from each other and combined with the School Questionnaire (SASS-3A) or the School District Questionnaire (SASS-1A) as appropriate. This change was made early in the data reformatting stage of data processing so that data from the SASS-3Y were not processed independently.\nAside from the exception noted above, each file contained data from a single questionnaire type. Although the files had different details, the editing and imputation processes followed the same structure. Once the data from all the different collection mechanisms were combined into SAS data sets with their status codes, Census Bureau analysts began the data editing/review process by assigning a preliminary interview status code. Once the preliminary interview status code was assigned, the analysts ran the data file through a series of computer edits to identify inconsistencies, assign a final interview status to each case, and impute items that were still \u201cnot-answered\u201d after taking into account item responses that were blank due to a questionnaire skip pattern. Once all of the \u201cnot-answered\u201d items were imputed during the imputation stage and analysts had reviewed all data, the final data release files were prepared. These data files are the source files for the documentation files and restricted-use files.\nQuestionnaire Check-in\nCheck-in of Paper Questionnaires\nRespondents were encouraged to complete and mail back all forms sent to the school or school district. Questionnaires received by the National Processing Center (NPC) were immediately checked into the ATAC system by clerical staff. At this stage, questionnaires received an outcome code of complete if any items on the questionnaire were answered. Additional outcome codes that were set included refusals,\n\n\f128 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nblanks, duplicates, Undeliverable as Addressed (UAA), and various out-of-scope codes.16 The questionnaires were then grouped into batches by questionnaire type and interview status (i.e., completes, noninterviews, and out-of-scope for the survey), and those classified as \u201ccomplete\u201d were sent on for data capture. These outcome codes assigned during check-in were later used to determine the status code of each case.\nFor cases that did not mail in the paper questionnaire during the initial phase of data collection, the Census Bureau had two follow-up operations. One was a telephone call operation and the other was an inperson visit by a field representative (FR). The aim of both of these operations was to encourage the respondent to complete the paper questionnaire. All paper questionnaires received by NPC during these operations were checked-in as described above.\nSome of the cases that went through the telephone follow-up data collection process completed the questionnaire over the phone with the Telephone Center (TC) interviewers. In these later phases, the telephone centers used a modified ATAC system, along with an internal paper system, to track the telephone interview questionnaires.\nIf a questionnaire was still outstanding following telephone follow-up, the case was sent to Field. FRs had discretion over the method by which respondents returned their forms. The FR could arrange to pick up completed questionnaires at the school or could provide postage-paid envelopes for the schools to mail their completed questionnaires to the NPC. If the FR picked up the completed questionnaires at the school, he or she would then send the forms to NPC.\nQuestionnaires completed over the phone or picked up by an FR were grouped into batches of 100 by questionnaire type and shipped to the clerical processing staff at the NPC for ATAC check-in and data keying.\nThe Regional Office Survey Control (ROSCO) system was not used for the school district questionnaires (SASS-1A). These questionnaires were tracked by the Jeffersonville TC (JTC) and the various regional offices (ROs) manually, using a specially designed series of spreadsheets. When the school district questionnaires were mailed to the NPC, they were checked in using the ATAC system.\nCheck-in of Internet Questionnaires\nApproximately 66 percent of teachers who completed a SASS public or private school teacher questionnaire completed the internet version of the questionnaire. Data from the SASS teacher questionnaires completed on the Internet were retrieved daily from the instrument by Census Bureau programming staff and assigned a check-in code (\u201cnet code\u201d) based on the items completed by the respondent; this net code, along with the ATAC outcome code discussed above, was later used to determine the status code of each teacher record.\n16 The following out-of-scope codes apply to all SASS questionnaire types: school/district closed, not a school/district, closed and may open later, temporarily without students, and duplicate school in sample. The following out-of-scope codes apply to all SASS questionnaire types except the District Questionnaire: wrong grade range, and school wrongly classified. The following out-of-scope codes apply only to the SASS teacher questionnaires: teacher never worked at this school, teacher no longer works at this school, not a teacher/does not teach a regularly scheduled class, teacher deceased, and teacher moved outside of the United States. The following out-of-scope code applies only to the SASS principal questionnaires: no principal/headmaster/school director. The following out-of-scope code applies only to the SASS Library Media Center Questionnaire: no library media center.\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 129\nThe internet instrument was programmed so that internet respondents could not skip over critical items (those items that must be answered in order for a questionnaire to be considered complete). On the last screen of the internet questionnaire, the respondent was given the option to submit the completed questionnaire. The internet questionnaires were assigned a check-in code of complete as long as the respondent completed all of the critical items plus ten percent of the remaining items and successfully submitted the completed survey. All other situations where the respondent accessed the instrument but did not complete the questionnaire were considered to be partially complete and were assigned an interview status code during the preliminary and final interview status recode (ISR) stages of data processing that was dependent upon which items the respondent did or did not answer. For further information about the preliminary and final ISR classification, refer to the Data Review section of this chapter.\nData Capture and Imaging\nData Capture of Paper Questionnaires\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS paper questionnaire data were captured using a combination of manual data keying and imaging technology, both of which were facilitated by the Integrated Computer Assisted Data Entry (iCADE) system. The first step in the iCADE system is imaging. The images are then used as the source for electronic data capture, manual keying, and analyst data review.\nWhen the SASS paper questionnaires were received and checked-in by the Census Bureau clerical processing staff as \u201ccomplete\u201d (i.e., any items on the questionnaire were answered), they were entered into the iCADE system for control purposes and grouped into batches by questionnaire type for data capture and imaging. The batches of questionnaires were disassembled using a guillotine, and each duplex page was scanned. At the conclusion of the scanning process, the iCADE system matched the number of imaged pages with the number of pages expected for each questionnaire type. If there was a discrepancy between the images scanned and the number of pages expected, a series of screens was presented to clerical staff, enabling a clerk or supervisor either to accept the batch as it was or to pull it from processing until the issue was resolved.\nThe batches that were accepted after the scanning process were sent to the next stages of data capture: auto registration, Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), and manual registration. During auto registration, all of the scanned images were read into the server by their barcodes, which then identified each page in the batch. Once the pages were identified, the OMR server could then read and recognize the presence of answer marks in the boxes next to pre-coded, categorical items. The OMR server was programmed with the locations of the answer boxes for pre-coded items prior to data capture. The program automatically entered the appropriate data into the OMR script file for that questionnaire.\nThe automated processes (registration and OMR) were not able to complete every paper questionnaire. Certain circumstances could cause them to fail. For example, an unreadable barcode or a checkbox ambiguity would be flagged by the program for intervention. Batches that could not be completed in the automated processes were directed to a manual registration phase of data capture. This process included showing the images to clerical staff, enabling a clerk or supervisor to resolve the issue by manual repair.\nThe next stage of data capture was a data quality check of the OMR responses, referred to as the Optical Mark Analysis (OMA) Sample Verification. During this check, a percentage of blank OMR fields and nonblank OMR fields were sampled so that clerks could verify the output from OMR and all sampled fields were added to an OMA data file. This OMA data file was then sent to a verification clerk who\n\n\f130 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nverified the validity of the OMA output. The verification clerk was presented with an image of the sample fields and was instructed to enter the response (if any) that he or she found in each field.\nThe OMA process included the computation of error rates for both the blank and nonblank fields. An error occurred when the clerk\u2019s field verification differed from the OMR recognition. When differences were found, the batch sample was forwarded to a second clerk, an Adjudicator, who was then required to provide an interpretation of the marks with differences. When the Adjudicator had made a decision and the data had been adjusted if necessary, the batch was marked as finished and was then checked for batch completeness.\nOnce all of the OMR data were captured correctly and verified as necessary, all write-in fields (e.g., openended, numeric, and character fields) were captured by a process called Key from Image (KFI). First, the server was programmed with the location of expected answer marks for items that were not precoded. Then, clerical staff, called keyers, viewed the write-in fields and manually typed (keyed) the data present in the field or entered a code to indicate the field was blank.\nThe next stage of data capture was a data quality check of the KFI responses, referred to as Analyze KFI. During this check, a percentage of non-blank KFI fields were sampled so that clerks could verify the output. A random number was generated at the starting point for non-blank fields within a batch. Then, the system began at the randomly generated number and took every X\u2019th field for the non-blank fields and all sampled fields were added to a KFI data file. This KFI data file was then sent to a verification clerk who would verify the validity of the KFI output. The verification clerk was presented with an image of the sample fields and was instructed to enter the response, if any, that he or she found in each field. This clerk was not provided with the data entered by the original keyer.\nThe system compared the KFI entry from the first entry and the verification entry. The fields with differences were flagged in the KFI script file. In addition, the system computed error rates for the nonblank fields. An error occurred when the clerk\u2019s field verification differed from the original KFI entry. Errors were classified into a number of categories, based upon the keying error situation.\nFor these cases where there was a difference, the batch KFI script file was forwarded to a third clerk, an Adjudicator, who was required to provide an interpretation of the marks with differences. The Adjudicator could 1) agree with the keyer, 2) agree with the verifier, or 3) provide his or her own interpretation of the respondent\u2019s answer. The Adjudicator then classified the error into a number of categories based on the keying error situation; this classification served as the final classification. Once the Adjudicator had made a decision and the data had been adjusted if necessary, the batch was marked as finished and released to Census Bureau analysts.\nData Capture of the Teacher Internet Questionnaires\nData collected in the teacher internet instrument did not go through a separate data capture operation. Internet response data were saved by the system in electronic format, so they did not require a data capture process.\nReformatting\nAfter SASS questionnaire data were captured and transmitted (or just transmitted in the case of the internet questionnaire), the resulting output files of raw data were reformatted into SAS datasets in order to facilitate the remaining data processing. Once the waves of output files were reformatted, they were sent to Census Bureau analysts weekly for data review.\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 131\nOnce the reformatted SAS datasets for the data collected on the Public School Questionnaire (With District Items) (SASS-3Y) were created, some additional reformatting steps were required. The SASS-3Y was distributed to the following types of schools:\n\u2022 school district institutions with only one school; \u2022 public charter schools operating within regular public school districts; \u2022 public charter schools operating within school districts only containing charter schools; \u2022 independent charter schools that are not affiliated with regular school districts; and \u2022 state-run schools.\nThe SASS-3Y included items from both the School Questionnaire and the School District Questionnaire. This questionnaire was specifically designed for schools with no known school district or schools which function as the district.17 Therefore, district-level data were collected on either the SASS-3Y or the School District Questionnaire (SASS-1A).18 Likewise, public school-level data were collected on either the SASS-3Y or the Public School Questionnaire (SASS-3A).\nFollowing the reformat of the 1A, 3A, and 3Y data, the school district items that appeared on the 3Y questionnaire were split out from the 3Y data file and included with data from the School District Questionnaire. The school items that appeared on the 3Y questionnaire were split out from the 3Y data file and were included with data from the Public School Questionnaire. Data remained on these files throughout all stages of data processing, until the final files were created.\nData Review\nThe overall goal of the data review process was to make sure that the final datasets contained clean, accurate data and that there were no \u201cnot answered\u201d (.n) items on any questionnaire records in the final data files. Each phase of processing had an associated review of the data where analysts looked at the frequencies data, source code by source code (or groups of source codes, as necessary) in order to observe the changes that occurred in the data throughout the different stages of data processing. These data processing steps, which are outlined and discussed further in this document, include: a preliminary interview status classification; a series of computer edits that check that the data are in range, consistent throughout a questionnaire record, follow the correct skip pattern, and logically follow from responses on\n17 All of the SASS-3A items appeared on the SASS-3Y questionnaire, while not all of the SASS-1A items appeared on the SASS-3Y questionnaire. Items that pertain only to school districts were not included on the SASS-3Y. Specifically, these items include those concerning: district-wide staff members; principal salary schedules; school choice within districts; and migrant education. In addition, there was one item that appeared on the SASS-3Y but did not appear on either the SASS-1A or SASS-3A. A table containing the specific district items that were not included on the SASS-3Y can be found in appendix M. 18 Charter schools operating within regular public school districts were administered a SASS-3Y questionnaire, and their dependent districts were administered a SASS-1A questionnaire. Therefore, district level data were collected twice for these schools. Their district\u2019s SASS-1A district data were processed with the SASS-1A district data and published on the Public School District data files. The district data collected on the SASS-3Y were processed independently and are published on the forthcoming Charter School Analysis File. There were a few exceptions to this, however. Four dependent charter schools within two regular districts that contained only charter schools were included in the school sample. Due to operational error, the associated districts themselves were not sampled or mailed a District Questionnaire. In addition, there were 40 dependent charter schools sampled that were the only school sampled from their associated regular school district. Due to operational error, the associated districts were not mailed a District Questionnaire. As a result, these 42 districts were classified as noninterviews on the Public School District data file.\n\n\f132 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nrelated SASS questionnaires; a final interview status classification; and an imputation stage, during which any remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d survey items were imputed. At every step in which data were changed by a computer edit, an edit flag was set to indicate the nature of the change. Similarly, imputation flags were set when data were added to indicate that data were imputed. As part of data review, analysts examined those changes.\nThe primary objectives of the data review were to validate that the processing programs were working as intended and identify suspicious values. By reviewing the frequency counts of data items at each stage of data processing, analysts were able to make sure that the edit and imputation programs were working correctly; that is, that they were doing what analysts intended for them to do. The data review also helped to ensure that the imputed values were consistent with the other data on the questionnaire record.\nAnalysts used the frequencies of each data item at each stage of data processing to identify suspicious values (e.g., if an item\u2019s response was outside the range of possible answer choices or if an answer seemed unlikely given the respondent\u2019s other responses in the survey). In the early stages of processing, analysts investigated anomalies by visually examining the image of the paper questionnaire page. Analysts verified that the data were keyed correctly and looked for additional information the respondent may have written on the questionnaires outside of the answer spaces provided. Analysts updated the files with corrected information as appropriate.\nThe 2011\u201312 school year was a survey year for both the SASS and the Private School Survey (PSS). In order to minimize the burden for private schools selected for the SASS sample, the SASS Private School Questionnaire included all of the PSS questions, in addition to the necessary SASS school data. PSS items are defined as any item collected for the PSS that also remain on the SASS private school record. Items 1,\n2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10\u201319, 34\u201337, 73\u201374, and 76\u201379 were all PSS items and were processed (edited and\nimputed) with the PSS data files then copied back to the SASS private school data file. The edit and imputation flag values that reside on the SASS private school documentation file are the same for the PSS items as for the SASS items. The edit flags are not included on the restricted-use file.\nPreliminary ISR Classification\nThe preliminary Interview Status Recode (ISR) was a preliminary determination of whether each case was an interview, a non-interview, or was out-of-scope for SASS. In general, cases with an \u201cout-ofscope\u201d outcome code that had been assigned during data collection were classified as out-of-scope (ISR=3) for the preliminary ISR. Otherwise, cases with data entries were classified as completed interviews (ISR=1). Cases with no data and cases where the district or school had refused were classified as noninterviews (ISR=2). A more detailed discussion of interview status can be found in Chapter 6. Computer Edits\nAfter the preliminary ISR classification, all files were submitted to a series of computer edits.19 These edits consisted of a range check, a consistency edit, a blanking edit, and a logic edit.\n19 The \u201ccomputer edits\u201d referenced through out this chapter refer to the range checks, consistency edits, blanking edits, and logic edits that took place after the data were collected and reformatted into SAS datasets. They do not include the edits that were embedded into the teacher internet instrument, which included range checks and consistency edits that would prompt the respondent if a response they entered was out of range or inconsistent with other entries. The teacher questionnaires completed in the internet instrument still underwent the computer edit stage of processing as described throughout this chapter. However, their data went through a more stringent filter before data processing began at the time of respondent questionnaire completion.\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 133\nCreating Edit Flags\nBecause the consistency edits and logic edits made actual changes to the existing SASS data, a series of computer edit flags were created to indicate such changes. These flags enabled analysts to keep track of how much editing was occurring overall, along with what kinds of changes and at which stage of processing these changes were made. The definitions for each flag used during the consistency and logic edits are described in exhibit 8 below.\n\n\f134 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit 8.

The range check was used to delete entries that were outside the range of acceptable values that were set prior to the administration of SASS. Entries that were deleted as a result of range checks had data added during the logic edit and imputation stages of data processing. The edit flags described above do not reflect the deletion of entries due to range checks.\n\nConsistency Edit\n\nThe consistency edits identified inconsistent entries within each case and, whenever possible, corrected them. If the inconsistencies could not be corrected, the inconsistent values entries were deleted. These inconsistencies were:\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 135\n1. within items (e.g., if the response to the \u201cYes/No\u201d part of School Questionnaire item 25\u2014 whether or not any students were enrolled in the 12th grade during last school year (2010\u2013 11)\u2014was \u201cNo,\u201d but the number of students enrolled in the 12th grade on October 1, 2010 was greater than zero for the second part of the item); or\n2. between items (e.g., if School District Questionnaire item 16 indicated that there were fewer days in the normal contract year for a principal in the school district than days in the school year for most students in the district in item 7).\nIn addition, the consistency edits filled in some items where data were missing or incomplete by using other information on the same data record. For example, if some parts of School Questionnaire item 5\u2014 student enrollment counts by race\u2014had entries, and the sum of those parts was greater than or equal to the school\u2019s total enrollment, then a zero entry was put in each part that was unanswered during the consistency edit.\nBlanking Edit\nThe blanking edits deleted extraneous entries (e.g., in situations where skip patterns were not followed correctly) and assigned the \u201cnot answered\u201d (.n) code to items that should have been answered but were not. Entries that were assigned the \u201cnot answered\u201d (.n) code had data added during the logic edit and imputation stages of data processing. The edit flags do not reflect the deletion or assignment of the \u201cnot answered\u201d (.n) due to blanking edits.\nLogic Edit\nData were added to questionnaire records during the logic edits, which filled in some items where data were missing or incomplete using other information on the same questionnaire or from other related data sources. The four main types of edits that occurred during the logic edits are described in further detail below.\n\u2022 Editing data by ratio adjusting the original value. Data were ratio adjusted in some circumstances so that items were consistent with one another. For example, if the counts of students by race on School Questionnaire item 5 did not sum to the reported total enrollment in item 2, then the ratio of each race to the total enrollment was preserved, but the actual number was adjusted to be consistent with the total enrollment figure.\n\u2022 Editing data using other items on the same SASS questionnaire record. Based on entries from related items on the same SASS questionnaire record, assumptions were made about how the respondent might have answered items. For example, item 4 on the Teacher Questionnaire asks how much the respondent works as a teacher in any of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels at this school. If this item was left blank by the respondent, and the respondent indicated that he or she is required to work at least 35 hours during a typical full week to receive base pay in item 55, then item 4 was marked \u201cfull time\u201d by the logic edit.\n\u2022 Editing data using related items from an associated SASS questionnaire. Information from an associated SASS questionnaire record was sometimes used to add data to the applicable record during the logic edits. For example, item 28 on the Principal Questionnaire asks if the school has students enrolled in the third grade. If this item was left blank on the Principal Questionnaire, then the response from the associated School Questionnaire item 1, which asks which grades are offered at the school, was used to add data to the principal record.\n\n\f136 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Editing data using information from the sample file. Information from the sample file was sometimes used to add data to the applicable record during the logic edit. For example, item 5a on the School District Questionnaire asks whether the district enrolls any prekindergarten students. If the respondent left this item blank and the sample file indicated that the lowest grade offered by the district was not prekindergarten, then item 5a was marked \u201cno\u201d by the logic edit.\n\nValues filled in by the logic edits were valid responses because they were within the range of acceptable values that was set prior to the administration of SASS and were consistent with the respondent\u2019s answers to related items.\n\nThe only records that were put through the series of computer edits were those classified as interviews in the preliminary ISR. The tables in appendix N show the number of edit changes made to entries for each of the variables within each data file. These changes are summarized in table 65 below.\n\nTable 65.

Values were created for these items in the next step of the processing\u2014imputation.\n\nImputation Procedures\n\nDuring the computer edit stage of data processing, extraneous entries were deleted in situations where skip patterns were not followed correctly and the \u201cnot answered\u201d (.n) code was assigned to the items that should have been answered but were not. In addition, some data were added or modified based on other items on the same or an associated SASS questionnaire record. The remaining \u201cnot answered\u201d items were eligible for imputation after the computer edit stage of processing was complete. SASS is a fully-imputed survey, meaning that all \u201cnot answered\u201d items that remained after the computer edits were filled with data during imputation.\n\nIn order to fill \u201cnot answered\u201d items with data, questionnaires were put through an imputation stage of processing during which two main approaches were used. In one approach, \u201chot deck\u201d imputation, data were imputed from items found on questionnaires of the same type that had certain characteristics in common. These records are called \u201cdonor records.\u201d\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 141\nIf the donor, or \u201chot deck,\u201d imputation was unsuccessful in finding an appropriate donor, the second method of imputation was applied. The second method is known as mean or mode imputation, during which data are imputed from the mean or mode of data found on questionnaires of the same type among respondents who have certain characteristics in common (\u201cdonor groups\u201d). This mean and mode imputation was implemented only as a final method of imputation and on an as-needed basis.\nWhen a missing item was imputed from a donor record and the donor answered using the \u201cother\u201d option, the write-in \u201cplease specify\u201d portion was not imputed. In addition, none of the write-in items (e.g., openended items) were imputed from donor records. Many of the write-in items ask for information that is very specific to each respondent. For instance, items 8b and 8c on the Teacher Questionnaire are openended write in items that ask information about the respondent\u2019s occupation during the previous school year, such as what was the specific occupation and what were the usual activities or duties at that job. Items such as these were not imputed and were left unanswered on the final data files (i.e., given a value of -9 for missing data).\nOnce the imputation stage was complete, there were no more unanswered items other than the write-in items (e.g., open-ended items) that are not imputed. At this point, Census Bureau analysts performed checks on the imputed data to make sure that they were consistent with other data on the same record. For a small number of cases where imputed data were either inconsistent with other data on the same record or appeared to be outlier data, analysts made adjustments to the imputed data during a postimputation data review process.\nCreating Imputation Flags\nFlags that were used in the imputation stage of processing were different from those used for the computer edits in that they were in the format of f_[sourcecode] = (value of 0, 7, 8, or 9). The definitions for each imputation flag used in the 2011\u201312 SASS are described in exhibit 9.\n\n\f142 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nExhibit 9.

By looking at the flag values, data users are able to identify which items were imputed and how the imputations were performed. The data user can use this imputation flag to decide whether or not to include imputed data in his or her analysis and which types of imputed data to employ.\n\nHot Deck Imputation\nDuring hot deck imputation, responses were determined by establishing a donor record and then basing imputation on data found within the donor record. Donors were selected based on their answers to specified items called \u201cmatching variables.\u201d If two respondents answered the selected matching variables in similar ways, then it was assumed that they were comparable and that imputation of one data item from the other was reasonable.\n\nThe matching variables used to establish donor relationships were selected based on the type of data the donor would supply to the record undergoing imputation. For example, since a respondent\u2019s answer to a given item may be influenced by the school\u2019s enrollment and the proximity of the school to a metropolitan center, these variables were used to find another respondent in a school with similar characteristics.\n\nEach item on each questionnaire was assigned a group of matching variables along with a routine describing the hierarchy of importance of each of the matching variables in determining an appropriate donor. The matching variables were chosen and ordered to ensure that the donors chosen were the most similar to the record with the unanswered data and therefore the best donors possible. All public school sector donor records needed to be from the same state or group of states20 as the record with missing data. Similarly, all private school sector donor records needed to have the same religious affiliation, or matching strata, as the record with missing data.\n\nFor example, on the Principal Questionnaire, item 54 asks for the principal\u2019s birth year. If the respondent left this item blank, then the most important variable in predicting its value would be the number of years as a principal in any school (YEARPRIN), followed by the grade levels offered by the school (NLEVEL). Therefore, the ordered matching variables were STGROUP, YEARPRIN, NLEVEL.\n\n20 STGROUP classifies states into 23 groups according to their geographic locations and school system similarities. STGROUP was used, rather than the school\u2019s specific state, because there are occasional problems with finding appropriate donor records for records with unanswered items for schools in small states.\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 143\nHowever, item 25 concerns the frequency at which a number of problems occur at the school, an area in which the number of years as a principal would not be useful predictors. Instead, the grade levels offered by the school (NLEVEL) would be the most important indicator, followed by the type of school at which the respondent served as principal (TYPE), and the proximity of the respondent\u2019s school to a metropolitan center (URB). Therefore, the ordered matching variables for this item would be STGROUP, NLEVEL, TYPE, URB. The tables in appendix O show the complete list of matching variables used during 2011\u201312 SASS hot deck imputation for each data file, along with their definitions and items for which they were used as matching variables.\nThe matching variables of the donor records had to perfectly match those of the record undergoing imputation. When there were not enough donor records within any given stratification cell of perfectly matched matching variables, the matching variable(s) of least importance was dropped, and the imputation program began a new search for a donor record based upon the subset of matching variables established as variable(s) were dropped in sequence.\nAll public school sector donor records needed to be from the same state or group of states as the record with missing data and all private school sector donor records needed to have the same religious affiliation as the record with missing data; therefore, these variables could never be dropped when searching for a donor. If the matching variables were reduced to state group or religious affiliation and no donor was found, then the value was imputed based on the mean or mode of matching groups of respondents. Once the donor relationship was established, the donor record provided data items either directly or indirectly to the imputed record. Directly meant that the donor\u2019s response to an item was imputed to the record undergoing imputation; this occurred most frequently with categorical items. Indirectly meant that a combination of donor\u2019s replies, most commonly a ratio, was used to derive a response for the record undergoing imputation. Eight main types of commonly-used direct and indirect donor relationships were defined and used during hot deck imputation, and these are described in further detail below.\n\u2022 Simple Imputation. During the most basic type of imputation, known as simple imputation, the missing item was imputed directly from that item on the donor record. For example, item 33 on the School District Questionnaire asks if training is available to prepare staff members in the district to teach in fields with current or anticipated shortages, at no cost to themselves. If this item was still unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of data processing, then item 33 was imputed with the response from the donor record and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Simple Imputation for Multiple Items. Simple imputation for multiple items was an expansion of simple imputation, where a series of missing items were imputed directly from those items on the donor record. For example, item 6 on the Principal Questionnaire asks whether the principal held a variety of positions at a school prior to becoming a principal. The item has seven parts, a through g, which include the positions of department head, curriculum specialist or coordinator, assistant principal or program director, guidance counselor, library media specialist/librarian, athletic coach/athletic director, or sponsor for student clubs or debate teams. If any or all parts of this item were still unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of data processing, then they were imputed with the response from the donor record and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Simple Imputation with Blanking Edit, then Simple Imputation. Items requiring simple imputation with blanking edits, then simple imputation had two parts. The first part was a simple imputation, where the initial missing item (an item with a yes/no response, referred to as a \u201cscreener\u201d item) was imputed using simple imputation, directly from that item on the donor record. Then, depending on the imputed response, the subsequent item(s) were either imputed using simple imputation (when \u201cyes\u201d is imputed to the screener item) or blanked (if \u201cno\u201d is imputed to the\n\n\f144 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nscreener item). This type of imputation occurs for items where this skip pattern is present. Items following a different skip pattern likely fell into the \u201cComplex Imputation\u201d donor relationship described later in this section.\nFor these items, there were always two donors established. The first donor was used when both parts (the \u201cscreener\u201d portion and the subsequent items) of the imputed item were missing. The second donor was used when the respondent answered the screener item with a \u201cyes\"\u201d response, but the subsequent item(s) were missing and needed to be imputed. The method of imputation for this second donor was simple imputation.\nFor example, item 14a on the School Questionnaire asks if the school uses any special requirements when admitting students other than proof of immunization, age, or residence. If the response to 14a is \u201cyes,\u201d then item 14b asks whether the school uses a variety of requirements for admission. This item has eight parts, which include student scores on an admission test, student scores on a standardized achievement test, academic record, special student needs, special student aptitude, skills, or talents, a personal interview, recommendations, and a signed school-parent compact. If both 14a and 14b were unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of data processing, then item 14a was imputed with the response from the donor record and flagged accordingly first. If \u201cNo\u201d was imputed to 14a, then all parts of item 14b were assigned the valid skip code. However, if \u201cYes\u201d was imputed to 14a, then all parts of item 14b were imputed with the responses from the donor record and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Ratio Imputation. During ratio imputation, the missing item was imputed using the donor's ratio of that item to some predetermined related item (\u201cratio variable\u201d) and applying it to that same related item on the record being imputed. For example, item 18b on the School Library Media Center Questionnaire asks how many of the computer workstations in the library media center have access to the Internet. If this item was still unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of data processing, then item 18b was imputed by applying the ratio of the computers with internet access (item 18b) to total computers for student or staff use in the library media center (item 18a) from the donor record to the total computers for student or staff use (item 18a) on the record undergoing imputation and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Ratio Imputation for Multiple Items. Ratio imputation for multiple items was an expansion of basic ratio imputation, where a series of missing items were imputed using the donor\u2019s ratio of each of those items to some predetermined related item (\u201cratio variable\u201d) and applying these ratios to that same related item on the record being imputed. For example, item 39e on the Private School Questionnaire asks how many full- and part-time staff held the position of librarians or library media specialist in the school. If one or both parts of this item were still unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of data processing, then they were imputed by applying the ratio of the number of full- or part-time librarians or library media center specialists (item 39e) to total teachers (item 37, total) from the donor record to the total teachers (item 37, total) on the record undergoing imputation and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Simple Imputation with Blanking Edit, then Ratio Imputation. Items requiring simple imputation with blanking edit, then ratio imputation had two parts. The first part was a simple imputation, where the initial missing item (usually an item with a yes/no response, referred to as a \u201cscreener\u201d item) was imputed using simple imputation, directly from that item on the donor record. Then, depending on the imputed response, the subsequent item(s) were either imputed using ratio imputation (when \u201cyes\u201d was imputed to the screener item) or blanked (if \u201cno\u201d was imputed to the screener item). This type of imputation occurred for items where this skip pattern was present.\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 145\nItems following different skip patterns likely fell into the \u201cComplex Imputation\u201d donor relationship.\nFor these items, there were always two donors. The first donor was used when both parts (the \u201cscreener\u201d portion and the subsequent items) of the imputed item were missing. The second donor was used when the respondent answered the screener item with a \u201cyes\u201d response, but the subsequent item(s) were missing and needed to be imputed. The method of imputation for the second donor was ratio imputation.\nFor example, item 5a on the School District Questionnaire asks if the district enrolls any prekindergarten students. If the response to 5a is \u201cyes,\u201d then item 5b asks how many prekindergarten students were enrolled in the district around the first of October. If both 5a and 5b were unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of data processing, then item 5a was imputed with the response from the donor record and flagged accordingly first. If \u201cNo\u201d was imputed to item 5a, then item 5b was assigned the valid skip code. However, if \u201cYes\u201d was imputed, then item 5b was imputed by applying the ratio of prekindergarten students (item 5b) to total students enrolled in the district (item 2) from the donor record to the total students enrolled in the district (item 2) on the record undergoing imputation and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Ratio Imputation with Blanking Edit, then Ratio Imputation. Items requiring ratio imputation with blanking edit, then ratio imputation have two parts. The first part was a ratio imputation, where the initial missing item (referred to as a \u201cscreener\u201d item) was imputed using the donor's ratio of that item to some predetermined related item (\u201cratio variable\u201d) and applying it to that same related item on the record being imputed. Then, depending on the imputed response (whether a value of 0 or a value greater than 0 was imputed), the subsequent item(s) were either imputed using ratio imputation (when a value greater than 0 was imputed to the screener item) or blanked (if a value of 0 was imputed to the screener item). This type of imputation occurred for items where this skip pattern was present. Items following different skip pattern patterns likely fell into the \u201cComplex Imputation\u201d donor relationship.\nFor these items, there were always two donors. The first donor was used when both parts (the \u201cscreener\u201d portion and the subsequent items) of the imputed item were missing. The second donor was used when the respondent answered the screener item with a response greater than 0, but the subsequent item(s) were missing and needed to be imputed. The method of imputation for the second donor was ratio imputation.\nFor example, item 32a on the School Questionnaire asks how many teachers were newly hired by the school for grades K\u201312 and comparable ungraded levels. If the response to 32a is greater than 0, then item 32b asks how many of the newly hired teachers are in their first year of teaching. If both 32a and 32b were unanswered upon entering the imputation stage of processing, then item 32a was imputed by applying the ratio of newly hired teachers (item 32a) to total teachers (item 27c) from the donor record to the total teachers (item 27a) on the record undergoing imputation. If a value of 0 was imputed to 32a, then item 32b was assigned the valid skip code. However, if a value greater than 0 was imputed to 32a, then item 32b was imputed by applying the ratio of newly hired first year teachers (item 32b) to total newly hired teachers (item 32a) from the donor record to the total newly hired teachers (item 32a) on the record undergoing imputation and flagged accordingly.\n\u2022 Complex Imputation. Complex imputation was used when the imputation could not be accomplished using one of the other seven donor relationship types. In these cases, it was simply because, while the general methodology might fit one of the other donor relationships, the skip\n\n\f146 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\npattern might have been reverse (e.g. the subsequent items are imputed if the screener is imputed as \u201cNo\u201d rather than \u201cYes\u201d). In other cases, the imputation was deemed \u201ccomplex\u201d due to its level of difficulty (e.g., too many steps in the imputation process), and therefore separate imputation programs had to be drafted.\nFinally, to prevent a single record from having an undue impact on the data, a record could only be used as a donor a maximum of five times.\nData imputed during the \u201chot deck\u201d imputation were given an imputation flag of value \u201c7.\u201d\nMean and Mode Imputation\nDuring mean and mode imputation, responses were imputed by establishing groups of similar questionnaires (donor groups) and then imputing for a particular item by substituting either the mean (the average of all the responses for that item) or mode (the response that occurs most frequently) of the same data item within that established donor group. Donor groups were selected based on respondents\u2019 data for specified items called \u201cmatching variables.\u201d If several respondents answered the selected matching variables in the same manner, then it was assumed that imputation of one data item from the mean or mode of the cases within the similar group was reasonable. The mode of responses within a donor group was used for the categorical items, while the mean was used for continuous items.\nThe matching variables used to establish donor groups for mean and mode imputation were the same matching variables used during the hot deck imputation. However, if a donor group could not be established even after collapsing each matching variable completely, the mean and mode imputation would drop the least important matching variable(s) in the established matching variable hierarchy and look for a donor group until one was established and the missing data item was imputed.\nData imputed during the mean and mode imputation were given an imputation flag of value \u201c8.\u201d\nPostimputation Processing\nFollowing imputation, the computer edits were re-run and any remaining data issues were resolved. These edits were used to ensure that the values imputed were within acceptable ranges and were consistent with other items on the same questionnaire. In a very small number of cases, an imputed value was blanked out by one of these computer edits due to inconsistency with other data within the same questionnaire or because it was out of the range of acceptable values. In these situations, Census Bureau analysts looked at the items and tried to determine an appropriate value based on a number of factors. Census Bureau analysts reviewed:\n\u2022 the original image of the questionnaire to see if the respondent had made any notes in the margin that might provide insight;\n\u2022 other items within the same record with related information; \u2022 similar cases to get an understanding of what the respondent might have answered; and/or \u2022 means and modes of similar subsamples.\nWhen analysts changed or added data for any reason during the postimputation data review, an imputation flag with a value of \u201c9\u201d was set to indicate this. Once this analyst review was complete, any items that were imputed at a rate greater than 15 percent were analyzed as part of the item bias analysis (see chapter 6 for details about nonresponse bias analysis).

The restricted-use files contain only the respondents\u2019 records; processing variables and most sampling\n\n\fChapter 7. Data Processing 151\nvariables were removed. In addition, the documentation files and restricted-use files were altered to meet the requirements of data nondisclosure.\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank.\n\n\f153\nChapter 8. Weighting and Variance Estimation\nThis chapter describes the weighting procedure used for 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The final weights are needed to have the sample estimates reflect the target survey population when analyzing the data. In addition, the variance estimation procedures are discussed, which include the methods of estimating sampling errors for weighted estimates in SASS using the replicate weights.\nWeighting\nThis section describes the weighting processes for each SASS respondent. The general purpose of weighting is to scale up the sample estimates to represent the target survey population. The steps for weighting various types of respondents are largely the same. The initial basic weight (the inverse of the sampled unit\u2019s probability of selection at the time of initial selection) is used as the starting point, then a sampling adjustment factor is applied to account for any additional circumstances impacting the probability of selection (e.g., merged schools or split schools), which produces the base weight. Next, a nonresponse adjustment factor is calculated and applied using information known about the respondents and nonrespondents from the sampling frame data. Finally, various ratio-adjustment factors are calculated and applied to the sample. The type and number of ratio-adjustment factors varies with each SASS data file. However, in general, each adjusts the sample totals to frame totals in order to reduce sampling variability.\nMost components of the weighting process employ weighting classes in the calculation of the weighting adjustments factors. Weighting classes allow for differential adjustment factors to be computed for the same weighting component. This technique is especially useful when the computed factors are presumed to differ substantially, such as when patterns of nonresponse vary across subpopulations. In subsequent sections, the formula for computing the particular weighting component is presented for each component of SASS, along with a brief description of each component of the weight. When computations were done within weighting classes, or cells, such as nonresponse adjustments, the cells are described. Sometimes a cell did not have enough data to produce a reliable estimate, and was collapsed according to specified criteria. The most important variables were always collapsed last. The collapsing criteria are also described below for each component of SASS.\nThe school weight is described first since it is the primary sampling unit. The public and private school weights have similar structures and are presented together. They differ only by the definition of the cells that are used to compute the nonresponse adjustment factor and the ratio-adjustment factor(s). The specific weighting adjustment factors and cells are described in the second section. Since the public and private school principal weights are similar to the school weights, they are described third. In the fourth section, the public school district weights are described. The fifth section describes how district base weights are computed. Teacher weights are described in the sixth section. Since the public and private school teacher weights have the same structure, they are presented together. They differ only in the definition of the cells that are used to compute the various weighting factors. These cells are described separately within the teacher weight section. The final section describes the school library weights. The School Library Media Center Questionnaire was only offered to public schools in this administration of SASS.\nThe distribution of the final weights from each file is provided in table 75 below.\n\n\f154 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 75.

Weighting and Variance Estimation 155\nInitial Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection of the school at the time of selection.\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the school\u2019s probability of selection that are identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger, duplication, or incorrect building-level collapsing (i.e., a junior high school and a senior high school merge to become a junior/senior high school). Any changes in the school collapsing described in chapter 4 (i.e., uncollapsing or additional collapsing of schools) are adjusted for in this step. The collapsing described in chapter 4 is reflected in the initial basic weight.\nNonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for total school nonresponse. It is the weighted (product of initial basic weight and sampling adjustment factor) ratio of the total eligible in-scope schools (interviewed schools plus noninterviewed schools) to the total responding in-scope schools (interviewed schools) within cells. For the first time, the 2011\u201312 SASS determined cell definitions by a procedure known as CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection). The CHAID procedure determines an optimal set of cell definitions. These cells require no further collapsing. The cells used are as presented in appendix Q. At this stage of the weighting process, noninterviewed and out-of-scope schools are assigned a weight of zero.\nFirst-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the sample estimates to known final frame totals after all frame construction. Construction of the frame is described in chapter 4. For public schools, the first-stage ratio-adjustment factor is equal to the ratio of the total number of SASS frame schools minus out of scope sample schools to the weighted sample estimate of the total number of schools within each weighting class, or cell, defined for this step in the weighting procedure. For private schools, the adjustment was the same, except for the area frame. For the area frame, all private schools in noncertainty primary sampling units (PSUs) were in sample and there were no universe counts for all noncertainty PSUs. These schools were assigned a factor equal to one.\nSecond-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor applies only to private schools. It is a factor that adjusts sample estimates based on an older sampling frame to current independent control counts. For the 2011\u201312 SASS, the list frame for private schools was the current 2011\u201312 PSS list frame, whereas the area frame was based on an older 2009\u201310 PSS area frame sample. The second-stage ratio-adjustment factor is the ratio of the weighted 2011\u201312 PSS estimates of schools to the weighted 2011\u201312 SASS sample estimate of schools within each cell.\nSchool Weighting Adjustment Cells\nThe school nonresponse adjustment factor and first- and second-stage ratio-adjustments were computed within cells. The schools were classified into cells based on sampling frame data for the noninterview and first-stage ratio-adjustments. For the second-stage ratio-adjustment, private schools were classified into cells using questionnaire data.\nNonresponse adjustments were determined using CHAID, or Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection. CHAID is a classification method for building decision trees by using chi-square statistics to identify optimal splits.\nCHAID first examines the cross tabulations between each of the input fields and the outcome, and tests for significance using a chi-square independence test. If more than one of these relations is statistically significant, CHAID will select the input field that is the most significant (smallest p value). If an input has more than two categories, these are compared, and categories that show no differences in the outcome are\n\n\f156 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\ncollapsed together. This is done by successively joining the pair of categories showing the least significant difference. This category-merging process stops when all remaining categories differ at the specified testing level.\n\nPublic, Public Charter, and Private School Adjustment Cells\n\nExhibit 10 presents a summary of the collapsing criteria applied for the first- and second-stage ratioadjustment factors to the different types of schools in the weighting process. The exact cells are shown in appendix Q.\n\nExhibit 10.

NOTE: Grade level is defined for charter and private schools as elementary, secondary, and combined. For other public schools, grade level is primary, middle, high, and combined. Collapsed locate consists of city, suburb, town, and rural. Affiliation, enrollment category, and state/region are as listed in Appendix Q. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), 2011\u201312.\n\nThis table is used to identify the differences in the criteria used in each adjustment factor calculation. The collapsing criteria are used within a cell, while the collapsing order is used to determine a homogenous cell with which to collapse. The categories used in the collapsing order differed by sector, type of public school, state or affiliation stratum and are detailed in appendix Q. Note that collapsing for public schools was restricted to within type (public charter, other public). For example, if a particular cell in the charter public school table met the collapsing criteria (i.e., had at least ten interviewed schools and an initial factor of less than 1.5), then it was not collapsed into another cell. However, if that cell did not meet any one of the above criteria, it was collapsed with a similar cell. In this case, the cell would have been collapsed into a cell with a similar grade level. The number of interviews needed to keep the cell from collapsing was always used as a criterion for collapsing and can differ for different types of schools.\n\nPrincipal Weight (Public School Principal and Private School Principal Data Files)\n\nThe regular public, public charter, and private school principal weighting was done the same way as the school questionnaire weighting described above. Since the response status for each of the principal surveys and the corresponding school surveys could be different, the weighting process was done separately for each questionnaire. The sum of the principal weights may be less than the sum of the\n\n\fChapter 8. Weighting and Variance Estimation 157\n\nschool weights because some schools do not have principals. See chapter 7 for a discussion of school and principal interview status.\n\nPublic School District Weight (School District Data File)\n\nThe final weight for the public school district data is the product of:\n\n(Initial Basic Weight) and (Sampling Adjustment Factor) and (Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (First-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor)\n\nwhere:\n\nInitial Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection of the district at the time of selection. Note that districts were not selected directly, making the computation of this probability more complex. See the next section \u201cDistrict Initial Basic Weights,\u201d for a detailed description of the computation.\n\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the district\u2019s probability of selection that are identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger or split. For example, if two districts consolidated into one, the consolidated district\u2019s base weight would reflect the two chances of selection (i.e., the joint probability of selection).\n\nNonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for total district nonresponse. It is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and sampling adjustment factor) ratio of total eligible in-scope districts to the total responding in-scope districts, computed within weighting classes, or cells, within each state. At this stage of the weighting, out-of-scope and noninterviewed districts are assigned a weight of zero. As with schools, the district nonresponse cells were determined using the CHAID procedure.\n\nFirst-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the sample estimates to the 2009\u201310 CCD total number of districts with schools. It is the ratio of the total number of noncertainty districts in the frame to the weighted sample estimate of the total number of noncertainty districts in the frame, computed within weighting classes, or cells, (see exhibit 11) within each state. Certainty districts were assigned a factor of one.\n\nExhibit 11.

Some of the criteria (collapsing criteria) apply within a cell, while the other criteria (collapsing order) are used to determine a similar cell with which to collapse. Criteria vary by whether or not the district was selected with certainty.\n\nDistrict Initial Basic Weights\n\nGiven the complexity of the sampling scheme, the calculation of the district initial basic weights is not straightforward. Districts were divided into two groups: 1) districts outside Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia, and 2) districts in Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia, which are all certainty districts. See chapter 4 for a discussion of district sample selection.\n\nDistrict Initial Basic Weights for Districts Outside Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia\n\nThe district sample was not selected directly through a district frame. Instead, the districts were selected through the school sampling. In other words, the districts associated with the sampled schools comprised the district sample. The base weight, therefore, is more complex than for other respondents.\n\nSince schools were stratified by grade level (i.e., primary, middle, high, and combined for traditional schools; elementary, secondary, and combined for charter schools) and by type (i.e., public charter, other public) the probability of selection for district k, (Pk(sel)) can be written as follows:\n\nPk(sel) =\n\n1\u2013[(1-Pk(PUB,PRI)) (1-Pk(PUB,MID))(1-Pk(PUB,HIG)) (1-Pk(PUB,COM)) (1-Pk(CHA,ELM))(1-Pk(CHA,SEC))(1-Pk(CHA,COM))]\n\nwhere:\n\nPk(PUB,PRI)\n\nis the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are classified as primary (PRI) and not charter (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are regular public primary and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, Pk(PUB,PRI) is set equal to one.\n\nPk(PUB,MID)\n\nis the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are middle (MID) and are not public charter schools (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are not public charter, but are middle and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(PUB,MID) is set equal to one.\n\nPk(PUB,HIG)\n\nis the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are high (HIG) and are not public charter schools (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are not public charter, and are high schools and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(PUB,HIG) is set equal to one.\n\nPk(PUB,COM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are combined (COM) and not public charter (PUB). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are not public charter, and are combined and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(PUB,COM) is set equal to one.\n\n\fChapter 8. Weighting and Variance Estimation 159\nPk(CHA,ELM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are elementary (ELM) and public charter (CHA). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are public charter, elementary, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(CHA,ELM) is set equal to one.\nPk(CHA,SEC) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are classified as secondary (SEC) and public charter (CHA). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are public charter, secondary, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, then Pk(CHA,SEC) is set equal to one.\nPk(CHA,COM) is the probability of selecting district k which contains schools that are classified as combined (COM) and public charter (CHA). This equals the sum of the school selection probabilities for the schools that are public charter, combined, and in district k. If the sum is greater than one, Pk(CHA,COM) is set equal to one.\nNote that 1/Pk(sel) equals the initial basic weight.\nDistrict Initial Basic Weights for Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia\nThe initial basic weight was one for all regular districts in Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and West Virginia since all districts in these four states were guaranteed to be selected for sample. Their final weights, however, may not equal one due to adjustment for nonresponse.\nTeacher Weight (Public School Teacher and Private School Teacher Data Files)\nThe final weight for public and private school teachers is the product of:\n(Initial Basic Weight) and (School Sampling Adjustment Factor) and (Teacher List Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (Teacher-Within-School Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (First-Stage RatioAdjustment Factor) and (Teacher Adjustment Factor)\nwhere:\nInitial Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection of the teacher at the time of selection.\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the school\u2019s probability of selection that are identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger, duplication, or incorrect building-level collapsing (i.e., a junior high school and a senior high school merge to become a junior/senior high school). Any changes in the school collapsing described in chapter 4 (i.e., uncollapsing or additional collapsing) are adjusted for in this step. The collapsing described in chapter 4 is reflected in the initial basic weight.\nTeacher List Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for teachers in schools that did not provide a list of its teachers. It is the weighted (the product of the school initial basic weight and the school sampling adjustment factor) ratio of total eligible in-scope schools to the total in-scope schools providing teacher lists, computed within cells (see appendix Q). As with other nonresponse adjustments, the cells were determined using CHAID.\nTeacher-Within-School Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for sampled teachers who did not respond to the survey. It is the weighted (product of all previously\n\n\f160 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\ndefined components) ratio of the total eligible teachers to the total eligible responding teachers computed within cells (see appendix Q). CHAID was used to define the cells. At this stage of the weighting procedure, noninterviewed and out-of-scope teachers are assigned a weight of zero.\n\nFirst-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor is a factor computed at the school level that adjusts the sampled schools\u2019 frame estimates of full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers to the total full-time equivalent teachers in the whole school sampling frame (either the 2009\u201310 CCD or the updated 2009\u201310 PSS). For the set of noncertainty schools, the factor is the ratio of the frame estimate of the total number of FTE teachers to the weighted (product of all previously defined components) sample estimate of the total number of FTE teachers. These factors are computed within cells (see exhibit 12). The sample estimate uses the frame count of the number of FTE teachers in the school.\n\nFor teachers from certainty schools, the factor is one.\n\nTeacher Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the inconsistency between the estimated number of teachers from the SASS school data files and the SASS teacher data files. It is the ratio of the weighted number of teachers from the school data file for a cell to the weighted number of teachers on the teacher data file for a cell. The weight is the product of all previously defined components. This factor ensures that teacher estimates from the teacher file will agree with the corresponding teacher aggregates from the school file (after imputation), since the teacher file counts are being adjusted to agree with the school counts.\n\nThe teacher list nonresponse adjustments, the teacher-within-school nonresponse adjustments, the first-stage ratio adjustments, and the teacher adjustments are computed within cells. The cells for the first-stage ratio adjustments are the same as those used in the school first-stage adjustments, and are described in the previous School Weight section. However, exhibit 12 describes the criteria for the teacher adjustments.\n\nExhibit 12.

The collapsing criteria apply within a cell, while the collapsing order is used to determine a similar cell with which to collapse. Criteria vary by school sector and type of school.\n\n\fChapter 8. Weighting and Variance Estimation 161\nSchool Library Weight (Library Media Center Data File)\nSASS school library data were used to estimate the characteristics of schools with libraries as well as schools without libraries. Whenever possible, sampled schools with libraries and sampled schools without libraries were adjusted separately. Thus, interviewed libraries were weighted up to the weighted estimate of sampled schools known to have libraries, as determined at the time library questionnaires were distributed. Likewise, the number of interviewed schools with no library was weighted up to the weighted number of all schools without libraries as determined from the questionnaire distribution. This was done to study the characteristics of each type of school. When it was not possible to adjust the library weights by the type of school, all sampled libraries and schools without libraries were adjusted as a whole. This was necessary to handle instances where the existence of the library could not be established during data collection. Due to reporting inconsistencies between the library survey and the school survey, library survey data is not adjusted directly to schools reporting to have libraries on the school questionnaire.\nThe final weight for the public school library data is the product of the following:\n(Initial School Basic Weight) and (Sampling Adjustment Factor) and (Library Type A, or Unknown status, Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (Library Type B, or Known Status, Nonresponse Adjustment Factor) and (First-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor)\nwhere:\nInitial School Basic Weight is the inverse of the probability of selection from the school sample file as reflected at the time of the school sampling.\nSampling Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for circumstances that affect the school\u2019s probability of selection that are identified after the data collection has begun, such as a merger, duplication, or incorrect building-level collapsing (i.e., a junior high school and a senior high school merge to become a junior/senior high school). Any changes in the school collapsing described in chapter 4 (i.e., uncollapsing or additional collapsing) are adjusted for in this step. The collapsing described in chapter 4 is reflected in the initial basic weight.\nLibrary Type A (Unknown Status) Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for schools that were general refusals or were never contacted and the library status was not known. This factor adjusts all schools (with and without libraries) together because it was not clear whether the school had a library. It is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor) ratio of the total school library records to the total in-scope interviewed school libraries plus out-of-scope school libraries. Cells (as described in appendix Q) were defined using CHAID.\nLibrary Type B (Known Status) Nonresponse Adjustment Factor is an adjustment that accounts for library nonrespondents where the status of the library is known based on the status of the School Library Media Center Questionnaire. Given that schools with libraries were able to be distinguished from schools without libraries, this adjustment was made separately for SASS sampled schools with and without libraries. Cells (as described in appendix Q) were defined using CHAID.\nSchools with libraries: This adjustment is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor and the type A nonresponse adjustment factor) ratio of the interviewed libraries plus the noninterviewed libraries to the interviewed libraries.\n\n\f162 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nSchools without libraries: This adjustment is the weighted (product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor and the type A nonresponse adjustment factor) ratio of the interviewed schools without libraries plus the noninterviewed schools without libraries to the interviewed schools without libraries. At the conclusion of the nonresponse adjustment procedures, noninterviewed libraries are assigned a weight of zero.\nFirst-Stage Ratio-Adjustment Factor is a factor that adjusts the sample estimates to known frame totals. Construction of the frame is described in chapter 4. For public schools, the first-stage ratioadjustment factor is equal to the ratio of the total number of SASS frame schools minus out-ofscope sample schools to the weighted sample estimate of the total number of schools within each weighting class, or cell, defined for this step in the weighting procedure. This is the same factor that was applied to the SASS school sample.\n\nVariance Estimation\n\nProducing Replicate Weights\nIn surveys with complex sample designs, such as SASS, direct estimates of sampling errors that assume a simple random sample will typically underestimate the variability in the estimates. The SASS sample design and estimation included procedures that deviate from the assumption of simple random sampling, such as stratifying the school sample, oversampling new teachers, and sampling with differential probabilities. This section describes the variance estimation used for the 2011\u201312 SASS, how the replicates were assigned, and how to use the replicate weights to compute variances.\nThe preferred method of calculating sampling errors to reflect these aspects of the complex sample design of SASS is using replication. Replication methods involve constructing a number of subsamples, or replicates, from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for each replicate. The mean square error of the replicate estimates around the full sample estimate provides an estimate of the variance of the statistic. The replicate weights are used to compute the variance of a statistic, Y, as given below:\n\n\u2211 Variance (Y ) = \uf8ec\uf8eb 1 \uf8f7\uf8f6 \uf8edn\uf8f8\n\nr\n\n(Yr \u2212 Y)2\n\nWhere: Yr = the estimate of Y using the r th set of replicate weights\nn = the number of replicates\n\nThe SASS surveys completed before 1993 used a procedure known as balanced repeated replication (BRR) for the calculation of sampling variance. BRR assumes sampling is done with replacement, and hence, BRR does not reflect the increase in precision due to sampling a large proportion of a finite population. For most surveys, where the sampling rates are small, the increase in precision will be small and can be disregarded safely. However, with SASS, the public surveys (i.e., school, principal, school district, teacher, and library) are designed to produce reliable state estimates. This necessarily implies large sampling rates, which can lead to very large overestimates of variance with BRR. Likewise, the private sector surveys (i.e., school, principal, and teacher) are designed to produce detailed private school affiliation stratum estimates, which also imply large sampling rates, and subsequent overestimation of variance with BRR.\n\n\fChapter 8. Weighting and Variance Estimation 163\nIt is possible to adjust the BRR to include a finite population adjustment (FPC). The FPC corrects the standard error in instances where a large proportion of the frame is in sample. However, since SASS uses a probability proportionate to size (PPS) systematic selection procedure, it is not clear what the appropriate FPC would be. It is even possible for an appropriate FPC to be greater than one (see Kaufman, 2001).\nTo overcome this limitation, a bootstrap variance estimator was implemented for the 1993\u201394 SASS and its role was expanded in 1999\u20132000 and even more so in the 2003\u201304 SASS. The bootstrap variance estimator was used for public schools, private list frame noncertainty schools, and public school districts in 1993\u201394. In 1999\u20132000, an additional bootstrap estimator was also included for public schools and private list frame certainty schools. The bootstrap estimator used in the 2003\u201304 SASS was modified from the 1999\u20132000 estimator to make it more stable. In 2003\u201304 a new bootstrap estimator for both public and private school teachers was included. The bootstrap variance reflects the increase in precision due to large sampling rates because the bootstrap sampling is done systematically without replacement, as was the original sampling. The 2011\u201312 SASS used the same bootstrap variance estimation procedure as the 2003\u201304 SASS.\nThe idea behind the public school district bootstrap variance estimation is to use the distribution of the sample weights to generate a bootstrap frame. A series of bootstrap samples of a prespecified bootstrap sample size can be selected from the bootstrap frame, respective replicate weights computed, and variances estimated with standard BRR software. This process is repeated for a number of independent samples following the SASS sample design, using variables from the frame. With estimates from a number of samples, a true estimate of the variance is computed. Given the true variance estimate, the bootstrap stratum sample sizes are chosen to get as close as possible to the true stratum variance estimates. Once the bootstrap stratum sample sizes are determined, bootstrap samples and replicate weights are generated for the actual fielded sample using these bootstrap stratum sample sizes. This process indirectly generates an appropriate FPC. For further details see Kaufman (1998). The district bootstrap replicate basic weights (inverse of the probability of selection) generated for the fielded sample were subsequently reweighted by processing each set of replicate basic weights through the weighting procedure.\nThe other bootstrap weights (public schools and teachers and private list frame schools and teachers) were calculated using the updated bootstrap system. This system is based on a series of assumptions about the sampling design: 1) the traditional systematic PPS first-stage sample can be approximated using a randomized systematic sample, and 2) the stratified equal probability systematic sample can be approximated by a stratified without replacement simple random sample. Using these assumptions, the bootstrap replicate weights are computed from a single sample. Again, the appropriate bootstrap replicate base weights (inverse of the probability of selection) generated for the sample were subsequently reweighted by processing each set of replicate base weights through the weighting procedure.\nSince the number of certainty schools is substantial, it was decided to treat nonresponse as a stage of sample selection. For certainty schools, this allowed for the reflection of a variance component that otherwise would be regarded as a bias. The nonresponse sampling model is:\n\u2022 For noncertainty schools, nonresponse is considered a nested random process within selected PSUs. Within appropriately defined cells (see the earlier section on \u201cSchool Weighting Adjustment Cells\u201d), it is assumed nonresponse follows a \u201cmissing at random process.\u201d\n\u2022 For certainty schools, nonresponse is considered the first stage of selection. It is assumed that this process follows a simple random sample without replacement model within appropriately defined\n\n\f164 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\ncells (see the earlier section on \u201cSchool Weighting Adjustment Cells\u201d). The frame size for this selection is assumed to be the number of selected certainty schools in the cell and the sample size is the number of responding certainty schools in the cell.\n\nThis procedure also allows for correctly estimating variances for school-based estimates that use school teacher averages generated from the SASS teacher data files.\n\nTo be consistent with the bootstrap procedures described above, the nonresponse modeling of certainty schools was reflected through an appropriately defined bootstrap procedure. For more details on the bootstrap methodology and how it applies to SASS, see Efron (1982), Kaufman (1992, 1993, 1994, 1998, and 2001), and Sitter (1990).\n\nThe newest version of the bootstrap procedure made it possible to compute teacher bootstrap replicate weights at the same time as the school weights, considerably reducing the processing time to form the replicates.\n\nEach SASS data file includes a set of 88 replicate weights designed to produce variance estimates. Replicate weights were created for each of the 88 samples using the same estimation procedures used for the full sample and are included in the data files. Most of the replicate weights were produced using a\nbootstrap procedure. The next sections describe how replicate weights were produced for each file.\n\nApplying Replicate Weights\n\nAs described above, the replicate weights are used to compute the variance of a statistic, Y, as given below.\n\n\u2211 Variance\n\n(Y\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\uf8ec\uf8eb 1 \uf8f7\uf8f6 \uf8ed 88 \uf8f8\n\n88\n(Yr\nr =1\n\n\u2212 Y)2\n\nWhere: Yr = the estimate of Y using the r th set of replicate weights, and the\nnumber of replicate weights is 88 for SASS.\n\nAnalysis of the bootstrap replicate weights revealed that approximately 3 percent of the school (public and private) and teacher (public and private) weights and approximately 9 percent of the district replicate weights fell outside a 95 percent confidence interval. These are nearly the expected 5 percent, indicating the bootstrap replicate weights are close to normally distributed.\n\nThe computation of sampling errors using these replicate weights can be done easily using one of the following software packages: WesVar Complex Sample Software, SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute 2001), AM Statistical Software, or STATA 9.\n\n\u2022 WesVar\u2014The user needs to create a new WesVar data file by specifying the full sample weight variable and the replicate weight variables as defined above, and the replication method, BRR. The replicate weights and the full sample weight can be highlighted and dragged to their appropriate place on the \u201cNew WesVar Data File\u201d window. For more information, visit https://www.westat.com/ourwork/information-systems/wesvar-support. \u2022 SUDAAN\u2014The user needs to specify the sample design as a \u201cbalanced repeated replication\u201d design as well as specifying the replicate weight variables. Specifying the sample design (DESIGN = BRR) is done in the procedure call statement (i.e., PROC DESCRIPT DESIGN =\n\n\fChapter 8. Weighting and Variance Estimation 165\nBRR;). The specification of the replicate weights is done with the REPWGT statement (i.e., to produce the sampling errors for estimates from the Principal files use the statement: REPWGT AREPWT1-AREPWT88;). For more information, visit www.rti.org/sudaan/. \u2022 AM\u2014The user needs to set the replicate weights along with the replication method using the right-click context menu in the variable list window. Once the \u201cSet Replicate Weights\u201d window is displayed, the replicate weights as identified above can be highlighted and dragged into the window. At the bottom of the window are four options for the replication method; BRR should be selected. For more information, visit http://am.air.org. \u2022 STATA\u2014The use of replicate weights for the generation of standard errors is a new feature to STATA 9. First, the user needs to survey set the data (SVY SET) by defining: the probability weight ([pw = ]); balanced repeated replication weights (brrweight(varlist)); variance estimation type (vce(brr)); and turning on the mse formula (mse). Once these parameters are set, users are able to call up the survey settings and tell STATA which type of standard errors to produce using the SVY BRR command. SVY BRR also allows users to specify the statistics to be collected (exp_list) and the command to perform (e.g., mean or tab). For more information, visit http://www.stata.com/.\nPublic School and Public School Principal Replicates\nThe bootstrap estimator as described in the previous section was used for developing both the public school and administrator replicates. The replicate weights for the school files are SREPWT1 through SREPWT88. The replicate weights for the public school principals are AREPWT1 through AREPWT88.\nPrivate School and Private School Principal Replicates\nFor private schools, the list frame used the bootstrap methodology as described above. For the area frame, the PSU sampling rates were very small; consequently, there is no advantage in using the bootstrap. BRR methodology was used in the area frame as it had been for all previous rounds of SASS. Half-samples are defined by pairing sample PSUs within each sampling stratum, forming variance strata. The final product is 88 replicate weights. After the variance strata were assigned, an orthogonal matrix (matrix H where: HHT = nIn where In is the identity matrix of order n) was used to form the 88 balanced half-sample replicates. Thus, the same methodology can be applied to both the list frame and the area frame replicate weights to compute variances. The replicate weights for the private school file are SREPWT1 through SREPWT88.\nPrivate school principal replicate weights were calculated similarly to the school replicate weights. The replicate weights for the private principal file are AREPWT1 through AREPWT88.\nSchool Library Media Center Replicates\nThe library replicate weights were developed similarly to the school bootstrap replicate weights. The replicate weights for the public and public charter school library files are MREPWT1 through MREPWT88.\nTeacher Replicates\nThe teacher replicate weights were generated at the same time as the school replicate weights as part of the 2011\u201312 bootstrap system.\n\n\f166 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nBRR methodology was employed rather than bootstrap if a teacher was in the private school area frame. Teacher sample records were assigned replicate weights by multiplying the school BRR replicate weight times the teacher\u2019s conditional probability of selection given the school is selected in the SASS school sample. The replicate weights for the public, public charter, and private teacher files are TREPWT1 through TREPWT88.\nSchool District Replicates\nTo reflect that the districts were selected through the school, the school district bootstrap samples were drawn from a frame that reflected both the public school and district distributions. This frame was the major difference between the district bootstrap methodology and that described above for schools. The replicate weights for the district file are DREPWT1 through DREPWT88.\n\n\f167\nChapter 9. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) program staff members have the responsibility of ensuring that data files are acceptable for public release. Before files are released to the public, staff members review the data for errors associated with the edit, imputation, and weighting programs. This review includes a number of checks that incorporate univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis that rigorously examine as many aspects of the data as possible without delaying timely release of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The following are aspects of the datasets that were reviewed:\n\u2022 general data quality; \u2022 nonresponse; \u2022 weighting; and \u2022 external data checks.\nGeneral Data Quality\nGeneral data quality included a number of reviews that could be characterized as consistency edits. These checks involved an examination of the individual responses, patterns of response, and summary statistics for variables and files to ensure consistency within items, respondents, and files. In addition, key variables and cross tabulations of key variables were examined for distributions and relationships that were expected based upon prior administrations and other research, a check of face validity. The specific data checks included edits, frequency counts, and reasonableness of data, as described below.\nEdits. The validity of the skip patterns in the questionnaire was established for each SASS questionnaire during the processing of the data; that is, Census Bureau analysts verified that each item in the questionnaire had the number of responses it should have if skip instructions were followed correctly. Quality checks on the edit specifications were performed and resulted in some corrections (which were treated as a form of imputation).\nFrequency Counts. Unweighted record counts for every variable were examined from the restricted-use data files. Variables with out-of-range values or inconsistent values were identified, and these values were corrected.\nReasonableness of Data. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate tabulations of key survey variables were obtained and compared to estimates from the previous SASS. Tabulations were reviewed to determine whether the basic relationships observed were within reasonable bounds, allowing for elements of change (such as random fluctuations in variance, or a trend such as overall population growth in a state). The distributions and relationships observed were consistent with expectations.\nResponse Rates\nResponse rates were examined for possible bias, and any evidence of bias at the unit or item level was investigated. The details of this analysis are discussed in greater detail in chapter 6. The nonresponse analysis identifies the levels of possible bias, methods for addressing potential bias, and the reduction in bias as a result of these efforts.\nUnit Nonresponse. Response rates were calculated at the state or affiliation stratum level for all SASS data files. (See chapter 6 for unit response rate information.) Nonresponding districts, schools, principals, teachers, and library media centers were studied in greater detail to identify patterns of unit nonresponse. (See chapter 6 for information on the nonresponse unit bias analysis.) The findings across public school respondents showed\n\n\f168 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nthat weighting adjustments substantially reduced possible bias for national estimates, though many state-level estimates remained biased. Similarly, for private school respondents, weighting adjustments substantially reduced bias for most items nationally, but a number of affiliation-level estimates remained biased. The weighted national response rates for questionnaires varied from 64.7 percent for the Private School Principal Questionnaire to 80.6 percent for the School District Questionnaire. The base-weighted response rate was below 50 percent for at least one questionnaire for the following states: Alaska, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Rhode Island. The Baptist, Jewish, other religious, nonsectarian regular program, and nonsectarian special emphasis program affiliation stratum each had at least one questionnaire with a baseweighted response weight less than 50 percent.\nItem Nonresponse. The extent of item nonresponse for each SASS data file was determined. (See chapter 6 for item response rate information.) Items with high nonresponse rates are identified and reported in tables. Following this review, there were no items removed from the data files. However, items with a response rate lower than 70 percent are footnoted as such in published tables.\nReplicate Weight Checks\nThe review of the SASS replicate weights consisted of reviewing the distribution of these weights. The following was done:\n1. For each replicate, the weights were totaled. Each replicate total, as well as the average of those numbers, was checked against the full-sample estimate. The standard error of the replicate totals was computed and checked for reasonableness.\n2. A coverage analysis was performed for the public school and private school final replicate weights using the school frame, Common Core of Data, and Private School Survey frame variables such as full-time teacher equivalents and Title I status. Normal distribution theory dictates that confidence intervals generated using the standard errors from the replicate weights (equal to the sample estimate plus or minus two standard errors) should cover the true population 95 percent of the time. This was checked empirically using these known frame variables as the true population values: the percentages of times the true population value was within the confidence intervals using the replicate standard errors was tabulated as a quality check on the replicate weights.\nExternal Data Checks\nOne way to verify the external validity of SASS data is to make comparisons to the survey universe, or frame, from which the sample is drawn. For public school districts, schools, principals, and teachers, the external file is an adjusted version of the Common Core of Data (CCD), an annual administrative census of all public schools and public school districts in the United States and its territories. The corresponding frame for private schools, principals, and teachers is the Private School Universe Survey (PSS).\nThe sampling frame is drawn from the universe data files, which pertain to 2 years prior to the field collection of SASS data. Direct comparison can be made between the estimated count of the survey unit, such as school districts or schools, and the corresponding CCD or PSS count. Such comparisons are usually made between SASS and the sampling frame year of the universe data files.\nSASS survey estimates of a characteristic of districts or schools, such as enrollment, were compared to CCD or PSS estimates. Those comparisons are usually made to the concurrent years of the universe data files, as the data collected in the field for any given school year are only valid for the same year of the universe. The number of students attending school or the number of teachers employed is subject to more year-to-year change than the number of schools or districts.\n\n\fChapter 9. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 169\nPublic School District Unit Count Comparison (Public School District Data File)\nComparisons of the number of public school districts by state and region were made to the CCD 2009\u201310 Public Education Agency Universe. The CCD estimates are independent from SASS because SASS collects its data directly from school districts that are in sample and CCD data are collected from the state education agencies. For the 2011\u201312 SASS, the district sample consisted of the set of districts that were associated with the SASS public school sample, including public charter schools that operated independently of a public school district. The districts in scope (i.e., eligible) for SASS are those that employed elementary- and/or secondary-level teachers and were in operation in the 2011\u201312 school year. CCD utilizes a less restrictive definition of a district and collects information on supervisory unions and districts that neither administer schools nor hire teachers.\nThus, two SASS-CCD comparisons were made; one to the total number of CCD districts for the state and one to the number of \u201cregular\u201d CCD districts (as defined by CCD) in the state. Depending upon the number of out-of-scope districts in each particular state, the SASS estimates are either closer to the total number of districts or to the number of regular districts in CCD. Comparisons in counts of public school districts by state between CCD and SASS are shown in tables 76 and 77. The first table compares the estimated number of public school districts in SASS (calculated using the district final weight) with the number of total and regular school districts in the 2009\u201310 CCD Public Education Agency Universe. The second table compares the estimated number of public school districts in SASS (calculated using the district base weight) with the adjusted frame developed by the sampling statisticians at the Census Bureau in preparation for SASS data collection. These are two different measures of \u201cfit\u201d between the weighted count from SASS and the frame count of districts. The sampling frame version of CCD used in table 77 is between the total number of districts and the number of regular districts.\n\n\f170 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 76.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of public school districts in the 2011\u201312 SASS compared with total and regular districts in 2009\u201310 CCD Public Education Agency Universe, by state, region, and community type: 2009\u201310 and 2011\u201312\n\nState and region (1)\nTotal\n\n2009\u201310 CCD\nregular districts1\n(2)\n17,807\n\n2009\u201310 CCD\nregular districts\nwith students2\n(3)\n13,629\n\n2011\u201312 2011\u201312\n\nSASS\n\nSASS frame SASS\n\nestimate as SASS\n\n2009\u201310 (2009\u201310 frame 2011\u201312 2011\u201312 a percent- estimate as\n\nCCD CCD (charter SASS SASS age of a percent-\n\nregular without\n\nand districts districts CCD age of\n\ndistricts charter and state- run (charter (without districts 2011\u201312\n\nwith state-run districts and state- charter and\n\nwith SASS\n\nschools3 districts)4 only)5 run only)6 state-run)7 schools8 frame9\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n14,245 14,213 3,871 2,803 14,188\n\n99.6\n\n99.8\n\nState Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n171\n\n133\n\n133\n\n133\n\n48\n\n4\n\n146 109.8 109.8\n\n54\n\n53\n\n53\n\n53\n\n1\n\n16\n\n42\n\n79.2\n\n79.2\n\n642\n\n224\n\n242\n\n242\n\n575\n\n79\n\n599 247.5 247.5\n\n295\n\n244\n\n258\n\n258\n\n22\n\n55\n\n222\n\n86.0\n\n86.0\n\n1,190\n\n958 1,102 1,102\n\n55\n\n106\n\n943\n\n85.6\n\n85.6\n\nColorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida\n\n262\n\n178\n\n186\n\n186\n\n18\n\n45\n\n154\n\n82.8\n\n82.8\n\n200\n\n169\n\n172\n\n172\n\n65\n\n39\n\n165\n\n95.9\n\n95.9\n\n40\n\n19\n\n19\n\n19\n\n25\n\n4\n\n41 215.8 215.8\n\n59\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n94\n\n75\n\n67\n\n72\n\n72\n\n15\n\n6\n\n47 4,700.0 4,700.0\n\n3\n\n78 108.3 108.3\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n206 1\n142 1,076\n387\n\n180\n\n183\n\n183\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n116\n\n116\n\n116\n\n869 1,002 1,002\n\n294\n\n309\n\n309\n\n36\n\n4\n\n201 109.8 109.8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n26\n\n14\n\n115\n\n99.1\n\n99.1\n\n48\n\n246\n\n621\n\n62.0\n\n62.0\n\n64\n\n26\n\n338 109.4 109.4\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n371\n\n361\n\n361\n\n361\n\n0\n\n327\n\n316\n\n292\n\n292\n\n11\n\n194\n\n174\n\n175\n\n175\n\n3\n\n123\n\n69\n\n74\n\n74\n\n129\n\n255\n\n246\n\n182\n\n182\n\n4\n\n93\n\n276\n\n76.5\n\n76.5\n\n7\n\n310 106.2 106.2\n\n22\n\n150\n\n85.7\n\n85.7\n\n0\n\n157 212.2 212.2\n\n61\n\n142\n\n78.0\n\n78.0\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n25\n\n24\n\n24\n\n24\n\n1\n\n393\n\n244\n\n330\n\n330\n\n67\n\n855\n\n551\n\n605\n\n605\n\n320\n\n558\n\n337\n\n381\n\n381\n\n190\n\n165\n\n152\n\n152\n\n152\n\n13\n\n0\n\n22\n\n91.7\n\n91.7\n\n65\n\n324\n\n98.2\n\n98.2\n\n73\n\n853 141.0 141.0\n\n75\n\n456 119.7 119.7\n\n9\n\n166 109.2 109.2\n\nMissouri\n\n565\n\n523\n\n527\n\n527\n\n145\n\n214\n\n396\n\n75.1\n\n75.1\n\nMontana\n\n502\n\n417\n\n345\n\n345\n\n3\n\n238\n\n114\n\n33.0\n\n33.0\n\nNebraska\n\n294\n\n253\n\n281\n\n281\n\n5\n\n122\n\n164\n\n58.4\n\n58.4\n\nNevada\n\n18\n\n17\n\n18\n\n17\n\n12\n\n0\n\n21 116.7 123.5\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n280\n\n180\n\n158\n\n158\n\n13\n\n29\n\n166 105.1 105.1\n\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n\fChapter 9.

These \u201cother\u201d types of districts are largely either administrative units that oversee charter schools or independent charter schools that are recognized within their state as if they were districts. Methodologically, single-school districts, some public charter schools, and some state and federally-run schools were not sent a separate district questionnaire, but instead received the Public School Questionnaire (with District Items). The Public School Questionnaire with District Items incorporated most, but not all, district-level items into the school questionnaire.\n\n\fChapter 9. Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 175\nWhen the data files were created from the questionnaires, district-level data for these \u201cother\u201d types of districts were included on the district data file, with the exception of charter school data for public charter schools that are under the jurisdiction of a regular school district. It is important to include these district-level data for a single-school district, state or federally-funded school, or public charter school record on the district file in order to approximate the district data reported by CCD and to provide SASS data for \u201cother\u201d types of districts that exist at the elementary and secondary level. Table 77 provides the comparison between the total district count in CCD and the SASS estimate of districts, including those for public charter or state-run schools.\nDifferences in the count of districts between CCD and SASS do occur for various reasons. In New England, the main reason why CCD and SASS estimates diverge is that CCD counts all local districts as districts. SASS, however, defines a district as an entity that operates at least one school and is responsible for hiring, firing, and setting policies. In Vermont and, to some extent, in Maine, the functions that define a district in SASS are performed by the supervisory union, school union, or co-op. Supervisory unions, school unions, or co-ops may oversee several districts, as defined by CCD. Consequently, the \u201cdistrict of record\u201d in CCD may not actually be the district that directs the operations for these small, rural schools.\nThe adjusted SASS sampling frame reflects the changes that are made to better fit the SASS definition of eligible districts for sampling. Even after those adjustments are made, there are still some remaining discrepancies between the SASS sampling frame and the actual sample, as shown in table 76\u2019s rightmost column. In general, it is not possible to completely subtract districts that would be ineligible for SASS from CCD because they are not always readily identifiable. For example, in some states supervisory units may oversee school operations, while in other states that is not as common.\nThe largest differences between SASS estimates and CCD or the adjusted SASS frame occurred in the following states: Arizona, District of Columbia, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Utah. With the exception of Rhode Island, the primary difference between the SASS district estimates and the CCD totals may be attributable to the high number of charter schools in those states. Because SASS considered independent charter schools as \u2018district entities,\u2019 these changes are substantive differences between the two data collections and will impact the district count for SASS. The estimates in table 77 provide comparisons that eliminate the majority of these discrepancies. The two remaining states with large discrepancies are the District of Columbia and Vermont. The difference in the District of Columbia is related to the large number of charter schools and the presence of only one regular district. In Vermont, the discrepancies are related to the issues discussed above.\nPublic School Unit Count Comparison (Public School and School Files)\nComparisons of the number of public schools in SASS were made to the total number of public schools and the number of public schools with students in the 2009\u201310 CCD, the year from which SASS drew its sample of schools. The number of public schools in SASS is 2.0 percentage points higher than the number of CCD public schools with students (table 78). There were four states (California, Delaware, Kentucky, and Minnesota) that exceeded the CCD number by more than 15 percent and four states (Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota) that were more than 15 percent lower. The four states with estimates higher than CCD include a number of schools with a discrepancy between the CCD-reported number of students and SASS-eligibility (the presence of students) and the presence and number of students reported in SASS. The schools with lower estimates include states that experience collapsing of schools between the CCD frame year and SASS collection. However, all of these states were within that range when comparing the SASS estimate as a percentage of the frame. Five states have an estimated number of public schools for SASS that is below 90 percent of the SASS frame: Alabama, Arizona, District of Columbia, Minnesota, and South Dakota. Overall, the percentage difference between SASS and the frame year CCD count of public schools was 2.0; this increases to 4.9 once the school collapsing operation is taken into consideration. The school collapsing operation described in chapter 4 was expected to reduce the consistency of the count of schools between CCD\n\n\f176 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n(particularly in the frame year) and SASS, in some states.

Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 179\nComparisons of the number of public school students in SASS were made to the frame year of CCD from the published student counts for 2009\u201310 (table 79). Two comparisons were made, one to the CCD total number of students and the other to the CCD K\u201312 student count. The latter count does not include any prekindergarten students. The SASS student counts are for K\u201312 grade levels, as long as the school reporting a kindergarten also has a 1st grade. While there are at least some public schools included in CCD\u2019s definition of K\u201312 that may not have been eligible for SASS, in general most public kindergarten students would be eligible as students in SASS; therefore, it does not make sense to exclude kindergarten from the student counts when making the comparison to CCD.\nOverall, the SASS student count is about 0.1 percentage points higher than CCD\u2019s count of total K\u201312 students from 2 years prior to SASS (table 79). There were 1,278,678 prekindergarten students included in CCD in 2009\u201310. Excluding the prekindergarten students brings the SASS student count into a closer degree of \u201cfit\u201d than was achieved with the comparison of the number of schools in SASS to CCD. However, excluding the prekindergarten students enlarges the amount of difference in those states for which SASS has a higher number of students than the prekindergarten\u201312 frame-year CCD counts. Population growth (i.e., births and/or migration) may account for SASS count in 2011\u201312 in some states being higher than the frame year CCD count, but that does not help to explain why the SASS count of students in 2011\u201312 is lower for 17 states than the adjusted frame-year CCD count.\nThere were three states in which the amount of the difference between the 2009\u201310 CCD and SASS as a percentage of the SASS frame was 10 percentage points or more: Alaska, New York, Tennessee, and West Virginia. The remaining states with a higher count in the SASS frame than estimated in the 2011\u201312 SASS were less than 10 percent different from the adjusted frame count. The amount of that difference may be reduced in some states when comparing the SASS data to the same year of CCD, if those data were available (which they are not as of the time this report is being prepared). There were 21 states in which the number of students was more than 5 percentage points higher in SASS compared to the 2009\u201310 CCD. Some of these states are among those that have sometimes had over-reporting of enrollment and teachers in SASS. This may indicate that the school collapsing operation narrowed, but did not entirely eliminate, the over-reporting of students in some states and perhaps over-compensated on the over-reporting in other states. The reports of enrollment in Alaska have been inconsistent in previous SASS administrations.\n\n\f180 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 79.

Although the overall sample is representative at the national and regional level only, among those states with a large number of public charter schools, the sample does attempt to be representative for those states. States with fewer public charter schools were all sampled together, and those states with no public charter schools were excluded from the sampling.\n\nThe comparisons that are shown in table 80 should not be interpreted as a critique of the sampling that was employed to draw a national sample. Rather, the comparisons show how closely the sample does or does not fit to subnational counts of public charter schools as identified in the CCD frame year. Comparisons are made to the frame year from CCD, as opposed to the concurrent data collection year, because the sample as drawn\n\n\f182 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nfrom the frame year has no way to include any newly-created schools. This is of particular importance for public charter schools, which are counted by CCD only after the state grants a charter for the school and permits the school to begin operation.\n\nTable 80.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of public charter schools in 2011\u201312 SASS compared to 2009\u201310 CCD, by state, region, and community type: 2009\u201310 and 2011\u201312\n\nState and region (1)\nTotal\n\n2011\u201312\n\n2009\u201310 SASS\n\nCCD public frame\n\n2009\u201310 charter (2009\u201310\n\nCCD public schools CCD with\n\ncharter (published adjust-\n\nschools1 count)2 ments)3\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n5,356\n\n4,952 5,079\n\n2011\u201312\n\n2011\u201312 SASS un-\n\nSASS weighted\n\npublic public\n\ncharter charter\n\nschools schools\n\n(CCD (CHAR\n\nident- FLAG =\n\nified)4\n\n1)5\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n4,423\n\n674\n\n2011\u201312 SASS public charter\nschools (CHAR FLAG =\n1)6 (7)\n4,482\n\nSASS estimate\nas a percent-\nage of CCD7\n(8)\n83.7\n\nSASS SASS\n\nestimate estimate\n\nas a (CHAR\n\npercent- FLAG=1)\n\nage of\n\nas a\n\nSASS percentage\n\nframe8 of CCD9\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n88.2\n\n83.7\n\nState Alaska Arizona California Colorado Delaware\n\n25\n\n25\n\n25\n\n28\n\n7\n\n37 148.0 148.0 148.0\n\n575\n\n504\n\n571\n\n453\n\n58\n\n479 83.3 83.9\n\n83.3\n\n878\n\n813\n\n842\n\n821\n\n120\n\n761 86.7 90.4\n\n86.7\n\n161\n\n158\n\n155\n\n146\n\n21\n\n146 90.7 94.2\n\n90.7\n\n21\n\n18\n\n21\n\n31\n\n7\n\n33 157.1 157.1 157.1\n\nDistrict of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho\n\n101\n\n99\n\n90\n\n54\n\n12\n\n54 53.5 60.0\n\n53.5\n\n487\n\n412\n\n437\n\n374\n\n49\n\n374 76.8 85.6\n\n76.8\n\n67\n\n63\n\n63\n\n63\n\n17\n\n110 164.2 174.6 164.2\n\n31\n\n31\n\n31\n\n22\n\n6\n\n22 71.0 71.0\n\n71.0\n\n37\n\n36\n\n36\n\n48\n\n5\n\n48 129.7 133.3 129.7\n\nIndiana Louisiana Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota\n\n53\n\n53\n\n53\n\n40\n\n10\n\n44 83.0 83.0\n\n83.0\n\n98\n\n77\n\n77\n\n51\n\n13\n\n45 45.9 58.4\n\n45.9\n\n63\n\n62\n\n62\n\n102\n\n14\n\n102 161.9 164.5 161.9\n\n302\n\n294\n\n291\n\n257\n\n30\n\n257 85.1 88.3\n\n85.1\n\n188\n\n181\n\n178\n\n165\n\n23\n\n165 87.8 92.7\n\n87.8\n\nNew Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina Ohio\n\n81\n\n70\n\n81\n\n99\n\n13\n\n102 125.9 125.9 125.9\n\n73\n\n72\n\n71\n\n62\n\n16\n\n62 84.9 87.3\n\n84.9\n\n141\n\n140\n\n140\n\n81\n\n15\n\n81 57.4 57.9\n\n57.4\n\n96\n\n96\n\n96\n\n96\n\n13\n\n96 100.0 100.0 100.0\n\n361\n\n323\n\n336\n\n280\n\n43\n\n280 77.6 83.3\n\n77.6\n\nPennsylvania\n\n136\n\nTexas\n\n578\n\nUtah\n\n78\n\nWisconsin\n\n229\n\nAll other states\n\n496\n\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n134\n\n133\n\n113\n\n536\n\n556\n\n506\n\n72\n\n76\n\n62\n\n206\n\n198\n\n142\n\n477\n\n460\n\n326\n\n25\n\n113 83.1 85.0\n\n83.1\n\n51\n\n495 85.6 89.0\n\n85.6\n\n17\n\n62 79.5 81.6\n\n79.5\n\n23\n\n178 77.7 89.9\n\n77.7\n\n66\n\n336 67.7 73.0\n\n67.7\n\n\fChapter 9.

By construction, the total number of private schools in SASS 2011\u201312 matches the total number of schools in 2011\u201312 PSS, although there is sampling variability in the number of private schools for subsets of SASS, such as private schools by affiliation stratum and NCES typology. Note that totals by region do not match since region was not used to control SASS to PSS as described in the private school weighting section of Chapter 8.\n\nThe comparisons in table 81 show that the number of private schools measured by SASS in 2011\u201312 is lower than the comparable number of private schools from PSS in 2009\u201310. However, the number of private schools measured in the 2011\u201312 SASS has been adjusted to match the number of private schools in the 2011\u201312 PSS, and the number of private schools in the PSS did decrease from 2009\u201310 to 2011\u201312.\n\nThe stratification groups (termed Affiliation stratum in these tables) for the 2011\u201312 SASS are comparable to those used in SASS 2007\u201308, but are somewhat different from what had been used for previous SASS data collections. Prior to the 2003\u201304 SASS, there were 19 groups, plus \u201cother,\u201d based on a combination of religious affiliation and school membership groups. In the 2003\u201304 SASS, the previous 19 groups, and\n\n\f184 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u201cother,\u201d a rather large category, were streamlined into 11 categories including an \u201cAll other religious\u201d category that is smaller than the previous \u201cother\u201d category. The new stratification groups for both 2003\u201304 and 2007\u201308 did not use a combination of the religious affiliation and association membership responses for forming any of the categories; rather, only the religious orientation (religious or non-sectarian) and religious affiliation items are used. For the 2007\u201308 SASS, more streamlining was performed, such that only private schools with a membership size of 800 or more schools nationally have their own stratum group. Groups below that threshold had been sampled at a higher rate than larger groups, and as a result, had tended to respond at lower rates than the larger groups. Now, fewer of these smaller groups\u2019 schools are burdened with responding, but the tradeoff is a lack of detail collected in SASS about those types of schools. Schools from those groups are still included in sample, but are not specifically drawn as part of any affiliation stratum except \u201call other religious.\u201d The sampling for 2011\u201312 was consistent with the 2007\u201308 methodology.\n\n\fChapter 9.

Overall, the SASS student count is about 7 percentage points higher than the PSS count in 2009\u201310 and about 12 percentage points higher than the concurrent year\u2019s student count in PSS (table 82). By affiliation stratum, SASS estimates as a percentage of the 2009\u201310 PSS ranged from 90.2 percent for the Catholic, private stratum to 133.7 percent for the Nonsectarian regular school stratum, and the SASS estimates as a percentage of the 2011\u201312 PSS ranged from 93.2 percent for the Catholic, private school stratum to 137.8 percent for the Nonsectarian, special emphasis school stratum. However, by NCES typology, the SASS count of private school students was higher\n\n\f186 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nfor all of the three typology categories when compared to the 2011\u201312 PSS, by about 5 percent for Catholic, 9 percent for Other Religion, and 32 percent for Nonsectarian schools.\n\nThe percentage differences between SASS and the concurrent PSS are larger than the differences between SASS and the frame year PSS. While the differences are larger, sampling variability for some of the smaller strata may account for percentage differences greater than 5 percent. This difference may be attributable to higher response rates from larger private schools resulting in an over inflation of the weights of the larger schools relative to the smaller schools. Another factor may be weighting as the SASS weights are produced separately from the PSS weights, allowing for this difference to emerge. SASS and PSS weights control for the school counts but not the student counts.\nTable 82.

Reviewing the Quality of SASS Data 187\nPublic School Teacher FTE Comparison (Public School Teacher Data File)\nThe comparison between the number of teachers in the SASS Public School data file and the CCD State Nonfiscal Survey is an approximation, since the SASS public school teacher data are collected and reported in head counts of people rather than in the number of full-time-equivalent positions (FTEs) reported to CCD (table 83). As an external check, this spots gross differences. There are several reasons why the number of teachers, approximated to FTE counts from the Public School Teacher data file, would differ from CCD State Nonfiscal Survey counts. CCD counts are statewide official tallies of teaching positions, reported from a central agency, and unduplicated to account for teachers in multiple districts or schools. The teacher count from SASS depends in part on the cooperation of the schools to provide a list of all teachers. Approximately 18 percent of schools in 2011\u201312 SASS did not provide a teacher list. The CCD count reflects some teaching positions for which the teacher is away from the school during the SASS data collection, such as a teacher who is on maternity leave. The assumptions about the proportions of part-time to full-time teachers, which are used to adjust the headcount data to FTEs, may be reasonable overall but may not be as accurate on a stateby-state basis. When a public school in sample for SASS is declared out-of-scope, such as when that school merged with another nonsampled school, the teachers who would have been or actually were sampled are also declared out-of-scope. While such factors affect relatively small proportions of the sampled cases, there may be a cumulative effect on the overall count of teachers in some states.\nThe SASS teacher estimate of the number of FTE teachers (table 83) was 3.5 percent higher overall than the frame year CCD count of FTE teachers. There could be several reasons for this. One reason is that the approximation of FTE teachers from SASS is not as accurate as the reporting of FTE positions in CCD, particularly within certain states. Another possible reason is that the school collapsing operation in SASS may not have completely taken care of the over-reporting of teachers in combined K\u201312 schools. At the state level, the larger discrepancies are likely a function of previously discussed factors including CCD-SASS discrepancies, higher numbers of charter schools, school collapsing, and lower response rates. A comparison of the SASS teacher estimate from the teacher file to the SASS teacher estimate from the school file produced a difference of only 0.1 percentage points and all but one state-level estimate (Wyoming) was within 5 percentage points of the school file.\n\n\f188 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable 83.\n\nEstimated number and percentage of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers in public schools in 2011\u201312 SASS compared to the 2009\u201310 CCD, by state and region: 2009\u201310 and 2011\u201312\n\nState and region (1)\nTotal\n\n2009\u201310 CCD FTE\npublic school teachers1\n(2)\n3,165,781\n\n2011\u201312 SASS FTE\npublic school teachers (teacher\nfile)2 (3)\n3,278,059\n\n2011\u201312 SASS public school\nteachers (headcount) (school file)3 (4)\n3,385,281\n\n2011\u201312 SASS public school\nteachers (approx.\nFTE) (school\nfile)4 (5)\n3,275,132\n\nSASS school file\nas a percentage of 2009\u201310\nCCD5 (6)\n103.5\n\nSASS teacher file\nas a percentage\nof SASS school file6\n(7)\n100.1\n\nState Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California\n\n52,112 8,165 65,307 38,533 289,424\n\n43,730 7,147 59,547 37,284 272,332\n\n45,046 7,378 62,473 38,102 284,382\n\n44,127 7,044 59,916 37,171 271,895\n\n84.7\n\n99.1\n\n86.3\n\n101.5\n\n91.7\n\n99.4\n\n96.5\n\n100.3\n\n93.9\n\n100.2\n\nColorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida\n\n49,465 42,033 8,739 6,715 172,319\n\n53,657 42,917 9,112 5,144 174,443\n\n56,481 44,857 9,344 5,452 176,344\n\n53,626 42,527 9,223 5,339 173,814\n\n108.4 101.2 105.5 79.5 100.9\n\n100.1 100.9 98.8 96.3 100.4\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\n\n117,172 11,500 15,546\n134,476 61,021\n\n121,594 13,751 15,738\n136,935 62,271\n\n123,058 13,868 16,355\n140,579 64,111\n\n120,984 13,567 15,463 135,398 62,323\n\n103.3 118.0 99.5 100.7 102.1\n\n100.5 101.4 101.8 101.1 99.9\n\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine\n\n35,041 33,685 39,401 49,037 15,978\n\n34,520 35,041 45,218 43648 17147\n\n36,101 36,648 46,782 43,915 18,365\n\n34,427 34,764 45,504 42,863 17,406\n\n98.2 103.2 115.5 87.4 108.9\n\n100.3 100.8 99.4 101.8 98.5\n\nMaryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi\n\n57,503 69,950 91,046 53,761 33,347\n\n56,125 75,719 93,333 58,405 36,899\n\n58,404 80,437 95,823 62,748 37,618\n\n57,074 77,442 91,660 58,261 37,222\n\n99.3 110.7 100.7 108.4 111.6\n\n98.3 97.8 101.8 100.2 99.1\n\nMissouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire\nSee notes at end of table.\n\n67,274 10,608 22,156 22,990 15,461\n\n65,880 11,702 22,918 24,590 14,794\n\n69,837 12,381 23,897 24,908 15,759\n\n67,388 11,723 22,587 24,630 14,987\n\n100.2 110.5 101.9 107.1 96.9\n\n97.8 99.8 101.5 99.8 98.7\n\n\fChapter 9.

PSS always reports FTE counts of teachers. For ease of comparison, the headcounts of teachers in SASS were converted to approximate FTE counts in 2007\u201308 and this continued in 2011\u201312.\nThe number of private FTE teachers in SASS (table 84) is 2.6 percent lower overall than the frame year count of teachers in PSS and 1.2 percent higher overall than the concurrent year\u2019s count. However, both the frame year and concurrent year\u2019s PSS teacher counts are quite close in absolute numbers. There are much larger differences by affiliation strata, ranging from about 14 percent below the concurrent PSS count for Catholic, private school teachers to about 24 percent above the PSS count for Nonsectarian, regular teachers. The small sample size of both of these groups (and consequently, relatively larger variance estimates) probably contributes to the large percentage differences in FTE teacher counts.\nWhile the overall number of private schools in SASS is controlled to the concurrent PSS total, this is not true of the number of FTE teachers. There are several factors that contribute to differences between SASS estimates and PSS estimates. Schools that closed between the sampling year of 2009\u201310 and 2011\u201312 would tend to lower the FTE estimate in SASS relative to the 2011\u201312 PSS, at least to the extent that there are differences in the number of FTE teachers between schools that closed and schools that remained open. The 2011\u201312 SASS used the 2009\u201310 PSS area frame instead of the 2011\u201312 PSS area frame. The difference in area frames could either raise or lower the FTE estimates of teachers in SASS.\nA higher estimate of FTE teachers in SASS by NCES typology could result from one or more factors. The overall count of private schools in SASS is controlled to the 2011\u201312 PSS, but not within each type of private school, so that the number of schools by NCES typology category may be higher in SASS than in PSS. In addition, differences in the area frames between SASS and PSS may contribute to this effect.\n\n\fChapter 9.

Key Terms for SASS\nThe following terms are defined as they apply to the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS).\nAffiliation stratum. SASS uses 11 categories into which all private schools are divided based on religious orientation and association membership. These categories are Catholic\u2014parochial, Catholic\u2014 diocesan, Catholic\u2014private, Baptist, Jewish, Lutheran, Seventh-Day Adventist, other religious, nonsectarian\u2014regular, nonsectarian\u2014special emphasis, and nonsectarian\u2014special education. Schools with multiple affiliations are classified by their first affiliation in the above list. These categories represent the private school sampling strata for SASS; therefore, the SASS private school sample is designed to support estimates for each of these affiliation categories.\nBase weight. This is the inverse of the initial probability of selection (termed the initial basic weight) including adjustments to the probability of selection due to schools determined to be splits or mergers during data collection operations. These adjustments to the initial probability of selection are called the sampling adjustment factor. The base weight is defined as the product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor.\nBureau of Indian Education (BIE) school (see \u201cSchool\u201d). Meets all school criteria; operated by or under contract with the Bureau of Indian Education; reported as a BIE school by the state education agency and/or by the Bureau of Indian Education; offers services to American Indian students. BIE schools may include day schools, boarding schools, cooperative schools, and contract schools. The Bureau of Indian Affairs was recently renamed Bureau of Indian Education.\nCareer Technical Center (CTC). An alternative school that offers organized educational activities with a sequence of courses that provides students with the academic and technical knowledge and skills they need to prepare for further education and for careers (other than careers requiring a baccalaureate, master\u2019s, or doctoral degree) in current or emerging employment sectors. The courses include competency-based applied learning that contributes to the academic knowledge, higher-order reasoning and problem solving skills, work attitudes, general employability skills, technical skills, and occupationspecific skills of the students.\nCharter (or public charter) school. A charter school is a public school that, in accordance with an enabling state statute, has been granted a charter exempting it from selected state or local rules and regulations. A charter school may be a newly created school or it may previously have been a public or private school. Meets all school criteria; receives public funding as primary support; provides free public elementary and/or secondary school to eligible students.\nCombined school. A school is classified as combined if it has one or more of grades K\u20136 and one or more of grades 9\u201312; for example, schools with grades K\u201312, 6\u201312, 6\u20139, or 1\u201312 were classified as having combined grades. Schools in which all students are ungraded (i.e., not classified by standard grade levels) are also classified as combined.\nCommon Core of Data (CCD). CCD is the Department of Education\u2019s primary database on public elementary and secondary education in the United States. CCD is a comprehensive, annual, national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts and contains data that are designed to be comparable across all states. The objectives of CCD are twofold: first, to provide an official listing of public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the nation, which can be used to select samples for other National Center for Education Statistics surveys; and second, to\n\n\fA-2 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nprovide basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and secondary schools and schooling in general.\nDistrict. A Local Education Agency (LEA), or public school district, is defined as a government agency that employs elementary or secondary level teachers and is administratively responsible for providing public elementary and/or secondary instruction and educational support services. Districts that do not operate schools but do employ teachers are included; for example, some states have special education cooperatives that employ special education teachers who teach in schools in more than one school district. Supervisory unions are also included.\nElementary school. A school is classified as elementary if it has one or more of grades K\u20136 and does not have any grades higher than grade 8. For example, schools with grades K\u20136, 1\u20133, or 6\u20138 are classified as elementary.\nFinal weight. This is the product of the initial basic weight, sampling adjustment factor, separate adjustments for nonresponse at each stage of selection, and one or more stages of ratio adjustment to the frame or to independent sources. The final weight is used to produce weighted estimates from the survey data. See chapter 8 for details on the weighting procedure.\nFIPS. FIPS stands for Federal Information Processing Standards and refers to a variety of codes for standardized reference. FIPS county and state codes were developed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) as numeric identifiers for each county and state in the United States. In 2009, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) issued a standardized set of numeric or alphabetic codes to ensure uniform identification of geographic entities through all federal government agencies. These standards replace the FIPS codes. INCITS 38 identifies state codes and replaced FIPS 5-2. INCITS 31 identifies counties and replaced FIPS 6-4. More information on the state and county codes can be found at: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/ansi/ansi.html.\nFull-time equivalent. A method of counting teachers that limits the number only to those teachers whose working hours meet or exceed the number of hours prescribed by the school district for full-time employees.\nHigh American Indian enrollment school. High American Indian enrollment schools are public schools where 19.5 percent or more of the students are American Indian or Alaska Native, as reported in the 2009\u201310 Common Core of Data. Schools with high American Indian enrollment were not stratified separately from other public schools for the 2011\u201312 SASS.\nInitial basic weight. This is the inverse of the probability of selection from the initial sampling procedure. In contrast, the base weight is the inverse of the probability of selection covering all sampling, including any adjustments to the probability of selection due to schools determined to be splits or mergers during field operations.\nItinerant teacher. A teacher with an assignment that requires the teacher to provide instruction at more than one school.\nLibrary media center. An organized collection of printed and/or audiovisual and/or computer resources which is administered as a unit, is located in a designated place or places, and makes resources and services available to students, teachers, and administrators. A Library Media Center may be called a library, media center, resource center, information center, instructional materials center, learning resource center, or any other similar name.\n\n\fAppendix A. Key Terms for SASS\n\nA-3\n\nMissing data. SASS is a fully imputed dataset. Consequently, the only survey items that lack responses are either those that are part of a skip pattern and should not have been answered by a particular respondent or write-in responses, which include data too specific to reasonably impute from another respondent\u2019s data. Data pulled from the frame (i.e., the Common Core of Data or the Private School Universe Survey) are not necessarily imputed for missing data. In these instances, a value of -9, indicating missing data, is provided for that variable.\nPrincipal. A principal is the administrator who has primary responsibility of the overall day-to-day functioning of the school.\nPrivate school (see \u201cSchool\u201d). Meets all school criteria; does not receive public funding as primary support; does not operate within the public school system.\nPrivate School Universe Survey (PSS). PSS is a biennial survey designed to collect data from all K\u201312 private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It is the universe from which the sample for the private school component of SASS is selected.\nPublic school (see \u201cSchool\u201d). A public school is defined as an institution that provides educational services for at least one of grades 1\u201312 (or comparable ungraded levels), has one or more teachers to give instruction, is located in one or more buildings, receives public funds as primary support, and is operated by an education agency. Public charter schools, schools in juvenile detention centers, and schools located on domestic military bases and operated by the Department of Defense are included.\nSampling adjustment factor. In the weighting process for each SASS respondent, the sampling adjustment factor is applied to the initial basic weight to account for any additional circumstances affecting the probability of selection. The product of the initial basic weight and the sampling adjustment factor is the base weight. See the definitions for initial basic weight and base weight.\nSchool. An institution or part of an institution that has one or more teachers who provide instruction to students, has students in one or more of grades 1\u201312 (or the ungraded equivalent), has its own principal/administrator if it shares a building with another school or institution, is in operation during the 2011\u201312 school year, and is NOT primarily a postsecondary or adult basic education institution. The following are NOT considered a school: schools located exclusively in a private home, Department of Defense (DoD) schools located outside of the US, offices of special education in an LEA, tutoring services, homeschool clearing houses, and adult learning facilities.\nSchool head. A school head is defined as the person holding presiding rank at the school, who assumes final responsibility for the overall operation of the institution.\nSecondary school. A school is classified as secondary if it has one or more of grades 7\u201312 and does not have any grade lower than grade 7. For example, schools with grades 9\u201312, 10\u201312, or 7\u20138 are classified as secondary.\nState school. State schools are typically run by a State Department of Education and are not overseen by a district (e.g., schools in juvenile detention centers, schools for the blind, etc.).\nTeachers. A teacher is defined as a full-time or part-time teacher who teaches any regularly scheduled classes in any of grades K\u201312. This includes administrators, librarians, and other professional or support staff that teach regularly scheduled classes on a part-time basis. Itinerant teachers are included, as well as long-term substitutes who are filling the role of a regular teacher on a long-term basis. An itinerant teacher is defined as a teacher who teaches at more than one school (e.g., a music teacher who teaches 3\n\n\fA-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\ndays per week at one school and 2 days per week at another). Short-term substitute teachers and student teachers are not included.\nTraditional public school. Traditional public schools are publicly-funded schools other than public charter schools. They include regular, special education, vocational/technical, and alternative schools. They also include schools in juvenile detention centers and domestic schools located on military bases and operated by the Department of Defense. See also the definitions for public and public charter schools.\nTypology, private school. Private schools were assigned to one of three major categories (i.e., Catholic, other religious, and nonsectarian). Within each of these major categories, three additional subcategories were assigned. As a result, two typology-based variables exist on the private sector data files; a \u201c3-level typology\u201d (RELIG) and a \u201c9-level typology\u201d (TYPOLOGY). The categories and subcategories are 1. Catholic\u2014parochial, diocesan, and private; 2. Other religious\u2014conservative Christian, affiliated with a religious school association, and not\naffiliated with a religious school association; and 3. Nonsectarian\u2014regular, special program emphasis, and special education.\nUngraded. Refers to schools that have an alternative means of classifying students, other than by grade level.\nUngraded students. Ungraded students are those who are not assigned to a particular grade level (kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade, etc.); for example, special education centers and alternative schools often classify their students as ungraded. Students in Montessori schools are also considered ungraded if the school assigns them to \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cintermediate\u201d levels instead of specific grades.\nValid skip. An item that was not applicable due to a response to a previous item on the same questionnaire and was provided with a value of -8, indicating a valid skip. Certain survey items direct respondents to skip subsequent items based on their answers to the original item, or stem. For instance, if a respondent answered \u201cNo\u201d to item 12a on the School Questionnaire (\u201cDoes this school have a kindergarten?\u201d), he or she was directed to skip items 12b and 12c (respectively, \u201cHow long is the school day for a kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or transitional first grade student?\u201d and \u201cHow many days per week does a kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or transitional first grade student attend?\u201d) and to \u201cGO TO item 13 below.\u201d Because the respondent answered that the school in question does not have a kindergarten, subsequent questions about kindergarten students at that school were not applicable. In instances when an item should not have been answered by the respondent, a value of -8, which designates a valid skip, is applied to that variable(s).\n\n\fB-1\nAppendix B.

Using several tests to determine the representation and efficiency of the sample, two definitions of high-poverty schools were used: 1) schools with at least 50 percent free or reduced-price lunch enrollment, and 2) schools with at least 75 percent free or reduced-price lunch enrollment. These two definitions of high-poverty schools were used to examine the distribution of high poverty across several reporting domains, as well as the distribution of key analysis variables, as defined by NCES. Because no standard definition of poverty in the SASS target population is currently in use by NCES or the research community, this analysis incorporated two definitions to ensure the results reported here were not sensitive to a particular definition.\nIn summary, the analysis shows that while the 2007\u201308 SASS sample adequately represents high-poverty schools, marginal improvements to the representation can be made at low costs. Therefore, ESSI recommends purposely improving the distribution of high-poverty public schools through adding the free and reduced price lunch variable to the sample sort.\nDetails on the analyses, findings, and recommendations can be found below.\nCoefficients of Variation (CV)\nESSI calculated point estimates, standard errors, and CVs for key estimates, within reporting domains, by both high-poverty definitions. The purpose of this analysis was to help quantify comments on the limitations of high-poverty estimates through a comparison with NCES standards.\nThe key analysis variables analyzed were: enrollment, total number of teachers, percent minority students, hours per week spent on all school-related activities, average class size, and highest degree earned. The reporting domains used in this analysis include the following variables, several of which are SASS stratification variables: school type, region, community type, school grade level (both 3 and 4 categories), teaching experience, teacher employment status, state, and certainty states. CVs were then calculated and compared between the two high-poverty definitions. Table C-1 shows summary statistics for the CV analysis.\n\n\fAppendix C. Poverty Analysis for SASS 2011\u201312 Public School Sample C-3\n\nTable C-1. Summary statistics for coefficients of variation, by high-poverty definition: 2007\u201308\n\nPercent of coefficients\n\nPercent of coefficients\n\nMedian coefficient of variation 15 percent of variation 30 percent\n\nHigh-poverty definition\n\nof variation\n\nor higher\n\nor higher\n\nSchools with 50 percent or\n\nmore free or reduced-\n\nprice lunch\n\n12.5\n\n38.5\n\n3.1\n\nSchools with 75 percent or\n\nmore free or reduced-\n\nprice lunch\n\n14.7\n\n48.5\n\n5.4\n\nNOTE: The 2007\u201308 SASS sample was designed to produce key estimates with coefficients of variation 15 percent or less.\n\nEstimates with coefficients of variation 30 percent or higher are flagged as unstable. Estimates in this table represent key\n\nestimates calculated within key reporting domains, by poverty level. Estimates with cell sizes less than 30 unweighted\n\nobservations were excluded from this analysis.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), \u201cPublic\n\nSchool and Public School Teacher Data File,\u201d 2007\u201308.\n\nAs shown in table C-1, at least 51 percent of the estimates studied in this analysis had a relatively precise CV (below 15 percent1) regardless of the poverty definition examined. The converse indicates that at least\n39 percent of the estimates studied could be judged by the user community as being less than ideal. The\npercent of estimates exceeding the desired level of 15 percent is naturally larger for the more restrictive\ndefinition (75 percent of more) because the number of schools meeting this criterion is smaller.\n\nGiven the sample design aimed for CVs of 15 percent or less, the table C-1 results show that the SASS 2007\u201308 adequately represents schools with high poverty levels for many of the key SASS estimates. However, the representation could be expanded.\n\nUsing Regression Analysis to Analyze CV Associations\n\nA large number of CVs were produced for the analyses summarized in table C-1 including overall estimates and estimates by reporting domain. To test whether high CVs are associated with the highpoverty categories for the two definitions, overall and then controlling for reporting domains, ESSI conducted a series of regression models using the CV as the dependent variable (table C-2). The \u2018all domains\u2019 row estimates the effect of poverty on the CV of key estimates calculated within all reporting domains, while the other rows estimate this same effect within specific reporting domains. For example, the \u2018within region\u2019 row for schools with 50 percent or more free or reduced-price lunch has a regression coefficient of 2.3, which is significant at the p<.001 level. This means that even after controlling for region, high-poverty schools (using this definition) are still significantly associated with higher CVs in comparison with non-high-poverty schools.\n\n1 A coefficient of variation (CV) of 15 percent or less has been used as the desired level of precision since the development of the 1990\u201391 SASS sample design.\n\n\fC-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTable C-2.

However, the strength of the association is not completely consistent across the definitions. This suggests that the current SASS stratification variables are not sufficient to increase the representation of high-poverty schools and that a high-poverty variable should be introduced to the 2011\u2013 12 SASS design.\n\nResponse Rate Comparisons\n\nSample design optimization determines the minimum number of units (e.g., schools or teachers) required to meet a set of analytic objectives. This minimum size must be inflated to account for sample loss associated with nonresponse. Lower response rates among high-poverty schools could introduce difficulties for improving their representation in the sample, possibly requiring oversampling.\n\nIn order to determine if high-poverty schools responded at lower rates than non-high-poverty schools, ESSI calculated base-weighted response rates and compared the rates between the two definitions of high poverty schools. Response rates were calculated within domain levels in order to facilitate the comparison of different types of schools. In most instances, high-poverty schools had about the same response rate as non-high-poverty schools, and in several instances, notably CTC schools, charter schools, and schools in the Northeast, response rates were actually higher than non-high-poverty schools. Response rates were lower for high-poverty schools for only a few domain levels, most notably in towns. Overall, ESSI found\n\n\fAppendix C. Poverty Analysis for SASS 2011\u201312 Public School Sample C-5\n\nthat response rates were not lower for high-poverty schools, and therefore differential response rates among high-poverty schools should not be an issue for the SASS 2011\u201312 public-school sample.\n\nComparison of School Sample Frame and Restricted-Use Files\n\nIn order to show how close the distribution of high poverty among the respondents matches the distribution of high poverty in the population, ESSI compared the distribution of high-poverty schools in the public school sample frame file and the final-weighted restricted-use file. In other words, do the levels of poverty in the respondents accurately represent the levels of poverty in the population?

Of the 71 domain levels compared, 35 (49.3 percent) were more than 5 percent different between the sample frame and interview population, when comparing schools with 50 percent or more students receiving free or reduced-price lunch. However, 19 (26.8 percent) were more than 5 percent different when comparing schools with 75 percent or more students receiving free or reduced-price lunch.\n\nFor most domains in table C-3, the 2007\u201308 SASS analysis file contained a higher proportion of highpoverty schools than exhibited in the target population. This oversampling of high-poverty schools inherent in the current SASS sample design could be further expanded through its addition as a sorting variable. Further analysis will be conducted prior to implementation to ensure that such as change would not negatively impact the precision of schools outside the high-poverty category.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe analyses above show that the representation of poverty is adequate for a majority of the estimates and domains calculated, but could be improved for others. The regression models show that a high percentage of free and reduced-price lunch is associated with less precise estimates (larger CVs); improving the representation of poverty in the sample should reduce this association. Additionally, because the response rates are comparable for high- and non-high-poverty schools, the allocation of sample to this former category does not need to be explicitly controlled through its use as a stratification variable.\n\nTherefore, ESSI recommends adding free or reduced-price lunch as a sort variable prior to sample selection to improve the representation of high-poverty schools in the SASS 2011\u201312 sample. This recommendation is a lower-cost option than adding another level of stratification which is almost guaranteed to increase the overall sample of schools required for the design. The precision of key estimates for the high-poverty schools will be controlled in expectation through a sample design optimization.\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank.\n\n\fD-1\nAppendix D.

In other words, these schools would no longer be sampled at higher rates, but would remain in the SASS target population. In order to estimate the effect of removing the BIE and CTC strata, ESSI performed an analysis using the SASS 2007\u201308 public school sampling frame.\n\nIn general, no problems were found using the new stratification. BIE sample counts decreased to those appropriate to their population proportion. CTC representation in the sample increased, while the representation of all other public schools in the sample was not significantly affected by the new stratification. Therefore, ESSI recommends keeping BIE schools and CTCs on the sampling frame. Details on the analysis can be found below. ESSI also examined poverty distributions among the three school types to ensure school poverty representation would not be affected by the stratification change. Information on this analysis can be found in Attachment D-1.\n\nNew Stratification and Probabilities of Selection\n\nAfter dropping CTCs, BIE schools, and schools with high American Indian enrollment, the new strata include three main levels: (1) schools in Delaware, Maryland, Florida, Nevada, and West Virginia, (2) public charter schools, and (3) all other public schools. Type (1) schools were further stratified by district and by four-level school level. Type (2) schools were further stratified by state or region and then by school level. Finally, type (3) schools were further stratified by state and then by school level.\n\nFor the analysis, ESSI classified the SASS 2007\u201308 public school sampling frame using the new stratification levels. The 2007\u201308 sampling frame was used for two reasons. One, the 2007\u201308 sampling frame had already been prepared for SASS sampling (e.g., removing schools with zero enrollment and schools outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, etc.), which saved time by avoiding all of these edits on a newer CCD public school file. Second, ESSI could use the sample allocations from 2007\u201308 to estimate the number of BIE and CTC schools sampled without the BIE and CTC strata. This allowed us to recreate the 2007\u201308 sample with the new stratification, without creating a new sample allocation.\n\nThis new stratification was applied to the 2007\u201308 frame and sample, which were used to determine the number of schools on the frame and the number of schools sampled within each new stratification level. These sample counts were then used to calculate the probability of selection for each school on the frame:\n\n\u03c0 hi\n\n=\n\nmhShi Sh+\n\nwhere h = first-stage stratum index (h = 1, \u2026, H);\n\ni = school index within stratum h;\n\nmh = number of schools to be selected in stratum h;\n\nShi = FTEhi , the size measure for school hi defined as the square root of full-time equivalent\n\nteacher variable from CCD;\n\n\u2211 Sh+ =\n\nMh i =1\n\nShi\n\n,\n\nthe\n\nsum\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nsize\n\nmeasures\n\nwithin\n\nstratum\n\nh;\n\nand\n\nMh = total number of schools in stratum h.\n\n\fAppendix D. Bureau of Indian Education-Funded Schools\n\nand Career and Technology Centers Sampling Change\n\nD-3\n\nThis formula produces the probability of selection for each school on the frame, determined by the number of schools selected within the given strata (mh), the square root of the schools number of full-time equivalent teachers (Shi), and the sum of the square roots of FTE teachers within the given strata (Sh+). FTE is used as a size of measurement for each school. This school-level probability of selection has been used for several rounds of SASS.\n\nThe individual probabilities of selection for each school were then summed within each stratum using the following formula:\n\nM hi\n\u2211 m\u02c6 kh = \u03b4khi \u03c0 hi\ni =1\n\nwhere k = school analysis domain index (k = 1 [BIE], 2 [CTC], and 3 [Other public schools]); m\u02c6 kh = expected sample size for domain k within stratum h; and \u03b4khi = zero-one indicator to identify schools in the relevant domain.\n\nThis formula gives us the expected number of schools sampled within each strata level, by school type.

The last three columns display the number of schools actually sampled using the original 2007\u201308 stratification, which included strata for BIE and CTC schools.\n\n\fD-6 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nThe largest difference between the new expected sample counts and the original sample counts is for BIE schools. If BIE schools are sampled, rather than taken with certainty, we expect to select around 50 BIE schools, much less than the 178 selected for the 2007\u201308 study.\n\nThe number of CTC schools expected to be sampled under the new stratification is actually larger than the number originally sampled in 2007\u201308. The total number of CTC sample schools expected under the new stratification is 158, whereas there were only 131 originally sampled in 2007\u201308. This is most likely the result of some CTC schools having larger FTE counts than other public schools. The median FTE count for CTC schools is 2.45, whereas the median FTE count for all other public schools is 1.00, which results in a mean probability of selection of 0.16 for CTC schools and 0.10 for all other public schools. Thus, CTC schools, on average, have a higher probability of selection than the other public schools.\n\nOnly minor changes were observed in the difference of expected to original sample sizes for all other public schools. These changes reflect the removal of the BIE and CTC school stratification levels.\n\nExpected Counts After Nonresponse Adjustment\n\nTable D-2 displays the expected response counts and the number of responding schools in 2007\u201308. The expected response counts were derived by multiplying the expected sample sizes by the nonresponse rate in 2007\u201308. This shows how many schools we would expect to respond using the new stratification levels.\n\nTable D-2.

Under the new stratification, only 36 BIE schools are expected to respond, versus 131 responding BIE schools in the 2007\u201308 sample. We still see an increase in the number of CTC schools responding, and a relatively small increase for all other public schools.\n\n\fAppendix D. Bureau of Indian Education-Funded Schools\n\nand Career and Technology Centers Sampling Change\n\nD-9\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, the BIE schools are most affected by the change in stratification. After controlling for nonresponse, there is an expected drop of 73 percent of responding BIE schools, which reflects the change from certainty sampling to probability sampling. While this will preclude producing national estimates for BIE schools, this drop in the number of BIE schools is expected given their very small population size. BIE schools will still be represented in the overall public-school survey estimates.\n\nThe representation of CTC schools is not harmed by the stratification change. Rather, their representation will increase in expectation. After controlling for nonresponse, the expected counts increased 22 percent of responding CTC schools. As mentioned above, this appears to be a result of a skewed distribution of FTE counts. Finally, there was only a 0.01 percent change in the expected number of responding other public schools. Slight changes include more schools responding in the West and more City schools responding. Overall, ESSI recommends including BIE schools and CTCs on the sampling frame without special treatment.\n\n\fD-10 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nAttachment D-1. Poverty Distribution Among School Types\n\nNCES decided to include free and reduced-price lunch enrollment in the sample sort for SASS 2011\u201312 in order to improve representation of school poverty. If BIE schools or CTCs have high proportions of schools with high poverty rates, the representation of high-poverty schools could be damaged by not sampling BIE schools and CTCs at higher rates. Table D-3 displays the high-poverty and not-high poverty distributions for BIE schools, CTCs, and all other public schools on the 2007\u201308 sampling frame, using a threshold of 50 percent of students participating in free and reduced-price lunch. This threshold was used to obtain a conservative estimate of the number of high-poverty schools. Although unable to simulate free lunch in the sample sort in the analysis above, table D-3 contains distributions of poverty.\n\nTable D-3.

But with a total of 178 BIE schools, the BIE sector represents only 0.2 percent of all public schools. Approximately 40 CTCs were high-poverty schools, representing only 0.1 percent of all high-poverty public schools (table A-1). Therefore, given the small population of BIE schools overall, and the small proportion of CTCs with high-poverty, there should be no negative effect on the representation of high-poverty schools in the 2011\u201312 sample by using the new stratification.\n\n\fE-1\nAppendix E. 2011\u201312 SASS Redesign\u2013\u2013Precision Analysis\nThis appendix contains a report prepared by the American Institutes for Research (AIR), Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI).

E-4\n\n\fE-2 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nIntroduction\nThe purpose of this memo is to summarize the analysis results to evaluate levels of precision for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) sample allocation. The first section briefly discusses how precision is defined in SASS. The second section discusses precision at the school level using data collected from the 2007\u201308 SASS questionnaires. Finally, the third section describes precision for estimates from the 2007\u201308 SASS teacher instruments.\nDetermining Precision\nInformation from several sources is used to determine a desired respondent sample size. They include: 1. the number of sample units in the target population; 2. the desired level of precision; 3. key analysis variables such as totals and proportions; and 4. important reporting domains (i.e., subpopulations).\nThe number of units in the target population is currently being estimated with counts from the 2008\u201309 Common Core of Data and 2007\u201308 PSS as a surrogate to the actual frame. The first-stage sampling frame for schools for the 2011\u201312 SASS will be finalized in spring 2011.\nThe desired level of precision for SASS estimates is defined in terms of the estimated coefficient of variation (CV; also referred to as a relative standard error). As set in the 1990\u201391 SASS, key survey estimates used to calculate the overall sample size and allocation to strata should have a CV no greater than 15 percentage points.\nThe evaluation below includes a set of important analysis variables identified in the summer of 2010 as well as generic proportions to address other important SASS characteristics. These variables and generic values are evaluated:\n\u2022 by school type (public charter, traditional public, overall public, private); \u2022 by region within school type; \u2022 by grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined for private schools; elementary, middle,\nsecondary, and combined for public schools); \u2022 by grade level and region within school type; and \u2022 by teachers\u2019 years of experience.\nSchool-level Precision\nTable E-1 contains the marginal totals for the expected number of responding schools in the 2011\u201312 SASS and the minimum number of respondents needed for a set of key estimates to have no larger than a 15 percent CV. The key school-level estimates identified by NCES and ESSI used in the evaluation included1:\n\u2022 total number of schools; \u2022 total number of students in schools; \u2022 total number of libraries; \u2022 total number of teachers; and\n1 Additional analysis variables were evaluated but later excluded from the list because the results were cost prohibitive (e.g., percentage of principals within minority race/ethnicity categories).\n\n\fAppendix E. 2011\u201312 SASS Redesign\u2014Precision Analysis E-3\n\n\u2022 total number of school staff: principals; library media specialists/librarians; school support staff; full-and part-time school/guidance counselors; nurses (full-and part-time combined); and psychologists (full- and part-time combined).\nTable E-1.

For example, the percentage of traditional public schools is estimated to be 92.6, the percentage of female principals in traditional public schools is estimated to be approximately 50.5, and the percentage of teachers self-identified as a race/ethnicity other than White is 16.4. To accommodate varying levels of estimated percentages in SASS, sample sizes for estimates ranging from 2.5 (rare occurrence) to 95 percentage points were evaluated against the 15 percent CV criterion (table E-2).\nAs shown in table E-2, SASS estimated percentages for both elementary and secondary public schools (traditional public and public charter combined) will have no larger than a 15 percent CV provided that the characteristic being estimated is associated with at least 25 percent of the target population. This suggests that estimates such as the percentage of teachers self-identified as non-White (16.4 percent) will have a CV greater than 15 percent. Note that smaller percentages require larger sample sizes for a specified level of precision in comparison with larger proportions.\n\nTable E-2.

Table E-4 summarizes the results. This indicates that many key estimated percentages will be supported by the 2011\u201312 SASS. The exception is associated with rare characteristics in the population such as, for example, the percentage of teachers by non-White race/ethnicity categories by school type and grade level.\nTable E-4.

The TLF collects the name and selected information for every eligible teacher in SASS sampled schools. In the past, each sampled school received a paper listing form. The 2009 field test examined the feasibility of collecting the teacher data electronically from districts with sampled schools rather than on paper from each individual school.\nThis new methodology had the potential to improve the efficiency of the SASS collection. The expected benefits included the following:\n\u2022 reducing data collection costs significantly by eliminating the need for field follow-up operations in the fall for the TLF;\n\u2022 reducing respondent burden by collecting school-level information from the district, therefore reducing the number of respondents and the difficulty of providing the information;\n\u2022 reducing data processing costs by eliminating the majority of data keying for the TLF; and \u2022 improving the timeliness of teacher sampling and the administration of the teacher\ncomponent of the survey.\nThe field test had two primary research questions:\n1. Was the new methodology feasible? That is, were districts able and willing to provide teachers\u2019 names and data for selected schools?\n2. Were the resulting teacher lists satisfactory? That is, were the districts able to provide data that were comparable in accuracy and reliability to the lists provided by schools? In addition, this includes the question about whether districts report in accordance with the SASS definition for a \u2018teacher,\u2019 including teachers that met the definition and excluding staff that did not meet the definition.\nIf the districts were able to provide data and the teacher coverage was sufficient, then the test had secondary research questions regarding operational feasibility and the data quality. These questions included the following:\n\u2022 Teacher data\u2014Could the district provide the following information for each teacher: name, subject matter taught, part-time or full-time status, and years of experience?\n\u2022 School data\u2014Could districts provide the grade range of each school and/or the enrollment? (This information is used to identify school mergers and splits from the universe.)\n\u2022 Timing\u2014When could districts provide the information for their full roster of teachers for the current school year? Is this sooner or later than when the schools have this information?\n\u2022 Operations\u2014If collecting teacher lists from school districts was determined to be feasible, what operations (mailout, telephone calls) will be needed?\n\u2022 Technical details\u2014In what format could respondents provide a file (Microsoft Excel, other) and how should the website and secure server be set up to receive teacher files?\nThese secondary questions were used to inform the study about the limitations regarding the availability or quality of the additional sampling information collected on the TLF. If the coverage was sufficient, these analyses would be the basis for the decision whether or not to implement this methodology in production of the SASS.\n\n\fAppendix F. Summary of the 2009 Field Test Findings and\n\nRecommendations for the 2011\u201312 SASS Methodology\n\nF-3\n\nField Test Design Features\n\nThe field test included multiple panels designed to address the issues of feasibility (could and would districts provide data), data quality (accuracy of data from districts versus schools), and file format (how would districts send the data). A sample of 100 districts was selected and asked to provide information electronically, but they were divided into two distinct panels:\n\n\u2022 Panel 1\u2014Districts were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers in any format convenient for them. The Census Bureau provided an Excel template, but did not encourage its use.\n\u2022 Panel 2\u2014Districts were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers using the Excel template provided; however, any format was accepted.\n\nIn order to check the quality and accuracy of the lists provided by the districts, schools were sampled in each of the 100 sampled districts. Schools were divided into three treatment groups. Within each group, they were divided again by whether the school\u2019s district was asked to provide an electronic list in any convenient format or using the Excel template. The three groups are listed below:\n\n\u2022 Group A\u2014Schools were asked to provide an electronic teacher list. Within this group, half the schools were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers in any format convenient for them. The other half of the schools were asked to provide an electronic list of teachers using the Excel template provided.\n\u2022 Group B\u2014Schools were asked to verify and correct, as necessary, a traditional TLF that was preprinted with the information the district had provided. Schools received the same treatment regardless of their district\u2019s panel (whether the district was asked to provide list in Excel format or any format convenient for them).\n\u2022 Group C\u2014Schools were asked to provide information on the traditional paper TLF. Schools received the same treatment regardless of their district\u2019s panel (whether the district was asked to provide the list in Excel format or any format convenient for them).\n\nThe sample size of each school group is shown below in table F-1.\n\nTable F-1.

The Census Bureau sent the appropriate contact person a letter describing the SASS and asking the respondent to provide an electronic list of teachers using the secure website. At the same time, the Census Bureau sent schools in group A a letter requesting an electronic list of teachers and schools in group C a letter requesting that they complete the enclosed TLF. A reminder letter was\n\n\fF-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nsent to nonresponding districts and schools. The Census Bureau conducted a telephone follow-up operation to remind nonresponding districts and schools to provide the electronic list of teachers or complete the TLF, as appropriate. Once electronic lists of teachers were received from the districts for schools in group B, the Census Bureau printed a TLF prepopulated with the teacher information. These forms were sent to their respective schools with a letter requesting that the respondent review the TLF and correct the information, if necessary. Nonresponding schools were contacted by telephone. Table F-2 provides the timeframe for these activities.\n\nTable F-2.

The two most important questions were the primary research questions outlined above\u2014were the districts able and willing to provide TLF data, and were the data of comparable (or sufficient) quality. The first question was answered primarily by reviewing district participation and response rates. The second question was answered by comparing verified data from districts and their schools to examine whether districts provided data that met the quality standards necessary on the TLF for the purposes of teacher coverage and teacher sampling. The results of the field test provided evidence that implementing the proposed methodology would provide comparable data in a timelier manner at a significantly lower cost in the 2011\u201312 administration of SASS than following the 2007\u201308 SASS methodology (i.e., asking schools to complete and return a paper TLF by mail, with follow-up by telephone calls and personal visits).\nParticipation and Response Rates\nAnalysis of the response rates and a review of the debriefing questions asked of the districts provided evidence that the districts were both willing and able to provide TLF information in an electronic format. Table F-3 presents the response rates for all districts, as well as the response rates for each panel. Seventy-two of the 100 districts contacted delivered an electronic file, for a response rate of 72 percent. It is worth noting that nearly 60 percent of the districts responded in the first 6 weeks after mailout, before telephone follow-up started. Fifty-seven percent of the schools included in the independent panels of the study provided files or TLFs during the entire data collection period. The response rate for districts was higher than the response rate for schools (72 percent and 57 percent, respectively). This result clearly suggested a \u201cyes\u201d for research question one: were school districts willing and able to provide teacher lists for sampled schools.\n\n\fAppendix F.

During the 2007\u201308 SASS, approximately 56 percent of schools provided TLFs after mail and telephone operations, and the remaining 44 percent were sent to field follow-up. In the field test, 72 percent of districts provided an electronic list of teachers. If the same percentage of districts provided an electronic list of teachers for their sampled schools during the 2011\u201312 SASS, the response rate prior to field follow-up would be significantly higher than during the 2007\u201308 SASS.\n\nTable F-3 shows that the districts which were asked specifically to provide the lists in Excel format responded at a higher rate (80 percent) than the districts which were asked to provide the list in any electronic format (64 percent). These results are encouraging, as Excel files are the preferred format for this operation and explicitly asking for a very common and familiar format resulted in greater participation than a more flexible, but perhaps more ambiguous, request. Additional comments from the districts in follow-up questions and debriefing interviews are presented later in this report, but the initial findings based upon participation show this methodology to be feasible.\n\nTable F-4 provides the number of teacher lists received from districts and schools. The 72 participating districts provided lists for 336 schools, representing 67.61 percent of the sampled schools. Of these schools, 83 provided an independent teacher list and 125 reviewed a TLF prepopulated with the information the district provided. Sixty of the 83 independent list pairs were compared for accuracy. The results of the analysis are reported in the following section. The 28 districts that did not participate were responsible for 161 sampled schools; however, 51 of these schools provided an independent teacher list.\n\nTable F-4.

Historically in SASS, the schools have provided this list and significant efforts have been made to reduce the burden on the schools, ensure appropriate teacher frame coverage, improve the efficiency of the sampling, and maintain high response rates. The two important aspects of quality are teacher coverage and substantive accuracy of the ancillary information. Teacher coverage refers to the extent to which the information collected includes all SASS-eligible teachers and only SASS-eligible teachers. Coverage errors occur when eligible teachers are left off the TLF and when noneligible teachers are included. Substantive accuracy refers to the correctness of the information schools reported about each teacher. The first data quality section reviews teacher coverage and the second section will address substantive accuracy. Teacher coverage and substantive accuracy were evaluated by comparing the list pair, that is, the teacher list for each school provided by the district and the corresponding school.\nTeacher Coverage\nThe first and most important research question regarding the quality of the data considers coverage\u2014were the appropriate teachers included and inappropriate staff excluded so that the district-provided TLFs provided an appropriate frame for teacher sampling? Teacher coverage was evaluated using a gross error rate for the TLF information. Errors were defined as discrepancies between the list pair. The Census Bureau reconciled all discrepancies by calling the schools to determine which list was correct.\nTeacher discrepancies mainly consisted of either the school or district not having an updated roster of current teachers (including name changes from marriage, or one school listing them by a nickname that is not easily matched to their real name), teachers being included who do not meet the SASS definition of a teacher, or the district not including a teacher for the sample school because they work at more than one school. Most of these mistakes resulted from the school or district not responding consistently with the directions provided.\nGross error rates were calculated for schools and districts for each panel, where the gross error rate is defined as the total number of errors divided by the total number of correctly reported teachers within each panel. All errors were counted\u2014incorrectly listed teachers as well as teachers incorrectly omitted. Table F-5 presents the school and district gross error rates. Overall, teacher coverage of the districtcollected data was comparable to the data collected from the schools. When comparing the gross error rate of all list pairs (regardless of format), the gross error rate for the schools was 5.11 percent compared to 5.74 percent for the districts. These overall rates suggest that the districts are able to provide TLF data of a comparable quality.\n\n\fAppendix F.

However, the gross error rate for districts that were specifically asked to provide an electronic list using the Excel template was 2.55 percent, while the gross error rate of all the paired schools was 4.81 percent. An examination of the gross error rates of district respondents by the requested format (any format and Excel) reinforced the overall finding that teacher coverage was of a comparable quality for lists provided by schools and districts. The lower gross error rate for the districts asked to use the Excel template (2.55 percent) suggests that the use of the Excel template may result in better quality data. The template included columns for each of the appropriate variables with the goal of helping the respondents identify and provide the correct information.\n\nWhen the district was asked to provide the electronic list of teachers in any format, both the paired schools that provided the information in an electronic file and the paired schools that provided the information on the traditional paper TLF had lower gross error rates than their districts. In both instances, the school information appeared to be more accurate than the district, with gross error rates of 4\u20136 percent, about half of the gross error rate of the paired districts. These results were less encouraging.\nHowever, when the district was specifically asked to provide their electronic list of teachers in the Excel template, the districts provided teacher lists that were of comparable quality. The gross error rate for districts using the Excel template was 1.90 percent compared to 2.42 percent for the paired schools that provided an electronic list. The gross error rate for districts using the Excel template was 2.89 percent compared to 6.05 percent for the paired schools that completed the traditional paper form.\nSchools that responded using the Excel template had lower gross error rates than schools responding using the traditional TLF. At the same time, the schools responding using the Excel template had higher gross error rates than districts responding using the Excel template. While the differences were small, these results provide evidence that teacher coverage would be comparable, and potentially better, when using teacher lists provided by the districts in an Excel template. Overall, these results provide evidence\n\n\fF-8 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nthat districts can and will provide a list of teachers that is of a comparable quality to lists provided by schools in terms of teacher coverage.\nSubstantive Accuracy\nSubstantive accuracy refers to the accuracy of the items the districts reported about each teacher. The districts provided lists of teacher names, along with the teacher\u2019s subject matter, full-time or part-time status, teaching experience, and likelihood of continuing teaching. This information is used for teacher sampling; therefore, the accuracy of the information is important. The results in this section compare the responses of the corresponding districts and schools across the panels.\nThe information reported for each teacher independently by the district and the paired school was compared for each of the substantive items. A total of 60 district lists were compared to the electronic list or the TLF provided by the school. Any discrepancies were verified by calling both the school and district, and the results of these contacts were documented. The results for each list pair were compared for each of the substantive questions. For each school, analysts classified the accuracy in the following categories:\n\u2022 school list more accurate than the district list (labeled \u201cSchool list more accurate\u201d); \u2022 school list less accurate than the district list (labeled \u201cDistrict list more accurate\u201d); and \u2022 school list neither more nor less accurate than the district list (labeled \u201cLists equally accurate\u201d).\nTable F-6 presents the frequencies based on the above accuracy classification overall and for each of the substantive items. Overall, 19 (32 percent) of the school lists and 14 (23 percent) of the district lists were determined to be more accurate than their paired list. The remaining 27 (45 percent) of the corresponding school and district lists were determined to be equally accurate. Comparing the accuracy of the detailed teacher information from the schools and districts, the modal category for all but one item is, \u201cLists equally accurate.\u201d When one list was more accurate than the other, the school list was more likely to be accurate; however, in most instances, the difference between the number of school lists and district lists that were more accurate than their paired list was relatively small.\nTable F-6.

As shown in table F-7, the electronic school list was generally more accurate than the paired district list, though, in many cases, the lists were equally accurate. As shown in table F-8, when the school completed a paper TLF, the lists were generally equally accurate overall and for each substantive item.

When differences occurred, the school and district were each more accurate in 12 cases. There were a variety of reasons for discrepancies in the subject matter. Many discrepancies occurred because a teacher taught multiple subjects, and the school or district listed only one of the subjects. Many of the errors were the results of the school marking an incorrect subject. A few cases had, for instance, fifth- or sixth-grade teachers listed as general elementary teachers, but these teachers taught specific subjects. The discrepancies arose when the school or district would list the specific subject taught and the other would list general elementary. In a couple of instances, a teacher used to teach one subject (what district reported), but now teaches a new subject; in these cases, the district didn\u2019t have updated records. Finally, another common mistake was that both schools and districts would classify subjects such as physical education, music, and art as \u201cgeneral elementary\u201d rather than \u201cother.\u201d\n\nTables F-7 and F-8 show that examining the different school groups by whether the school provided an electronic list or completed a paper form did not change the conclusion that the districts and schools reported teachers\u2019 subject matter at similar levels of accuracy.\n\n\fF-10 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nFull-time/Part-time Status Discrepancies\nOverall, 39 of 56 list pairs (70 percent) reported part- or full-time status with the same level of accuracy. As presented in table F-6, when differences occurred, the school was more accurate in 10 cases and the district was more accurate in seven cases. The reported errors occurred when schools marked part-time, indicating teachers were part-time at the school but full-time in the district. The converse also occurred; some schools listed teachers as full-time and the district had marked the teacher part-time because the teacher worked part-time in multiple schools. Each respondent made errors in a manner that may have been the result of not fully reading or understanding the directions, but the errors were not significantly more likely by either respondent, nor did they appear to present a systematic bias.\nTables F-7 and F-8 show that examining the different school groups by whether the school provided an electronic list or completed a paper form did not change the conclusion that the districts and schools reported teachers\u2019 full- or part-time status at similar levels of accuracy.\nTeaching Experience Discrepancies\nOverall, 15 of 52 list pairs (29 percent) reported teachers\u2019 experience with the same level of accuracy. As presented in table F-6, when differences occurred, the school was more accurate in 20 cases and the district was more accurate in 17 cases. Teaching experience discrepancies reported by the schools were often a result of the schools reporting their best estimate, which was not as accurate as the district report. Many of the schools reported that the district probably had better information on teacher experience. One school reported that they called their teachers and asked for their total experience, resulting in numbers that did not match the district-reported numbers. A few of the districts making errors reported the experience of teachers only for the sample school, rather than all the schools in which the teacher had taught.\nTables F-7 and F-8 show that examining the two school groups by whether the school provided an electronic list or completed a paper form did not change the conclusion that the districts and schools reported teachers\u2019 experience at similar levels of accuracy.\nDiscrepancies in Whether Teacher is Expected to be Teaching Next Year\nOverall, 32 of 39 list pairs (82 percent) reported teachers\u2019 expected status next year with the same level of accuracy. As presented in table F-6, when differences occurred, the school was more accurate in six cases and the district was more accurate in one case. Most districts and schools provided this information, but this had the lowest response among the requested items. When asked why it was omitted, most respondents said the information was accessible, but they omitted it because it was time consuming to access. Most of the discrepancies between the school and district occurred as a result of the district not having an updated list of teachers planning to quit or retire the following year.\nTables F-7 and F-8 show that examining the two school groups by whether the school provided an electronic list or completed a paper form did not change the conclusion that the districts and schools reported teachers\u2019 status for the following year at similar levels of accuracy.\nDependent Verification\nAn additional aspect of the field test was a dependent verification. In the dependent verification group, schools were sent traditional paper TLFs prepopulated with the teacher information that the districts provided electronically. The dependent verification was included in case a second step was needed to improve the accuracy of the district-reported data. In fact, the district-reported data in the independent test was of comparable quality to the school-reported data, so a dependent process will not be needed if this methodology is implemented in the next SASS. The dependent results, however, reinforce the independent results with respect to the quality of data. In 40 percent of these dependent verifications,\n\n\fAppendix F. Summary of the 2009 Field Test Findings and\n\nRecommendations for the 2011\u201312 SASS Methodology\n\nF-11\n\ndistricts were found to be equally as accurate as the schools. In just over half of the cases, the schools were found to be more accurate than the districts, but the overall gross error rate for the districts was still only 5.2 percent. It should be noted that this dependent verification would not catch school errors since the schools are confirming rather than independently reporting teacher lists.\nSummary of Teacher Coverage and Substantive Accuracy\nThe preceding findings have answered the second primary research question. Districts were able to provide a list of teachers that was comparable in accuracy to the lists provided by schools. Moving beyond teacher coverage, it is clear that districts have access to and the willingness to provide the teacherlevel substantive sampling information. The results suggest that, given the appropriate assistance with an Excel template, districts provide either equally accurate or more accurate information across most measures. It is also important to note that districts responded at a higher rate than schools in this study. All of these findings weigh in favor of the new methodology when considering the potential value of any changes to the SASS collection methodology.\nInformation Availability and Timing\n\nThe website that respondents used to provide their list of teachers included several follow-up questions. The first follow-up question asked around what date the school or district would be able to provide a complete listing of teachers working in the school(s). Seventy-four districts and 21 schools responded to this question; however, not all responding entities provided a list of teachers. Responses to the follow-up questions indicated that there is a wide range of dates that schools and districts are able to provide the information for their full roster of teachers. Overall, it does appear that many of the districts may be able to provide this information earlier than the schools. Table F-9 provides the number of districts and schools that reported being able to provide a list of teachers during each month. A substantially higher percentage of districts than schools could report teacher rosters before July (32 percent and 14 percent, respectively). However, it should be noted that all schools reported being able to provide the information by November, while a few districts would not have full roster information available until December.\nTable F-9.

Ninety-six districts and schools\n\n\fF-12 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nanswered these questions. All respondents said that they would be able to provide the grade range of each school in sample. Four of the 75 districts and two of the 21 schools that responded said they would not be able to provide total enrollment; all others said they would be able to do so.\nThe final question asked what office or area of the school district prepared the listing of teachers. Overwhelmingly, the district files came from the Human Resources Department. Other sources included the Superintendent\u2019s office, the Finance Department, and the Information Technology Department. Some districts even obtained the list from the school.\nDebriefing Questions\nAfter the data collection ended, the Census Bureau called some school districts to ask them follow-up questions. Districts were called for one of three reasons: the district provided a file, but not in Excel; the district provided a file, but did not include all of the requested information; or the district did not provide a file.\nDistricts That Provided a File, but Not in Excel\nAlmost all schools and districts in the sample provided their files in Excel. For districts that provided a file, but not in Excel, the Census Bureau staff contacted the respondent by phone to ask if the district was able to export their teacher data into Excel. If yes, staff asked if it was a difficult or time-consuming process, and if no, staff asked in what other formats the district could provide the file. Finally, staff asked if it would have been easier to produce a hard copy listing of the requested information. Only two districts provided a file that was not in Excel. One of the districts said it was not possible this year to export the data into Excel, but next year they would be able to provide an Excel file. This district also said that in the future, they would rather provide a paper copy of the TLF, but that it is not too hard for them to provide electronically. The other district said they are only able to do it in PDF format, but that it was extremely easy and they would be happy to supply the information again electronically in the future.\nDistricts That Provided a File, but Did Not Include All the Requested Information\nFor districts that provided a file, but not all the requested information, the Census Bureau staff contacted the respondent by phone to ask why the respondent was unable to provide the items missing and determine the best source for this information. One district that did not include full-time/part-time status, experience, and expected teaching status for next year said that they thought they had included the information, but mistakenly forgot it. The respondent said the information was easily accessible and that they could provide it in the future. Finally, she said it would definitely be better to contact the district for information in the future and that their schools forward anything like this to them anyway. Another district forgot to identify at which school each teacher listed was teaching. The respondent said in future surveys they would make sure it is clarified and that because it is a small district, it would not matter either way if the information was collected from the school or district. The last district did not list subject taught, full-time/part-time status, or expected teaching status for next year. The district pulled all the information from a report that is available within the district. There is no running list of updated information, so the information provided is all that is available. The district suggested obtaining the information from the state.\nDistricts That Did Not Provide a File\nFor districts that did not provide a file, the Census Bureau contacted the district staff by phone to ask if the district would have the ability to electronically provide: 1) a full roster of teachers; 2) grade levels; and 3) total enrollment numbers for schools in their districts. Of the 12 districts called, only one stated that they would not be able to provide teacher names. The remaining stated that in the future they would be able to provide the information requested. All but one district stated that they could provide the\n\n\fAppendix F. Summary of the 2009 Field Test Findings and\n\nRecommendations for the 2011\u201312 SASS Methodology\n\nF-13\n\ninformation before or during the school year. The remaining district stated that the information would not be available until after the school year began.\n\nCaveats\n\nThere are a few caveats that should be noted when reviewing the results of the field test. The sample sizes for this study were limited, so the level of confidence in these results is somewhat limited. To illustrate, assuming simple random sampling, a sample size of 60 would require about a 4.5 percent difference in gross error rates to say there is a difference. A sample size of 175 would require a 2.7 percent difference.\n\nIn addition, the panels were not assigned randomly. This could have introduced a state effect. However, since all panels were selected from multiple states, the potential impact of this is likely to be small. The time of year could also have had an impact. In SASS, list collection begins in August and is mostly completed by November. The data collection for the field test began on November 23, 2009, and was completed on March 26, 2010.\n\nAnother potential drawback is that districts may refuse to provide the list and may refuse to allow their schools to participate in the SASS when contacted. In the field test, two large districts refused for their schools. This eliminated 25 schools from the test and could have a significant impact in the SASS if districts are contacted rather than schools.\n\nRecommendation\n\nBased on the results of the field test, the Census Bureau recommended implementing the methodology for the 2011\u201312 SASS. The data collection operations conducted for the field test worked well and resulted in a response rate of 72 percent for all districts. The Census Bureau recommended that similar operations be implemented for the 2011\u201312 SASS. District offices should be contacted by telephone prior to the beginning of SASS data collection to determine the appropriate contact person for the list of teachers. As the districts that were asked to provide the teacher list using the Excel template had a higher response rate and provided more accurate teacher data, the initial letter should request that the district provide a list of teachers using the Excel template. Follow-up efforts should include a reminder letter and telephone follow-up.\n\nIf districts are unable to complete the electronic version or prefer a paper copy, then a paper TLF should be available as well. If districts refuse to provide the information or do not respond to the request, then the Census Bureau should contact the schools and ask them to provide this information either electronically or by completing a paper TLF.\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank.\n\n\fG-1\nAppendix G.

G-53\n\n\fG-2 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nIntroduction\nIn the spring and summer of 2010, the Census Bureau contracted with ICF Macro, a research and evaluation company headquartered in Calverton, Maryland, to plan and carry out a series of cognitive interviews with teachers, principals, and school district personnel. The purpose of these interviews was to gather feedback on proposed questions for the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), a national educational survey that is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Census Bureau. This report is a summary of the feedback that ICF Macro collected from participants, as well as recommendations for revisions to the items.\nThe SASS consists of several different instruments, including a questionnaire for teachers, a questionnaire for principals, a questionnaire that asks for information about a school\u2019s programs and resources, and a questionnaire that is completed by personnel at the school district level. In this case, the Census Bureau asked that ICF Macro test proposed questions for all four of these instruments.\nParticipants were recruited from several sources, including a list provided by NCES of schools and educators in the SASS sampling frame, a list purchased from an outside vendor, and an ICF Macro database of educators. An e-mail was sent out to potential participants that described the study and offered an incentive to those who participated. Interested participants who contacted ICF Macro by telephone or e-mail were then screened and scheduled for an interview.\nInterviews for all of the questionnaires averaged 45 to 60 minutes and were conducted by phone. Prior to each interview, the participant was e-mailed a copy of the proposed items and told to print them out. Participants in the teacher, principal, and school questionnaire testing were asked not to read the items before the interview. Participants in the district testing were asked to review the items before the interview to ensure that they had the information they would need to respond.\nDuring the interview, participants were asked to answer each of the proposed items as they normally would if they were answering a paper survey. As they answered each item, they were asked to \u201cthink aloud\u201d\u2014that is, to describe out loud what they were thinking as they read and answered the question and point out anything that surprised or confused them. After the participant had answered a set of items, the interviewer would then ask a series of follow-up questions or probes and get clarification of responses as necessary. If a skip pattern caused a participant not to respond to an item, he or she was later asked to review the item and provide feedback.\nThe following sections address each of the four questionnaires\u2014district, school, principal, and teacher\u2014 separately. Each section provides a brief summary of the participants that were recruited, and then provides findings and recommendations for each of the tested items.\nTesting of Items for the District Questionnaire\nDescription of Participants\nTwelve district representatives were interviewed to obtain their feedback on the proposed items to the district questionnaire. Three of the representatives were from small districts (of 1,000 or fewer students), seven were from medium districts (of 1,001\u20133,500 students), and two represented large districts (of 3,500 or more students). Participants were from the following states:\n\u2022 California; \u2022 Georgia; \u2022 Massachusetts;\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-3\n\n\u2022 Michigan; \u2022 Nebraska; \u2022 New Jersey; \u2022 Ohio; \u2022 Pennsylvania; \u2022 Tennessee; \u2022 Virginia; and \u2022 Washington\n\nSummary of Findings\n\nThe following section summarizes the results of the interviews testing items for the District SASS Questionnaire. Under each item tested, we describe key findings as well as recommendations.\n\nITEM 1 Around the first of October, how many SHORT-TERM substitute teachers of any grades K\u201312 were eligible to teach in this district? Record HEAD COUNTS, not FTEs (full-time equivalent). Do NOT include teachers who teach ONLY prekindergarten, postsecondary, or adult education.\n__ __ __ Short-term substitute teachers\nFindings\n\u2022 Approximately half of participants were able to answer this item accurately and provide an exact head count.\no Two participants estimated the answer because the district does not keep a list for prior years. (This problem was largely due to the timing of the interviews, and would be less of a problem in November, when the survey is administered.)\no One participant was unable to answer this item because a third party provides substitutes for the district and the district does not have access to the total number in that \u201cpool.\u201d She would have left the question blank.\no One participant interpreted \u201celigible to teach\u201d as meaning only fully-licensed substitutes. Thus, she included only fully licensed substitutes in her count, even though the district also uses substitutes who are not fully licensed.\no One participant provided the number of substitutes used, rather than those who were available.\n\u2022 None of the participants included substitutes who teach only prekindergarten, postsecondary, or adult education.\nRecommendations\n\u2022 No modifications are recommended for this item.\n\n\fG-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nITEM 2 Does this district have a policy to encourage teacher attendance or prevent teachers from using an excessive amount of unplanned leave? (e.g., buying back unused leave, counting unused leave toward retirement, rewards for perfect attendance)\n__ Yes __ No\nFindings \u2022 In general, participants easily understood what this item was asking and responded accurately.\n\u2022 All participants interpreted \u201cunplanned leave\u201d as taking sick or personal leave that was not scheduled in advance.\n\u2022 When asked to provide examples of policies that might be included in this item, participants\u2019 responses included:\no buying back unused sick and/or personal leave (annually or at retirement);\no applying unused sick leave toward retirement; and\no receiving a bonus for not exceeding a certain number of sick days in a school year.\n\u2022 One participant responded \u201cYes\u201d but was unsure if the policy in his district should count, as it is actually a stipulation in the teachers\u2019 contracts and not technically a district-level policy.\nRecommendations \u2022 No modifications are recommended for this item.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-5\n\nITEM 3\nAre the following criteria used in considering applicants for teaching positions in this district? Mark (X) only one box.\na. Full standard state certification for field to be taught \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nb. At least emergency or temporary state certification or endorsement for field to be taught \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nc. Graduation from a state-approved teacher education program \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nd. College major or minor in field to be taught \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\ne. Passing score on a STATE test of basic skills \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nf. Passing score on a STATE test of subject knowledge \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\ng. Passing score on a local DISTRICT test of basic skills or subject knowledge \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nh. Passing score on the Praxis Series Core Battery Test of Professional Knowledge \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\ni. Passing score on the Praxis II: Subject Assessment in a specific content area \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nj. Passing score on the Praxis III: Teacher Performance Assessment in a specific content area \uf0a8 Yes \uf0a8 No\nFindings\n\u2022 Some participants were unsure how to respond to some or all of parts (c) through (j) because these criteria are part of the requirement to be certified in their state, and are not specifically considered a district requirement. All of these participants responded \u201cYes\u201d to the relevant items.\n\n\fG-6 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 Part (a):\no Some participants were unsure of what was meant by \u201cfull standard state certification\u201d and thought this needed to be clarified. These participants were unclear whether this would include preliminary or alternative certification.\no Another participant responded \u201cYes\u201d (even though it does not matter what certification applicants hold) because she thought the district would \u201clook bad\u201d if she said \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u2022 Part (c): For one participant, the answer to part (c) would be \u201cYes\u201d for some teachers but \u201cNo\u201d for others\u2014for example, people with a business degree may teach business courses in his district without having graduated from a state-approved teacher education program. The participant responded \u201cNo\u201d to this item.\n\u2022 Part (d):\no For one participant, a major or minor in the field to be taught would only be considered if it were necessary for \u201chighly qualified\u201d status. She indicated that she would write in \u201cit depends.\u201d\no Another participant responded \u201cNo\u201d to this item because she felt it did not apply because there are only elementary school teachers in the district.\n\u2022 Part (g): One respondent answered \u201cYes\u201d to this item, even though the district does not have a test. He responded \u201cYes\u201d because if the district did have a test, it would be required.\n\u2022 Parts (e) through (j):\no Two participants had difficulty with these items because they were not sufficiently familiar with the requirements to be sure of the correct answers. However, if actually completing the survey, at least one of the two would have asked someone who knew the answers.\no Those participants who knew that the state test was the Praxis answered \u201cYes\u201d to both the state and Praxis questions.\nRecommendations \u2022 To clear up confusion about how to respond if a certain criterion is applied to some but not all applicants\nor positions, consider revising the wording as follows: \u201cAre the following criteria REQUIRED for any teaching positions in this district?\u201d\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-7\n\nITEM 4a\nLAST SCHOOL YEAR (2008\u20132009), how many teachers of the following types were DISMISSED or did not have their contracts renewed? Record HEAD COUNTS, not FTEs (full-time equivalent). If none, please mark (X) the box. If this district does not have a tenure system, please distinguish teachers based on the definitions provided. Please include only classroom teachers, which means any staff member who currently teaches any regularly scheduled classes in any of grades K\u201312. Please do NOT include short-term substitute teachers, aides, or librarians who only teach library skills or how to use the library.\na. Total DISMISSED teachers: Include both tenured and nontenured teachers. __ __ __ Teachers \uf0a8 None \uf0e0 GO TO item 6\nFindings\n\u2022 Nine of the participants reported that at least one teacher had been dismissed. For this entire series of items (4a through 4d), only one reported the FTE rather than head count.\n\u2022 All participants followed the skip pattern correctly.\n\u2022 Participants had a consistent understanding of who should be included in the count. For example, none of them said they would include a teacher\u2019s aide, but all would count a special education teacher who worked in several different classes.\n\u2022 The wording in the question stem, \u201cDISMISSED or did not have their contracts renewed,\u201d does not match the wording under part (a), \u201cTotal DISMISSED teachers.\u201d While no participants pointed this out, it could be potentially confusing to respondents.\nRecommendations\n\u2022 In order to maintain consistency between the question and the response option, consider revising the wording under (a) as follows: \u201cTotal teachers who were DISMISSED or did not have their contracts renewed.\u201d\nITEM 4b\nb.

She said that none of the teachers in her district were dismissed for that reason, but were not rehired because they failed to meet \u201chighly qualified teacher\u201d requirements. (This was her response to Item 5.)\n\u2022 All participants who responded to this item followed the skip pattern correctly.\nRecommendations \u2022 Consider providing a definition for and/or examples of \u201cpoor performance.\u201d\nITEM 4c c. Of those teachers dismissed as a result of POOR PERFORMANCE, how many were\nnontenured teachers? Nontenured teachers are often relatively inexperienced or novices. This includes teachers in their initial induction year, teachers who are on year-to-year contracts, and those teachers who have not entered a more permanent status, traditionally referred to as tenure. \uf0a8 None or __ __ __ Teachers\nFindings \u2022 All participants indicated that their district has a tenure system.\n\u2022 Some participants provided more specific definitions of a \u201cnontenured teacher,\u201d most of which included a description of a probationary period. However, all felt that the definition provided was sufficient and clear.\n\u2022 All participants who said they understood the term \u201cpoor performance\u201d found it easy to answer this question.\nRecommendations \u2022 No modifications are recommended for this item.\nITEM 4d d.

In cases where there was only one reason, participants left the second and third reasons blank.\n\u2022 One participant responded based on the most common reasons teachers are typically dismissed in the district, not just for that past year.\n\u2022 Five participants selected \u201c6\u2014Other\u201d as one of the most common reasons teachers were dismissed. These participants provided the following descriptions of why teachers had been dismissed:\no misconduct with students;\no personal reasons;\no duties and responsibilities;\no not a good fit;\no interns failing to complete all requirements to obtain their teaching license or certificate; and\no temporary hires being let go.\n\n\fG-10 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\u2022 One participant had two \u201cother\u201d reasons.

She then created \u201c7\u2014Other,\u201d wrote \u201ctemporary hires,\u201d and listed \u201c7\u201d as the third most common reason. This participant listed \u201c5\u2014Poor performance of teachers\u201d as the second most common reason.\n\u2022 Several participants suggested that \u201cinappropriate behavior with students,\u201d should be added to the list of possible responses. Another thought the item should specify how dismissals due to \u201cbudget issues\u201d should be categorized.\nRecommendations \u2022 Consider adding \u201cinappropriate behavior with students\u201d as a response option.\n\u2022 Consider adding \u201c(e.g., due to budget cuts)\u201d as an example for response option 3.\nITEM 6 Is there a salary schedule for TEACHERS in this district?\n__ Yes\uf0e0GO TO item 8. __ No\nFindings \u2022 All participants responded \u201cYes\u201d to this item.\n\u2022 None of the participants had any difficulty with the item itself; however, approximately half missed the skip pattern and responded to Item 7.\nRecommendations \u2022 Because problems with the skip pattern may be due to the testing environment, no modifications are\nrecommended for this item.\nITEM 7 What would be the normal yearly base salary for a teacher with a bachelor\u2019s degree and no teaching experience in this district?

Responses to part (f) were $7,000 to $27,000 higher than responses to part (d).\n\u2022 One respondent found it difficult to answer this question because the salary schedule in her district is organized by credits, not by educational degrees. For that reason, she noted that a Master\u2019s degree might fall into one of several columns on the schedule.\n\u2022 For two districts, teachers get a specific stipend for having a Master\u2019s degree. One participant wrote in this stipend separately (\u201c+$2,479\u201d) on parts (c) through (f). The other included it in her answer for parts (c) through (e), but wrote it in separately (\u201c+$2,000\u201d) only on part (f).\n\u2022 Part (f): One respondent wrote in the stipend that teachers receive for National Board Certification (\u201c+$2,479\u201d) as well as teaching a hard-to-staff subject (\u201c+$500\u201d).\nRecommendations\n\u2022 Consider including the following direction: \u201cInclude in your responses any stipends that teachers receive for educational degrees, but not stipends that are provided for other reasons (e.g., National Board certification).\u201d\n\u2022 To limit the number of instructions that are provided with this item, consider eliminating the instruction to \u201cReport in whole dollars.\u201d\n\n\fG-12 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nITEM 9a a.

All teachers indicated that they provided a permanent increase to base salary for years of service (part 1) and completion of degrees or credits (part 2).\nSome participants were not sure what was meant by \u201cnontest learning or behavioral objectives\u201d in parts (9) and (10). When asked to provide examples of what these objectives might be, participants mentioned behavioral objectives for special education students, citizenship, and \u201cfollowing the rules.\u201d However, none of the participants could provide examples of how these objectives could be tied to compensation.\nThe participant whose district allows teachers to attend fewer meetings if they meet achievement targets responded \u201cYes\u201d to part (7) and selected \u201cnoncash bonus.\u201d\nBased on participants\u2019 responses to Item 10a, none should have responded \u201cYes\u201d to Parts 3 to 13 of this item. However, this was not always the case:\nPart (3): More than one-third of participants indicated that they offer a permanent increase to salary or cash bonus to teachers who complete NBPTS certification. None of these participants, however, responded \u201cYes\u201d to Item 10a.\nPart (4): Two of the participants said their districts gave teachers a permanent increase to their base salary for completing professional development. Neither had responded \u201cYes\u201d to Item 10a.\nPart (6): One participant indicated that teachers may receive a permanent increase to their base salary tied to the results of administrator evaluations. She did not consider this to be part of an \u201calternative compensation system,\u201d and responded \u201cNo\u201d to Item 10a.\nPart (12): One participant said \u201cYes\u201d and selected \u201cpermanent increase to base salary\u201d because they do have a permanent increase to base pay for hard-to-staff subjects. This participant did not consider this to be part of an \u201calternative compensation system,\u201d and responded \u201cNo\u201d to Item 10a.\nPart (13): Two participants selected \u201cYes\u201d and \u201ccash bonus\u201d for this item\u2014one because school psychologists are given a cash bonus, and the other because teachers who mentor another teacher over the summer are given a cash bonus. As above, both responded \u201cNo\u201d to Item 10a.\nAll participants were able to distinguish between part (7) and part (8).\nThe current wording for this item asks about the features of the compensation system for \u201cteachers.\u201d When asked if their answers would change if the question specified \u201cK\u201312 teachers,\u201d participants indicated that their responses would remain the same.\n\n\fG-18 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nRecommendations\nThere were a number of inconsistencies between participants\u2019 responses to Item 10a and Item 11. Because of these inconsistencies, we would recommend eliminating Item 10a and defining whether a district has an alternative compensation system based on their answers to Item 11.\n\nITEM 12 Does this district grant high school diplomas?

There were several issues that came up related to this part of the item:\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-19\n\n\u2022 Participants were unsure whether part (e1) was supposed to be a subset of part (e). Based on responses, it appeared that most assumed that it was a subset\u2014that is, that the response to part (e1) had to be less than or equal to the number they placed in part (e).\n\u2022 Two participants were not sure why physical and biological sciences were treated as a single group. Because their districts require one year of biology and one year of physical science, they both wrote in under part (e1)\u201done year of each.\u201d\n\u2022 Most participants could not think of any science courses that would not fall under \u201cphysical or biological sciences.\u201d Therefore, several commented that they did not understand why part (e1) was separated from part (e).\n\u2022 Some participants thought this item was referring to whether students were required to take specific physical science or biology courses. In other words, if students were required to take one year of biology, one year of chemistry, and two years of additional science courses of their choosing, these participants would provide a response of 2.0 for part (e1)\u2014even if the two additional courses students took would likely be biology or physical science courses as well.\nRecommendations\nConsider revising the wording of Item part (e1) to more clearly reflect the intent of the question.\n\nITEM 14 Does this district have any prekindergarten students? __ Yes __ No\uf0e0 GO TO item 15a\nFindings Most participants did not have any difficulties with this item.\nOne participant hesitated because her district does not enroll any prekindergarten students, but does offer services to children of that age (e.g., rehabilitation services and speech therapy).

She noted that the closer to the date she was asked, the better the estimate would be.\nOne participant was able to provide the total number of students approved for free or reduced price lunch, but was not able to break that number down between K\u201312 and PreK students. She indicated that if the survey came during the school year, she would be able to better answer the question because the person who has access to that information is a 10-month employee and is not there during the summer.\nRecommendations\nNo modifications are recommended for this item.\n\nItems Related to Collecting Information and Increasing Participation\n\nIn addition to testing the previous items for the Schools and Staffing Survey, the Census provided ICF Macro with several other questions related to collecting information and increasing participation from districts. Responses to these items are provided below.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-21\n\nPrincipal Contact Information\nAll but one participant indicated that they would be willing to provide the U.S. Department of Education (ED) with the names and e-mail addresses of the principals in their district. The remaining participant indicated that she would have to first get permission from the superintendant.\nSix participants said the list of schools and principals would be finalized in July, two said it could be as early as May, two said no sooner than August 1, and the remaining participant indicated that the lists would be finalized in June.\nAll but one of the participants indicated that their district had a public website with principal e-mails.\nAll participants would be willing to provide principals\u2019 names and e-mail addresses over the phone for up to approximately 10 schools. All were also willing to provide this information by e-mail as an Excel attachment. However, participants in smaller districts thought it would be easier to do so in the body of an e-mail, rather than as an attachment.\nAll participants said that they could provide a table of principal contact information either for all schools in their district, or for a subset identified by ED. A few thought it might be easier to provide the information for a subset only, but most had no preference. All participants were also willing to fax principal contact information to the Census Bureau or ED.\nAll but two participants would be willing to upload a file to a website, provided that it was secure. The other two were concerned that uploading the file might be more complicated or time-consuming than emailing or faxing the information.\nTeacher Contact Information\nAll but one participant said they would be willing and able to provide ED with a list of all teachers working at their schools, and would be able to identify those teachers who were in their first year of teaching. The participant who was unwilling to do so said it would be cumbersome to get this information. She also had concerns about teachers\u2019 privacy, and indicated that she would have to know exactly what the information would be used for.\nGrade Range and Closing Information for Schools\nAll participants said they would be willing and able to provide the range of grades served by the schools in their district and to identify whether any of the schools had closed.\nIdeas for Increasing Participation\nParticipants were asked whether they had any ideas of what could be included with the survey to make it more likely that districts would participate. Suggestions provided by participants included providing a specific due date for when districts should respond, including a \u201cpress release\u201d with more information about the study, or providing more detailed information about how participants\u2019 privacy would be ensured.\n\n\fG-22 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nTesting of Items for the School Questionnaire\nDescription of Participants\nTwelve principals were interviewed to obtain their feedback on items on the school questionnaire. Four were elementary school principals, four were middle school principals, and four were high school principals. The following states and the District of Columbia were represented:\n\u2022 Arizona; \u2022 Maryland; \u2022 Michigan; \u2022 Minnesota; \u2022 Ohio; \u2022 Pennsylvania; \u2022 South Carolina; \u2022 Wisconsin; and \u2022 District of Columbia Half of these participants were charter school principals, five were public school principals, and one was a private school principal.\nSummary of Findings\nThe following section summarizes the results of the interviews testing items for the School SASS Questionnaire. Under each item tested, we describe key findings as well as recommendations.\nITEM 1a Does this school have any special requirements for admission other than proof of immunization, age, or residence? __ Yes __ No \uf0e0 GO TO item 2a\nFindings Approximately one-third of participants did not follow the skip pattern correctly. After responding \u201cNo\u201d to this item, they continued to Item 1b instead of going to Item 2a.\nOnly one of the 12 respondents had admission requirements at their school that could be considered \u201cspecial\u201d\u2014a principal at an alternative school that only accepts \u201cover aged\u201d students. However, this participant responded \u201cNo\u201d to this item.\nOne principal at a public elementary school seemed to misread the question and responded \u201cyes,\u201d even though her school had no special requirements for admission.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-23\n\nRecommendations\nAlthough one-third of participants did not follow the skip pattern correctly, this could be partly due to the fact that they were in a testing environment and thought they had to answer every question, even though they were initially told to follow all skip patterns.\nTo better emphasize the skip pattern, consider rephrasing the question as follows, \u201cDoes this school use any requirements other than proof of immunization, age, or residence when deciding whether to admit students?\u201d\n\n\fG-24 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nITEM 1b\n\nDoes this school use the following requirements for admission?\n\nAdmission test\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nStandardized achievement test\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nAcademic record\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nSpecial student needs (e.g., students \u201cat risk\u201d or with disabilities)\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nSpecial student aptitudes, skills, or talents\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nPersonal interview\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nRecommendations\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nLottery system\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nSchool-parent compact\n\n(This is a contract between school community members [e.g., parents, principals, teachers, and\n\nstudents] that acknowledges the shared responsibility for student learning and/or the school\u2019s policies)\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nFindings\nParticipants who should have skipped this question proceeded to answer it, by identifying items from the list that they used in their admission process. For example:\n\u2022 Several schools requested students\u2019 academic record (part 3) and so principals in these schools selected this option even though it was not a requirement for admission.\n\u2022 Several charter schools also used a lottery system only if they had more students trying to register than available spaces in a given year. Some of these principals responded \u201cYes,\u201d and others responded \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u2022 All participants were asked to provide feedback on this question regardless of whether or not they should have answered it. Questions some participants were confused by or commented on are summarized below:\no Part (2): One alternative school principal who uses standardized tests to determine the academic level of incoming students was not sure how to answer this question. He left it blank.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-25\n\no Part (4): Two charter school principals said they did not understand what this question was asking.\no Part (8): For the most part, participants shared a common understanding of how a \u201clottery system\u201d worked. However, some principals explained it as a random draw process that all students needed to participate in to be admitted to the school, while other principals explained it as the random draw process that waitlisted students participated in to fill remaining seats.\no Part (9): Most participants understanding of a \u201cschool-parent compact\u201d aligned with the definition provided in the item. However, one participant had a very different understanding. She stated, \u201cA compact would be for parents who do work for the school. Like parents that work to help to get a charter started or make other contributions. The compact ensures admission of their child in exchange for the work.\u201d A compact (the listed definition or her own definition) was not a requirement of admission to this principal\u2019s school, so her confusion about what a compact is did not impact her answer.\nRecommendations As shown below, consider making four changes to this item:\n\u2022 Changing the wording of the question;\n\u2022 Adding the phrase \u201cstudent scores\u201d to parts (1) and (2);\n\u2022 Changing the examples for parts (4) and (5); and\n\u2022 Changing the wording of part (8).\nDoes this school use the following criteria when deciding whether to admit students?\nStudent scores on an admission test\nStudent scores on a standardized achievement test\nAcademic record\nSpecial needs (e.g., giving preference to students \u201cat-risk\u201d or students with disabilities)\nSpecial aptitudes, skills, or talents (e.g., giving preference to academically gifted, or fine arts students)\nA personal interview\nRecommendations\nA lottery system in which new students must participate\nA signed school-parent compact (This is a contract between school community members [e.g., parents, principals, teachers, and students] that acknowledges the shared responsibility for student learning and/or the school\u2019s policies.)\n\n\fG-26 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nITEM 2\n\nAre the following programs or services currently available AT THIS SCHOOL for students in any of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels, regardless of funding source?\n\nExtended day program providing instruction beyond the normal school day for students who need academic assistance\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nBefore-school or afterschool day care programs\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nBefore-school or afterschool enrichment programs\n\n__\n\nYes\n\n__\n\nNo\n\nFindings\nEvery participant responded \u201cYes\u201d to at least one question.\nPrincipals had different understandings of what distinguished part (a) (extended day programs) from part (c) (enrichment programs). Most participants thought that item (a) referred to programs that provide support for children that are struggling or need remediation, while option (c) would be open to all students or those who are \u201con-track.\u201d However:\n\u2022 Two principals thought there was no difference between part (a) and (c), because all before-school and afterschool programs are extended day programs that offer enrichment.\n\u2022 Another principal thought that programs under part (a) would be open to all students, while enrichment programs under part (c) would be open to struggling students or those who volunteer.\n\n\u2022 Most principals shared a common understanding of the difference between part (b) (day care programs) and part (c) (enrichment programs). They indicated that day care programs did not offer instruction to students, and they were primarily to \u201cbabysit\u201d students. A few principals did comment that a before or afterschool day care program could also be considered an extended day program.\n\n\u2022 Two principals commented that they were unfamiliar with the phrase \u201ccomparable ungraded levels.\u201d One thought it referred to schools that offered prekindergarten. The other thought that the use of the term \u201cungraded\u201d was referring to how schools compared with each other (i.e., use of \u201cgrades\u201d for accountability). Both principals, however, eventually ignored the phrase and continued to answer the question as intended.\nRecommendations\nAs shown below, consider making two changes to this item:\n\n\u2022 Changing the wording of parts (a) and (c) to make the difference between them clearer;\n\u2022 Changing the order so that parts (a) and (c) are adjacent (again, to make the two parts easier for participants to distinguish).\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-27\n\nBefore-school or afterschool programs providing students who need academic assistance with instruction beyond the normal school day (e.g., tutoring, homework help)\nBefore-school or afterschool enrichment programs providing students with advanced academic instruction not available in the regular curriculum (e.g. <<insert appropriate examples here>>)\nBefore-school or afterschool day care programs\n\nITEM 3a For THIS school year (2009\u201310), were there teaching vacancies in this school; that is, teaching positions for which teachers were recruited and interviewed? __ Yes __ No \uf0e0 GO TO item 4\nFindings\nMost principals did not have difficulty answering this question. However, there were some inconsistencies in how the question was interpreted.\nOne principal knew he had vacancies for 2009\u20132010 in June of 2009, and filled the vacancies in June 2009 prior to the start of the 2009\u20132010 school year. He did not consider these positions when answering this question.\nAnother principal interpreted \u201cfor which teachers were recruited and interviewed\u201d to mean positions for which he had multiple candidates. He indicated that if he had a teaching vacancy that he filled using a current teacher, he would not count that position for this question.\nOne principal interpreted \u201cfor which teachers were recruited and interviewed\u201d to mean positions for which he recruited and interviewed but did not hire a teacher\u2014that is, unfilled vacancies.\nOne principal said her school does not \u201crecruit,\u201d because all vacancies are sent to the teachers\u2019 union and she only interviews and selects from the candidates the union provides to her. However, she still responded \u201cYes\u201d to this question as she thought this was what was intended.\nAnother principal also indicated that he does not \u201crecruit\u201d because he routinely has multiple candidates for each position and does not have to. This principal therefore responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question.\nRecommendations\nConsider rephrasing this question as follows:\n\u201cFor THIS school year (2009\u20132010), were there any teaching vacancies in this school that you filled, or tried to fill?\u201d\n\n\fG-28 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nITEM 3b\n\nb.

However, one principal still could not explain the difference, while two said there was no difference between the columns.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-29\n\nThere was some inconsistency in how middle school principals responded to the questions about science positions. These principals indicated that their science teachers generally did not specialize in specific subjects, but taught grade-level curricula that covered multiple subjects. One principal \u201ctriple-counted\u201d these teachers (i.e., included the teacher under all three science categories), while other principals counted the teacher once under the primary science content taught by the teacher.\nAll high school principals shared a common understanding of what positions could be classified as biology or life sciences. About half the high school principals were able to provide an example of a \u201cphysical science\u201d course, and only one high school principal could provide an example of an \u201cother natural science\u201d course; her examples were botany or astronomy.\nRecommendations\nProvide examples of physical sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry) and \u201cother natural sciences\u201d (e.g., environmental science, earth science).\nConsider adding a \u201cmiddle school science\u201d or \u201cgeneral science\u201d position to the list.\nConsider different labels for these categories (e.g., \u201cPosition does not exist at this school\u201d and \u201cNo vacancies this year.\u201d)\n\nITEM 4\nIs this school a public CHARTER school? (A charter school is a public school that, in accordance with an enabling state statute, has been granted a charter exempting it from selected state or local rules and regulations. A charter school may be a newly created school or it may previously have been a public or private school.) __ Yes __ No \uf0e0 End survey\nFindings\nMost principals did not have any difficulty answering this question. However, two principals (one of a charter and one of a traditional public school) commented that charter schools are not necessarily exempted from state or local rules. In neither case did this impact their answers to the question.\nRecommendations\nAlthough there was some disagreement with the definition of charter school used, all participants understood the question. No modifications are recommended.\n\nITEM 5 Which of the following best describes the origin of this public charter school? __ A converted public school __ A converted Bureau of Indian Education-funded school __ A converted private school __ A school originally established as a charter\nFindings All six principals who worked at charter schools knew the origin of their school, and most did not have difficulty answering this item. One principal of a school originally established as a charter, however, said\n\n\fG-30 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nshe did not understand the terms \u201cconverted public school,\u201d or \u201cconverted Bureau of Indian Educationfunded school.\u201d\nOne principal said his school took over the charter of another charter school. He correctly responded, \u201cA school originally established as a charter.\u201d\nOne charter school principal added that private charter schools exist in Atlanta, and the authors of this survey may want to distinguish this type of school from other types. Recommendations No modifications are suggested for this item.\nITEM 6 Who granted the current charter? __ A school district __ The State Board of Education __ Postsecondary institution __ A state charter-granting agency __ Other \uf0e0 What is the name of the chartering agency? ______________________________________________\nFindings Charter school principals did not have any difficulty answering this item.\nOne principal commented that a charter school could fall into more than one category if its charter was granted by a partnership (e.g., of a State Board of Education and a postsecondary institution). Other participants thought that the categories were mutually exclusive.\nRecommendations No modifications are suggested for this item.\nITEM 7 Which of the following best describes the governance structure of this public charter school? __ An independent or standalone charter school __ Part of a nonprofit charter management organization or network of schools that are managed by a central agency __ Part of a for-profit management organization or network of schools that are managed by a central agency __ Part of a traditional public school district __ Other \uf0e0 Please describe _________________________________________________\nFindings All charter school principals knew the governance structure of their school and were able to respond correctly to the item.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-31\n\nOne principal did not understand the phrase \u201cnetwork of schools that are managed by a central agency.\u201d His school is managed by a company that also manages other charter schools (a charter management organization), but he did not consider this a \u201cnetwork of schools.\u201d After some time, he eventually ignored that phrase in the question and was able to answer the question correctly.\nRecommendations\nNo modifications are suggested for this item.\n\nITEM 8a\nDoes this school have a library media center?\nA library media center is an organized collection of printed and/or audiovisual and/or computer resources which is administered as a unit, is located in a designated place or places, and makes resources and services available to students, teachers, and administrators. A library media center may be called a school library, media center, resource center, information center, instructional materials center, learning resource center, or any other similar name. __ Yes __ No \uf0e0 End survey\nFindings\nParticipants did not have any difficulty answering this item. All indicated that the description of a \u201clibrary media center\u201d seemed appropriate to them.\nTwo respondents suggested that the item refer to a \u201clibrary/media center,\u201d rather than \u201clibrary media center.\u201d One of the two indicated that her school had both a library and a media center, and thought the item should not treat them as the same; however, this did not appear to affect her response.\nRecommendations\nNo modifications are suggested for this item.\n\nItem 8b\nIs the library media center open to community members who do not attend, or have children who attend, this school? __ Yes __ No \uf0e0 End survey\nFindings\nSeveral participants found the wording of the phrase \u201ccommunity members who do not attend, or have children who attend this school\u201d to be confusing. One person, for example, pointed out that this phrase could be interpreted as referring to community members who either (a) do not attend this school, or (b) have children who attend this school\u2014when, obviously, the intent of the item is the opposite of (b).\nTwo respondents commented that community groups (such as church organizations) can rent their school facilities outside of school hours through an outside agency, such that the school would not be involved in the transaction. They said that while these groups typically rent auditoriums or other open spaces, they did not see a reason why the outside groups could not also rent the library media center. However, both respondents answered \u201cNo\u201d to this item because they assumed that was not the intent of the item.\n\n\fG-32 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nRecommendations\nReplace the phrase \u201ccommunity members who do not attend, or have children who attend, this school\u201d with \u201ccommunity members who do not have children who attend this school.\u201d The meaning of the suggested change is slightly different from the original in that it leaves out the reference to community members who do not attend the school themselves. We believe this is unlikely to be a problem, because most survey respondents would not consider current students to be \u201ccommunity members.\u201d\nIf NCES does not wish to change the meaning of the phrase in question, we recommend using the phrase \u201ccommunity members who do not attend this school and do not have children who attend this school.\nItem 8c\nMay community members who do not attend, or have children who attend, this school use the library media center during the following times? During regular school hours __ Yes __ No During the week, outside of regular school hours __ Yes __ No On weekends, outside of regular school hours __ Yes __ No\nFindings\nAgain, several participants commented on the wording of the phrase \u201ccommunity members who do not attend, or have children who attend, this school\u201d as described in the findings from Item 8b (above). No additional problems arose with this question.\nParticipants that answered \u201cNo\u201d to Item 8b followed the skip pattern correctly and did not respond to Item 8c. When asked how they would have answered, one of these participants indicated that she would have answered \u201cYes\u201d to parts 2 and 3 of Item 8c. (This was one of the participants who had said \u201cNo\u201d to Item 8b, even though the school\u2019s library media center could be rented by community members through an outside agency. She indicated that her answer to Item 8c reflected the times during which the library media center could be rented.)\nRecommendations\nIf changes are made to the wording of Item 8b, implement the same changes to Item 8c for consistency. No other modifications are suggested for this item.\nItem 8d\nMay community members who do not attend, or have children who attend, this school use library media computer workstations to access the Internet? __ Yes __ No, it is not permitted __ No, there are no computer workstations __ No, there is no internet access\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-33\n\nFindings As with Items 8b and 8c, several participants commented on the wording of the phrase \u201ccommunity members who do not attend, or have children who attend this school.\u201d\nTwo participants noticed that the word \u201ccenter\u201d appeared to be missing from Item 8d (i.e., referring to the phrase \u201clibrary media computer workstations\u201d).\nOne person said that the first response option should read, \u201cYes, with conditions,\u201d because Internet use in her school is subject to the district\u2019s Acceptable Use policy. However, she indicated that if this option did not appear (as in the version tested), she would select \u201cYes.\u201d\nParticipants that answered \u201cNo\u201d to Item 8b followed the skip pattern correctly, and did not answer this item. These participants were subsequently asked to review the item and provide feedback.\nRecommendations If changes are made to the wording of Items 8b and 8c, implement the same changes to Item 8d for consistency.\nTo maintain consistency across items, add the word \u201ccenter\u201d after the phrase \u201clibrary media.\u201d\n\n\fG-34 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nTesting of Items for the Principal Questionnaire\nDescription of Participants\nTwelve principals were interviewed to obtain their feedback on items on the principal questionnaire. Four were elementary school principals, four were middle school principals, and four were high school principals. The following states and the District of Columbia were represented:\n\u2022 Alabama; \u2022 California; \u2022 Illinois; \u2022 Maryland; \u2022 North Carolina; \u2022 Pennsylvania; \u2022 South Carolina; \u2022 Wisconsin; and \u2022 District of Columbia.\nSummary of Findings\nThe following section summarizes the results of the interviews testing items for the principal questionnaire. Under each item tested, we describe key findings as well as recommendations. Census modified several items that were especially problematic during the initial testing of the principal SASS items. ICF Macro contacted the principals who had participated in the initial testing to test the revised items. Findings from the revised items are presented after the findings from the items originally tested. Findings from the Initial Testing\nITEM 1 Do you currently hold a license/certificate in \u201cschool administration\u201d? __ Yes __ No\nFindings Participants generally had no difficulty answering this item; all but one participant responded \u201cYes.\u201d\nIn several cases, the license/certificate held by participants were not actually in \u201cschool administration,\u201d but in other fields such as \u201csecondary school administration,\u201d \u201ceducational leadership,\u201d or \u201ceducational administration.\u201d However, all of the participants understood what was being asked, and did not think it needed to be changed.\nRecommendations No modifications are recommended for this item.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-35\n\nITEM 2\nWe are interested in the importance you place on various educational goals. From the following 10 goals, which do you consider the most important, the second most important, and the third most important? 1\u2014Building basic literacy skills (reading, math, writing, speaking) 2\u2014Encouraging academic excellence 3\u2014Preparing students for postsecondary education 4\u2014Promoting occupational or vocational skills 5\u2014Promoting good work habits and self-discipline 6\u2014Promoting personal growth (self-esteem, self-knowledge, etc.) 7\u2014Promoting human relations skills 8\u2014Promoting specific moral values 9\u2014Promoting multicultural awareness or understanding 10\u2014Fostering religious or spiritual development\n__ Most important __ Second most important __ Third most important\nFindings\nA few participants initially misunderstood the instructions, and began ranking all 10 goals before they realized they were only to rank the three most important.\nParticipants generally did not have any difficulty ranking their first two goals, but some had difficulty selecting the third goal because they felt there were several that were equally important at this level.\nSeveral participants felt that there was significant overlap between the goals on this list. A few participants considered these overlaps when selecting which goals they felt were most important. One participant stated, \u201cI\u2019m making it easier by combining ones that are the same. Number 2 encompasses 1, 3, and 5. Number 6 encompasses 7 and 9.\u201d She then selected (in order of most important) goals 2, 6, and 8. As another example, one participant decided to include goal 6 (Promoting personal growth) as one of his top three items as he felt it also captured goal 5 (Promoting good work habits and self-discipline).\nTwo participants commented that goals 3 and 4 could be combined into the phrase \u201ccollege and career readiness.\u201d\nParticipants were asked if there were any goals that were not relevant and could be excluded from the list. Many participants from public schools thought that goal 10 (Fostering religious or spiritual development) could be excluded, as it was not relevant to their situations. A few also thought goal 8 (Promoting specific moral values) could be excluded for the same reason. In fact, one public school participant commented that even if this was one of his most important goals he would not identify it on this list because there might be negative repercussions for stating that a public school was promoting specific moral values.\nRecommendations\nConsider providing examples of the different goals to better distinguish them. However, due to the nature of the question it is very likely that different respondents will still interpret them differently.\n\n\fG-36 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nDepending on the intent of goals 3 and/or 4, consider rephrasing as \u201cPromoting college and/or career readiness\u201d to reflect current terminology.\n\nITEM 3 Please indicate to what extent your school has accomplished the following:\n\na.

Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-37\n\n\u2022 having a democratic government and school leadership team; and \u2022 the processes in an individual school created to ensure the school runs well (e.g., scheduling class\ntimes).\nPrivate school principals interpreted this question as follows:\n\u2022 having a board of directors where all roles are mapped out and there is a clear chain of command; and\n\u2022 having a governing model (e.g., president-principal). Even though participants were not clear on what the phrase meant, they all stated that the school accomplished this goal to a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d extent. The rationale given by one principal was that if he selected any other option it would appear as if his school had no structure.\nPart (c): Several participants were not sure of what was meant by the phrase \u201csecuring a financial base.\u201d Again, most public school principals said their school was not responsible for securing a financial base and so were not sure how to answer this question.\nThree public school principals responded \u201cNot applicable\u201d because their money comes from the state.\nOne public school principal responded \u201cTo a small extent,\u201d saying that the state gives the school the money and he allocates it.\nFour public school principals responded \u201cTo a moderate extent.\u201d Two selected this option because they are keeping the school \u201cin the black.\u201d One selected this option because he constantly seeks other funding for his school, and one because he puts the \u201cbudget together.\u201d\nTwo public school principals responded \u201cTo a great extent,\u201d because they monitor the funds they receive from the state.\nOne private school principal responded \u201cTo a moderate extent,\u201d as his school is secure enough to offer tuition assistance; the other private school principal responded \u201cTo a great extent\u201d as they operate off a tuition base, but need other funds to run special programs.\nPart (d): Public school principals generally had difficulty answering this question.\nSeveral pointed out that they are not responsible for \u201cattracting\u201d students as students are assigned to the school based on where they live.\nAlthough their situation was much the same, however, the responses from the 10 public school principals varied widely: one responded \u201cTo a small extent,\u201d three responded \u201cTo a moderate extent,\u201d five responded \u201cTo a great extent,\u201d and one responded \u201cNot applicable.\u201d\nOf the respondents who selected \u201cTo a great extent,\u201d one did so because she tries to retain students (though not attract them); another selected this option even though he said the question did not apply to public schools.\nOne principal selected \u201cTo a small extent,\u201d saying, \u201conce they\u2019re in school, we try to keep them happy.\u201d\nPrivate school principals generally did not have a problem answering this question.\nPart (e): Public school principals were not clear about the level of assessment (state, local, or school) to which this question referred. Participants gave different answers based on their understanding.\n\n\fG-38 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nOne participant selected \u201cNot applicable\u201d because his school uses the state assessment system.\nAnother principal selected \u201cTo a great extent\u201d because although his school uses the state assessment system they also \u201cdo a great job with formative assessment.\u201d\nPart (f): Participants did not have difficulty answering this part.\nRecommendations\nIf possible, provide examples in the question stem to help principals understand when it is appropriate to select the \u201cNot applicable\u201d option.\nBased on findings from cognitive testing of this item, it is clear that participants have very different interpretations of most of these items\u2014particularly parts (a), (b), and (c). NCES could consider clarifying the items by adding more description. However, it is likely that due to the nature of the question, respondents will still have different interpretations of what they are being asked.\nBecause public school principals generally felt that parts (b), (c), and (d) did not apply to their situation, NCES might consider ignoring responses to these questions from public school respondents and focusing on responses from charter and/or private schools.\n\nITEM 4\n\nTHIS school year (2009-2010), does this school have any of the following?\n\na. Community involvement activities for students during and after normal school hours\n\n__\n\nYes __ No\n\nb.

Methods to inform parents or guardians of the students\u2019 progress\n\n__\n\nYes __ No\n\nFindings\nPart (a): All participants stated that their school participated in community involvement activities. Initially, one participant was not sure if this item was limited to activities that send students into the community. His school does not send students into the community, but community members can participate in an \u201cAfter school academy.\u201d He eventually decided that the \u201cAfter school academy\u201d would count for this item. Other activities included:\nHaving community members speak to students on career day; and\nService learning and community service projects.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-39\n\nParts (b) and (c): Most participants were able to easily distinguish between these two parts. Participants tended to associate part (b) with intangible rewards and part (c) with tangible rewards, e.g., cash, pizza or ice-cream parties, getting out of class early, and special field trips.\nPart (d): Most participants were able to provide examples of programs designed to help students prepare for educational transitions to college. Most of these programs were orientation-type programs designed to prepare students for transitions between schools. In the majority of cases these were for transitions to the next school level, but some schools also indicated they had programs for incoming students, and at least two schools said they had programs for both incoming and graduating students.\nPart (e): All participants immediately thought of report cards and progress reports as ways in which they informed parents or guardians of student progress. When probed for other modes of communication most participants also stated that they communicated with parents via phone, letters, and one-on-one meetings during parent-teacher conferences. A few participants mentioned e-mail, open houses, newsletters, and Parent Teacher Association meetings.\nOnly a few participants thought that adding examples would help clarify the question. Specifically, three of these participants thought that adding examples to part (c) would be helpful, and one participant thought adding examples to part (a) would be helpful.\nRecommendations\nPart (a): Provide examples of community service activities that would be included under this option.\nPart (c): Provide examples of incentive/reward programs to reduce the potential that principals could misinterpret this item.\nPart (e): If NCES does not want participants to consider report cards as methods of informing parents of their students\u2019 progress, this must be noted in the question. For example, \u201cMethods (other than report cards) to inform parents or guardians of the students\u2019 progress\u201d\n\n\fG-40 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nITEM 5\n\nLAST SCHOOL YEAR (2008-09), what percentage of students had at least one parent or\n\nguardian participating in the following events?\n\nMark (X) one box on each line.\n\n0\u201325\n\n26\u201350 51\u201375 76\u2013100\n\nNot\n\npercent percent percent percent applicable\n\na.

Examples given of parent education workshops or courses included:\n\n\u2022 workshops on helping children with homework; \u2022 information sessions about college scholarships and applications; and \u2022 classes/seminars on parenting. Part (e): Participants had differing interpretations of this part.\n\nOne participant stated that he did not know what was meant by the phrase \u201cwritten contract between school and parent.\u201d\n\nAnother participant said the item was ambiguous because he did not understand whether he should be thinking of a behavioral contract (a contract that parents and students sign when a student is having\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-41\n\ntrouble in school) or a parent compact (a nonbinding document which parents at his school have to sign at the beginning of the year). He later decided it was the latter and selected \u201c76\u2013100 percent.\u201d\nAnother participant had a similar confusion and was not sure if the question was intended to describe a behavioral contract or an IEP. He decided this question meant a behavioral contract and responded \u201cNot applicable,\u201d as his school did not use behavioral contracts.\nOther interpretations of the term \u201cwritten contract between school and parent\u201d included:\n\u2022 an academic assistance plan;\n\u2022 a plan outlining the goals for student success and what the parent will do to help achieve the goal; and\n\u2022 a contract at the end of the student handbook that parents must read and sign indicating their agreement with school policies and their agreement to pay tuition.\nPart (f): A few participants had some trouble answering this question because it was difficult for them to distinguish between these parents and those who volunteer only occasionally. One principal selected \u201cNot applicable\u201d for this item, saying that her school did not have regular parent volunteers because they ask for volunteers on an as-needed basis.\nPart (g): Several participants had difficulty with the phrase \u201cinvolvement in instructional issues.\u201d\nOne participant did not place a response on this line because she did not understand what it meant.\nThe other participants had very different interpretations of what they were asked to identify. These included, the percentage of all parents:\n\u2022 who express concerns about the curriculum or the way a teacher grades;\n\u2022 involved in back to school night (two participants interpreted part (g) in this way even though backto-school night was already referenced in part (a);\n\u2022 who contact the school to advocate for their child;\n\u2022 who help with the school improvement plan, or who serve on a committee to assess textbooks or decide school policy; and\n\u2022 who have children with specially identified instructional needs;\nPart (h): Most participants responded \u201c0\u201325 percent\u201d for this question. To better understand how participants interpreted the phrase \u201cinvolvement in governance,\u201d they were asked to provide examples of how parents could be involved in governance. Participants\u2019 explanations included:\n\u2022 Parents can serve on school improvement councils or boards that make governance decisions such as determining school policies.\n\u2022 Parents can participate in booster clubs\u2014parent groups that organize activities to support various school activities.\nPart (i): Most participants responded \u201c0\u201325 percent\u201d for this question. To better understand how participants interpreted the phrase \u201cinvolvement in budget decisions,\u201d they were asked to provide examples of how parents could be involved in budget decisions. Participants\u2019 explanations included:\n\u2022 Parents can serve on school improvement councils, finance committees, booster clubs, or the parent association; and\n\n\fG-42 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\n\u2022 Parents can voice their budget concerns or ideas at board meetings. Recommendations Part (e): Clarify what is meant by the phrase \u201cwritten contract between school and parent,\u201d whether it means a contract that is set up as part of a student behavioral intervention, an IEP, or a parent-school compact that is put in place for all parents.\nPart (g): This question is very broad and interpreted in a variety of different ways. If the item is retained, a description should be provided of what is meant by \u201cinvolvement in instructional issues.\u201d\nDepending on the intent, consider clarifying parts (h) and (i).\n\nITEM 6\n\nOn average throughout the school year, what percentage of time do you estimate that you spend on the following tasks in this school?

One participant decided not to answer this item as she thought it was \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d Another participant commented that he hoped his responses would \u201cnot be taken too seriously,\u201d as he did not think his estimates were accurate.\nAll participants who answered this question provided answers that totaled to 100.\nParticipants were asked if they considered evening and weekend events when determining their percentages. While most participants stated that they did consider night and weekend events, a few stated that they limited their calculations to what they did during the school day.\nPart (f): Activities that participants categorized as \u201cother\u201d were:\n\u2022 Sporting events; \u2022 Discipline; \u2022 Personal professional development; and \u2022 New initiatives (e.g., learning communities)\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-43\n\nRecommendations\nConsider specifying in the instructions whether principals should include time spent outside the regular school day.\nConsider limiting the number of categories in this item to three or four in order to make it easier for respondents to allocate time between them. If possible, try to avoid categories that are likely to have very low time allocations.\nPart (c): If the phrase \u201cstudent interactions\u201d is used, specify whether this category should include time spent on discipline.\nPart (f): Consider restructuring the \u201cOther\u201d option by adding examples rather than having principals fill in additional activities. \u201cOther (e.g., attending afterschool activities; professional development; responding to requests from district, state, or federal education officials)\u201d\n\nITEM 7\n\nDo any of the following people or groups conduct formal evaluations in this school for teachers of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels?\n\na.

They recommended adding a \u201cNot applicable\u201d option to distinguish between not having the vice principal evaluate, and not having a vice principal at the school.\nPart (c): A few participants were not sure how to answer this question if their peers completed only a part of the formal evaluation, e.g., if they completed observations of a teacher and these were included in the principal\u2019s formal evaluation. Two participants answered \u201cYes\u201d in this situation, while another answered \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\fG-44 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nPart (d): Outside groups that participants thought would fall into this category included school district staff, math and literacy coaches, and members of the school\u2019s accrediting body.\nAlmost half of the participants thought that school district staff should be added to the list. One private school principal also suggested including students.\nRecommendations Specify if the item is intended to capture information only on those who submit formal evaluations or if the intent is to also capture information on all those who participate in the formal evaluation process.\nPart (b): If data are not collected elsewhere in the survey as to whether the school has a vice principal or assistant principal, consider including a \u201cNot applicable\u201d option.\nPart (d): If other school personnel (such as math and literacy coaches) should not be considered when answering part (d), either specify this or add \u201cother school personnel\u201d as a separate category.\nConsider including school district personnel either as a separate category or include it as an example in part (d): \u201cOutside groups (e.g., consultant, school district personnel).\u201d\nITEM 8 For tenured or experienced K\u201312 teachers, how frequently are formal evaluations conducted? __ Twice or more per year __ Once a year __ Once every 2 years __ Once every 3\u20134 years __ Once every 5 or more years __ Never\nFindings When answering this question, several participants did not distinguish between \u201cformal evaluations\u201d and \u201cobservations.\u201d These principals counted all the times they observed teachers even if these observations were not part of a formal evaluation.\nIn at least three cases, principals explicitly stated that there were no formal evaluations for experienced K\u201312 teachers, however, they did not select the \u201cNever\u201d option. One participant selected \u201cOnce every 5 or more years\u201d because he included informal evaluations in his answer; one selected \u201cTwice or more per year\u201d because his tenured teachers receive what he called two \u201csnapshot\u201d observations per year; and the third participant selected \u201cTwice or more per year\u201d because he thought he and his school would \u201clook bad\u201d if he selected \u201cNever.\u201d\nRecommendations Add the following (or similar) instruction for the item: \u201cConsider only FORMAL EVALUATIONS in your answer to this question.

Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-47\n\nFindings\nParts (a) and (b): One participant was confused by the skip pattern in these questions. If the participant selects \u201cNo\u201d the instructions are to \u201cGo to item 11b below.\u201d As there is no instruction that indicates what the respondent should do if he/she answers \u201cYes,\u201d this participant assumed he should stop answering the entire item at this point. The participant had to be prompted by the interviewer to complete the rest of the item.\nParts (a) and (b): Participants generally understood that a \u201cchecklist evaluation\u201d assesses whether specific competencies or behaviors are present. Some participants thought that for \u201cstandards-based evaluations\u201d teachers were evaluated simply based on whether they were meeting a standard, while other participants thought that for this type of evaluation, the principal needed to document evidence of the extent to which the teacher was meeting each standard.\nPart (b): Participants interpreted the word \u201cpeers\u201d to be other classroom teachers. One participant explicitly limited this group to only certified teachers.\nPart (e): One participant was not certain of how to respond to this item, because while student scores are considered as a part of other components of the evaluation, they \u201care not a separate category.\u201d He responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question. Another participant uses students\u2019 AP test scores in the evaluation of AP teachers and in the evaluation of departments, but not in the evaluation of other individual teachers. He responded \u201cYes.\u201d\nParts (c), (d), (f), (g), and (h): Participants did not have any difficulty understanding these questions.\nPart (i): Other types of information used for formal evaluations that participants thought should be included in the list were:\n\u2022 evaluation by the Vice principal or Assistant principal; and\n\u2022 evaluation by outside groups.\nParticipants were asked what types of teachers they would not consider \u201cregular classroom teachers.\u201d Participants mentioned:\n\u2022 longterm substitutes;\n\u2022 health, physical education, media specialists, and guidance counselors; and\n\u2022 administrators (although this principal said that in his school all administrators teach at least one class).\nIn answering this question participants considered all certified teachers\u2014including special education, resource, and part-time teachers\u2014to be \u201cregular classroom teachers.\u201d\nRecommendations\nInclude \u201cEvaluations by the assistant or vice principal\u201d in the list.\nBecause teachers within the same school may be evaluated differently, consider adding an instruction for principals to respond \u201cYes\u201d if any of the items in the list apply to evaluations of any regular classroom teacher.\n\n\fG-48 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nITEM 12 How many classroom observations are typically conducted prior to completing an evaluation on a teacher of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels? If none, please mark (X) the box. \uf0a8 None or __ __ Total observations\nFindings Participants had very different understandings of how to answer this question:\n\u2022 Most participants thought they should only include formal observations, but a few thought they should include both formal and informal observations.\nSome participants provided the typical number of observations for new or struggling teachers, while others provided an average number of observations for evaluations of all teachers (including new or struggling).\nSome participants provided the maximum number of observations ever used for an evaluation, while others responded with an average number of observations.\nRecommendations Specify whether principals are to consider formal and/or informal observations.\nSpecify whether principals are to consider the number of observations conducted for formal and/or informal evaluations.\nSpecify whether principals are to consider the number of observations conducted for new/nontenured vs. tenured teachers.\nITEM 13 How long is the typical classroom observation that occurs prior to completing an evaluation on a teacher of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels? If none, please mark (X) the box. \uf0a8 None or __ __ __ Minutes per classroom observation\nFindings Most participants said that the length of an observation could vary significantly depending on whether it was a formal or informal evaluation, and also depending on whether the teacher was new, underperforming, or experienced. In most cases, participants provided the maximum length of an observation.\nMost participants thought they should only include formal observations, but a few thought they should include both formal and informal observations.\nOne participant incorrectly totaled the multiple observations she did for a teacher and recorded a response of 180 minutes (based on three 60-minute observations).\nRecommendations Specify whether principals are to consider formal and/or informal observations, and whether they are to consider formal and/or informal evaluations.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-49\n\nWhen analyzing response data, NCES should be aware that respondents may not be providing the \u201ctypical\u201d length of an observation, but something closer to the maximum length. If that is a problem, NCES should consider clarifying that in the question.\n\nITEM 14\nAre teachers\u2019 evaluations used, at least in part, to determine a teacher\u2019s compensation? __ Yes __ No\nFindings\nOne participant was unclear as to whether this question was limited to only financial compensation. She does offer nonfinancial incentives to teachers with a good evaluation such as leaving early, but she eventually decided the item referred only to financial compensation and responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question.\nAnother participant stated that at her school, compensation is indirectly tied to evaluations because teachers who receive a poor evaluation may be denied a \u201cstep\u201d on the salary scale. She responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question.\nRecommendations\nNo modifications are recommended for this item, unless NCES wants participants to respond \u201cYes\u201d if teachers can be denied a step on the salary scale based on their evaluations.\nFindings from the Revised Items\nItem 1a\nHow frequently are informal classroom observations typically conducted on tenured or experienced teachers of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels? Mark (X) only one box. __ At least once a week __ Once or twice a month __ A few times a year __ No informal observations are typically conducted\n\nItem 1b\nHow frequently are informal classroom observations typically conducted on nontenured or new teachers of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels? Mark (X) only one box. __ At least once a week __ Once or twice a month __ A few times a year __ No informal observations are typically conducted\nFindings\nMost participants did not have any difficult responding to these items. However, one participant did not initially see the word \u201cinformal\u201d in the question. After reading Item 2a (the next item), she went back and re-read Item 1a more closely and realized her mistake. She then changed her answers to Items 1a and 1b.\n\n\fG-50 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThree participants commented that several different response options might be correct, depending on other circumstances (e.g., whether a teacher is struggling). Two participants picked the response option corresponding to the highest number of observations that might take place; the other participant selected the lowest number of observations that would take place.\nOne participant was unsure whether to include \u201cwalk-throughs,\u201d and thought the item should specify whether these should be counted as \u201cinformal observations.\u201d\nHalf of the participants indicated in their responses that informal observations are carried out more frequently with nontenured teachers. The remaining half indicated that the frequency of observations was the same for tenured and nontenured teachers.\nTwo participants specifically commented that it was a good idea to ask about tenured and nontenured teachers separately because the frequency of observations often varies between the two groups.\nNone of the participants selected the response option \u201cNo informal observations are typically conducted\u201d for either Items 1a or 1b. Participants commented that the response option was appropriate to include and easy to understand.\nRecommendations To emphasize the difference between these items and other items, put \u201cinformal\u201d in all capital letters.\nTo emphasize the difference between Items 1a and 1b, underline the phrase \u201ctenured or experienced\u201d in Item 1a and \u201cnontenured or new\u201d in Item 1b.\nItem 2a How many formal classroom observations are typically conducted prior to completing an evaluation on a tenured or experienced teacher of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels? If none, please mark (X) the box. __ None or __ __ Total observations\nItem 2b How many formal classroom observations are typically conducted prior to completing an evaluation on a nontenured or new teacher of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels? If none, please mark (X) the box. __ None or__ __ Total observations\nFindings Participants did not have any difficulty responding to these items.\nTwo participants commented that the number of observations conducted might vary depending on the circumstances (e.g., whether a teacher is struggling). Of these two, one provided the upper end of the range in her responses to Items 2a and 2b; the other provided the lower end of the range.\nFour of the six respondents gave a higher response for Item 2b than for Item 2a, indicating that more formal observations are conducted prior to completing an evaluation on a nontenured teacher compared to a tenured teacher. The remaining participants indicated the number of observations was the same for tenured and nontenured teachers.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-51\n\nNone of the participants selected \u201cNone\u201d for either of Items 2a or 2b, but all felt it was appropriate to include as a response option.\nRecommendations To emphasize the difference between these items and other items, put \u201cformal\u201d in all capital letters.\nTo emphasize the difference between Items 2a and 2b, underline the phrase \u201ctenured or experienced\u201d in Item 2a and \u201cnontenured or new\u201d in Item 2b.\n\nItem 3a How long is the typical formal classroom observation that occurs prior to completing an evaluation on a tenured or experienced teacher of grades K\u201312 or comparable ungraded levels?

If none, please mark (X) the box. __ None or __ __ __ Minutes per classroom observation\nFindings Participants did not have any difficulty responding to these items.\nTwo of the six participants provided higher answers for Item 3b than for Item 3a, indicating that observations were generally longer for nontenured teachers compared to tenured teachers. The other four participants\u2019 response to Items 3a and 3b were the same.\nThree of the participants indicated that observations might have a range of durations. For example, one participant said that observations for both tenured and nontenured teachers could last between five and 30 minutes. The other three participants indicated that the length of an observation was always consistent.\nOf the three participants who indicated that the length of an observation could vary, two provided an answer that represented the \u201caverage\u201d length of an observation. The other participant provided the lower end of the range as her response, but verbally added that \u201csome observations might be longer.\u201d\nRecommendations To emphasize the difference between these items and other items, put \u201cformal\u201d in all capital letters.\nTo emphasize the difference between Items 3a and 3b, underline the phrase \u201ctenured or experienced\u201d in Item 3a and \u201cnontenured or new\u201d in Item 3b.\n\n\fG-52 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nItem 4\nHow frequently are tenured or experienced teachers rated in FORMAL evaluations?\nConsider only formal evaluations in your answer to this question, not informal evaluations or number of times observations are conducted.

She indicated that teachers at her school are evaluated five times per year.\nThree of the six participants provided different answers for Items 4 and 5. In all three cases, they indicated that nontenured teachers were rated more frequently in formal evaluations compared to tenured teachers. The remaining three participants provided the same answer for Items 4 and 5.\nWhen answering Item 4, one participant indicated that there is no requirement to observe tenured teachers unless a teacher is struggling. This participant selected \u201conce every 5 or more years.\u201d\nRecommendations\nTo emphasize the difference between Items 4 and 5, underline the phrase \u201ctenured or experienced\u201d in Item 4 and \u201cnontenured or new\u201d in Item 5.\nTo maintain consistency with the first three sets of items, label these items using \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d (e.g., items 4a and 4b) rather than giving them different item numbers.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-53\n\nTesting of Items for the Teacher Questionnaire\n\nDescription of Participants\nICF Macro recruited teachers who represented every grade level in K\u201312, many geographic regions, and a wide range of experience. Some participants came from charter or private schools, as well as traditional public schools. All participants held a bachelor\u2019s degree, and most also had a master\u2019s degree. There were four participants with National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) certification. Teachers came from:\n\u2022 California; \u2022 Georgia; \u2022 Kansas; \u2022 Maryland; \u2022 New Hampshire; \u2022 New York; \u2022 Pennsylvania; \u2022 Tennessee; \u2022 Virginia; and \u2022 Washington.\n\nSummary of Findings\nThe following section summarizes the results of the interviews testing items for the Teacher Questionnaire. Under each item tested, we describe key findings as well as recommendations.\nITEM 1 In what year did you FIRST begin teaching, either full-time or part-time, at the elementary or secondary level? * Do not include time spent as a student teacher. __ __ __ __ Year\nFindings All but two participants had no difficulty responding to this item.\nOne teacher was unsure which year to count as his first because he began teaching as an unlicensed teacher. He counted his year as an unlicensed teacher as the year in which he began teaching.\nAnother teacher was unsure which year to count as her first because she began teaching in another country. She counted her first year teaching abroad as her first year teaching.\nOne teacher started as a Pre-K teacher, but the year she reported for this item was when she began teaching at the elementary level.\n\n\fG-54 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nRecommendations No modifications are recommended for this item.\nITEM 2 In what year did you begin teaching in THIS school? * If you have had a break in service of one year or more, please report the year that you returned to this school. * Do not include time spent as a student teacher. __ __ __ __ Year\nFindings This item was difficult for several participants:\n\u2022 Several participants were not sure whether \u201cTHIS school\u201d meant the school in which they were currently teaching or the school referred to in Item 1 (first year of teaching). (This may have been an artifact of testing resulting from the order in which items were shown to participants.)\nOf four participants who reported breaks in service, at least two incorrectly provided the year they first came to the school, not the year they returned after their break.\nOne participant is an ESL teacher who teaches in multiple schools at the same time. She was not sure how to respond to this item, so she picked one of the schools she teaches in and responded for that school.\nParticipants were asked to respond to the following hypothetical situation: \u201cImage that you had started teaching at this school in the year 2000. You taught in the school until 2007, then took a year off and returned in 2009. How would you answer this item?\u201d Nine of the 16 participants correctly answered \u201c2009.\u201d Five incorrectly answered \u201c2000,\u201d one said \u201c2007,\u201d and one did not know how to respond to the question.\nSeveral participants asked whether the \u201cbreak in service of one year or more\u201d referred to a school or calendar year. All of them interpreted it as a school year.\nRecommendations To avoid different interpretations of a \u201cbreak in service of one year or more,\u201d consider specifying whether it is a calendar year or a school year.\nIf teachers who work in multiple schools will be answering this question, consider adding an instruction specifying how they should respond to this item.\nIn the instruction about breaks in service, revise the bolding of text to emphasize what should be reported: \u201cIf you have had a break in service of one year or more, please report the year that you returned to this school.\u201d\nITEM 3 In how many schools have you taught at the elementary or secondary level? * Do not include time spent as a student teacher. __ __ Schools\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-55\n\nFindings Most participants had no difficulty responding to this item.\nOne participant started in one school, transferred to another school, and then returned to the first school. She did not double-count the first school, and reported teaching in two schools.\nTwo participants indicated they had some trouble responding to this item:\n\u2022 One participant only included schools he taught in during the school year, and did not include other schools where he taught only during the summer.\n\u2022 Another participant estimated the number of schools she taught in (20) because she teaches in multiple schools at the same time. Over the course of her career, she has taught in so many schools that she could only estimate her response.\nRecommendations Depending on the intent of the question, consider adding an instruction specifying how teachers who work in multiple schools each year should answer this item.\n\nITEM 4\nHow many school years have you worked as an elementary- or secondary-level teacher in a public or private school? * Include the current school year. *Public schools include public charter and/or Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools. * If you worked in more than one school in a given school year, count that school year only once. * Do not include time spent as a student teacher. * Record whole years, not fractions or months. __ __ School Years\nFindings\nSeveral participants said there were too many italicized instructions, and a few indicated they did not read the italicized instructions at all because there were so many.\nThis was especially problematic for one participant who did not include the 2 years she taught in a charter school because \u201ccharter\u201d was not in the question stem and she did not read the italicized instructions.\nTwo teachers had \u201chalf years\u201d (11.5 and 21.5); one rounded down while the other rounded up.\nOne participant included a year of maternity leave because she was still a paid employee.\nOne participant suggested that the item should ask how many years the respondent has worked \u201cin public or private schools,\u201d rather than \u201cin a public or private school.\u201d\nRecommendations\nChange the wording of the question from \u201cin a public or private school\u201d to \u201cin public or private schools.\u201d\nTo increase accuracy among those who will not read all of the italicized instructions, consider rewording the question stem as: \u201cHow many school years have you worked as an elementary- or secondarylevel teacher in public or private schools (including charter and/or Bureau of Indian Educationfunded schools)?\u201d\n\n\fG-56 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nTo reduce the number of italicized instructions, consider removing the second and third instructions.

After looking at the items more closely all realized that Item 6 asked for different information than earlier items. However, several suggested that Item 5 and Item 6 could be combined into a single item.\nOne participant suggested that Item 6 refer to \u201cschool years\u201d to maintain consistency with previous items.\nTeachers defined part time in different ways, depending on what was applicable at their school or district. These definitions included: hours (less than 35 or 40 per week, less than 8 per day), full days (fewer than 3 full days per week), classes or sections (less than 3, 5, or 6 per day), FTE (less than 0.6 or 1.0), or working half time (in a district where the only options are half- or full-time).\nRecommendations\nConsider using skip patterns so that participants are only asked the relevant portions of Item 6, depending on their responses to Item 5.\n\n\fG-58 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nTo increase accuracy among those who will not read all of the italicized instructions, consider rewording the question stem as: \u201cHow many years have you worked FULL-TIME and/or PART-TIME as an elementary- or secondary-level teacher in a public or private school (including charter and/or Bureau of Indian Education-funded schools)?\u201d This would also allow for the removal of the second instruction.\nTo maintain consistency between Items 4, 5, and 6, consider changing \u201cyears\u201d to \u201cschool years.\u201d\nITEM 7 Do you instruct the same group or a portion of a group of students for more than one year (e.g., looping)? __ Yes __ No\nFindings About half of the participants understood the correct meaning of the term \u201clooping.\u201d The other half misunderstood the term to mean teaching one or more students for two consecutive years (for example, if a student happened to have the same teacher for 9th and 10th grade math). Participants\u2019 responses were consistent with their interpretation of the item.\nRecommendations Revise the item as: \u201cDo you instruct the same group of students for more than one year (e.g., looping)?\u201d\nITEM 8 How many separate class periods or sections do you currently teach at THIS school? * Do not include homeroom periods or study halls.

However, most said that most of their classes touched on all of the areas described; 5 of the 6 participants who responded to this item said \u201cYes\u201d to all eight parts of the question. The only participant who did not respond \u201cYes\u201d to all parts was a teacher who had recently started taking coursework to get certification. She said \u201cNo\u201d to (1) methods of delivering lessons, (5) engaging gifted and talented students, and (7) subject-specific teaching methods.\nResponses to the part (8) \u201cother courses\u201d included: teaching with technology, curriculum development, classroom management, classroom and behavior management, educational psychology, fundamentals of education, instructional technology, teaching with technology, and educational administration.\nSeveral teachers mentioned \u201cinstructional technology\u201d and \u201cclassroom management\u201d as content areas that should be included in the list.\nRecommendations\nConsider adding \u201cinstructional technology\u201d and \u201cclassroom management\u201d as content areas.\nDepending on the intent of the question, consider specifying whether participants should count courses that touched on this content at all, or only those that specifically focused on each content area. Based on findings from these interviews, it appears that if no changes are made to the item the percentage of \u201cYes\u201d answers will be extremely high.\n\n\fG-62 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nITEM 12\n\nIn your FIRST year of teaching, how well prepared were you to\u2014\n\n* If you are in your first year of teaching, please answer for THIS school year.\n\n* Mark (X) one box on each line.\n\nNot at all Somewhat\n\nWell\n\nprepared prepared prepared\n\na.

Respondents indicated that they might consider a number of different types of assessments, from class assignments and discussions to standardized test scores.\nPart (h): Respondents did not have any difficulty with this part of the item. Some respondents were initially confused by what it meant to \u201cmeet state content standards,\u201d but this did not seem to cause them any trouble in answering.\nOne teacher who had taught in both public and private schools said it was possible that private school teachers may not know what state content standards are. This was confirmed by one private school teacher who said she did not know what the state content standards were, but she selected the \u201cvery well prepared\u201d option because she was sure she would be able to meet them.\n\n\fAppendix G.

(The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is a nongovernment organization that administers National Board certification, a voluntary national assessment program that certifies teachers who meet high professional standards. In order to gain certification, the candidate must at least complete a portfolio of classroom practice and pass one or more tests of content knowledge.) __ Yes, fully certified\uf0e0GO TO item 14 below __ No \uf0e0 GO TO item 15a\nFindings\nTwo of the 11 participants who responded to this item indicated that they had never heard of NBPTS.\nFive participants indicated that they had NBPTS certification.\nOne participant responded \u201cYes,\u201d but did not actually have NBPTS certification. She received her initial certification in another country, and referred to her certification in the United States as NBPTS certification in this item and Item 14.\nRecommendations\nNo modifications are recommended for this item.\n\nITEM 14\n\nUsing Table 2, in what content area(s) does the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification allow you to teach?\n\nSubject Name\n\nCode\n\n__ __ __ Code\n\n__ __ __ Code\n\n__ __ __ Code\n\nFindings The four participants that had NBPTS certification did not have any difficulty responding to this item.\nRecommendations No modifications are recommended for this item.\n\n\fG-64 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nITEM 15a1 Which of the following describes the teaching certificate you currently hold in THIS state or that is accepted by THIS state? * Mark (X) only one box. * If you currently hold more than one of the following, a second certification may be listed in item 16. __ Regular or standard state certificate or advanced professional certificate __ Certificate issued after satisfying all requirements except the completion of a probationary period __ Certificate that requires some additional coursework, student teaching, or passage of a test before regular certification can be obtained __ Certificate issued to persons who must complete a certification program in order to continue teaching __ I do not hold any of the above certifications in THIS state\uf0e0 GO TO item 17. Findings Most participants did not have any difficulty responding to this item. Most participants initially ignored the phrase \u201cor that is accepted by THIS state.\u201d When asked what this phrase meant, most were unsure and said they found it to be confusing. Some participants were unsure how to respond to this item because the first response option reflected the current status of their certificate, but one of the other options was true in the past. For example, one noted that her certificate had initially required some additional coursework, but she had since completed that coursework. All of these participants selected the first response option. Recommendations Consider rephrasing the question in a simpler way; for example, \u201cWhich of the following currently describes the teaching certificate that allows you to teach in this state?\u201d\n1 These findings and recommendations also apply to Item 16b, which is very similar.\n\n\fAppendix G.

Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-67\n\nFindings Several participants appeared overwhelmed when they first encountered this set of items because they seemed very complicated. While most were able to figure the question out and answer correctly, several encountered problems:\nOne participant mistakenly used Table 1 instead of Table 2 when selecting content codes.\nOne participant was certified to teach history. However, she entered this as two different content codes: \u201cSocial studies, general\u201d and then \u201cHistory.\u201d\nOne math teacher entered 102 (the code for \u201cgeneral education\u201d) in the space for \u201cContent Area,\u201d and 190 (the code for \u201cmathematics\u201d) in the space for \u201cContent Code.\u201d\nOne participant indicated that her certificate allowed her to teach all of the content areas listed under English and Language arts in Table 2. This participant listed all of these as \u201cadditional content areas\u201d in parts (d), (f), (h), and (j), and then wrote the rest in at the bottom of the page.\nOne participant that was certified to teach several content areas said that the item was too complicated, and indicated that she would leave it blank.\nA number of participants had difficulty responding to the \u201cGrade Range\u201d section of this item if their certification did not match the grade ranges provided. For example:\nTwo teachers who were certified to teach grades 7 and 8 but not grade 6 did not check the box for \u201cAny of grades 6\u20138,\u201d because they did not think they could check that box unless all of the grades applied.\nOne participant who was certified to teach grades 4 and 5 but not K-3 checked the first content area box, but wrote \u201cOnly grades 4 and 5\u201d in the margin.\nInstead of marking two different grade levels under part (b), one participant answered \u201cYes\u201d to part (c) and then provided the same content code and a second grade range under part (d).\nOne participant listed three content areas in which she was certified. However, she only provided grade ranges for the first content area; for the other two she left the grade range boxes blank.\nRecommendations Consider simplifying this question by deleting parts (e) through (j) and allowing respondents to list more than content area in part (d).\nProvide a full example of how the item should be completed. Illustrate in this example how grade ranges should be reported if respondents are certified to teach some, but not all, of the grades in a given range.\n\nITEM 16a Do you have another current teaching certificate in THIS state or that is accepted by THIS state? __ Yes __ No\uf0e0GO TO item 17\nFindings Most participants responded \u201cNo\u201d to Item 16a. Of those that responded \u201cYes,\u201d most did so incorrectly:\n\n\fG-68 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nOne person responded \u201cYes\u201d but actually had only one certificate that covered two content areas, which she had reported in Item 15.\nOne respondent considered NBPTS certification to be \u201canother teaching certificate\u201d and selected \u201cYes.\u201d Other participants with NBPTS certification selected \u201cNo\u201d for this item.\nOne participant had initially been certified in Connecticut, but then moved to New York and became certified there. Because her certification in Connecticut would still be valid (although not in New York), she responded \u201cYes\u201d to Item 16a.\nTwo participants were working toward a second certificate, but still had to do something else for the certification to be accepted by the state (e.g., complete coursework or pass an exam). One responded \u201cYes\u201d to this item because her situation fell under one of the response options in Item 15. The other responded \u201cNo\u201d because the certificate was not currently accepted \u201cas is.\u201d\nRecommendations Consider rephrasing the question, for example, \u201cDo you have another current teaching certificate under which you can teach in this state?\u201d\nAlternatively, add an instruction indicating how respondents should answer if they are working toward a second certificate but have not yet completed the requirements.\nITEM 17 How often are you formally evaluated? *Consider only FORMAL EVALUATIONS in your answer to this question, not informal evaluations or observations. __ Twice or more times per year __ Once a year __ Once every 2 years __ Once every 3-4 years __ Once every 5 or more years __ No formal evaluations are required\nFindings Participants defined \u201cformal evaluations\u201d in a consistent manner, including a formal observation by an administrator, feedback, and a report of some kind that goes in the teachers\u2019 record.\nNone of the participants selected \u201cno formal evaluations are required\u201d; most responded \u201conce a year\u201d or \u201ctwice or more times per year.\u201d\nOne participant responded \u201conce a year,\u201d even though she is not ever formally evaluated. When asked why she responded this way, the participant explained that her school was very small and there was not enough time for the principal to formally evaluate all of the teachers. However, the teachers are evaluated informally, and she felt that should be reflected on the survey.\nOne participant responded \u201ctwice or more times per year\u201d because this was the \u201cideal,\u201d but said that in most cases formal evaluations only take place once a year.\n\n\fAppendix G. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, September 2010\n\nG-69\n\nRecommendations\nIn order to improve accuracy, consider adding a similar item asking participants to report how often they are informally evaluated.\n\nITEM 18 DURING THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR, do you, or will you, earn any additional compensation from this school system for extracurricular or additional activities such as coaching, student activity sponsorship, or teaching evening classes? * Report amounts in whole dollars. __ Yes \uf0e0 How much? Record amount, then GO TO item 19 below. $__ __,__ __ __.00 __ No\nFindings Most participants did not have any difficulties with this item, and those who reported receiving extra money did not have any difficulty providing an amount.\nOne participant did not know whether to include money received for activities during the summer, because the item refers to the current school year. She decided not to include money for these activities.\nAnother participant did not know whether to report money earned for participating in professional development; she eventually decided not to do so.\nTeachers reported earning compensation for the following activities:\n\u2022 Covering detention and remediation;\n\u2022 Coaching/mentoring other teachers;\n\u2022 Serving as a department chair;\n\u2022 Tutoring students; and\n\u2022 Proctoring tests.\nRecommendations Because coaching/mentoring other teachers is a relatively common activity, consider adding it to the examples provided.\n\nITEM 19\nDURING THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR, do you, or will you, earn any additional compensation from this school system based on your students\u2019 performance (e.g., through a merit pay or pay-for-performance agreement)? * Report amounts in whole dollars. __ Yes \uf0e0 How much?

Another participant did not know where to report professional development. Neither participant reported money received from these activities in any item.\nThe following activities were counted for this item:\nStipend for NBPTS certification\nCoaching/mentoring other teachers\nJudging an academic tournament\nGrant to travel and learn about American History\nOne teacher who counted NBPTS certification gave the total money she receives, although she later indicated that the district and state share the cost.\nOne teacher indicated that she earns money from a different school system, for teaching night school. She did not include that money in her answer to this item, because the money didn\u2019t come from \u201cthis school system.\u201d\nRecommendations Assuming that the responses described above reflect the intent of the question, no modifications are recommended for this item.\n\n\fAppendix G.

The purpose of these interviews was to gather feedback on proposed questions for the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), a national educational survey that is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Census Bureau. This report is a summary of the feedback that ICF Macro collected from participants, as well as recommendations for revisions to the items. The SASS consists of several different instruments, including questionnaires for teachers and principals. For this project, the Census Bureau asked ICF Macro to test proposed questions for these two instruments. A total of nine principal and nine teacher participants were recruited from a list purchased from an outside vendor. An e-mail was sent out to potential participants that described the study and offered an incentive to those who participated. Interested participants who contacted ICF Macro by telephone or e-mail were then screened and scheduled for an interview. Because some of the items to be tested related to the inclusion of student test score outcomes or growth as a criterion in principal and teacher evaluations, recruitment was focused on school districts that have some experience with this type of student performance-based evaluation.1 It is important to note that as a result, the responses of participants to these questions are likely not representative of the entire SASS sample. All interviews were conducted by phone. Prior to each interview, the participant was e-mailed a copy of the proposed items and asked to print them out. Participants were told not to read the items before the interview. During the interview, participants were asked to answer each of the proposed items as they normally would if they were answering a paper survey. As they answered each item, they were asked to \u201cthink aloud\u201d\u2014that is, to describe out loud what they were thinking as they read and answered the question and point out anything that surprised or confused them. After the participant had answered a set of items, the interviewer would then ask a series of follow-up questions or probes and get clarification of responses as necessary. The length of the interviews averaged 15 to 20 minutes for the principal questionnaire and 25 to 30 minutes for the teacher questionnaire. The first section discusses the testing of items for the principal questionnaire, while the second section addresses testing of items for the teacher questionnaire. Each section provides a brief profile of the participants that were recruited, and then provides findings and recommendations for each of the tested items.\n1 Recruitment was limited to school districts that had received Teacher Incentive Fund grants from the U.S. Department of Education, since a requirement of these grants is that districts develop evaluations systems for teachers and/or administrators at least in part based on student performance.\n\n\fAppendix H. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, May 2011\n\nH-3\n\nTesting of Items for the Principal Questionnaire\n\nDescription of Participants\nNine school principals were interviewed to obtain their feedback on proposed items for the principal questionnaire. Two of the participants were from elementary schools, four were from middle or junior high schools, and three were from high schools. Participants were recruited from seven different states: Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio and Tennessee.\n\nSummary of Interview Findings\n\nICF Macro was asked to test three items for the principal questionnaire. The following section describes key findings for each item, as well as recommendations for how it should be revised.\n\nItem 1a Were you, or are you going to be, rated in a FORMAL evaluation this school year? __ Yes __ No \u2192 GO TO item 1c below.\n\nFindings\nMost participants had no difficulty responding to this question.\nOnly one of the nine participants responded \u201cNo.\u201d This participant indicated that he was not evaluated this year, but that beginning next year he will be evaluated every year.\nIn general, participants interpreted a \u201cformal evaluation\u201d to mean a written evaluation conducted by a supervisor, and one that is documented in personnel files. Most said that their formal evaluation involves establishing goals and providing evidence of progress toward meeting those goals.\nA few participants at first suggested that it would be helpful to clarify what is meant by a \u201cformal\u201d evaluation. However, after thinking about it more, these participants decided that it would be difficult to come up with a description that would be accurate in all situations.\nRecommendations\nNo revisions are recommended for this item.\nItem 1b Are student test score outcomes or test score growth included as an evaluation criterion in your formal evaluation this school year? __ Yes __ No\n\nFindings\nAll but one principal responded \u201cYes\u201d when asked this question. However, some of these participants later indicated that test score outcomes or growth are not actually explicit criteria in their evaluation. Most said that they answered \u201cYes\u201d because student test score outcomes or test score growth were measures of\n\n\fH-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\ntheir school\u2019s performance, and their school\u2019s performance was a primary component of their own personal evaluation. Some indicated that poor test scores or test score growth could lead to them being removed from their position, while good test scores could result in schoolwide bonuses or recognition. One participant responded \u201cNo\u201d because although student test score outcomes and growth indirectly reflect on his performance, they are not explicit criteria in his evaluation. Recommendations NCES should be aware that it is possible that there may be some inconsistency in responses; among principals for whom test score outcomes and growth are not explicit evaluation criteria, some may answer \u201cNo,\u201d while others may answer \u201cYes\u201d because they feel they will be indirectly held responsible on these criteria. As long as this is not a problem for NCES, no revisions are needed.\nItem 1c\nHow often are you formally evaluated? __ Two or more times per year __ Once a year __ Once every 2 years __ Once every 3 years __ Once every 4 years __ Once every 5 or more years __ No formal evaluations are required\nFindings Most of the participants had no difficulty responding to this item. Eight of the nine participants said they were formally evaluated \u201conce a year.\u201d Most said that their annual evaluation included multiple meetings (for example, an initial meeting to set goals, an interim meeting and then a final meeting when they received a rating for their performance), but that they considered this to be part of a single evaluation process. One participant had indicated in Item 1a that he would not be evaluated during this school year. However, he answered \u201conce a year\u201d to this question because he would be evaluated annually starting next year. One participant indicated he was evaluated \u201cTwo or more times per year.\u201d This participant said there were initial, midpoint, and final evaluations over the course of the school year. Recommendations In order to preserve consistency in wording with Item 1a, rephrase this item as:\n\u201cHow often are you rated in a FORMAL evaluation?\u201d\nThe current response options to this item do not allow for the possibility that a principal might not receive any formal evaluations even though they are required. For that reason, rephrase the last response option as \u201cNo formal evaluations are conducted.\u201d This will also remove the risk of having two possible correct answers, as described under Teacher Item 1a.\n\n\fAppendix H. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, May 2011\n\nH-5\n\nTesting of Items for the Teacher Questionnaire\n\nDescription of Participants\n\nNine teachers were interviewed to obtain their feedback on items on the teacher questionnaire. Four were elementary school teachers, three were middle school teachers, and two were high school teachers. Participants were recruited from four different states: Colorado, Florida, Maryland and North Carolina.\n\nSummary of Interview Findings\n\nICF Macro was asked to test seven items for the teacher questionnaire. An additional item (Item 3) was added to provide context for the subsequent questions.\nItem 1a\n\nHow often are you INFORMALLY evaluated? Consider only INFORMAL evaluations in your answer to this question, not formal evaluations or observations. __ Two or more times per year __ Once a year __ Once every 2 years __ Once every 3 years __ Once every 4 years __ Once every 5 or more years __ No informal evaluations are required\n\nFindings\nWhen asked to describe what they thought was meant by an \u201cinformal\u201d evaluation, participants\u2019 responses were very similar. Participants generally described \u201cinformal evaluations\u201d as walkthroughs or observations by the principal, assistant principal, or other school/district staff that are not reflected in their personnel file. Participants indicated that the results of informal evaluations were generally not provided in written form, and they do not have an impact on their performance ratings.\nAll participants responded \u201ctwo or more times per year\u201d or \u201conce a year.\u201d\nWhile most participants thought that the question was clear and easy to answer, one found the instructions confusing. This participant was unsure whether the direction not to include \u201cformal evaluations or observations\u201d meant that no observations should be included (as opposed to only formal observations).\nOne participant commented that two of the answer options were correct. This participant said that she is informally evaluated multiple times a year, but that it is also true that no informal evaluations are required in her district.\nRecommendations\nTo clarify that informal observations are to be considered in the answer to this question, rephrase the directions as follows:\n\u201cConsider only INFORMAL evaluations in your answer to this question, not formal observations or evaluations.\u201d\n\n\fH-6 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nThe current response options for this item do not allow for the possibility that a teacher might not receive any informal evaluations even though they are required. For that reason, rephrase the last response option as \u201cNo informal evaluations are conducted.\u201d This will also remove the risk of having two possible correct answers, as described above.\nItem 1b\nHow often are you FORMALLY evaluated? Consider only FORMAL evaluations in your answer to this question, not informal evaluations or observations. __ Two or more times per year __ Once a year __ Once every 2 years __ Once every 3 years __ Once every 4 years __ Once every 5 or more years __ No formal evaluations are required\nFindings\nWhen asked to describe what they thought was meant by a \u201cformal\u201d evaluation, participants\u2019 responses were very consistent. Participants described \u201cformal evaluations\u201d as written evaluations that impact their career and go into their personnel file. Participants generally indicated that during their formal evaluations the principal or assistant principal observes them teaching a lesson. Prior to the observation they meet with the principal or assistant principal to discuss the lesson, and after the lesson they meet again to debrief on how the lesson went and areas for improvement.\nOn Items 1a and 1b, seven of the nine participants selected the same response for the number of times they were informally and formally evaluated. One participant indicated he had more informal evaluations than formal evaluations each year, while one said she had more formal evaluations than informal evaluations.\nRecommendations\nTo maintain consistency in wording with Item 1a, rephrase this item as:\n\u201cHow often are you rated in a FORMAL evaluation?\u201d\nTo maintain consistency with Item 1a, rephrase the directions as follows:\n\u201cConsider only FORMAL evaluations in your answer to this question, not informal observations or evaluations.\u201d\nTo maintain consistency with Item 1a, change the wording of the last response option to: \u201cNo formal evaluations are conducted.\u201d\n\n\fAppendix H. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, May 2011\n\nH-7\n\nItem 2a\nWere you, or are you going to be, rated in a FORMAL evaluation this school year? __Yes __ No \u2192 GO TO item 3 below.\n\nFindings Participants had no difficulty responding to this item. All participants responded \u201cYes\u201d to this item. Recommendations No revisions are recommended for this item.\n\nItem 2b\nAre student test score outcomes or test score growth included as an evaluation criterion in your FORMAL evaluation this school year? __ Yes __ No \u2192 GO TO item 3 below.\n\nFindings\nParticipants generally did not have any difficulty answering this item. Two of the nine participants answered \u201cYes.\u201d While others answered \u201cNo,\u201d all said that they understood the question and were aware of other teachers who were evaluated on the basis of student test score outcomes growth. For example, two participants mentioned that Teach for America fellows in their districts have student test score outcomes or test score growth included as evaluation criteria in their formal evaluation.\nOne participant answered \u201cNo,\u201d because test scores are not included as part of his formal evaluation. However, he later said that he does receive a monetary bonus if his students make a certain level of growth on assessment scores.\nSome participants commented that although they are not currently evaluated on the basis of student test scores, these outcomes are often discussed among staff and administrators and may factor into evaluations in the near future.\nRecommendations\nNCES should be aware that this item may not capture teachers who are eligible for a bonus based on their students\u2019 test scores. As long as this is the intent of the question, no revisions are recommended.\n\n\fH-8 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nItem 3\nWhich of the following describes the teaching certificate you currently hold that certifies you to teach in THIS state? Mark (X) only one box.\n\uf071 Regular or standard state certificate or advanced professional certificate \uf071 Certificate issued after satisfying all requirements except the completion of a probationary period \uf071 Certificate that requires some additional coursework, student teaching, or passage of a test before\nregular certification can be obtained\n\uf071 Certificate issued to persons who must complete a certification program in order to continue\nteaching\n\uf071 I do not hold any of the above certifications in THIS state\nFindings One teacher chose the first option, but was confused because she thought the question was referring to additional certifications or endorsements for other subject areas, rather than her basic teaching certificate. Another teacher indicated that she was in her probationary period, but still chose option A. Recommendations No revisions are recommended for this item.\nItem 4a\nAre you certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards in at least one content area? (The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is a nongovernment organization that administers National Board certification, a voluntary national assessment program that certifies teachers who meet high professional standards. In order to gain certification, the candidate must at least complete a portfolio of classroom practice and pass one or more tests of content knowledge.)\n\uf071 Yes, fully certified \uf071 No \u2192 GO TO item 4c below.\nFindings Eight of the nine participants said \u201cNo.\u201d The one participant who responded \u201cYes\u201d answered correctly; she was National Board certified. All but one of the participants had previously heard of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and had a general sense of what it was. One participant was initially not sure how to respond because he was working on his state certification and he did not know if this was related to National Board certification. Since he had never heard of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\fAppendix H. Cognitive Testing of Schools and Staffing Survey Items\n\nSummary of Findings and Recommendations, May 2011\n\nH-9\n\nRecommendations No revisions are recommended for this item.\n\nItem 4b\n\nUsing Table 1 on page 4, in what content area(s) does the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification allow you to teach?\n\nSubject Name\n\nCode\n\nFindings Note: The table of certification content area codes (Table 1) is included as Attachment H-3 to this report. The eight teachers that answered \u201cNo\u201d to the previous item initially skipped this question. When asked to review it, none saw anything about the question that they thought would make it confusing or difficult to answer. The one teacher who was National Board certified had no difficulty identifying the subject name and code for which she was certified (middle grades, general, code 103). Recommendations No revisions are recommended for this item.\nItem 4c\nAre you working toward National Board Certification?\n\uf071 Yes \uf071 No\nFindings Most participants had no difficulty responding to this item; all answered \u201cNo.\u201d As in Item 4a, one participant was not sure how to respond because he was working toward his state certification and did not know if this work would be related to National Board certification. This participant correctly responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question. Recommendations No revisions are recommended for this item.\n\n\fH-10 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nAttachment H-1.

I-3\n\n\fI-2 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nIntroduction\nAs part of the sampling for the 2011\u201312 SASS, the sample allocation was optimized with respect to standard errors and costs. This was done to improve the efficiency of the sample design for a fixed data collection budget. To accomplish this, SASS used optimum allocation. Optimum allocation refers to a method of sample allocation, used with stratified sampling. Optimum allocation is designed to provide the most precision for the least cost. Based on optimal allocation, the best sample size for stratum h is:\nnh = n * [ ( Nh * Sh ) / sqrt( ch ) ] / [ \u03a3 ( Nh * Sh ) / sqrt( ch ) ]\nwhere nh is the sample size for stratum h, n is total sample size, Nh is the population size for stratum h, Sh is the standard error of stratum h, and ch is the direct cost associated with collecting data from an individual school from stratum h. Note that ch does not include indirect costs, such as overhead costs. Cost data was obtained from the 2007\u201308 SASS. Standard errors used in the allocation were derived by averaging standard errors from the 2007\u201308 SASS and the 2003\u201304 SASS for total schools, total teachers, and total enrollment.\nFirst, sample was allocated by sector, resulting in a desired sample allocation of 10,250 regular public schools, 750 public charter schools, and 3,000 private schools. Next, sample was allocated, optimally, to state or affiliation and grade level. Some additional constraints were imposed as part of this allocation. All strata with at least five schools were assigned a minimum sample size of five. A maximum constraint of 60 percent of the schools in the sampling frame was also imposed on strata with a minimum of nine schools in the sampling frame.\nSampling Allocation by Sector\nRegular Public Schools\nIn public schools, the sample allocation was further restricted, with the goal of obtaining a maximum average coefficient of variation for regular public schools by grade within state. This step attempted to achieve coefficients of variation (CVs) of 15 percent for primary schools, 20 percent for middle schools, and 10 percent for high schools within a state. Sample was allocated to states so as to achieve a 10 percent overall coefficient of variation for state-level estimates. These constraints were applied assuming response rates comparable to the 2007\u201308 SASS could be achieved.\nFor the most part these constraints were achieved. However, in some smaller states, the CV requirement could not be achieved due to the 60 percent maximum sampling rate rule. This impacted middle and high school strata in these states, as well as the overall state-level CV in Delaware, North Dakota, and Vermont. Additionally, in some states, the high school CV was relaxed to 11 percent instead of 10 percent in order to avoid having an overall allocation result that differed too much from the 2007\u201308 result. These states where the relaxed high school CV requirement were applied were Arizona, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Washington.\n\n\fAppendix I. School and Teacher Sample Allocation Procedure\n\nI-3\n\nPublic Charter Schools\nFor public charter schools, a minimum sample size of two was allocated to state by grade level strata. Beyond that, no specific CV constraints were applied. The sample was allocated using the optimum allocation procedure.\nPrivate Schools\nPrivate schools, at the affiliation by grade level, were generally allocated a minimum sample size of 30 schools. Exceptions were made for Jewish, nonsectarian\u2014special emphasis, and nonsectarian\u2014special education in order to avoid overburdening these rather small affiliations that are sometimes rather reluctant to cooperate. For these three affiliations, a minimum sample size was set at 11 percent of the sampling frame for nonsectarian schools and 10 percent for Jewish schools. Schools from the Private School Universe Survey (PSS) area frame were all selected for sample (252 in total) since they tend to have a large variance associated with them. The remaining schools were allocated using the optimum allocation procedure. One slight deviation was implemented\u2014the affiliation by grade strata sample sizes was limited to 60 percent of the sampling frame. This additional constraint only affected Baptist secondary schools.\nOnce the sample had been allocated to affiliation by grade level, the sample was allocated to the sampling strata\u2014affiliation by grade by census region. This was accomplished by calculating the measure of size of each school in the sampling frame, the square root of the number of teachers, then summing the measure of size for each stratum. The sample for affiliation by grade level was then allocated to each region proportional to the accumulated measure of size of the schools within each region. A minimum sample size of two was set for each stratum that had at least two schools.\nSampling Allocation for Teachers\nOptimum allocation was not formally applied to the teacher sampling. Instead, teacher-within-school average cluster sizes were adjusted up or down in response to an analysis of the 2003\u201304 and 2007\u201308 teacher standard errors by school stratum. Previously, average cluster sizes varied only by sector and grade level. For regular public school teachers, the general goal was to be able to produce coefficients of variation of 15 percent for primary and high school teacher estimates by state and 20 percent for middle school teacher estimates by state. This was achieved by computing expected CVs using the new 2011\u201312 SASS school sample sizes and default teacher cluster sizes from the 2007\u201308 SASS. An assumption was made that all response rates would be within two percentage points of what they had been in the 2007\u201308 survey. Consequently, the average teacher cluster sizes for regular public schools were permitted to vary by state as well as grade level. A minimum average of three and a maximum average of 10 were implemented as a constraint.\nFor public charter and private school teachers, average cluster sizes were adjusted from the 2007\u201308 SASS so as to better achieve the desired goal of 5 percent CVs by grade level within sector. The average cluster sizes, however, were not permitted to vary by state or affiliation.\n\n\fThis page intentionally left blank.\n\n\fJ-1\nAppendix J.

J-3\n\n\fJ-2 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nBackground\nPublic school districts have a responsibility to shield their elementary and secondary schools from an excessive amount of interference with instructional time in the name of \u201cresearch.\u201d Therefore, they can have a system similar to universities\u2019 Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), which review potential research applications. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) does not systematically search for such school district policies. Over the years, though, various surveys as well as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) have identified a common set of school districts with known policies for handling research requests.\nThese school districts can approve or reject their schools\u2019 ability to consider participation in the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). Therefore, securing the approval of these districts is essential to the success of SASS. In past years, many districts indicated that formal approval from the district was required before they would allow schools to participate in SASS. Often this approval process required months to complete, making it difficult to obtain approval during the SASS data collection period. In the 2003\u201304 and 2007\u201308 administrations of SASS, the NCES and Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI) attempted to identify and contact districts with a formal approval process well ahead of data collection in order to secure this approval. For the 2011\u201312 administration of SASS, the U.S. Census Bureau was responsible for researching and/or contacting the districts in order to obtain requirements for submission of an external research request, compiling the research request packet, and submitting the research request packet to the appropriate personnel/department. The Census Bureau identified 321 school districts that required prior approval to conduct surveys with schools in their district based on past administrations of SASS, other NCES-sponsored surveys, and the district contact calling operation that occurred in the summer of 2011. These 321 districts oversaw 1,998 schools that were selected for SASS. The Census Bureau referred to these districts as \u201cspecial contact districts.\u201d Due to the high number of special contact districts, and considering available resources and time, Census Bureau staff first applied to all special contact districts with three or more sampled schools. As resources and time permitted, some districts with two or fewer sampled schools were contacted. As a result, the Census Bureau sent research requests packets to 214 districts prior to the initial mailout. Seven additional special contact districts that oversaw a total of 48 schools were identified after the initial mailout and these districts were sent research packets. The Census Bureau applied to a total of 221 districts.\nMethods\nCensus Bureau staff began researching and/or contacting districts in February 2011. The purpose of the research or initial contact was to identify a contact person at the district and to determine what requirements needed to be satisfied before the district would approve the administration of SASS. Generally, districts required either research applications or research proposals. These applications often requested background on the study, information on the sampling plan, survey questionnaires, school resources required, and a plan for protecting the confidentiality of data. Census Bureau staff prepared research applications or proposals according to the districts\u2019 requirements and submitted them directly to the district. Census Bureau staff developed a tracking sheet that listed each of the special contact districts and provided a description of their research requirements, contact names, and the initial and final outcome of contact with the district. The Census Bureau provided regular updates on the progress of the approval process to the NCES.\n\n\fAppendix J. Report on Results of Special Contact Districts J-3\n\nFindings\n\nBy the initial mailout, 42 districts approved their participation in SASS (either unconditionally or conditionally), 126 districts had not granted permission to conduct the survey and were pending, and the remaining 46 districts denied participation. Of the special contact districts, 188 had special handling procedures related to the package contents or the appropriate recipient. School packages1 were mailed to the majority of schools in districts where a decision was pending, as long as there were no known special procedures. These special procedures included, but were not limited to, sending the district\u2019s letter granting permission when sending materials to the school, altering the text of the letters, having principals formally approve survey participation in their schools by signing a Principal Permission Form, or having all participants approve survey participation by signing a Participant Informed Consent Form.\n\nThe Census Bureau ceased following up with the special contact districts regarding the applications in December 2011. At the end of follow-up efforts, 58 districts approved their schools\u2019 participation in SASS, approval in 15 of districts without special procedures was pending, approval in 90 of districts with special procedures were pending, and 58 districts denied participation. Schools in districts that denied participation and schools in districts with special procedures where approval was pending were not contacted.\n\nThe response rate of schools in the special contact districts was lower than the overall public school response rate for all school level questionnaires. The response rate comparison is shown in table J-1. These response rates differ from the unweighted final response rates as those were determined after the data were edited and completeness checks were performed.\n\nTable J-1.

Future SASS administrations should continue to contact districts that require formal permission to conduct surveys with their schools as it reduces the number of districts that need to be contacted for permission during data collection. The approval process should begin as early in the year as possible so that the status of the majority of the special contact districts is determined prior to the initial mail-out.\n\n1The initial package of SASS questionnaires (including the Teacher Listing Form, Principal Questionnaire, and School Questionnaire, and School Library Media Center Questionnaire) was mailed to schools in October 2011.\n\n\fJ-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\nAs districts approve, they may alert the Census Bureau that they require that special procedures be implemented when contacting their schools via mail, telephone calls, or personal visits. While the Census Bureau should strive to accommodate these requests, care should be taken to limit the extent of additional resources allocated to these schools. For example, the goal should be, whenever possible, to limit the extent to which mail packages need to be modified, excluding the initial package sent to schools. Modifications to the initial package are relatively easy to accommodate because there is enough time to prepare them in advance. Modifications to subsequent school and teacher packages, while possible, are more problematic because of the decreased turnaround time and, in the case of teacher packages, the large workload that is involved.\n\n\fK-1\n\nAppendix K. 2011\u201312 SASS Unit Nonresponse Bias Analysis\n\nA comprehensive unit nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for the 2011\u201312 SASS.

Quality Assurance for Data Capture and Mailout Operations\nThis appendix details the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) quality assurance (QA) for the data capture operations. \u201cData capture\u201d is the method by which the SASS data are captured and converted from paper to electronic format. The data capture operations were facilitated by the Integrated Computer Assisted Data Entry (iCADE) system. An overview of the data keying operations is provided in chapter 7. The \u201cmailout operations\u201d include all procedures necessary for preparing Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) packages for distribution to respondents, including printing of all forms (such as letters, questionnaires, reminder postcards, etc.) and assembly of packages for sampled teachers.\nThe first section of this appendix describes the data capture operation procedures used by keying staff. The second section describes the detailed procedures used for quality assurance (QA) and verification of the SASS questionnaire data capture. The third section provides results of the verification of the SASS questionnaire data capture. The fourth and final section describes the detailed procedures for QA of the mailout operations and provides the results.\nData Capture and Imaging\nThe 2011\u201312 SASS paper data were captured (converted from paper to electronic format) using a combination of manual data keying and imaging technology, both of which were facilitated by the iCADE system. Prior to data capture, keying programs were developed for each SASS questionnaire. Images of these forms were captured during data entry, and these image files were used during the analyst data review steps of data processing to view the actual questionnaires online.\nWhen the SASS paper questionnaires were received and checked-in by the Census Bureau clerical processing staff, they were entered into the iCADE system for control purposes and grouped into batches by questionnaire type for data capture and imaging. The batches of questionnaires were disassembled using a guillotine, and each duplex page was scanned. At the conclusion of the scanning process, the iCADE control system matched the number of imaged pages with the number of pages expected for each questionnaire type. If there was a discrepancy between the images scanned and the number of pages expected, a series of screens was presented to clerical staff, enabling a clerk or supervisor to either accept the batch as it was or to pull it from processing until the issue was resolved.\nThe batches that were accepted after the scanning process go to the next stages of data capture: auto registration, Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), and manual registration. During auto registration, all of the scanned images were read into the server by their barcodes, which then identified each page in the batch. Once the pages were identified, the OMR server could then read and recognize the presence of answer marks in the boxes next to precoded, categorical items. The OMR server was programmed with the locations of the answer boxes for precoded items prior to data capture. The program automatically entered the appropriate data into the OMR script file for that questionnaire.\nDuring auto registration and OMR, a number of things could have potentially gone wrong. For example, if the system was unable to read a barcode, then it was not able to identify the questionnaire ID. If the system was unable to recognize a page corner point, it did not know which questionnaire page it was on and thus OMR was not able to occur. Finally, occasionally there were checkbox ambiguities due to marks outside of a checkbox, scratch outs, or random marks on a page. If any of these three scenarios occurred, the batch automatically went through the manual registration phase of data capture, during which a series of screens was presented to clerical\n\n\fL-2 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nstaff, enabling a clerk or supervisor to resolve the issue by manual repair. If there were no problems during the auto registration and OMR, this manual registration step was skipped altogether.\nThe next stage of data capture was a data quality check of the OMR responses, referred to as the Optical Mark Analysis (OMA) Sample Verification. During this check, a percentage of blank OMR fields and nonblank OMR fields were sampled so that clerks could verify the output from OMR. A random number was generated at the starting point for both blank and nonblank fields within a batch. Then, the system began at a randomly generated number and took every X\u2019th field for the blank fields. A similar procedure was used for the nonblank fields, and all sampled fields were added to an OMA data file. This OMA data file was then sent to a verification clerk who verified the validity of the OMA output. The verification clerk was presented with an image of the sample fields and was instructed to enter the response (if any) that he or she found in each field.\nThe system computed error rates for both the blank and nonblank fields. An error occurred when the clerk\u2019s field verification differed from the OMR recognition. When differences were found, the batch sample was forwarded to a second clerk, an Adjudicator, who was then required to provide an interpretation of the marks with differences. When the Adjudicator had made a decision and the data had been adjusted if necessary, the batch was marked as finished and was then checked for batch completeness.\nOnce all of the OMR data were captured correctly and verified as necessary, all write-in fields (e.g., open-ended, numeric, and character fields) were captured by a process called Key from Image (KFI). Keyers were presented with fields to key based on whether the server detected a \u201cpresence\u201d in an answer field. Prior to data capture, the server was programmed where to look for the presence of answer marks for items that were not precoded. The keyer either keyed the data present in the field or indicated that the field was blank.\nThe next stage of data capture was a data quality check of the KFI responses, referred to as Analyze KFI. During this check, a percentage of nonblank KFI fields were sampled so that clerks could verify the output. A random number was generated at the starting point for nonblank fields within a batch. Then, the system began at the randomly generated number and took every X\u2019th field for the nonblank fields and all sampled fields were added to a KFI data file. This KFI data file was then sent to a verification clerk who would verify the validity of the KFI output. The verification clerk was presented with an image of the sample fields and was instructed to enter the response, if any, that he or she found in each field. This clerk was not provided with the data entered by the original keyer.\nThe system compared the KFI entry from the first entry and the verification entry. The fields with differences were flagged in the KFI script file. In addition, the system computed error rates for the nonblank fields. An error occurred when the clerk\u2019s field verification differed from the original KFI entry. Errors were classified into a number of categories, based upon the keying error situation.\nFor these cases where there was a difference, the batch KFI script file was forwarded to a third clerk, an Adjudicator, who was required to provide an interpretation of the marks with differences. The Adjudicator could 1) agree with the keyer, 2) agree with the verifier, or 3) provide his or her own interpretation of the respondent\u2019s answer. The Adjudicator then classified the error into a number of categories based on the keying error situation; this classification served as the final classification. Once the Adjudicator had made a decision and the data had been adjusted if necessary, the batch was marked as finished and released to the sponsor.\n\nGeneral\n\nGeneral Information on Quality Assurance Procedures\n\n\fAppendix L. Quality Assurance for Data Capture and Mailout Operations L-3\n1. This QA plan provides a method of assuring the quality of the iCADE KFI Data Capture Operations for the 2011\u201312 SASS.\n2. The data from SASS forms will be captured utilizing the iCADE Data Capture System to perform OMR and KFI processes.\n3. For the KFI and OMA components of data capture, an independent verification will be employed. Verification will employ the same edits and capture rules as the production environment. The sponsor may elect to suspend or institute verification of any component at any time in consultation with QAB/DSD.\n4. Upon verification for each component of the batch, the original datasets and the verification datasets will be matched. Any discrepancies will be identified, classified, and subsequently adjudicated by the Quality Assurance Data Analysis Unit (QADAU) staff.\n5. Once adjudication is complete, accepted batches will be released for subsequent transmission. Rejected batches will undergo remainder verification for the fields not previously sample verified for the part(s) of the component(s) that failed, matched against the original data set, classified, adjudicated, and released.\n6. Any fields designated as \u201cmust verify\u201d will be verified 100 percent and excluded from any sample counts and batch decisions.\n7. Keyers will have completed keyboarding and procedural training prior to commencing production keying.\nBatch statistics will be maintained by the system and utilized by the QA staff to generate summary reports. Reports will be provided to the sponsor and data capture management, regarding project quality and for feedback to data capture keyers.\nReference Documents\na. Keying procedures will be provided for the operation.\nb. Codes for error classification for OMA and KFI are provided in Attachment L-1 of this QA plan.\nDefinitions\n1. A batch consists of (X) number of forms with a cover sheet for scanning and data capture purposes. The size of the batch is the number of forms in the batch. The batch sizes for SASS are as follows:\nSASS 1A, 1A(T), 2A, 2A(T), 2B, 2B(T), 3A and 3A(T) consist of (30) Forms. SASS 3B, 3B(T), 3Y, 3Y(T), 4A, 4A(T), 4B and 4B(T) consist of (20) Forms. LS 1A and 1A(T) consist of (50) Forms.\n2. Census Batch Number is a unique number created during the batching process.\n3. Optical Mark Analysis is the clerical review of the combined processes of Optical Mark Recognition by the OMR software and the ambiguous marks. A mark is considered ambiguous when the system cannot determine if the mark is a valid response. OMA does not occur until after Manual Registration/Ambiguities have been addressed.\n4. Key From Image (KFI) is the process where a data entry operator enters the data using the document\u2019s scanned images.\n\n\fL-4 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n5. A component is one of two processes that make up the data capture application, i.e., the Optical Mark Analysis and the Key From Image. Each of these components contains two parts, i.e., Blank Fields and Nonblanks Fields.\n6. A field is the smallest denomination of keyed data, as defined in the keying procedures.\n7. A blank field is a field where no data were detected during the automated presence detection phase of processing. Conversely, a nonblank field is a field where data were detected during the automated presence detection phase of processing.\n8. An Eligible sampling unit is a field that is eligible to be selected for verification.\n9. Excluded fields are fields that are captured but not eligible for verification.\n10. Must verify fields are fields that are presented for verification due to being predesignated fields or fields with warning flags. These are not part of the four universes of fields eligible for sampling.\n11. The verifier is the operator who captures the data for the match to the original data to subsequently determine the quality of the batch.\n12. A discrepancy occurs when the verifier\u2019s entry for any field differs from its corresponding field in the original data capture process.\n13. A field is considered to be defective if it contains one or more errors. This is synonymous with field in error.\n14. An error is defined within the data capture operation as any incorrectly captured data field. A field is in error if it contains one of the following types of errors:\na. OMA\u2014instance where the OMA process was unable to correctly interpret the mark-sense field.\nb. Key From Image (KFI)\u2014instances where the KFI operator erroneously captured or failed to capture the data.\nc. Presence Detection\u2014instances where the system failed to detect presence of data.\n15. An error assigned during the classification or adjudication operation may be classified as any of the actions listed in Attachment L-1 of this QA plan.\na. Charged errors\u2014keying errors that are determined to be the fault of the keyer and will be used to determine the keyer\u2019s error rate.\nb. Noncharged errors\u2014errors that are not charged against the keyer.\nc. Some discrepancies are considered \u201cnoncountable.\u201d These are classified as verifier errors (VE) and verifier adjustments (VA). They do not affect the keyer or batch status and are not counted against either the keyer or the batch.\n16. Classification refers to the initial process of comparing the discrepancies to the image source document to determine which entry is correct and assigning the proper error code.\n\n\fAppendix L. Quality Assurance for Data Capture and Mailout Operations L-5\n17. Adjudication refers to the review process of comparing the discrepancies to the image source document to determine which entry is correct and validating or assigning the proper error code.\n18. Remainder verification is the term used for performing 100 percent verification of the nonsampled fields for the part(s) of the component(s) in rejected batches.\nVerification\n1. For each component of data capture, independent verification will be performed. Eligible fields on the images will be presented for verification.\n2. For batches eligible for sample verification, a sample will be drawn from the universes of each component for nonblank and blank fields as follows:\na. OMA nonblank fields\u2014a 5 percent (1 in 20) systematic sample utilizing a random start is drawn.\nb. OMA blank fields\u2014a 1 percent (1 in 100) systematic sample utilizing a random start is drawn from the universe of fields where the system did not detect presence of OMR data.\nc. KFI nonblank fields\u2014100 percent (1 in 1) is drawn from the universe of fields where the system did detect presence of data.\nd. KFI blank fields\u2014a 1 percent (1 in 100) systematic sample utilizing a random start is drawn from the universe of fields where the system did not detect presence of KFI data.\nNOTE: The sponsor may elect to perform verification on blank fields and then suspend verification.\n3. Excluded fields\u2014will be indicated in the data capture procedure.\n4. Must verify fields\u2014will be indicated in the data capture procedure. Additionally, there may be fields with warning flags that are categorized as must verify fields.\n5. Perform the verification in the following manner:\na. independently capture all fields presented by the system using the document image.\nb. use the same capture rules as the production environment. 6. If during OMA or KFI an image is determined to be illegible due to scanning problems, notify the supervisor\nso that the appropriate disposition may be determined.\nQuality Assurance Adjudication\n1. Upon completion of each of the OMA and KFI verification, the original data sets and the verification data sets for each batch will be matched by the data capture system. Any discrepancies will be identified, classified and subsequently adjudicated by the QADAU staff.\n2. If any fields within the batch do not match, the classifier and/or QA adjudicator will determine if the production-captured data is in error. Error codes assigned will determine the data field to be retained in the final data set. If both fields are determined to be in error during the KFI component (error code 11), that field will be presented for the classifier or adjudicator to correct.\n\n\fL-6 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n3. Once adjudication is complete, accepted batches will be released for subsequent transmission. Rejected batches will undergo 100 percent remainder verification for the part(s) of the component(s) that failed, then matched against the original data set, classified, adjudicated and released.\n4. All errors detected in the verification and adjudication processes will be corrected.\n5. Use of the \u201cVA\u201d and \u201cVE\u201d error codes is approved for the following:\na. Keyers will be instructed to disregard keying the respondent leading zeros to minimize differences but will not be charged for keying the leading zeros. (Exceptions: Fields where dates and times are entered as specified in the keying procedures on page 33, section F.3.)\nb. Omission of spaces between the letters in place of a period, as per keying procedures on page 30, section E.2. This includes illegible spacing.\nc. If the only difference between the keyed and verified data is upper/lower case lettering (Example: J c Penney vs. J C Penney).\nd. If the keyer has corrected the spelling of a name that is illegible and the correct name spelling can be found anywhere else on the form.\ne. Responses that are \u201chard to read.\u201d If the keyer leaves a \u201ckeyer note\u201d indicating that they had difficulty reading the entry, an error will not be charged to the keyer of the batch.\nKeyer Control\n1. There is no keyer qualification process involved. Keyers will be set as qualified at the start of the survey keying. Decisions to retain keyers will be based on original keying (K Times = 1) only. Remainder verification on OMA blank and nonblank fields and KFI blank fields does not affect keyer status.\n(1) Calculate a keyer error rate for each batch:\nChargeable KFI nonblank fields in error ----------------------------------------------------- X 100\nKFI nonblank fields verified (2) QA will monitor and report keyer error rate on KFI nonblank keying if the keyer field error rate is\ngreater than 1.0 percent on a consistent basis. The decision to retrain the keyer will be determined by the DCB supervisor, QA and sponsor review of the overall keyer error rate report for the survey.\n(3) No batch decisions are made in this stage. Keyers in the qualified stage will receive keyer decisions on the KFI nonblank.\n2. Restricted Keyers (Keyer Status = R)\n(1) Keyers will be removed based on an administrative decision.\n(2) Restricted keyers are not eligible to perform verification.\nBatch Control\n\n\fAppendix L. Quality Assurance for Data Capture and Mailout Operations L-7\n1. Batch decisions for sample verified batches are made based on the criteria for each phase as follows:\na. OMA\u2014nonblank fields\u2014accept <=1.0 percent; b. OMA\u2014blank fields\u2014accept <=1.0 percent; c. KFI\u2014blank fields\u2014accept <=1.0 percent; and d. KFI\u2014nonblank fields are verified at 100 percent.\n2. All rejected sample batches will be 100 percent remainder verified for the part(s) of the component(s) that failed, then matched against the original data set, classified, adjudicated and released.\n3. No batch decisions will be made for remainder verification batches verified 100 percent.\n4. QA will institute a form of process control for OMA nonblank fields. If the percent of OMA nonblank fields sent to ambiguity repair is greater than the established control limit for three consecutive batches, QA will initiate an investigation with all concerned parties to determine the cause and the appropriate action to be taken.\n5. QA will institute a form of process control for KFI and OMA blank fields. If the percent of KFI and OMA blank fields is greater than the established control limit for three consecutive batches, QA will initiate an investigation with all concerned parties to determine the cause and the appropriate action to be taken.\nVerifier Requirements\n1. Verifiers must be qualified for the stage in which the batch was keyed.\na. Keyers in the qualified stage may verify qualified and restricted keyers\u2019 batches.\nb. Restricted keyers will not be allowed to verify.\n2. The system will check the keyer status of each verifier before allowing the verifier to verify a batch.\nIf the verifier\u2019s status indicates that the verifier is not eligible to verify a particular batch, the verifier will receive an error message and will not be allowed to verify that batch.\nFeedback And Continuous Improvement\nDiscrepancy listings will be provided for all batches. Keyers should be given feedback of all errors and all cases in which they have shown improvement. Particular attention should be given to keyers whose batches have keyer rejection decisions.\nInformation or decisions for handling procedural changes or any corrective actions resulting from the QA processes should be shared with all concerned parties.\nRejected Batches\n1. All rejected batches will be set by the system to be 100 percent remainder verified for the part(s) of the component(s) that failed, then matched against the original data set, classified, adjudicated and released.\n2. Remainder verification of rejected batches should occur as soon as possible. Remainder verification is considered part of the feedback process on system, OMA clerk and keyer performance.\n\n\fL-8 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n3. Remainder verification requires the verifier to independently capture all eligible fields not corrected in the original sample for the part(s) of the component(s) that failed.\nQuality Assurance Responsibilities 1. The QADAU will perform adjudication on all batches processed through the iCADE operations. 2. The iCADE system will generate a discrepancy listing for each batch for feedback to the KFI operators. 3. The QA staff will audit all discrepancy listings for completeness and accuracy. Batch statistics will be maintained by the system and utilized to generate summary reports. The QADAU will provide weekly summary reports of the results of the QA process.\nError Codes (Fields Only)\nTable L-1 provides a list of error codes and definitions for the 2011\u201312 SASS data keying operations.\n\n\fAppendix L.

Table L-2 provides a summary of the results and table L-3 provides the distribution of error types for the key from image (KFI) data capture used for all SASS questionnaires.\nIn table L-2 below, the accept and reject criteria are based on sampling a portion of the KFI entries for a batch and determining if the sample error rate is less than or exceeds the sample rate error parameters. Instead of entries being sampled for SASS, all KFI data entries were verified. The blank fields column refers to a data quality check of blank KFI fields, where a percentage of blank KFI fields are sampled so that clerks could verify the output. The process of the blank KFI field data quality check is identical to that described earlier for the nonblank KFI fields. Verification of blank KFI fields was not a requirement for the SASS data capture process.\n\nTable L-2.

All packages that were mailed to respondents and field representatives were mailed from Jeffersonville, Indiana, by the Census Bureau clerical processing staff.\nAll 2011\u201312 SASS questionnaires were printed commercially and then went through a separate labeling process in Jeffersonville. The exceptions to this were additional copies of the SASS-3Y Public School Questionnaire (with district items) requested by Census Headquarters staff during data collection, as well as all SASS telephone interview questionnaires, which were produced using the DocuPrint equipment. Other forms such as letters, postcards, inserts and other custom forms, such as District Contact Sheets, were also produced using the DocuPrint equipment. The DocuPrint equipment allowed for printing labeled letters in one operation. In addition, the DocuPrint system can be programmed to print variable data that is specific to that respondent within a letter. All DocuPrint materials were inspected for damage and incorrect presentation.\nFor the additional SASS-3Y and SASS telephone interview questionnaire booklets, the DocuPrint equipment loaded one 17-inch by 11-inch sheet at a time. Four questionnaire pages (8.5 x 11, front and back) were printed onto this sheet. Once all sheets for a questionnaire booklet were completed, a sample of the work was examined to\n\n\fL-12 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nensure that no errors occurred. When an error was found, an expanded inspection examined the questionnaires that were produced before and after the detected questionnaire to determine if a systematic error had taken place. Once the QA of the printing was completed, the sheets went through a binding operation using Duplo Booklet Maker equipment. The Booklet Maker read the barcode to determine when the designated number of sheets for a particular questionnaire were loaded into the machine, and then folded and stapled it twice in the spine, and trimmed the right-side vertical edge of the booklet. Booklets were subjected to sample inspections and, when defects were detected, to expanded inspections.\n\nCommercially printed blank questionnaires were loaded into an Ektajet high-speed printer for labeling. The variable data for each respondent was programmed into the machine, and printer heads labeled the front page of each questionnaire as it passed through the machine. Labeled questionnaires were subjected to sample inspections and, when defects were detected, to expanded inspections.\n\nThe assembly of packages for schools, training kits for field representatives, and questionnaire packets were all inspected to assure that nothing was damaged, missing, contained undisclosed information, or was incorrectly presented. The results of the mailout QA, including error remarks, for all initial mailout operations can be found in exhibits L-1 through L-3.\n\nExhibit L-1.

Quality Assurance for Data Capture and Mailout Operations L-37\nAttachment L-1. Error Codes for Data Capture\nThe following error code definitions and guidelines have been devised as an aid in assigning the proper error code to keying errors and program-detected discrepancies. This document includes examples to use when determining the proper code. Some examples provide for different data capture applications for certain error codes. Use of these definitions and examples will result in a more consistent approach in the assignment of error codes and greater reporting accuracy.\nOnce the verifier enters all the required data for a batch (100 percent or sample), the program will match the verifier\u2019s data with the keyer\u2019s or automated data captured entries. Any differences will be displayed on the discrepancy screen. The classifier enters the appropriate error code for each difference by referencing the actual document or image and reviewing the keyer or captured entries and the verifier entries.\nThe program calculates the number and kind of errors based on the codes assigned by the classifier. It is essential that the classifier understands the error codes and assigns them properly.\nA simulated version of the discrepancy screen is used to present examples throughout these guidelines.\nIn order to determine the proper error code, compare the data on the source document with the captured data shown and the verifier\u2019s data and determine which is correct. If the captured entry is correct, code the discrepancy with a \u201cVE\u201d (See Verifier Error). This code will signal the program to accept the captured data and delete the verifier\u2019s entry for that field.\nIf the verifier is correct, assign the proper error code as explained on the following pages. The computer will accept the verifier\u2019s entry and delete the captured data for that field.\nNOTE: The classifier will enter the error code only. The system is programmed to distinguish between chargeable and nonchargeable errors. The classifier does not need to enter an asterisk (*) or other notation for nonchargeable errors.\nAll errors are accredited to the batch and are used in computing batch error rates and determining batch decisions, if required. Nonchargeable errors are errors in which the data entry operator was not at fault and are not included in the keyer\u2019s error rate or keyer decision, if required. Codes of \u201cVA\u201d (Verifier Adjustment) and \u201cVE\u201d are not charged to the batch or keyer.\nIn the examples to follow, the word \u201ckeyer\u201d may represent the captured entry if automated data capture techniques are employed.\nError Codes for Data Capture\nOne error code must be assigned for each discrepancy. The type and number of codes should be in accordance with this procedure provided to the classifier. Assigning the proper error codes is essential in assuring that good batches are accepted and rejected batches are reworked.\nListed below are the error codes to be used.\nSTANDARD ERROR CODES (FIELDS)\u2014CFI/KFI/KFP\n\n\fL-38 Documentation for the 2011\u201312 Schools and Staffing Survey\n\nERROR CODE DEFINITION\n\n1 2 3 4 5* 6* 7* 8 9 10* 11 12* 13* 14* 15* 16* VA** VE**\n\nOTHER\u2014CHARGEABLE (EXPLAIN IN REMARKS) DATA OMISSION DATA DUPLICATION AUTO/MANUAL DUPLICATION ERROR RESPONDENT ERROR\u2014DATA OUTSIDE RECOGNITION ZONE RECOGNITION MISREAD RECOGNITION OMISSION FINGER ERROR PROCEDURE ERROR BOTH CAPTURED AND VERIFIER DATA INCORRECT (NONCHARGEABLE) BOTH CAPTURED AND VERIFIER DATA INCORRECT (CHARGEABLE) CODE ERROR\u2014HARD TO READ MACHINE ERROR\u2014KEYER NOT AT FAULT (SUPV INITIALS) SUPERVISOR ERROR\u2014(SUPV INITIALS) OTHER\u2014NONCHARGEABLE (EXPLAIN IN REMARKS) PROCEDURE MODIFICATION/CLARIFICATION VERIFIER ADJUSTMENT VERIFIER ERROR\n\n*NONCHARGEABLE KEYER ERRORS **DO NOT COUNT AS ERRORS\u2014CHARGEABLE OR NONCHARGEABLE\n\nNOTE: The classifier/adjudicator will enter the error code only.

An explanation of these codes must be recorded on the Discrepancy Listing and initialed by the DCB supervisor.\nIn the examples below, the error code 1\u2019s (document 83) are applied to errors that resulted from the keyer failing to reject a document that clearly should have been rejected. The error code 15\u2019s (document 90) are being applied to a document that the verifier rejected. In this second instance, the reasons for rejecting the document were less clear. Frequently, the DCB supervisor will make the determination as to whether or not the keyer should be charged the errors in this type of situation.\n\n\fAppendix L.

The example for documents 32 through 34 below involves this type of situation.\n\nAlso, the keyer may duplicate the wrong information: the data in the preceding field is not the same data to be keyed for the current field. The example for documents 57 and 58 involves duplicating the wrong data.\n\nDo not confuse these types of errors with data duplication errors (3).

These type differences occur when the procedure is revised (modification) or additional instructions are provided to clarify the procedure (Clarification).\n\nProcedure Clarification\u2014Usage of this explanation for error code 16 should be limited. It is applicable to situations in which a segment of the keyer\u2019s instructions in the written procedure are difficult to understand and the supervisor must consult the Project Planner for further explanation. The Project Planner may in turn, consult the sponsoring division to clarify the procedure. The resulting explanation should result in a formal revision to the procedure. However, the keyers are given immediate additional instructions as a group.\n\nProcedure Modification\u2014This explanation of error code 16 is applicable when a procedure revision has been issued. In certain situations, the keyer will have keyed the data according to the original procedure, and the verifier will have keyed the data following the revised procedure. The discrepancies in the data that resulted from the revision in the procedure would be coded as error code 16\u2019s.\n\nThe following situations are NOT \u201cprocedure clarifications\u201d or \u201cprocedure modifications\u201c:\n\n1. A keyer misunderstands the procedure and keys the data incorrectly. (Error code 9)\n2. Entries on the source document are poorly written and the keyer misinterprets the entries. (Error code 12) 3. The verifier questions entries on the source document. The supervisor changes the entries on the form,\nwhich results in discrepancies with the keyer entries. (Error code 15) 4. The supervisor gives the keyer the wrong instructions for keying an entry. (Error code 14)\n\nNOTE: In both cases, the Modification or Clarification must have occurred AFTER the keyer completed keying the batch and BEFORE the verification has been completed.\n\nVER SPV QA\n\nDOC SEQ#\n\nCFN/ID#\n\n16\n\nc51 77251\n\nITEM STREET ADDRESS\n\n16\n\n92 87321\n\nSTREET ADDRESS\n\nKEYER\n\nVERIFIER\n\n158 ANY STREET 158 ANY ST P.O. BOX 450 PO BOX 450\n\nVA\u2014Verifier Adjustment\nThe VA code is used for the coding of entries on the discrepancy screen/listing that need adjusting due to an error that is not chargeable to the keyer or the batch. In the example shown below for document 97, the keyer made a finger error on the key code entry. The data entry was keyed correctly but matched to the wrong key code due to the error. The verifier corrects the key code entry from \u201c223\u201d to \u201c233\u201d and moves the data entry to the correct field. The verifier assigned the VA code to the \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d lines displaying the correct entries for that field and the keyer is charged on the line that was in error. (This would apply on item/data entries only; fixed fields entries would be charged on both fields keyed and VA\u2019d only on the verifier\u2018s adjustment)\nAnother instance in which the VA code is used involves the resolution of referral flags. For some keying jobs, the keyer may be instructed to key a flag (for example, \u201c#\u201d) for a field that is in question. When the verifier enters the\n\n\fAppendix L. Quality Assurance for Data Capture and Mailout Operations L-47\n\nbatch, the flag has been resolved, and the verifier is told to enter the correct data. Coding the difference as a VA signals the computer to accept the verifier\u2018s entry but not to consider the difference as an error.\n\nVER SPV QA\n\nDOC SEQ#\n\nCFN/ID#\n\n8\n\n97 29302\n\nVA\n\n97 29302\n\nVA\n\n97 29302\n\nVA\n\n97 29302\n\nITEM Key Code\nData Key Code\nData\n\nKEYER 223 3990\n\nVERIFIER\n233 3990\n\nVA\n\n26 37890\n\nQTR EMPLOYEES\n\n#\n\n159\n\n*VA\n\n46 55421\n\n*VA\n\n65 66005\n\n123 JUNE AVE 123 JUNE AV JS BOOK STORE JS BOOKSTORE\n\n* When discrepancies occur in alpha fields (such as company names, street address, etc.) that involve differences in spacing or abbreviations only, and the meaning of the data is not affected, code these discrepancies as \u201cVA\u201d unless instructed differently in the QA plan or keying procedure.\n\nBookstore McDonald George Town Ave\n\nPO vs vs vs vs vs\n\nP O Book Store Mc Donald Georgetown Av\n\nNOTE: State name abbreviations are specific.

R-208\nWithin each questionnaire crosswalk, variables are listed in 2011\u201312 item order. If there is a blank in the variable\u2019s name for 1987\u201388, 1990\u201391, 1993\u201394, 1999\u20132000, 2003\u201304, or 2007\u201308, then that particular 2011\u201312 item did not have an equivalent item in earlier years. Variables from 2011\u201312 are categorized for how closely they \u201cmatch\u201d the corresponding variable in the 2007\u201308 questionnaire. The categories are:\n\u2022 New. The question was added since the previous survey. \u2022 Exact. The question wording and format are exactly the same except for changes in reference periods, changes in skip patterns, and item references. \u2022 Minor. The question content is the same, but there have been minor changes to the question wording or format. Minor changes include addition or deletion of text in the question, instruction or answer categories, changes in the use of bold and capitalization, and a change in the length of a write-in response category. \u2022 Major. The general content of or subject addressed by the item is the same, but the question wording or format has been changed significantly.\nIn addition, there are four crosswalks that compare similarities and differences across the 2011\u201312 SASS questionnaires given to each type of respondent (i.e., public school district, principal, school, or teacher). The first crosswalk presents items from the District Questionnaire that are also included on the Public School Questionnaire (with District Items) or the Private School Questionnaire (pages R-195 through R-199). The second crosswalk compares items found on the Principal and Private School Principal Questionnaires (pages R-200 through R-205), the third crosswalk compares items that are found on the three school questionnaires: School Questionnaire, Public School Questionnaire (with District Items), and Private School Questionnaire (pages R-206 through R-217), and the fourth crosswalk compares items found on the Teacher and Private School Teacher Questionnaires (pages R-218 through R-229). Comparisons are categorized on how well the item matches across surveys on the same scale as described above.
