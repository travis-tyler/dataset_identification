Currently, this system runs on a UNIX platform, but was originally designed for PC-based use, and, as such, is referred to as \"PCTides.\" The system is composed of a two-dimensional barotropic ocean model, which is driven by tidal forcing and/or surface wind and pressure forcing. PCTides is applied to the user's area of interest to provide a hindcast or forecast of tidal amplitude, phase and two-dimensional barotropic ocean currents. The PCTides system uses the solutions from a global tide model Finite Element Solutions 99 (FES99) to provide global boundary conditions. The system also contains a 2-min global bathymetry database (the NRL DBDB2 database) to define the model's geometry and bathymetry. Wind forcing for PCTides comes from a number of sources. If the user has access, the Navy's Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS), or the Coupled Ocean & Atmospheric Mesocale Prediction system (COAMIPS) may be used. Based on this model, hurricane forcing can be generated that can provide surface pressure and winds to drive the two-dimensional barotropic ocean model and generate a storm surge. One major advantage of PCTides is that the model has the ability to be rapidly relocated to areas of interest. The tidal heights can be generated at a user-specified latitude/longitude position and, therefore, is not dependent on a tidal \"look up\" table or preexisting database of preselected locations. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has built a globally relocatable tide-surge forecast system. Currently this system runs on a UNIX platform but was originally designed for PC-based use and as such is referred to as \"PCTides\". The system is composed of a twodimensional barotropic ocean model driven by tidal forcing and/or surface wind and pressure forcing. PCTides is applied to the user's area of interest to provide a hindcast or forecast of tidal amplitude, phase and 2-dimensional barotropic ocean currents. The PCTides system uses the solutions from a global tide model (FES99) (Lefevre et al., 2000) to provide global boundary conditions. The system also contains a 2-minute global bathymetry database, the NRL DBDB2 database, to define the model's geometry and bathymetry. PCTides may be run in a mode loosely constraining the solutions to a subset of more than 4000 tidal observations stations from the International Hydrographic Observations (IHO) database (Anonymous, 1988). Wind forcing for PCTides comes from a number of sources. If the user has access, the Navy's Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) or the Coupled Ocean and Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPSTM) (Hodur, 1997) may be used. The PCTides system also includes a \"hurricane model\" developed by Holland (1980) . Based on this model, hurricane forcing can be generated that can provide surface pressure and winds to drive the 2-dimenional barotropic ocean model and generate storm surge. One major advantage of PCTides is that the model has the ability to be rapidly relocated to areas of interest. The tidal heights can be generated at a user-specifed latitude/longitude position and therefore is not dependent on a tidal \"look up\" table or pre-existing database of pre-selected locations.\nThis report documents the validation of PCTides in different geographic areas demonstrated by NRL and outside experts and agencies.\nEl\nPCTides Validation Test Report\nThe U.S. Naval Research Laboratory has developed a globally relocatable tide/surge forecast system. PCTides runs on Windows 2000 and XP machines in a DOS mode and both on UNIX and LINUX platforms. PCTides is also currently run on the High Performance Computers (HPC machines) and is the tidal prediction component in the PC-based Distributed Integrated Ocean Prediction System (Allard et al., 2005).\nThe U.S. Navy has a requirement to produce global tide prediction forecasts (CINC Ocean 91-14, \"Tidal Predictions to Support Navy Operations\"). The PCTides system was developed to fill a void in the Navy's global tide forecasting capability. Tidal forecasts available to the Navy are presently limited to locations where there are coastal tidal water level observation stations. As such, the Navy has been limited to forecasts at specific locations with limited capability to estimate tidal amplitude between stations. In addition, these forecasts could not include the effects of winds (surge), which could play a substantial role in water level prediction. PCTides is a globally relocatable tide forecasting system designed to predict tides at any location. In addition, it can include wind/pressure forcing in its predictions. PCTides was specifically designed for shortterm (weekly) forecasts of tidal amplitudes, however longer forecasts can be made if necessary.\nThe PCTides system has been accepted into the Ocean and Atmospheric Master Environmental Library (OAML). A PC version of the system was submitted to OAML in 2002. It was determined after this delivery, that along with the PC version of the system, a UNIX format should also be available. Therefore, over the next year, NRL revised the PCTides system into both a UNIX and a PC format that were identical except for a GUI associated with the PC version. In addition, a number of upgrades were included into the PCTides system making a substantial improvement from the first version. As such, the original version of PCTides (PCTides 1.0) was withdrawn from OAML delivery and PCTides 2.0 was delivered in its place in October 2003.\nPrior to the delivery of PCTides 1.0, the system was evaluated by NRL, the developer, and by the Naval European Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NEMOC -Rota, Spain) as a beta-test center. The NEMOC evaluators provided a letter of assessment of the model (Appendix A). In addition, a tidal expert from the United Kingdom, Dr. Roger Proctor of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL), visited NRL as part of the ONR London Visiting Scientist Program, and tested the PCTides system in and around the UK coastal waters. The PCTides system was installed and produced results comparable to the UK tidal models within a short time (week) demonstrating the rapidly relocatable character of the system. Dr. Proctor compared these results to observations as well as to existing POL tidal prediction models and provided a statement on the fidelity of PCTides (Appendix B).\nManuscript approved November 1, 2005. PCTides 1.0 was evaluated during an official OPTEST at the Navy's Regional METOC centers at Norfolk (Naval Atlantic Meteorology and Oceanography Center -NLMOC) and San Diego (Navy Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center -NPMOC). The results of this OPTEST are stated in an OPTEST report to CNMOC (Appendix C) and reiterated as part of an NRL proceedings paper at the MTS Oceans 2002 conference (Preller et al., 2002) \nThis validation test report will describe the PCTides system and differences between PCTides 1.0 and 2.0. The report discusses the validation testing performed by NRL and includes (as appendices) the validation documentation generated by the outside experts and agencies described above.\nA more detailed description of the PCTides system is available from the PCTides software documentation:\nSoftware Design Description (SDD) for the Globally Relocatable Navy Tide Model (PCTides 2.0), Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Globally Relocatable Navy Tide Model (PCTides 2.0), Software Test Description (STD) for the Globally Relocatable Navy Tide Model (PCTides 2.0) and User's Manual (UM) for the Globally Relocatable Navy Tide Model (PCTides 2.0).\nThe PCTides system has a 2-dimensional (2-D) barotropic ocean model as its core (Figure 1 ). PCTides uses this depth-integrated shallow water model to predict both the barotropic currents and sea level heights on or near continental shelves (Preller et al., 2002) . It contains a wetting and drying algorithm for the simulation of coastal flooding due to tides and/or storm surge. Surface winds, pressure and/or astronomical tidal forcing drive this model. A global tide model, the Finite Element Solutions 99 (FES99) is used to provide tidal conditions at the open boundaries of the ocean model.\nSItaiozi Data Figure 1 . The PCTides system components.\nAll databases, except for the wind and pressure forcing, are internal to the PCTides system. These include: a) NRL generated bathymetry (NRL DBDB2), a 2-minute global data base (see http://www7320.nrlssc.navy.mil/DBDB2 WWW/) derived from a combination of the Navy's DBDBV data, the Smith and Sandwell dataset, the DAMEE North Atlantic data, the IBCAO Arctic data, the Australian Bathymetric and Topographic Data (ABTG), and regional data sets from the Gulf of Mexico and Yellow Sea; b) the FES99 global tidal solutions (Lefevre et al., 2000) and c) tidal station data from the International Hydrographic Office (IHO) database (Anonymous, 1988). The IHO data is used for either model validation or data assimilation.\nIn most applications of the system, winds from the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) , the Coupled Oceanographic and Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS T M ) (Hodur, 1997) or a COAMPS On-Scene system are used. These fields are used daily at the operational centers and retrieved typically through the Navy's METCAST system. In addition, the model contains a hurricane model (Holland, 1980 ) that generates hurricane force winds using a prescribed track, minimum surface pressure and radius of maximum winds. A final application of winds in the PCTides system is the input of a single value for wind speed over the entire domain which can vary temporally but not spatially, and is referred to as \"manual winds\" in the system. PCTides is a depth-integrated, barotropic hydrodynamic model used for modeling sea surface height and mean current structure in coastal regions due to tides and atmospheric forcing. It is economic to run in terms of computational overhead and data initialization requirements.\nA. Basic Equations of PCTides:\nThe equations solved are the shallow water equations and are presented below:\nwhere U and V are the depth averaged currents in the x and y directions respectively, H is the total depth, \" is the surface elevation, f is the Coriolis parameter, g is the acceleration due to gravity, P is the atmospheric surface pressure, p,, is the water density, v is the coefficient of lateral eddy diffusion and has a value of 0.2, 'rbX and -'by, the bottom frictional stress in the x and y directions, respectively. Sx Syy, Sxy and Sy.\nrepresent the wave radiation stresses. 4 The equations have been formulated on a Cartesian grid due to the relative ease of coding. However, the formulation is generalized to incorporate different map projections through the appropriate specification of the map factor, m, a scaling factor dependent on the chosen map projection of the model grid. In accordance with this generality, the Coriolis parameter varies with latitude.\nThe surface wind stress components are computed using the quadratic relationship:\nwhere ua I n( (1.5)\nThe bottom stress is represented by a Manning's n depth-dependent friction relation following Signell and Butman (1992):\nwhere n has the value 0.03. This formulation ensures that the drag coefficient increases with decreasing water depth and is applied to water depths greater than 1 m. In extremely shallow water and over land points that become inundated, drag coefficients can be specified at each grid-point according to the terrain type.\nBoundary conditions can be applied in a range of ways depending on the type of process being modeled. Meteorological forcing is applied via the wind stress and surface pressure gradient terms in equations (1.1) to (1.3) at all submerged model grid-points in the computational domain.\nTidal and meteorological forcing at lateral boundaries is achieved by specifying the incremental displacement of the water surface due to changes in tidal height and atmospheric barometric displacement. The lateral boundary conditions are applied using a \"one-way nesting\" technique. The boundary conditions are applied to the appropriate model variable 0 (representing height or velocity) with decreasing intensity from the 5 boundary to some specified number of model grid-points (typically around 12) into the domain according to the following equation;\nwhere Op is the model predicted value and b is the prescribed boundary value and a is varied according to a cosine function such that a= 0.5(cos r(1-nb/nmax) +1), n=l, n,,fl\nAt coastal boundaries and along riverbanks, the wetting and drying of grid cells is accomplished via the inundation algorithm described in the next section. On outflow, a radiation boundary condition, as described in Miller and Thorpe (1981) is applied to the velocity field to prevent the build up of wave energy within the numerical domain, while on inflow boundaries, a zero-gradient condition is applied.\nUnder any prescribed boundary forcing, PCTides is initialized by setting velocities to zero and interpolates the global Finite Element Solutions versions 99 (FES 99) (Lefevre et al., 2000) elevation field to the model grid. It is customary to allocate an initial spin-up period to allow the effects of the boundary forcing and tidal conditions to propagate throughout the computational domain. Sensitivity studies conclude that an appropriate spin-up time for PCTides using wind forcing is 24 hours and without wind forcing is 12 hours.\nThe adjustment of coastlines to account for flooding and draining takes place after equations (1.1)-(1.3) have been solved as described above. The coastal boundary is configured to pass through the velocity grid-points on the staggered grid in a stepwise manner such that it passes through the U points in the y-direction and through V points in the x-direction. The velocities on the boundaries are assumed to be zero.\nThe first step is to calculate the distance in the x-and y-directions that fluid could travel in a time step at each \u00fd grid-point that is adjacent to the coast. The depth-averaged current velocity used in this calculation is taken at the first grid-point on the seaward side of the \u00fd grid-point. The travel distance is:\nwhere AX\",j and AY\"-' are the distances in the x and y directions that the water traveled in the previous time step. By factoring in the travel time of the fluid, inland grid cells are prevented from automatically becoming inundated at the first instant the water level at the coast exceeds the height of the adjacent dry points. In equations (1.9) and (1.10), the first option applies to flooding in the positive x or y direction (or draining in the negative x and y direction) while the second option applies to flooding in the negative x and y direction (or draining in the positive x and y direction).\nThe testing for coastline movement proceeds in the x-and y-directions separately. If the height of the water at the first z-point seaward of the coastline exceeds the topographic height at the first z-point landward of it, and the accumulated distance traveled in the given direction exceeds the grid separation, then a new sea-point is added to the computational domain. The velocity at the newly acquired velocity point is extrapolated from adjacent points and the continuity equation is solved to obtain the water depth at the new height point. Finally, AX\"~J and AY,.J are set to zero.\nThe procedure for draining is similar. If the height of the fluid at the height point adjacent the boundary drops below some arbitrary positive height, E and the accumulated distance traveled by the fluid, exceeds the grid length, then draining is assumed to have occurred. The height grid-point is reclassified as dry (i.e. \u00fd=0) and the boundary relocated to the adjacent wet velocity grid-point. Examples of the performance of the inundation algorithm can be found in Hubbert and Mclnnes (1999a, b).\nIn order to improve the simulation of tidal forced dynamics a facility is included to \"nudge\" the model solution with tidal height predictions at tidal stations within the model domain. Global tidal station constituent data is stored in ASCII format in the file TCANALS.DAT. New stations can easily be added to this file in the appropriate format.\nDuring a model run the TCANALS.DAT file is scanned by subroutine TIDEOBS during its first call and the tidal constituent parameters for stations within the model domain are stored. At each model time step the tidal height is predicted at each station and used to \"nudge\" the model solution.\nThe nudging method is based on deriving a new solution at grid points near each tidal station from a weighted combination of the model solution and the station sea level prediction. The weighting function is calculated from the product of the parameter WGTFAC (default value = 0.50) and the half cosine function (range = 0 to 1) used for nesting (equation 1.8). The weighting of the station sea level prediction goes to zero at a defined distance from each station, determined by the parameter ZRADIUS (default value = 40 kin). The values of WGTFAC and ZRADIUS can be changed in the parameter file ASSIM.DAT that resides in the WORK directory. Changes to these parameters are not advised however unless there is a specific reason.\nPCTides was developed to be used by METOC personnel who have some knowledge of oceanography. To apply PCTides, the user should know the latitude and longitude boundaries of their region of interest and the specific locations for which a forecast is required. The user first sets up a model \"domain\" by inputting the north/south limits of latitude and the east/west limits of longitude and the grid resolution (the PC version also contains a GUI based grid generator). This automatically generates the model grid and interpolates NRL DBDB2 bathymetry to that grid. Next, a user runs the program to interpolate the tidal boundary/initial conditions to the grid. All of this can be quickly plotted (bathymetry, tidal constituents, etc.) using the PC GUI. This allows the user to take a first look at the area of interest. The user inputs a series of parameters defining the forecast attributes such as start time and length of the forecast, data assimilation option (on or off), wind forcing and the required frequency of the model tidal output. In addition, the user identifies the specific stations at which a forecast field is needed by inputting the latitude and longitude of that station. The user then executes the model.\nThe PC version of this code includes a graphic capability to generate \".gif' plots of the forecast tidal time series. Along with tidal height forecasts, PCTides provides forecasts of 2-D barotropic tidal currents. A graphic capability to generate \".gif' plots of the forecast tidal speed and direction is also included with the PC version. The user should take caution in utilizing the current information since it is not the full, 3-D baroclinic ocean currents. The Unix version of the code has no output graphic package. Figure 2) , b) UNIX and PC grid generation software (input latitude/longitude limits of the grid domain and resolution), c) adding the latest version of NRL DBDB2 bathymetry, d) modifying the bathymetry interpolation algorithm (UNIX and PC versions now are identical), e) increasing the maximum array size, f) adding software to automatically move specified output stations that are on land (due to numerical model grid resolution), to the closest ocean grid point, g) modifying the frequency of field output, h) increasing bottom friction for high resolution nests, i) adding code to incorporate new high resolution bathymetric data, j) adding error messages to parts of the code to make it more user friendly and k) modifying the documentation to reflect these changes. As such, these changes were substantial enough to warrant withdrawing PCTides 1.0 from OAML and delivering the new PCTides 2.0 in its place.\nOne of the revisions of the PCTides upgrade included the improvement to the global boundary conditions from the Finite Element Solution (FES) model. The major difference between the FES95 and FES99 is the resolution of the data. Also the accuracy of the FES99 solutions was improved by assimilating tide gauge and Topex/Poseidon altimeter information. The data used in PCTides 1.0 was FES 95, with a resolution of 0.5 degree. It contained both amplitude and phases of nine major tidal components. PCTides 2.0 was upgraded to use the FES99 data. This dataset has 0.25 degree resolution and assimilates 687 TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry crossover data along with -700 tide gauge data in the database. It contains both amplitude and phases for the nine major tidal components and is a significant improvement both in the deep ocean and along the coasts.\nGlobally, the maximum M2 (the major constituent of the nine used in the model) phase differences (figure 2a) are very small but with most differences occurring in the Bering Strait, Hudson Bay and Gulf of Lawrence (figure 2b), in the western Antarctic (figure 2c), and around Australia and the Indonesia coast (figure 2d). The other limited areas where differences occur include the southeast Mediterranean, the Iceland area, and the Kara and Laptev Sea. Neither FES95 nor FES99 have values in the Black or Caspian Seas. The amplitude differences are very small in most areas. \nA majority of the PCTides evaluations were performed using PCTides 1.0. However, those specific evaluations were only minimally (if at all) affected by the modifications included in PCTides version 2.0 and as such are believed to still be valid. If anything, errors should be reduced.\nThe PCTides OPTEST evaluation was performed by the regional centers at Norfolk (NLMOC) and San Diego (NPMOC). NLMOC chose the Chesapeake Bay as their evaluation location while NPMOC chose three regions for evaluation: 1) Scripps located off the southern California coast, 2) an area near Puget Sound and 3) near the Gulf of Alaska. The pass/fail criteria determined prior to the OPTEST by the centers, were an RMS error of less than 1.2 ft (0.365 m) in amplitude and a phase error less than 45 minutes. PCTides successfully passed this OPTEST in each area studied as documented in the OPTEST report (Appendix C) and the Preller et al., 2002 (Appendix D).\nIn addition to the OPTEST, PCTides was run for the region encompassing the southwestern coast of Spain. These runs were initially performed by NRL as part of a Rapid Response (RR98) Exercise off the Spainist coast in 1998 using PCTides 1.0 system. Figure 3 shows the model domain used and the specified output stations.\nFigure 3. Model domain with bathymetry contours and station locations for the southwestern coast of Spain.\nThe model simulations were run without IHO data assimilation and compared to the closest IHO data point for evaluation. Figures 4-6 show the comparisons of a 5-day (120 hour) elevation forecast from PCTides to the closest IHO point at stations 1, 3, and 6 (6 being closest to the Navy's regional center at Rota, NEMOC Although the main focus of these evaluations has been on tidal elevation, PCTides also predicts 2-D barotropic tidal currents. A major obstacle in evaluating the PCTide tidal currents is the lack of observations to compare against the model results. However, an excellent opportunity to validate the models forecast velocities was presented to us when the Naval Oceanographic Office provided us the data from four bottom mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) in the Yellow Sea deployed during the month of September 1995 (Figure 7 ). This thirty-day time series of velocity data was compared to a PCTides model forecast, which assimilated IHO data, but had no wind or pressure forcing. The PCTides forecasts of the tidal currents agree remarkably well with the depth-averaged ADCP observations. The last five days are shown (Figure 8) . Comparisons of the tidal heights for the entire time show the accuracy of PCTides forecast capability (Figure 9 ) as compared to the water level elevations derived from pressure gauges on the ADCP. \nA statistical evaluation of the PCTide tidal elevation and phase along with tidal magnitude were compared to the ADCP observations. The ADCP observations were not assimilated into the PCTides forecast but used only for validation. The statistics shown are the mean error (ME), absolute mean error (AME), root mean square difference (RMSD), standard deviation (SD), the correlation coefficient (R) and the skill score (SS).\nThe statistics are computed from the following equations:\nWhere ME is the bias or annual mean difference, X is mean of the data values, Y is the mean of the model values, SD is the standard deviation and Ox and 5y are the standard deviation of the data and model values respectively. For the mean difference (ME), the smaller the number, the smaller the difference between the model and the data. However, if the mean is near zero, as one would expect for a tidal time series, then the mean error is not a good statistical tool to use. The lower the absolute mean difference (AME), the smaller the variability between the observation and the model. This value expresses the mean difference between the model and the observations. The Root Mean Square (RMS) difference reflects the variability between the observation and the data. This is the classic expression of how close the model solution is to the observations. The larger the variability between the observations, the larger the RMS error. Like the RMS, the standard deviation (SD) gives you the variability of the data from the mean. As SD and RMS increase, the larger the variability of the data from the mean. A skill score (SS) of 1.0 indicates a perfect model prediction. A negative skill score indicates that the model may have normalized amplitudes larger than the correlation or large biases in the mean (Murphy and Epstein, 1989 ).\n19 Table 1 shows the tidal elevation statistics for the mean of both the model (with and without data assimilation) and the observations, the standard deviation of the model and the observations, the mean error (ME) difference, root mean square difference (RMSD) correlation coefficient (R) and the skill score (SS This comparison indicates the PCTides tidal elevation results using data assimilation compared better to the actual observations than the PCTides results without data assimilation (values in parenthesis). The RMS difference reflects the variability between the observations and the PCTides model. In this test study area using the RMS differences as our guide, the PCTides (with assimilation) varied slightly less from the observations by 30-50 cm, than the PCTides (without assimilation), which varied 31-53 cm. Comparing the correlation coefficients, the PCTides with assimilation ranged between 0.70 and 0.89, compared best to observations than the PCTides without assimilation that ranged between 0.72 and 0.81. A correlation coefficient of 1.0 indicates a perfect comparison.\n20 Table 2 shows the absolute mean error (AME), root mean squared (RMS) and the correlation associated with the phase of peak tidal elevation (in minutes). Table 3 shows the tidal speed magnitude statistics for the mean for both the model and the observations the standard deviation of the model and the observations, the mean error (ME) difference, root mean square difference (RMSD), correlation coefficient (R) and the skill score (SS The second set of measurements used in the evaluation of PCTides ocean currents was located in the Korea (Tsushima) Strait. Figure 10 shows the location of the two lines of bottom mounted ADCP's as part of the NRL Linkages of Asian Marginal Seas (LINKS) program. A PCTides domain was set up for this region and run for the period May 1-June 11, 1999. PCTides forecast tidal currents were compared to tidal current measurements from the ADCPs. Figure 11 shows examples from six stations at opposite ends of each line. PCTides consistently under predicted the magnitude of the currents located at stations Li-L5 anywhere from 1-23% (0.2 to 3.3 cm/sec) and over predicted the magnitude of the currents located at stations L6-L1 1 anywhere from 5-27% (0.6 to 3.5 cm). Current direction compared reasonably well at all stations.\n124'E 125*E 126*E 127\u00b0E 128*E 129*E 130*E 131*E 132*E June i99 June 1999 Figure 11 .

PCTides was not constrained to any observations during these studies. The PCTides predicted storm surge from these cases was compared to the NOAA observed water levels at stations along the path of Isabel. Figure 12 shows the PCTides forecast track of Isabel using winds and pressures from a) COAMPS, b) NOGAPS c) the observed hurricane track from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and d) the PCTides forecast (using winds generated from the Holland model) starting from the NHC projected path approximately 24 hours prior to landfall. \nSep 15Z\n.. 78 \nSep 72Z\nSep 03Z \n37' \"-\u2022\u2022i i'\n360\nA statistical evaluation of the PCTides results driven by each type of atmospheric forcing is given in Table 6 . Absolute Mean Error (AME) and Root Mean Squared (RMS) Error associated with the prediction of the amplitude and phase of peak storm surge for each PCTides simulation. Values in parentheses were calculated using the three stations (Beaufort, NC; Chesapeake, VA and Baltimore, MD) which remained uninterrupted throughout the storm.\nThese results indicated that given the correct path and hurricane definition (100 km RMW), PCTides did a very good job of predicting storm surge with an RMS height error of 38 cm and an RMS phase error of 50 minutes. Note that PCTides driven by COAMPS also did a reasonable job of predicting the phase and amplitude of the surge. Also interesting is the fact that the predicted path provided by the hurricane center approximately 24-hours before landfall was approximately 100 km east of the actual track. This study showed that PCTides could do an accurate job of predicting storm surge and that a useful application of PCTides prior to landfall should include an ensemble of forecasts indicating the range of surge possible for coastal regions.\nPCTides was used in the Maritime Rapid Environmental Assessment Trial (MREA04), which took place off the coast of Portugal from March through April 2004 (Figure 14) . During this time, PCTides was run using real-time COAMPS wind and surface pressure fields to produce a 48-hour tidal elevation forecast. This forecast was used as input for two wave models also run during the exercise: 1) the NRL Swan wave model (included in the DIOPS system) and 2) the Delft3D model.

This sonar is used to detect, classify and identify moored and bottom mines using side-scan, forward-looking, and volume search sonar from deep to very shallow water. The accuracy of the environmental data collected can be affected by tides in the geographic area of interest. Local tide variations can be provided by the PCTides system for adjusting this bathymetric data. This work was presented at the SPIE Security and Defense Symposium by Costin Barbu and Will Avera (Barbu et al., 2005). This corrected bathymetry could provide a useful tool for Mine Warefare Operations.\nThe PCTides system, developed by the Naval Research Laboratory, has been evaluated in a number of different locations by a number of different users. Consensus from these users is that PCTides is a useful and acceptably accurate tool for the prediction of tidal heights and wind driven surge. PCTides 2.0, recently submitted to OAML is an improvement over the previous version in a number of ways including improved databases, user-friendly software and a UNIX-based code. a) PCTIDES has the potential to be an excellent tidal modeling system.\nThe flexibility of creating user-defined tidal stations and defining detailed model parameters greatly enhances our ability to support operational customers.\nb) Although atmospheric forcing is integrated into PCTIDES, NEMOC does not typically use this capability as most requests for tidal data are beyond the prognostic time scale for numerical models.\nc) An assessment of model accuracy was conducted for the Rota, Spain local area. The evaluation consisted of designing a 10-km PCTIDES grid and comparing model output with historical data (\"hindcast\") and current observations (\"forecast\").\nOur findings were that the model performs hindcasts and forecasts extremely well for the local area. The NW European shelf is an ideal region to assess the performance of a re-locatable tidesurge modelling system for several reasons: it is a data-rich area with more than 30 tide gauges located around the UK coast; the coast itself is varied, with several estuaries interconnected by open coastal sections; the dynamics of the tides and storm surges differ between the west coast of Britain and the east coast; at POL we have over 30 years experience of modelling and forecasting tides and surges around the UK coast.\nOur evaluation took the form of a) designing a PCTIDES grid compatible with our own model grid (approximately 12km resolution) and comparing i) tides and ii) surges during April & May 2001 both with and without PCTIDES assimilation of tidal constants and b) designing and implementing higher resolution PCTIDES grids in specific areas of interest for either tidal characteristics (Bristol Channel has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world) or surge characteristics (Liverpool Bay -direct surge forcing, southern North Sea -external surge forcing).\nThe overall findings were as follows:\n\"* Tides in PCTIDES on the 12km grid without data assimilation were less accurate than the tuned tides of the POL model \"\u2022 Tides in PCTIDES on the 12km grid with data assimilation were of similar accuracy to the tuned tides of the POL model \"\u2022 Surges in PCTIDES on the 12km grid with data assimilation were of similar accuracy to those of the POL model only along open coasts; in the estuaries they were significantly worse \"* Surges in PCTIDES on the higher resolution grids with data assimilation were of similar accuracy to those of the POL model\nThe evaluation has shown that PCTIDES can produce tides and storm surges of comparable quality to those provided by a specifically tuned system. The initial 'first guess' PCTIDES could produce equivalent results only on open coasts, requiring data assimilation of tidal constants to improve on the tidal response in estuarine waters. A noticeable fact was the role the data assimilation played: the data-rich UK coast sometimes over-specified the assimilation, requiring careful consideration when having tide gauge locations in a coarse (12km) adjacent model grid cells. It also showed the value of the data assimilation as without it the results were not as good as in the POL model. Higher resolution models could produce better tide and surge results.\nI was impressed with the capability of PCTIDES. Initial results were obtained within hours of setting up the system and comparable results (to a system established over 20 years and continuously monitored) obtained within days. The ease with which higher resolution models could be set up made exploring optimum grid resolutions a simple task, and demonstrated how these could improve results. The role of available tidal data should not be underestimated however, the data-rich NW shelf enabled PCTIDES to perform well in this area.\nIf you require further details I would be pleased to discuss the results of my evaluation with you at greater length.\nRoger Proctor\nAppendix C PCTides OPTEST report\nThis report summarizes the PCTides operational evaluation plan, implementation of that plan and the results. To maximize relevance to current operations, the evaluation was designed and implemented at NLMOC and NPMOC (San Diego) over 3 months for 12 different stations. In summary, the report recommends that the basic model should be included in OAML and is suitable for fleet use after certain modifications and with caveats for operational use. We recommend the modified version of PCTides be included into the NITES software suite and on in the MET team laptops. The modifications recommended include changes in user interface, product output and display. The caveats recommended are caution in interpretation of model outputs when run near river outflows and for large semi-enclosed bays and estuaries where wind direction seriously affects tidal response. Guidance for these interpretations should be included in the operations manual.\nThe OPTEST was conducted both at NLMOC (Norfolk) and NPMOC (San Diego) between 1 March to 31 June, 2001. The model was run by the Center's operational watch once a day for 90 days making forecasts 12, 24 and 48 hours ahead using in parallel COAMPS and NOGAPS windfield forcing at 12-hour intervals throughout the forecast period.\nThe numerous widely separated stations tested the model's ability to forecast tidal heights at any required location, a major improvement over GFMPL. The test area's tidal station locations were inserted into PCTides as forecast points. The NOAA tidal station data were QC'd at NOAA and joined with the forecast water levels for statistical analysis. The primary parameters used are \"* AMD (meters): Absolute mean difference between forecast and observed water levels \"\u2022 Phase (minutes): Mean phase difference between forecast and observed times of high and low water.\nAbsolute values were not used so that the +/-\"lag\" effect could be observed. + indicates model lag. \"* RMSE (meters): Root mean square error of forecast water levels from observed. \"* RMSPH (minutes): Root mean square error of the forecast phase from the observed phase.\nSince PCTides current predictions are for barotropic conditions only, current predictions were not validated. It is recommended this output be eliminated because the operator could be misled if such values were relied upon in the common baroclinic situation.\nThe pass/fail criteria were selected so as to be a significant improvement over the information presently available to the Naval operator.\n1_) The root mean square percent error of PCTides predicted water relative to mean sea level (MSL) vs. NOAA observed water levels relative to MSL must be less than 1.2 foot (0.365 meters).\n2.) The root mean square percent error of PCTides predicted water levels max/min times vs. NOAA observed water level max/min times must be less than 45 minutes.\nOverall The forecasts exceeding the threshold can be explained as follows:\nBaltimore and Solomon Island: as harbors sitting at the end of a long SE fetch, an unusual sensitivity to forecast wind direction is evident in the data. Since this geographical situation is not uncommon, a caveat is indicated warning the user to interpret the PCTides forecast in light of this local sensitivity to wind direction.\nWindmill Point: tidal measurement station is located inside a river mouth. Since PCTides does not include river outflow, the forecasts would have the added error during rain events Although the following stations passed the criteria, the optest revealed other errors and sensitivities. At Kodiak, Alaska, the station location was incorrectly inserted into PCTides, causing the forecast to be made for a location in 85 m. (285 ft.) of water. At the Southern California station,_phase error was shown as a partial function of the grid scale chosen. For this station, NRL suggested a grid resolution below 10 km. However, the operator chose 17 km. and produced a phase error of 24 minutes. Later runs at 5 km. grid showed a 5 minute phase error. This phase error source was also a factor at Kodiak, Alaska. Therefore, a caveat should be included warning the user to use a grid resolution <10 km.\nThe OPTEST also revealed problems with the user interface, product dissemination and identification of area of interest. Though feedback from various users at both NPMOC and NLMOC, potential improvements were noted and are listed in the recommendation section below. Since PCTides code was written to run both on DOS and UNIX, we suggest that flexibility be retained and the existing user interface modified accordingly.\nThis panel finds the relocatability of PCTides is a significant improvement over GFMPL. PCTides eliminates the need for the operator to estimate what the water height at anchorage will be some lateral distance from the GFMPL data station location, a considerable source of error. While we have concerns regarding sensitivity of wind direction, this can 38 be addressed by a caveat. The user interface should be improved for inclusion in the NITES software suite before PCTides becomes operational.\nWe therefore recommend that PCTides is suitable for fleet use and inclusion in the NITES software suite only after the following improvements have been made.\nInstallation: The program must be configured such that installation from a CD or diskette by an untrained user is simple and effective.\nUser interface:\na.) The DOS windows functions should be incorporated into the existing code for windows and formatted for inclusion in the NITES software suite. b.) The batch files of the wind forcing be a default chosen initially by the user so as to retain the options of choosing a selected model or point source winds and to minimize the keystrokes required to run the model c.) Graphics should be modernized. The displayed coastlines should represent the chosen grid resolutions. During setup, the program should allow insertion of wind file location in the local LAN. This should be a default so the user need not re-enter it each run. d.) The source of the wind forcing used should be on the screen and saved in the product files. e.) Defining a grid should be made similar to Metcast Client. The user should be able to rubber band an forecast area and identify the tidal stations by enter lat/lon. The program should invisibly call the appropriate tidal data, bathymetry and wind field. f.) Grid resolutions should be in kilometers. g.) A pop-up window warning should be included that tells the user the depths of all chosen stations and when any selected point is on land or has a depth beyond a practical threshold level. Products:\na.) Output of prediction curves should be user choice formats (tif, gif, etc) compatible with JMV. b.) An option for automatically emailing the output to a user-defined list of addresses should be included.. c.) Display of barotropic currents should be eliminated to avoid operational use in baroclinic waters. d.) Auto-insertion into designated web pages should be built in for use at Navy Centers. The web addresses and other info can be inserted first time by the user Caveats: a.) The user should be warned against using the model in or near river mouths. Guidance should be given on the best interpretation of model output. b.) If the forecast position is inside semi-enclosed waters, the user should be warned about forecast sensitivity to winds in directions parallel to the bay's major axis. Some guidance for this interpretation should be written and included to help the user estimate the phase and amplitude depending on wind vector forecasts. c.) A general guide of accuracy in water height and timing based on OPEVAL data should be included.\nIf the above modifications are made satisfactorily, this committee will approve PCTides for operational use. . available) and/or astronomical forcing. The global ocean bathymetry is a 2-minute global database developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. Atmospheric forcing from the Navy's global or regional models is provided through the T System METCAST system and used to generate real time, wind he PCTides driven forecasts. PCTides output includes time series of tidal height deviations at each grid point of the model and time series of tidal height deviations at higher frequency (usually 10-12 minutes) at specified point locations. Barotropic tidal currents are also produced by the system. "}, {"section_title": "PCTides Validation Test Report", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory has developed a globally relocatable tide/surge forecast system. PCTides runs on Windows 2000 and XP machines in a DOS mode and both on UNIX and LINUX platforms. PCTides is also currently run on the High Performance Computers (HPC machines) and is the tidal prediction component in the PC-based Distributed Integrated Ocean Prediction System (Allard et al., 2005) .\nThe U.S. Navy has a requirement to produce global tide prediction forecasts (CINC Ocean 91-14, \"Tidal Predictions to Support Navy Operations\"). The PCTides system was developed to fill a void in the Navy's global tide forecasting capability. Tidal forecasts available to the Navy are presently limited to locations where there are coastal tidal water level observation stations. As such, the Navy has been limited to forecasts at specific locations with limited capability to estimate tidal amplitude between stations. In addition, these forecasts could not include the effects of winds (surge), which could play a substantial role in water level prediction. PCTides is a globally relocatable tide forecasting system designed to predict tides at any location. In addition, it can include wind/pressure forcing in its predictions. PCTides was specifically designed for shortterm (weekly) forecasts of tidal amplitudes, however longer forecasts can be made if necessary.\nThe PCTides system has been accepted into the Ocean and Atmospheric Master Environmental Library (OAML). A PC version of the system was submitted to OAML in 2002. It was determined after this delivery, that along with the PC version of the system, a UNIX format should also be available. Therefore, over the next year, NRL revised the PCTides system into both a UNIX and a PC format that were identical except for a GUI associated with the PC version. In addition, a number of upgrades were included into the PCTides system making a substantial improvement from the first version. As such, the original version of PCTides (PCTides 1.0) was withdrawn from OAML delivery and PCTides 2.0 was delivered in its place in October 2003.\nPrior to the delivery of PCTides 1.0, the system was evaluated by NRL, the developer, and by the Naval European Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NEMOC -Rota, Spain) as a beta-test center. The NEMOC evaluators provided a letter of assessment of the model (Appendix A). In addition, a tidal expert from the United Kingdom, Dr. Roger Proctor of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL), visited NRL as part of the ONR London Visiting Scientist Program, and tested the PCTides system in and around the UK coastal waters. The PCTides system was installed and produced results comparable to the UK tidal models within a short time (week) demonstrating the rapidly relocatable character of the system. Dr. Proctor compared these results to observations as well as to existing POL tidal prediction models and provided a statement on the fidelity of PCTides (Appendix B). PCTides 1.0 was evaluated during an official OPTEST at the Navy's Regional METOC centers at Norfolk (Naval Atlantic Meteorology and Oceanography Center -NLMOC) and San Diego (Navy Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center -NPMOC). The results of this OPTEST are stated in an OPTEST report to CNMOC (Appendix C) and reiterated as part of an NRL proceedings paper at the MTS Oceans 2002 conference (Preller et al., 2002) "}, {"section_title": "(Appendix D).", "text": "This validation test report will describe the PCTides system and differences between PCTides 1.0 and 2.0.

It contains a wetting and drying algorithm for the simulation of coastal flooding due to tides and/or storm surge. Surface winds, pressure and/or astronomical tidal forcing drive this model. A global tide model, the Finite Element Solutions 99 (FES99) is used to provide tidal conditions at the open boundaries of the ocean model."}, {"section_title": "IHO CoasW1 Tide", "text": "SItaiozi Data Figure 1 . The PCTides system components.\nAll databases, except for the wind and pressure forcing, are internal to the PCTides system. These include: a) NRL generated bathymetry (NRL DBDB2), a 2-minute global data base (see http://www7320.nrlssc.navy.mil/DBDB2 WWW/) derived from a combination of the Navy's DBDBV data, the Smith and Sandwell dataset, the DAMEE North Atlantic data, the IBCAO Arctic data, the Australian Bathymetric and Topographic Data (ABTG), and regional data sets from the Gulf of Mexico and Yellow Sea; b) the FES99 global tidal solutions (Lefevre et al., 2000) and c) tidal station data from the International Hydrographic Office (IHO) database (Anonymous, 1988) . The IHO data is used for either model validation or data assimilation.\nIn most applications of the system, winds from the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) , the Coupled Oceanographic and Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS T M ) (Hodur, 1997) or a COAMPS On-Scene system are used. These fields are used daily at the operational centers and retrieved typically through the Navy's METCAST system. In addition, the model contains a hurricane model (Holland, 1980 ) that generates hurricane force winds using a prescribed track, minimum surface pressure and radius of maximum winds. A final application of winds in the PCTides system is the input of a single value for wind speed over the entire domain which can vary temporally but not spatially, and is referred to as \"manual winds\" in the system.\nTwo dimensional fields of tidal heights and barotropic ocean currents are the products of the PCTides system. The user has the option of pre-selecting station locations where high frequency (typically 10-12 minute) tidal time series forecasts may be produced. Stations are identified by latitude and longitude locations prior to the forecast. These time series are written to a file containing station information, date, time, tidal elevation, current speed and direction. The forecast may be viewed as a printed text file or plotted as a time series curve. In addition to the station forecasts, elevation and current data are saved at each model grid point at a pre-selected time interval with a minimum output frequency of 10 minutes.\nPCTides can generate hindcasts back to the year 1900 (reference time chosen for the calculation of astronomical tides) and to any time in the future. Predictions that include wind/pressure forcing are limited to dates when the forcing is available. Tidal forecasts made without winds, can be useful in planning for future operational exercises.\nPCTides is a depth-integrated, barotropic hydrodynamic model used for modeling sea surface height and mean current structure in coastal regions due to tides and atmospheric forcing. It is economic to run in terms of computational overhead and data initialization requirements.\nA. Basic Equations of PCTides:\nThe equations solved are the shallow water equations and are presented below:\nwhere U and V are the depth averaged currents in the x and y directions respectively, H is the total depth, \" is the surface elevation, f is the Coriolis parameter, g is the acceleration due to gravity, P is the atmospheric surface pressure, p,, is the water density, v is the coefficient of lateral eddy diffusion and has a value of 0.2, 'rbX and -'by, the bottom frictional stress in the x and y directions, respectively. Sx Syy, Sxy and Sy.\nrepresent the wave radiation stresses.\nThe equations have been formulated on a Cartesian grid due to the relative ease of coding. However, the formulation is generalized to incorporate different map projections through the appropriate specification of the map factor, m, a scaling factor dependent on the chosen map projection of the model grid. In accordance with this generality, the Coriolis parameter varies with latitude.\nThe surface wind stress components are computed using the quadratic relationship:\nsx =CD Pa IU aI 14a sy = CDPaIUaIva (1.4) where ua I n( (1.5)\nThe bottom stress is represented by a Manning's n depth-dependent friction relation following Signell and Butman (1992) :\nwhere n has the value 0.03. This formulation ensures that the drag coefficient increases with decreasing water depth and is applied to water depths greater than 1 m. In extremely shallow water and over land points that become inundated, drag coefficients can be specified at each grid-point according to the terrain type."}, {"section_title": "B. Boundary and Initial Conditions", "text": "Boundary conditions can be applied in a range of ways depending on the type of process being modeled. Meteorological forcing is applied via the wind stress and surface pressure gradient terms in equations (1.1) to (1.3) at all submerged model grid-points in the computational domain.\nTidal and meteorological forcing at lateral boundaries is achieved by specifying the incremental displacement of the water surface due to changes in tidal height and atmospheric barometric displacement. The lateral boundary conditions are applied using a \"one-way nesting\" technique. The boundary conditions are applied to the appropriate model variable 0 (representing height or velocity) with decreasing intensity from the boundary to some specified number of model grid-points (typically around 12) into the domain according to the following equation;\nwhere Op is the model predicted value and b is the prescribed boundary value and a is varied according to a cosine function such that a= 0.5(cos r(1-nb/nmax) +1), n=l, n,,fl (1.8) At coastal boundaries and along riverbanks, the wetting and drying of grid cells is accomplished via the inundation algorithm described in the next section. On outflow, a radiation boundary condition, as described in Miller and Thorpe (1981) is applied to the velocity field to prevent the build up of wave energy within the numerical domain, while on inflow boundaries, a zero-gradient condition is applied.\nUnder any prescribed boundary forcing, PCTides is initialized by setting velocities to zero and interpolates the global Finite Element Solutions versions 99 (FES 99) (Lefevre et al., 2000) elevation field to the model grid. It is customary to allocate an initial spin-up period to allow the effects of the boundary forcing and tidal conditions to propagate throughout the computational domain. Sensitivity studies conclude that an appropriate spin-up time for PCTides using wind forcing is 24 hours and without wind forcing is 12 hours."}, {"section_title": "C. Inundation Algorithm", "text": "The adjustment of coastlines to account for flooding and draining takes place after equations (1.1)-(1.3) have been solved as described above. The coastal boundary is configured to pass through the velocity grid-points on the staggered grid in a stepwise manner such that it passes through the U points in the y-direction and through V points in the x-direction. The velocities on the boundaries are assumed to be zero.\nThe first step is to calculate the distance in the x-and y-directions that fluid could travel in a time step at each \u00fd grid-point that is adjacent to the coast. The depth-averaged current velocity used in this calculation is taken at the first grid-point on the seaward side of the \u00fd grid-point. The travel distance is:\nwhere AX\",j and AY\"-' are the distances in the x and y directions that the water traveled in the previous time step. By factoring in the travel time of the fluid, inland grid cells are prevented from automatically becoming inundated at the first instant the water level at the coast exceeds the height of the adjacent dry points. In equations (1.9) and (1.10), the first option applies to flooding in the positive x or y direction (or draining in the negative x and y direction) while the second option applies to flooding in the negative x and y direction (or draining in the positive x and y direction).\nThe testing for coastline movement proceeds in the x-and y-directions separately. If the height of the water at the first z-point seaward of the coastline exceeds the topographic height at the first z-point landward of it, and the accumulated distance traveled in the given direction exceeds the grid separation, then a new sea-point is added to the computational domain. The velocity at the newly acquired velocity point is extrapolated from adjacent points and the continuity equation is solved to obtain the water depth at the new height point. Finally, AX\"~J and AY,.J are set to zero.\nThe procedure for draining is similar. If the height of the fluid at the height point adjacent the boundary drops below some arbitrary positive height, E and the accumulated distance traveled by the fluid, exceeds the grid length, then draining is assumed to have occurred. The height grid-point is reclassified as dry (i.e. \u00fd=0) and the boundary relocated to the adjacent wet velocity grid-point. Examples of the performance of the inundation algorithm can be found in Hubbert and Mclnnes (1999a, b) ."}, {"section_title": "D. Tidal Data Assimilation", "text": "In order to improve the simulation of tidal forced dynamics a facility is included to \"nudge\" the model solution with tidal height predictions at tidal stations within the model domain. Global tidal station constituent data is stored in ASCII format in the file TCANALS.DAT. New stations can easily be added to this file in the appropriate format.\nDuring a model run the TCANALS.DAT file is scanned by subroutine TIDEOBS during its first call and the tidal constituent parameters for stations within the model domain are stored. At each model time step the tidal height is predicted at each station and used to \"nudge\" the model solution.\nThe nudging method is based on deriving a new solution at grid points near each tidal station from a weighted combination of the model solution and the station sea level prediction. The weighting function is calculated from the product of the parameter WGTFAC (default value = 0.50) and the half cosine function (range = 0 to 1) used for nesting (equation 1.8) . The weighting of the station sea level prediction goes to zero at a defined distance from each station, determined by the parameter ZRADIUS (default value = 40 kin). The values of WGTFAC and ZRADIUS can be changed in the parameter file ASSIM.DAT that resides in the WORK directory. Changes to these parameters are not advised however unless there is a specific reason."}, {"section_title": "PCTides Operation", "text": "PCTides was developed to be used by METOC personnel who have some knowledge of oceanography. To apply PCTides, the user should know the latitude and longitude boundaries of their region of interest and the specific locations for which a forecast is required. The user first sets up a model \"domain\" by inputting the north/south limits of latitude and the east/west limits of longitude and the grid resolution (the PC version also contains a GUI based grid generator). This automatically generates the model grid and interpolates NRL DBDB2 bathymetry to that grid. Next, a user runs the program to interpolate the tidal boundary/initial conditions to the grid. All of this can be quickly plotted (bathymetry, tidal constituents, etc.) using the PC GUI. This allows the user to take a first look at the area of interest. The user inputs a series of parameters defining the forecast attributes such as start time and length of the forecast, data assimilation option (on or off), wind forcing and the required frequency of the model tidal output. In addition, the user identifies the specific stations at which a forecast field is needed by inputting the latitude and longitude of that station. The user then executes the model. Figure 2 ), b) UNIX and PC grid generation software (input latitude/longitude limits of the grid domain and resolution), c) adding the latest version of NRL DBDB2 bathymetry, d) modifying the bathymetry interpolation algorithm (UNIX and PC versions now are identical), e) increasing the maximum array size, f) adding software to automatically move specified output stations that are on land (due to numerical model grid resolution), to the closest ocean grid point, g) modifying the frequency of field output, h) increasing bottom friction for high resolution nests, i) adding code to incorporate new high resolution bathymetric data, j) adding error messages to parts of the code to make it more user friendly and k) modifying the documentation to reflect these changes. As such, these changes were substantial enough to warrant withdrawing PCTides 1.0 from OAML and delivering the new PCTides 2.0 in its place.\nOne of the revisions of the PCTides upgrade included the improvement to the global boundary conditions from the Finite Element Solution (FES) model. The major difference between the FES95 and FES99 is the resolution of the data. Also the accuracy of the FES99 solutions was improved by assimilating tide gauge and Topex/Poseidon altimeter information. The data used in PCTides 1.0 was FES 95, with a resolution of 0.5 degree. It contained both amplitude and phases of nine major tidal components. PCTides 2.0 was upgraded to use the FES99 data. This dataset has 0.25 degree resolution and assimilates 687 TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry crossover data along with -700 tide gauge data in the database. It contains both amplitude and phases for the nine major tidal components and is a significant improvement both in the deep ocean and along the coasts.\nGlobally, the maximum M2 (the major constituent of the nine used in the model) phase differences (figure 2a) are very small but with most differences occurring in the Bering Strait, Hudson Bay and Gulf of Lawrence (figure 2b), in the western Antarctic (figure 2c), and around Australia and the Indonesia coast (figure 2d). The other limited areas where differences occur include the southeast Mediterranean, the Iceland area, and the Kara and Laptev Sea. Neither FES95 nor FES99 have values in the Black or Caspian Seas. The amplitude differences are very small in most areas. "}, {"section_title": "PCTides Evaluation", "text": "A majority of the PCTides evaluations were performed using PCTides 1.0. However, those specific evaluations were only minimally (if at all) affected by the modifications included in PCTides version 2.0 and as such are believed to still be valid. If anything, errors should be reduced.\nThe PCTides OPTEST evaluation was performed by the regional centers at Norfolk (NLMOC) and San Diego (NPMOC). NLMOC chose the Chesapeake Bay as their evaluation location while NPMOC chose three regions for evaluation: 1) Scripps located off the southern California coast, 2) an area near Puget Sound and 3) near the Gulf of Alaska. The pass/fail criteria determined prior to the OPTEST by the centers, were an RMS error of less than 1.2 ft (0.365 m) in amplitude and a phase error less than 45 minutes. PCTides successfully passed this OPTEST in each area studied as documented in the OPTEST report (Appendix C) and the Preller et al., 2002 (Appendix D) .\nIn addition to the OPTEST, PCTides was run for the region encompassing the southwestern coast of Spain. These runs were initially performed by NRL as part of a Rapid Response (RR98) Exercise off the Spainist coast in 1998 using PCTides 1.0 system. Figure 3 shows the model domain used and the specified output stations. Similar results presented at the RR98 Hot Wash meeting at Saclant Centre in La Spezia, Italy and at the 1999 US/UK Operational Oceanography workshop held in Taunton, England had been seen by NEMOC personnel. As a result, NEMOC requested to serve as a beta-tester of PCTides. PCTides was installed on their system in January 1999 and upgraded in August 2002. NEMOC successfully generated and distributed PCTides solutions to their users (see Appendix A) until the closure of the base.\nDr. Roger Proctor of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory performed an additional assessment of PCTides. Dr. Proctor and his colleagues are acknowledged experts in the prediction of tides in the NW European shelf region. Dr. Proctor worked with NRL to set up a PCTides grid similar to that used by the UK model. Tides and surges from PCTides were compared to the UK model output and to observations for the period April-May, 2001. Dr. Proctor concluded that PCTides forecast, assimilating IHO data, contained the same order of accuracy as the \"tuned\" UK model (Appendix B). Without IHO data assimilation, PCTides performance was less accurate than the UK model.\nAlthough the main focus of these evaluations has been on tidal elevation, PCTides also predicts 2-D barotropic tidal currents. A major obstacle in evaluating the PCTide tidal currents is the lack of observations to compare against the model results. However, an excellent opportunity to validate the models forecast velocities was presented to us when the Naval Oceanographic Office provided us the data from four bottom mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) in the Yellow Sea deployed during the month of September 1995 ( Figure 7 ). This thirty-day time series of velocity data was compared to a PCTides model forecast, which assimilated IHO data, but had no wind or pressure forcing. The PCTides forecasts of the tidal currents agree remarkably well with the depth-averaged ADCP observations. The last five days are shown ( Figure 8 ). Comparisons of the tidal heights for the entire time show the accuracy of PCTides forecast capability ( Figure 9 ) as compared to the water level elevations derived from pressure gauges on the ADCP. A statistical evaluation of the PCTide tidal elevation and phase along with tidal magnitude were compared to the ADCP observations. The ADCP observations were not assimilated into the PCTides forecast but used only for validation. The statistics shown are the mean error (ME), absolute mean error (AME), root mean square difference (RMSD), standard deviation (SD), the correlation coefficient (R) and the skill score (SS).\nThe statistics are computed from the following equations:\nWhere ME is the bias or annual mean difference, X is mean of the data values, Y is the mean of the model values, SD is the standard deviation and Ox and 5y are the standard deviation of the data and model values respectively. For the mean difference (ME), the smaller the number, the smaller the difference between the model and the data. However, if the mean is near zero, as one would expect for a tidal time series, then the mean error is not a good statistical tool to use. The lower the absolute mean difference (AME), the smaller the variability between the observation and the model. This value expresses the mean difference between the model and the observations. The Root Mean Square (RMS) difference reflects the variability between the observation and the data. This is the classic expression of how close the model solution is to the observations. The larger the variability between the observations, the larger the RMS error. Like the RMS, the standard deviation (SD) gives you the variability of the data from the mean. As SD and RMS increase, the larger the variability of the data from the mean. A skill score (SS) of 1.0 indicates a perfect model prediction. A negative skill score indicates that the model may have normalized amplitudes larger than the correlation or large biases in the mean (Murphy and Epstein, 1989) .

The RMS difference reflects the variability between the observations and the PCTides model. In this test study area using the RMS differences as our guide, the PCTides (with assimilation) varied slightly less from the observations by 30-50 cm, than the PCTides (without assimilation), which varied 31-53 cm. Comparing the correlation coefficients, the PCTides with assimilation ranged between 0.70 and 0.89, compared best to observations than the PCTides without assimilation that ranged between 0.72 and 0.81. A correlation coefficient of 1.0 indicates a perfect comparison.

The following qualitative feedback, derived from exercise and operational support, is provided: a) PCTIDES has the potential to be an excellent tidal modeling system.\nThe flexibility of creating user-defined tidal stations and defining detailed model parameters greatly enhances our ability to support operational customers.\nb) Although atmospheric forcing is integrated into PCTIDES, NEMOC does not typically use this capability as most requests for tidal data are beyond the prognostic time scale for numerical models.\nc) An assessment of model accuracy was conducted for the Rota, Spain local area. The evaluation consisted of designing a 10-km PCTIDES grid and comparing model output with historical data (\"hindcast\") and current observations (\"forecast\").\nOur findings were that the model performs hindcasts and forecasts extremely well for the local area. d) Customer feedback concerning PCTIDES products has been very favorable; products are deemed to be valuable in operations and planning."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "My point of contact in this matter is LT Gabriel, DSN 727-3967.

The initial 'first guess' PCTIDES could produce equivalent results only on open coasts, requiring data assimilation of tidal constants to improve on the tidal response in estuarine waters. A noticeable fact was the role the data assimilation played: the data-rich UK coast sometimes over-specified the assimilation, requiring careful consideration when having tide gauge locations in a coarse (12km) adjacent model grid cells. It also showed the value of the data assimilation as without it the results were not as good as in the POL model. Higher resolution models could produce better tide and surge results.\nI was impressed with the capability of PCTIDES. Initial results were obtained within hours of setting up the system and comparable results (to a system established over 20 years and continuously monitored) obtained within days. The ease with which higher resolution models could be set up made exploring optimum grid resolutions a simple task, and demonstrated how these could improve results.

In summary, the report recommends that the basic model should be included in OAML and is suitable for fleet use after certain modifications and with caveats for operational use. We recommend the modified version of PCTides be included into the NITES software suite and on in the MET team laptops. The modifications recommended include changes in user interface, product output and display. The caveats recommended are caution in interpretation of model outputs when run near river outflows and for large semi-enclosed bays and estuaries where wind direction seriously affects tidal response.

Since this geographical situation is not uncommon, a caveat is indicated warning the user to interpret the PCTides forecast in light of this local sensitivity to wind direction.\nWindmill Point: tidal measurement station is located inside a river mouth. Since PCTides does not include river outflow, the forecasts would have the added error during rain events Although the following stations passed the criteria, the optest revealed other errors and sensitivities. At Kodiak, Alaska, the station location was incorrectly inserted into PCTides, causing the forecast to be made for a location in 85 m. (285 ft.) of water. At the Southern California station,_phase error was shown as a partial function of the grid scale chosen. For this station, NRL suggested a grid resolution below 10 km. However, the operator chose 17 km. and produced a phase error of 24 minutes. Later runs at 5 km. grid showed a 5 minute phase error. This phase error source was also a factor at Kodiak, Alaska. Therefore, a caveat should be included warning the user to use a grid resolution <10 km.\nThe OPTEST also revealed problems with the user interface, product dissemination and identification of area of interest. Though feedback from various users at both NPMOC and NLMOC, potential improvements were noted and are listed in the recommendation section below. Since PCTides code was written to run both on DOS and UNIX, we suggest that flexibility be retained and the existing user interface modified accordingly."}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "text": "This panel finds the relocatability of PCTides is a significant improvement over GFMPL.

The user interface should be improved for inclusion in the NITES software suite before PCTides becomes operational.\nWe therefore recommend that PCTides is suitable for fleet use and inclusion in the NITES software suite only after the following improvements have been made.\nInstallation: The program must be configured such that installation from a CD or diskette by an untrained user is simple and effective.\nUser interface:\na.) The DOS windows functions should be incorporated into the existing code for windows and formatted for inclusion in the NITES software suite. b.) The batch files of the wind forcing be a default chosen initially by the user so as to retain the options of choosing a selected model or point source winds and to minimize the keystrokes required to run the model c.) Graphics should be modernized. The displayed coastlines should represent the chosen grid resolutions. During setup, the program should allow insertion of wind file location in the local LAN. This should be a default so the user need not re-enter it each run. d.) The source of the wind forcing used should be on the screen and saved in the product files. e.) Defining a grid should be made similar to Metcast Client. The user should be able to rubber band an forecast area and identify the tidal stations by enter lat/lon.

A pop-up window warning should be included that tells the user the depths of all chosen stations and when any selected point is on land or has a depth beyond a practical threshold level. Products:\na.) Output of prediction curves should be user choice formats (tif, gif, etc) compatible with JMV. b.) An option for automatically emailing the output to a user-defined list of addresses should be included.. c.) Display of barotropic currents should be eliminated to avoid operational use in baroclinic waters. d.) Auto-insertion into designated web pages should be built in for use at Navy Centers. The web addresses and other info can be inserted first time by the user Caveats: a.) The user should be warned against using the model in or near river mouths. Guidance should be given on the best interpretation of model output. b.) If the forecast position is inside semi-enclosed waters, the user should be warned about forecast sensitivity to winds in directions parallel to the bay's major axis.
