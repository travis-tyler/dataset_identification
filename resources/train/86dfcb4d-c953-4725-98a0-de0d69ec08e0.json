In this study, we introduce WaveletBrain, a novel representation of the white and gray matter surfaces of the cortex. The proposed framework innovates by deriving localized shape information from a global harmonic representation, that can be used in large-scale population studies of surface data. Results show that WaveletBrain leads to statistically significant improvements in comparison to the ShapeDNA representation in a variety of experiments including (i) classification of Alzheimer's disease, normal aging, and mild cognitive impairment, (ii) sex classification and (iii) age prediction of subjects. We performed our analysis on 719 patients and 2,876 surfaces. While this work focuses primarily on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, our proposed framework can be used to address general surface analysis problems in neuroscience.\nKeywords: WaveletBrain \u00b7 Spectral graph wavelets \u00b7 Brain \u00b7 Alzheimer's disease.\nCorresponding Author: ma masou@encs.concordia.ca.

In fact, the brain morphometry starts to change years before recognizing the first symptoms of AD. Although no cure for AD is known, efforts towards early detection of the disease could directly impact the quality of a patient's life [15] .\nRecently, there has been a flurry of research activity on designing a computerassisted model to detect subtle changes in brain shape and, hence determining risk level and preventive therapiess [4, 22, 21] . Measuring the similarity between all image pairs of a large set of N magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a computationally expensive operation of O(N 2 ) complexity [20] . Moreover, scanning artifacts and inhomogeneities can lead to noisy intensity variations in MRI scans, limiting the accuracy of AD classification [21] . The accuracy of prediction is closely linked to the model or representation used [3] . The cortical surface is responsible for all cognition, and finding an efficient and informative representation may lead to significant improvements in tasks such as classification and regression. Early approaches to modeling brain shape included volumetric measurements or voxel-wise morphometric analysis [7, 18, 9] . Although these representations are useful in describing inter-class differences, they ignore important regional information about brain shape [17] . Brain surfaces can be modeled as triangulated meshes leading to a more efficient and compact representation. Most existing approaches have analyzed the surfaces of subcortical structures, e.g. hippocampus [6, 5, 2] and measure a shape coarsely [21] , here we focus on the gray and white matter surfaces.\nRecently, spectral signatures based on the eigendecomposition of Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) have attracted a lot of attention in a wide range of applications including object retrieval and classification [11, 13] . Spectral shape descriptors are grouped into two categories, i.e. global and local descriptors. The local descriptors [12] are defined on each vertex and contain information about the local structure of that vertex, while global descriptors [16, 19, 1] capture information of the entire object. Shape-DNA [16] introduced by Reuter et al. as a global signature defined by non-trivial ksmallest eigenvalues of LBO normalized by mesh area that sorted in ascending order. Most recently, the authors extended the idea for brain identification called BrainPrint [21] . However, a global descriptor only provides a limited representation of a surface as a whole and cannot be applied when, for instance, to analyze local features on surfaces.\nSpectral graph wavelet signature (SGWS) is a compact descriptor that is not only pose-invariant but also allows assessing shapes in different scales. In a bid to resolve the deficiencies of the global descriptors, SGWS has been introduced in [11, 13] as a multiresolution descriptor that encodes both local and global structure of the shape. It efficiently captures valuable information about both macroscopic and microscopic structures of the shape, notably, the cortical folding pattern. SGWS has since showed superiority over ShapeDNA in both non-rigid shape classification and retrieval [11, 12] . Unlike BrainPrint, which relies on 44 descriptors calculated from both cortical and subcortical surfaces, we compute our SGWS only on the cortical surfaces, with 4 descriptors. This compact representation is less prone to segmentation error and more computationally feasible for large datasets. The new framework leads to more accurate classification and prediction results.\nThe contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) we propose a framework to precisely model a brain by harnessing the power of the spectral graph wavelets called Wavelet-Brain. (2) We exploit the WaveletBrain to predict Alzheimer's disease and show the superiority of our approach with respect to the well-known ShapeDNA in different experiments."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "We model a brain surface as a triangular mesh M, where M is defined by G = (V, E, T ), with V = {v 1 , . . . , v m } as the set of vertices, E = {e ij } as the set of edges, and T = {t 1 , . . . , t g } as the set of triangles. Each e ij = [v i , v j ] connects a pair of vertices {v i , v j }.

However, the advantage of the wavelet transform over the Fourier transform is its capability to perform localization in both frequency and space domain making spectral graph wavelet a perfect candidate for analyzing the signal in multilevel of descriptions.\nThe localization of wavelet function around a surface point j \u2208 V may be characterized by applying a wavelet operator T t g at kernel g and scale t to an indicator function f (i) = \u03b4 j (i) such that \u03c8 t,j = T t g \u03b4 j . The inner product between the input function f and \u03c8 t,j results in wavelet coefficients as\nalso we may construct the coefficients of the scaling function by applying the scaling operator T h on a unit impulse function \u03b4 j , i.e. \u03c6 j = T h \u03b4 j as follows\nWe integrate the coefficients of the wavelet and scaling function to build the spectral graph signature at vertex index j as follows:\nwhere s L (j) is the spectral graph wavelet descriptor at resolution level L. The dimension p of SGWS is L + 1, which leads to a compact signature for analyzing the cortex surface. Moreover, to access the full spectrum of the brain structure, the wavelet scales t k (t k > t k+1 ) are selected to be logarithmically equispaced between maximum and minimum scales t 1 and t L , respectively. We define the spectral graph wavelet generating kernel g and scaling function h as follows g(\nWe set \u03b3 such that h(0) has the same value as the maximum value of g and \u03bb min = \u03bb max /15. Also, the maximum and minimum scales are set to t 1 = 2/\u03bb min and t L = 2/\u03bb max , where \u03bb min and \u03bb max are the lower and upper bounds of the spectrum, respectively. Figure 1 represents the normalized \u03c7-squared distance between a specified point and the rest of points on normal (top row) and smoothed (bottom row) brain surface using SGWS.\nFeature Aggregation In WaveletBrain, a brain surface M is modeled by a p \u00d7 m matrix S = (s 1 , . . . , s m ) of spectral graph wavelet signatures, where each p-dimensional feature vector s i is a local descriptor that encodes the local information around the ith vertex. To aggregate the local features attained from spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT), we employ bag-of-features (BoF) model leading to a simple and lightweight representation of a brain surface that facilitates the process of brain comparison. The BoF model consists of four main steps: feature extraction and description, dictionary design, feature coding, and pooling."}, {"section_title": "Algorithm", "text": "In an effort to model the brain shape in spectral graph wavelets domain, we first select the white and gray matter surfaces for each subject in the dataset D. Afterward, each brain surface is characterized to a compact and discriminative representation with SGWS. Subsequently, we perform soft-assignment coding by embedding the local signatures into the geometric dictionary space of size k, resulting in higher dimensional mid-level features U = (u 1 , . . . , u m ) \u2208 R k\u00d7m which we refer to as spectral graph wavelet codes (SGWC). Consequently, we apply sum-pooling on code assignment matrix U to achieve a histogram h r = m i=1 u ri that represents each brain surface M. This process is repeated separately for right/left gray and white matters of a brain sur- face in the dataset. We combine extracted signatures of n brain surfaces in the dataset and arranged them into a 4k \u00d7 n data matrix Z = (z 1 , . . . , z n ) called WaveletBrain. It is noteworthy to mention that the dictionary is computed offline by concatenating all the SGWS matrices into a data matrix, followed by applying the K-means algorithm resulting in a vocabulary matrix V, where V = (v 1 , . . . , v k ) \u2208 R p\u00d7k . Any further processing such as age prediction and disease classification is conducted on the lightweight representation, i.e. the WaveletBrain Z. This requires considerably less memory and makes it easier to model, compute and compare than the image scans. WaveletBrain represents shape information in multiple levels of details and offers a greater descriptive representation on, for instance, fine levels of details such as the cortical folds, where definitely important shape information on brain atrophy may be hidden. To provide more discriminative power for WaveletBrain, we normalized our descriptor with surface area A, where A = diag(a i ). The flowchart of the proposed framework is depicted in Figure 2 ."}, {"section_title": "Experiments and Results", "text": "In this section, we assess the performance of the proposed WaveletBrain through extensive experiments for disease classification, sex classification and age prediction. We validate our approach by performing a comprehensive comparison with ShapeDNA [16] as a well-known approach in medical shape analysis.\nDataset The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and\nearly Alzheimers disease (AD). Early diagnosis of AD by sensitive and specific markers is a breakthrough to assist clinicians to develop new preventive treatment as well as reducing time and cost of clinical trial.In our experiment, we selected 719 subjects from ADNI dataset resulting in 2, 892 surfaces including right/left white and gray matters."}, {"section_title": "Performance Evaluation Measures", "text": "In a bid to perform AD and sex classification, we split our WaveletBrain data matrix Z = {(z i , y i )}, where z i \u2208 R 4k in two disjoint subsets of training set Z train for learning, and the test set Z test for testing. We evaluate the performance of a classifier on test data by building a contingency table. We then extract the accuracy results by dividing the total number of correctly classified examples by the total number of examples. We use support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier in our experiments to separate different categories since it works well in high-dimensional feature space.\nTo perform age prediction, we employ partial least-squares (PLS) regression [23] . PLS is beneficial when the number of variables in a data matrix Z is significantly larger than the number of observations. The intuition behind employing PLS regression is the failure of multiple linear regression due to multicollinearity among Z variables. As a result, the regression is performed on the latent variables. Intuitively, if there is a disparity between the predicted and the real age, it means a patient is suspected of suffering from AD.\nClassification of Alzheimer's disease We applied 10-fold cross-validation to classify brain surfaces of AD from those of the NC and MCI classes in the dataset. We consider an equal size of classes to perform classification. For instance, to classify NC and MCI groups, the data consists of 212 brain surfaces for each class. To capture more information about the brain shape, we also aggregated the differences between the right gray and white matters as well as those of the left hemispheres to the WaveletBrain. Table 1 reports a comparison between the performance of our WaveletBrain approach with ShapeDNA for differentiating between patients with AD, NC, and MCI. As can be seen, our framework outperforms the ShapeDNA in disease classification and results in higher accuracy with p-values of 0.0022, 0.0001, and 0.0024 for AD/NC, NC/MCI, and AD/MCI classification, respectively. For visualization purposes, Fig. 3 reveals the significance map of group differences between AD and NC. As can be seen, the location of brain differences correlates with changes in the hippocampal region."}, {"section_title": "Sex prediction", "text": "The task here is to predict the sex based on the WaveletBrain.

WaveletBrain achieved an accuracy of 81.67 \u00b1 4.30%, yielding therefore a higher accuracy for sex prediction with a p-value of 0.0001."}, {"section_title": "Age prediction", "text": "We evaluate the performance of the WaveletBrain on the prediction of the subject's age by exploiting 719 subjects from ADNI dataset. We employed PLS regression among different diagnostic classes to predict subjects' age. Our results are evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation. Figure 4 shows a scatter plot of true versus predicted age on the ADNI dataset. The least regression line is also included in the plot for both ShapeDNA and WaveletBrain.\nTo show the strength of the WaveletBrain in contrast with ShapeDNA for predicting age, we computed Pearson's r for both methods, yielding in r = 0.48 for ShapeDNA and r = 0.58 for WaveletBrain, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 4 , our framework outperforms ShapeDNA in terms of Pearson's r with performance improvement of 0.10.\nIn an effort to perform a further comparison between ShapeDNA and WaveletBrain, we calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) for real and estimated ages. The results showed that our proposed method attains an MAE of 4.31 compared to ShapeDNA with 4.59. As a result, WaveletBrain ameliorates prediction of the subject's age with a lower error of 0.22.
