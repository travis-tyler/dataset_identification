The prevalence of T2D steadily increases with age, with recent estimates suggesting that more than 25% of individuals older than 65 years have the disease. 1 Alzheimer disease (AD) is a brain disorder also linked to aging that affects approximately 5 million Americans. As the population continues to age in the coming decades, it is estimated that the prevalence of AD will triple by the year 2050. 2 Disturbingly, research has begun to link T2D to risk of AD, suggesting that as the population continues to age the incidence and prevalence of T2D increase; this may compound the growing burden of AD on the population. Therefore, it is imperative for research to fully understand the pathways that link these disorders.\nPrior to the advent of neuroimaging, identifying alterations in brain structure and function was limited to observations from animal models, autopsy studies, surgical interventions, or surface recordings of brain activity. In the past 2 decades, neuroimaging has given researchers the ability to observe the living brain in a noninvasive way. This review examines how the application of neuroimaging methodologies has led to greater understanding of the pathways that link T2D to cognitive impairment and AD.

The prevalence of T2D increases with older age. The main diagnostic criteria for T2D include fasting blood glucose levels greater than 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A 1C (HbA 1C ) levels >6.5%, or glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL after 2 hours following an oral glucose tolerance test. The hyperglycemia of T2D is caused by 2 factors: (1) an inability of the b-cells of the pancreas to maintain normoglycemic conditions in response to increased blood glucose and (2) a decrease in the ability of insulin to act on cells to promote glucose uptake and suppress glucose production by the liver, a condition termed insulin resistance. Obesity, a lack of physical activity, and inflammation all contribute to insulin resistance and promote a prediabetic physiological environment. The natural history of T2D is complex, with a variety of genetic, physiological, and lifestyle factors contributing to the etiology of the disease. 3 In addition to older age, a variety of risk factors including sedentary lifestyle, obesity, family history, and ethnicity confer increased risk of developing T2D.\nAlzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for approximately half of the reported dementia cases. 4 The incidence of AD increases with older age, increasing from less than 2 (per 100 person-years) in individuals less than 70 years of age, to possibly more than 6 in individuals 85 years of age or older, although these estimates vary widely across studies. 5 Alzheimer disease displays a characteristic progression of neuronal deterioration, beginning in the limbic regions of the brainparticularly the hippocampus-and spreading throughout the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. 6, 7 The ability to image these regions using functional and structural neuroimaging has provided critical insights into the progression of disease and attempts to identify imaging biomarkers, which may predict progression of the disease and subsequent cognitive decline. The hallmark feature of AD is the presence of extracellular b-amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Numerous molecular pathways have been identified that could link alterations in insulin signaling, as well as the effects of hyperglycemia, to b-amyloid concentration and t protein phosphorylation. 8 These pathways include disruption of the protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, competitive inhibition of insulin-degrading enzyme (which typically degrades b-amyloid) as well as oxidative stress and the formation of advanced glycation end products, which result from hyperglycemia. 9 A bidirectional relationship between insulin resistance and pathophysiological markers of AD, such as b-amyloid, has been documented. 10 Pathology studies on humans have yielded inconsistent results: some studies have found no relationship or even inverse associations between T2D and levels of plaques and tangles [11] [12] [13] but it is possible that the vascular risk factors associated with T2D may lower the threshold at which plaques and tangles impact functioning. 14 "}, {"section_title": "Type 2 Diabetes and Cognitive Impairment", "text": "Normal aging is associated with decreases in cognitive ability but prospective studies of those with T2D have shown an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in those with T2D. 15 It is unclear whether age and T2D act additively or synergistically to influence the degree of cognitive decline. The relationships between T2D and the rate of cognitive decline have been mixed 15-17 but a 4-year longitudinal study found no evidence for an increase in rate of decline among participants with T2D. 18 The relationship between T2D and cognitive impairment has been hypothesized to result from damage that occurs during critical periods of aging, with different risk factors having varying effects on cognition throughout the lifespan. 19 The effects of T2D on cognition are especially pronounced within the domains of memory and executive function. Most studies of the neuropsychological effects of T2D have focused on memory, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility. An empirical review of these studies examined cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of T2D on cognition. 20 Across studies, the most common finding was impairment in processing speed (63% of studies), followed by attention (50%), memory (44%), and cognitive flexibility (38%). Effect sizes were larger in older populations, and the effects generally remained significant after controlling for vascular risk factors.\nIdentifying the physiological aspects of T2D that contribute to cognitive decline has been an important line of research in hopes of developing preventative interventions. A study of older adults with T2D investigated the relationship between cognition and diabetes disease variables including disease duration, control (measured by HbA 1C ), insulin therapy, hypertension status, cholesterol levels, and polyneuropathy. After controlling for age, gender, and education, the only risk factors associated with cognitive impairment were duration and HbA 1C levels. 21 These data suggest that disease control and maintenance of blood sugar level may potentially confer cognitive benefits and possibly an additional motivation to encourage patients to engage in achieving blood sugar goals."}, {"section_title": "Insights From Neuroimaging", "text": "The increase in brain imaging studies over the past decade has provided significant insight into understanding how T2D affects brain structure and function, and how these differencessuch as hippocampal atrophy and alterations in resting state networks-mirror those seen in AD. A common focus in this decade of research is attempting to identify pathways that may link T2D to cognitive impairment and AD. As computing power and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner strength have increased, the level of analysis has kept in step, moving from more gross anatomical studies of volume and general atrophy to more fine-grained analysis of white matter tracts, utilizing newer methods such as diffusion tensor imaging. These neuroimaging studies hold the potential to identify early brain abnormalities, both functional and structural, that may serve as early biomarkers for later risk of cognitive impairment and the development of AD.\nStructural MRI Volumetric Differences. The majority of the studies utilizing neuroimaging to study the effects of T2D on the brain have focused on structural measurements, identifying how whole brain and regional gray and white matter volume relate to the disease. The emerging results have identified a consistent relationship between T2D and cortical and subcortical atrophy, much of which is often focused within the temporal lobes. Initial studies hypothesized that T2D would be associated with abnormalities within the temporal lobe, noting the relationship between T2D and AD. 22 Utilizing a sample of elderly participants (60-90 years of age), hippocampus and amygdala volumes were compared between individuals with T2D and controls. After controlling for any evidence of vascular disease-including carotid atherosclerosis, white matter lesions, and brain infarcts-individuals with T2D had more atrophy of the hippocampus and amygdala. When the degree of insulin resistance was compared to the regional brain volumes, higher insulin resistance was associated with greater atrophy of the amygdala. Later studies using a whole-brain analysis have continued to find a consistent link between diabetes and brain atrophy, [23] [24] [25] and this atrophy is often more pronounced within the hippocampus. 26 These results demonstrate the capabilities of structural MRI to identify regional brain abnormalities in individuals with T2D that mirror those seen in individuals with cognitive impairment and AD.\nRisk Factors. Understanding the components of T2D that contribute to brain atrophy has been an important line of research in order to identify potential points for intervention. 27 In middle age, glycemic control is an important factor that has been linked to the degree of atrophy. A multivariate regression analysis found that HbA 1C level was the only significant predictor of hippocampal atrophy in individuals with T2D. 26 A later study linked T2D to a reduction in prefrontal and hippocampal volumes and found that obesity (beyond diabetes diagnosis) was a significant predictor of smaller hippocampal volume. The authors hypothesized that inflammation associated with obesity may be the explanatory variable, and future work will be needed to fully characterize the mediators between T2D and changes in brain volume.\nAn additional factor that could contribute to hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive impairment is dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. A study of the relationships between HPA feedback, cognition, and brain volume in individuals with T2D found that diminished HPA feedback control was related to decreased cognitive performance. 28 Separately, obesity was related to decreased hippocampal volumes and HbA 1C predicted prefrontal volumes. These findings suggest that HPA dysregulation may be one pathway linking T2D to decreased cognitive performance but the brain pathways that mediate these links are not yet understood.\nInsulin resistance has recently been shown to be a predictor of gray matter atrophy and cognitive performance. 29 In otherwise cognitively healthy individuals, insulin resistance was associated with reduced gray matter within the medial temporal lobe as well as several regions clustered in the frontal, temporal, and limbic cortices. A subset of participants completed a 4-year follow-up visit to identify whether insulin resistance was predictive of cognition and brain volume decline. Insulin resistance at baseline predicted atrophy in several brain regions, including cingulate cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus, and regions in the prefrontal lobe. Insulin resistance was not related to cognitive ability at baseline, but baseline insulin resistance did predict poorer performance on encoding of information at follow-up. This relationship was mediated by progressive atrophy of the hippocampus and parahippocampus. These results highlight the promise of structural neuroimaging to contribute to our understanding of the pathways that link risk factors such as insulin resistance to future cognitive decline.\nWhite Matter Measurements. The hyperglycemia associated with T2D is accompanied by activation of inflammatory pathways, increases in the production of reactive oxygen species and lipotoxicity, and culminating in microvascular and macrovascular damage. 3 As such, it would be expected that individuals with T2D exhibit vascular lesions within the brain that could contribute to the development of cognitive problems. A study of 113 adults with T2D (age 56-80 years) found a higher number of white matter lesions in the brains of diabetic patients than those in controls, and this relationship remained after controlling for hypertension. 30 In addition to higher white matter lesion burden, the diabetic participants performed worse in the cognitive domains of attention/executive functioning, information processing speed, and memory. When neuropsychological performance was compared to structural brain information, deep white matter lesions and silent infarcts predicted information processing speed."}, {"section_title": "Relationships to Cognition.", "text": "A recent cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between brain atrophy, lesions, and decrements in cognitive function in individuals with T2D. 31 Concurrent with previous research, participants with T2D (n \u00bc 350) had more cerebral infarcts and less volume of gray matter, white matter, and smaller hippocampal volumes relative to control participants (n \u00bc 363). Distribution of gray matter atrophy was particularly localized to temporal, frontal, and limbic regions, a pattern characteristic of early AD. Notably, there was no difference in frequency of microbleeds or degree of white matter hyperintensities between the groups. Relative to controls, T2D was associated with lower performance on memory and speed of processing measures. In order to investigate the impact of lesions and atrophy on cognition, MRI variables were added in a stepwise regression model after adjusting for demographic characteristics and mood. Addition of gray matter volume reduced the relationship between T2D and cognition by an average of approximately 50%. However, including white matter hyperintensity volume, white matter volume, and infarcts had much smaller effects on the model. These results suggest the atrophy in a pattern similar to that seen in AD may contribute to the cognitive decrements observed in T2D.\nLongitudinal studies are beginning to trace changes in cognition and MRI over time in patients with T2D and attempting to identify structural brain changes that may explain the accelerated decline in cognition that is sometimes seen in older adults with T2D. In a 4-year follow-up study, Reijmer and colleagues 32 examined changes in brain volume, white matter hyperintensities, and cognitive functioning between patients with T2D and controls. Within the participants with T2D, the authors identified 17 participants (25% of the sample) who were experiencing accelerated decline. Retrospectively, those who had accelerated cognitive decline had larger white matter hyperintensity volumes and larger total brain volume at baseline. At follow-up, those with accelerated cognitive decline had greater increase in ventricular and white matter hyperintensity volume and greater loss of total brain volume, relative to those without accelerated cognitive decline. Although the authors were unable to find an association between clinical risk factors and accelerated cognitive decline, this study was the first to identify volumetric brain parameters that associate with changes in cognition over time.\nLongitudinal changes in brain volume were recently linked to changes in cognition in a large study from the Women's Health Initiative. 33 Utilizing a large sample of older women (n \u00bc 1366; age 72-89 years), the authors examined correlations between gray, white, and ischemic lesion volumes and cognition. At baseline, T2D was associated with smaller gray matter volumes and increased ischemic lesions, replicating earlier studies. There were no cross-sectional associations between T2D and white matter volumes. A subset of participants (n \u00bc 698) completed a repeat visit approximately 5 years later. Longitudinally, T2D was associated with an increase in ischemic lesion volumes-but the effects of T2D on loss of total brain volume were nonsignificant. To identify the effects of brain and ischemic volumes on cognition, all volumes were entered as covariates in a model relating T2D to cognitive performance. Inclusion of brain volumes in the model did not substantially reduce the relationship between T2D and cognitive deficits, suggesting that other factors likely contribute to the impairment of cognition in older women with T2D. These factors could include inflammation, genetic susceptibilities (such as apolipoprotein E), circulating insulin levels, or microstructural abnormalities (discussed subsequently).\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging has offered new opportunities to identify microstructural changes in the white matter that accompany T2D and may account for cognitive deficits. In the first study to examine how microstructural white matter changes are altered in T2D, white matter abnormalities (as measured by fractional anisotropy) were identified in the frontal and temporal lobes, but particularly in the temporal stem. 34 Furthermore, these abnormalities were predictive of immediate memory performance. A larger study on cognitively intact adults with T2D extended these findings by utilizing more imaging parameters including mean diffusivity, transverse diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy. 35 Whole-brain analysis found a correlation between disease duration and an increase in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and transverse diffusivity. Patients with T2D had a regional decrease in fractional anisotropy in the frontal lobes, primarily due to increased transverse diffusivity. These findings suggest that T2D may be associated with both axonal injury and demyelination and also illustrate how microstructural techniques will be useful in identifying white matter abnormalities in individuals with T2D. Recent studies have extended these findings of microstructural abnormalities and their relationship to cognitive functioning. Comparison of white matter tracts revealed an increase in mean diffusivity in patients with T2D, which, in turn, was related to worse memory performance and slower information processing speed. 36 Graph theory 37 has provided another method for investigating how the characteristics of white matter networks may relate to cognitive function. In a study of older nondemented adults, those with T2D displayed differences in local and global network properties relative to control participants. Network properties were neither related to memory nor executive functioning but several network characteristics (clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and path length) were predictive of slowed information processing in patients. As these methods become more widely used, neuroimaging will continue to identify structural mechanistic pathways that link T2D to cognitive impairment and AD."}, {"section_title": "Functional Imaging Studies", "text": "Although most studies have focused on how T2D relates to structural changes in the brain, a growing literature is documenting functional alterations that occur in conjunction with T2D. Functional studies have included quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF), glucose metabolism utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Results from different methodologies have not been as consistent as structural studies but have begun to identify alterations in brain activity and continued to draw possible links among T2D, cognitive impairment, and AD.\nCerebral Blood Flow. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and vascular dementia. Several studies have attempted to link T2D to alterations in CBF but with mixed results. Initial studies using single-photon emission computed tomography found a reduction in CBF in patients with T2D relative to controls. 38, 39 Later studies with larger sample sizes have had difficulty in identifying consistent patterns of CBF change in individuals with T2D. Experiments by the Utrecht Diabetic Encephalopathy Study investigated associations between T2D and total CBF in a cross-sectional study of 98 patients and 47 controls. In this sample, total CBF-as measured by blood flow within the internal carotid and basilar arteries-was diminished in patients. 40 However, when the values were corrected for brain volume, there was no significant difference in CBF between patients and controls. Across all participants, lower CBF was associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests (independent of white matter pathology and infarcts) but this association was independent of diabetes status. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that total CBF was likely not the underlying cause of cognitive impairment in patients but it was unclear whether cerebrovascular reactivity was a contributing factor.\nTo address both the question of reactivity and the longitudinal effects of CBF on changes in cognitive function and brain volume, a 4-year follow-up study was conducted. 41 Cerebrovascular reactivity was measured by observing the change in blood flow in response to an inhaled carbon dioxide mixture. At baseline, there was no relationship between cerebrovascular reactivity, cognition, and brain volume, or white matter disease. At follow-up, cognition had declined at similar rates for patients and controls, 42 but in patients with T2D this decline was not predicted by cerebrovascular reactivity or CBF. Similarly, CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity at baseline did not predict changes in brain volume. The authors concluded that these vascular measures may not play a causative role in cognitive decline and atrophy in T2D but other vascular brain damage may still play a role in these factors. Additionally, measurement of CBF provides only a gross measurement of total blood intake, without reference to regional differences that may increase or decrease with disease pathology.\nPositron Emission Tomography Imaging. The question of longitudinal regional changes in CBF was addressed recently by the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging utilizing 15 O-water PET imaging. 43 The initial study aimed to identify how cardiovascular risk (measured using the Framingham Heart Study score) is related to longitudinal changes in regional CBF. Participants included 97 older adults (mean baseline age: 69.5 years) with varying levels of cardiovascular risk and free of cognitive impairment. Participants completed PET scans annually for up to 8 years, and changes in CBF were modeled using cardiovascular risk score as the independent predictor. Higher baseline levels of cardiovascular risk were associated with decreases in CBF in several brain regions, independent of changes in tissue volume. Within the areas that displayed decreases in CBF, relationships were examined for individual risk factors that comprised the cardiovascular risk score. Type 2 diabetes mellitus had an independent relationship with CBF decreases in 1 region, insular cortex, and this relationship was not attenuated after controlling for changes in brain volume. One limitation of this study was that it included only 19 participants with T2D (total sample \u00bc 97 participants) and thus may have been underpowered to detect changes in other brain regions. These results suggest that longitudinal CBF changes that accompany T2D may be regionally specific but subsequent studies need to include larger samples that are specifically designed to test for these differences.\nA second study by the Baltimore group examined how impaired glucose tolerance in midlife (mean age \u00bc 57 at baseline) predicted subsequent changes in CBF, again measured by 15 O-water PET imaging. 44 Participants (n \u00bc 64, free of T2D) completed oral glucose tolerance tests and were divided into those with impaired glucose tolerance (n \u00bc 15) and normal glucose tolerance (n \u00bc 49). Longitudinal changes in CBF were then compared between the groups. Glucose tolerance status was associated with longitudinal increases and decreases in CBF in several regions. Relative to participants with normal glucose tolerance, those with impaired glucose tolerance had greater CBF decreases in regions including orbitofrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and the inferior parietal lobule. Greater increases in CBF were seen in regions including inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and globus pallidus. Accounting for apolipoprotein E status did not affect the results, but controlling for body mass index eliminated orbitofrontal and inferior parietal lobule relationships. However, all associations between glucose tolerance and increases in CBF remained significant after covarying for body mass index. These results suggest that impairments in glucose tolerancean early marker for diabetes risk-may hold predictive value for subsequent changes in CBF in numerous brain regions. Participants in this study were free of T2D and thus free of insulin treatment and diabetes intervention. However, as a subclinical sample, the longitudinal changes in CBF may continue to change if those with impaired glucose tolerance progress to T2D.\nAlterations in cerebral glucose metabolism that accompany prediabetes and T2D have been investigated in a crosssectional study utilizing 18F fluorodeoxyglucose PET. 45 Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and participants included older adults (mean age \u00bc 74) with prediabetes (n \u00bc 11), T2D (n \u00bc 12), or normal glucose tolerance (n \u00bc 6). At rest, in participants with prediabetes or T2D, higher insulin resistance was associated with reductions in glucose metabolism in regions including posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and temporal lobes and regions of prefrontal cortex. In adults with normal glucose tolerance, there were no associations between insulin resistance and regional cerebral glucose metabolism. A separate scan was conducted as participants completed a memory-encoding task. Healthy participants displayed the predicted increase in activation in regions associated with memory encoding, including medial cingulate, frontal, and temporal cortices. Qualitatively, those participants with prediabetes or T2D had a more widespread pattern of activation extending into putamen, cerebellum, and thalamic regions. Within that group, memory recall scores were associated with increased metabolism in regions including the posterior cingulate and left frontal and temporal cortex. Based on this pattern of diffuse activation, the authors draw parallels to changes in cerebral metabolism that are commonly seen in AD.\nResting-State Functional MRI. Measuring activity of the brain using rs-fMRI has had a major impact on identifying functional networks that are spontaneously active in the brain in the absence of a task or external stimulation. 46 As the properties of these networks have become better understood, research has begun to identify alterations in resting state networks that cooccur with numerous disorders. Most research has focused on schizophrenia, AD, and depression 47 but a growing body of research has identified alterations in resting-state networks that accompany T2D. One of the first studies to utilize rs-fMRI in individuals with T2D used a region-of-interest approach to identify how connections between brain regions were altered in conjunction with T2D in elderly participants. 48 Resting state signal was extracted from bilateral hippocampus regions and correlated with activity across the brain. These network maps were then compared between patients with T2D (n \u00bc 21) and controls (n \u00bc 19). Patients with T2D had reduced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and numerous regions that are typically associated with the ''default mode network,'' including the anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal and medial temporal lobes. Participants also completed neuropsychological tests that revealed differences in memory and executive function domains in participants with T2D but the study did not examine direct associations between differences in cognition and brain activity.\nAlterations in default mode network connectivity were recently examined in middle-age adults (45-66 years old) including 10 patients with T2D and 11 age-matched controls. 49 Patients exhibited lower connectivity between the posterior cingulate and several default mode regions, including middle temporal, medial frontal, and inferior frontal gyri. In this sample, no between-group differences were found in hippocampus volume or cognitive performance, and neither hippocampus volume nor cognitive scores correlated with functional connectivity measurements. However, due to the small sample size, these null findings could be the result of low statistical power.\nResting-state regional differences in activity were recently investigated using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, a separate method for identifying rs-fMRI components. 50 The study extended the findings of alterations in the temporal lobe, finding reduced amplitude values in bilateral middle temporal gyrus as well as several other regions. Activity in the middle temporal gyrus was inversely correlated with HbA 1C and executive functioning. These results continue to indicate that T2D not only affects structure of the temporal lobe but these alterations in structure may be accompanied by functional alterations. Furthermore, these findings reinforce the importance of HbA 1C as a significant predictor of brain volume, adding to the literature that identifies glucose control as an important factor in understanding decline.\nAlthough the literature linking T2D and alterations in brain activity has been limited relative to the size of the structural imaging literature, it has contributed to models that link T2D and its risk factors to regional changes that mirror those seen in cognitive impairment and AD. Several of the functional imaging studies are limited by small sample sizes and lack of prospective design. However, the findings continue to link alterations within temporal and limbic structures to the cognitive dysfunction that accompanies T2D. Future studies employing prospective designs and accounting for more of the physiological components of T2D have the potential to identify early functional alterations that may serve as independent predictors of risk of future cognitive decline. Combining functional and structural methodologies will continue to inform models for the pathophysiology that links T2D and its risk factors to cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "T2D and AD Biomarkers", "text": "Interactions Between T2D and AD Progression. As the population becomes older and the incidence of T2D and AD increases, it is critical to identify pathways within the diseases that may interact, possibly leading to worse outcomes. To date, only a few pioneering neuroimaging studies have included groups of patients with comorbid T2D and AD to identify the interactions between the diseases. An initial study measured the degree of cortical atrophy in patients with comorbid T2D and AD relative to patients with AD and without T2D. 51 Despite equal performance on neuropsychological function, participants with comorbid T2D and AD had significantly more cortical atrophy relative to those patients without T2D. This effect remained significant and independent of age, hypertension, history of vascular intervention, or infarcts. There was a nonsignificant trend toward more infarcts in patients with both disorders, leading the authors to conclude that a ''dual pathology''-both an increase in atrophy and infarcts-may account for the increase in dementia risk in participants with T2D. These results highlight the potential additive effects of T2D and AD on neurobiological pathways that contribute to cognitive impairment, as well as the danger of an increasing prevalence of both diseases.\nb-Amyloid Imaging. How insulin resistance relates to b-amyloid burden in brain tissue was recently investigated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging cohort. 52 The study included both autopsy samples (n \u00bc 197) and in vivo imaging of b-amyloid in living participants (n \u00bc 53). Presence of b-amyloid was assessed using Pittsburgh Compound B ( 11 C-PiB), a radiotracer utilized in PET imaging to identify plaques. Insulin resistance was quantified by oral glucose tolerance testing performed annually since entry into the study. Within the autopsy samples, there was no relationship among glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (as measured by HOMA-IR) and AD pathology. These null results maintained across different analytic strategies (categorical/continuous) and with various characteristics of the oral glucose tolerance test (rates of change, mean glucose levels at 120 minutes, etc.) When the sample was split based on dementia status (101 with dementia, 96 without), there were no intergroup differences in fasting glucose, insulin, or insulin resistance values. Similarly, there were no differences in AD pathology across groups based on the use of glucose-lowering drugs or insulin use.\nSimilar results were found using 11 C-PiB imaging: there were no group differences in 11 C-PiB retention when participants were split by glucose response, fasting insulin, or insulin resistance values. Participants in the top one-third of 11 C-PiB deposition had no difference in glucose or insulin scores relative to those in the bottom third of 11 C-PiB deposition. A region-of-interest analysis of the posterior cingulate/precuneus and medial temporal lobe also failed to find any differences in 11 C-PiB deposition. The authors note several shortcomings of the study, including that 11 C-PiB selectively marks b-amyloid burden but provides no measurement of protein aggregation other than b-amyloid. Second, pathological methods included silver staining rather than immunostaining, which is more sensitive to detecting plaques. Additionally, the study did not account for differences in vascular damage nor did it account for apolipoprotein E allele status. In summary, prospective measurements of glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance showed no associations with postmortem autopsy measures of AD pathology or with in vivo measurements of b-amyloid deposition using 11 C-PiB.\nNeuroimaging can continue to provide useful insights into the mechanisms between T2D and AD pathology, although the initial studies have had mixed results. Future studies including participants who have a longer history or higher severity of T2D may provide additional insights into how these factors contribute to AD pathology. The recent development of additional markers of b-amyloid, such as Florbetapir ( 18 F) that has a longer half-life than 11 C-PiB, may provide more sensitive imaging measures of b-amyloid deposition.\nAdministration of Insulin and Oral Agents. Insulin has been shown to have beneficial effects on memory and cognition. 53, 54 Alzheimer disease is associated with alterations in insulin concentrations and insulin sensitivity within the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. 55 Studies in rodent models have suggested that insulin signaling contributes to optimal hippocampal function, 56 and therefore restoring insulin levels to normal could provide a therapeutic opportunity for individuals with AD. An initial trial that administered intranasal insulin for 3 weeks to patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment found improvements in delayed story recall. 57 Following up on these results, a pilot clinical trial was conducted to identify the effects of longer-term intranasal insulin administration on cognition, brain function, and cerebrospinal-fluid markers of AD. 58 Participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or probable AD were assigned to one of the following 3 conditions-20 IU of insulin, 40 IU of insulin, or placebo-administered daily for 4 months. At the end of the trial, subgroups of each condition completed lumbar punctures to measure b-amyloid and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or PET scans to quantify cerebral metabolic rate. Insulin administration relative to placebo had protective benefits on cognition (less decline relative to placebo), and the 20 IU dosage was associated with better memory performance relative to both 40 IU and placebo. Insulin treatment did not have significant effects on b-amyloid or tau levels in CSF but did affect cerebral metabolism. Over the 4-month period, participants receiving placebo experienced a significant decline in metabolism but participants who received intranasal insulin displayed no change in cerebral metabolism during the same time period. These results suggest that administration of insulin into the central nervous system via the nasal passage may have protective effects on cognition accompanied by altered progression of brain function. Future studies will be needed to fully understand what underlies the protective effects of insulin on brain function, and how long these effects may persist with continued intervention.\nNumerous oral agents are available to target the pathology of T2D, with added convenience relative to intranasal administration, but the cognitive effects of these medications vary. Neuroimaging studies of the structural and functional effects of oral agents as they relate to AD pathology will be an important future direction. Several studies have hypothesized that targeting insulin resistance could hold potential for preventing cognitive decline and AD. 59 Initial data suggested that the insulin sensitizer Rosiglitazone may improve cognition in mild to moderate AD, 60 but a placebo-controlled phase III trial failed to find any evidence of benefits in cognition or global function. 61 Metformin use has been associated with reduced risk of dementia, 62 but long-term use was linked to an increased risk of AD, 63 and another recent study observed poorer cognitive performance among patients who were using metformin. 64 Incretin hormone receptor agonists, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, are a promising class of drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier 65 and have been shown to have beneficial effects in learning AD pathology within murine models. 66, 67 The effects of GLP-1 agonists on human cognition are currently unknown, but a clinical trial was recently completed (NCT01469351) that examined the effects of a 6-month treatment of liraglutide on b-amyloid deposition, as measured by 11 C-PiB in patients with AD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Over the past decade as we have struggled with increasing rates of T2D, neuroimaging has served as a critical tool for beginning to identify alterations in brain structure and function that may link T2D to AD. Volumetric studies have identified the impact of T2D on brain volume, and more powerful research scanners have begun to identify microstructural white matter abnormalities that will assist in understanding cognitive impairments that accompany T2D. Novel ligands such as 11 C-PiB now allow observation of b-amyloid in living tissue. Network analysis of brain activity identifies functional brain networks that illuminate how T2D affects activity across brain regions, which in turn contributes to cognitive dysfunction.\nThe coming decade will continue to build on these methods and findings, hopefully identifying interventions and strategies to slow or reverse cognitive and neurological dysfunction. Currently, a limited number of studies have utilized more advanced neuroimaging computational methods, such as graph theory, to more fully characterize patterns of change. Identifying how patterns of connectivity and activity change longitudinally, as well as in response to treatment, may provide critical insights into identifying biomarkers that can translate into clinical practice. No studies have yet implemented methodologies such as machine learning to identify alterations in activation patterns that may occur in T2D and serve as early markers of future cognitive impairment. Fortunately, a significant body of research has emerged utilizing these methods for early detection and potential clinical use of neuroimaging in AD. In the coming decade, as prevalence of T2D continues to increase and the population continues to age, it will be imperative to extend these methods to understand how T2D, cognitive impairment, age, and AD interact. Neuroimaging promises to extend our understanding of the mechanisms that link these factors and holds the potential to provide translational opportunities for intervention."}]
