[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is a significant clinical and public health problem due to its high prevalence and deleterious effects on maternal and offspring health [1]. Estimates from the United States are that nearly half (47.2%) of all pregnant women exceed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) GWG guidelines [2,3]. Women who enter pregnancy overweight or obese are at even greater risk for excessive GWG with nearly two-thirds exceeding recommendations [2]. These numbers are important when considering the majority of women in the United States aged 20-39 years are overweight or obese, and the prevalence is notably higher among African American women [4,5]. Excessive GWG is a consistent risk factor for postpartum weight retention [6][7][8][9], even up to 15 and 21 years postpartum [7]. Furthermore, excessive GWG increases a woman's risk for gestational diabetes [10], pregnancy-associated hypertension [11], and adverse birth outcomes such as cesarean delivery and large for gestational age infants [1,11]. Accumulating observational studies also show that higher GWG is associated with higher offspring weight and obesity [6,12,13]. Although pregnancy and postpartum are high-risk periods for the development of overweight and obesity [14,15], they are also times that afford unique opportunities for lifestyle behavior change due to women's frequent contact with health care providers and concern for their offspring's health. Behavioral interventions can increase the chance of achieving a healthy weight over the life course of both mother and child. Indeed, a recent Cochrane review concluded that diet, exercise, or combined interventions reduce the risk of excessive GWG and may reduce the risk of caesarean delivery, macrosomia, and neonatal respiratory morbidity [16]. Despite this positive review, notable gaps exist in the literature. Relatively few studies target GWG in overweight and obese pregnant women, and results are inconsistent [17][18][19]. Few intervention studies span both pregnancy and postpartum and include measures of offspring [20][21][22]. Evidence-based behavior change strategies are often not used. Few studies are adequately powered to test intervention effects within racial and are that the participant is 18-44 years of age, is white or Black/African American, can read and speak English, has no plan to move outside of the geographic area in next 18 months, is within first 16 weeks of pregnancy, and has a prepregnancy body mass index (BMI)\u226525 kg/m 2 and a prepregnancy weight\u2264370 pounds. In addition to OB/GYN clinics, flyers are posted in other locations in the greater Columbia, SC area, including a large pediatric clinic, university bulletin boards, local grocery stores, childcare centers, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) offices, Healthy Start offices, and other businesses commonly frequented by pregnant women. Study advertisements are also distributed through Craig's list, social media sites, such as Facebook, local parenting magazines, some of the participating clinics' websites, and some local events that are mainly targeting pregnant women or mothers with young infants. Interested women can complete the screening form on the study website or by telephone with study staff. Study staff attempt to contact all women who are initially eligible, based on the initial screening form responses, for a more comprehensive telephone screening. The main purpose of the telephone screening is to identify and exclude women with contraindications to exercise [34,35] and women who have substantial barriers that would preclude participation in the trial. Medical exclusions include uncontrolled blood pressure (>160 systolic or > 100 diastolic), use of insulin for diabetes, uncontrolled or untreated thyroid disease, hospitalization for a mental health or substance-abuse disorder in the past 6 months, multiple gestation, persistent bleeding in first trimester, history of more than 3 miscarriages, history of eating disorder or malnutrition, history of incompetent cervix, physical disabilities that prevent exercise, and physician advice to not exercise during pregnancy. Intervention-related exclusions are irregular or inconsistent access to a telephone and unwillingness to take part in weekly telephone calls. Modeled after Goldberg and Kiernan [36], women who remain eligible based on the telephone screening are also guided through an interview in which they explore the pros and cons of the two study arms, barriers to participation in each study arm, and potential solutions to barriers regarding participating in the two study arms of the trial. The purposes of this interview, based on principles of motivational interviewing, are to ensure that participants are fully informed about the two study arms and what they entail, have an opportunity to think through challenges they may experience related to participation, determine whether these challenges can be overcome, and explore any ambivalence they might have about participating. Women who remain eligible and interested after the telephone screening and motivational interview are scheduled for a baseline visit. The study enrolls women relatively early in pregnancy, and their health and pregnancy status may change as the pregnancy progresses. Therefore, at each measurement visit (two during pregnancy and two during postpartum), all participants are systematically screened for new symptoms or conditions since starting the program or since the participant's last study visit. In addition, if participants (irrespective of randomization group assignment) report a change in their health status at any other contacts besides measurement visits (e.g., phone calls, emails, letter to the study), a symptoms questionnaire is administered. Participants are withdrawn from the study if any of the following conditions occur: miscarriage, fetal loss, still birth, discovery of pregnancy with multiples after randomization, sudden death of newborn, or delivery before 32 weeks gestation. With approval of the principal investigators (PI), participants who develop a condition that necessitates bedrest or limiting of PA during pregnancy but can safely participate in postpartum intervention activities are able to remain in the study. Examples of such conditions include uncontrolled pregnancy-induced hypertension (>160 SBP or >100 DBP); diagnoses of preeclampsia or eclampsia, placenta previa, incompetent cervix, or postpartum cardiomyopathy; severe mental disorder that requires hospitalization; heart attack; surgical procedures; injuries that prohibit exercise; and evidence of intrauterine growth restriction. For participants in the intervention group who develop a contraindication to exercise, no PA content is included in intervention contacts during pregnancy, but nutrition content is delivered as appropriate. In addition, the participant continues with all postpartum intervention-related activities if her conditions are resolved and it is safe to resume moderate-intensity PA. Similarly, if a woman becomes pregnant again within the first year of her index pregnancy, she continues in the study but her data will not be included for any outcome where her pregnancy status may influence the measure (e.g., postpartum weight). All recruitment, enrollment, and retention data, including number of clinic screening forms completed, number of telephone screenings conducted, number of women eligible to participate, reasons for ineligibility, study visit completion rates (at each time point), and study withdrawals (by participant and by study), will be tracked in order to create a study flowchart consistent with CONSORT reporting guidelines [28]."}, {"section_title": "Randomization", "text": "A stratified randomization procedure with blocking is used to balance randomization within four intended delivery hospitals (two hospitals in Columbia, one hospital in Charleston, one hospital in Sumter) and two racial groups, which resulted in eight subsamples of eligible participants. If the intended delivery hospital is outside of these hospitals, the hospital that is geographically closest is selected. For every four participants within each subsample, two are randomized to the behavioral lifestyle intervention group and two to the standard care group. The study statistician conducted this randomization with a SAS program that generated an assignment list for each subsample noted above. The assignment lists are stored electronically, and the Program Manager selects the first available number sequentially on the list when randomizing a new participant. The participant ID, allocation assignment, and date of randomization are recorded. These lists can only be seen by the program manager, the study PIs, and the study statistician. Clinic staff, physicians, and measurement staff are blind to participant randomization. Randomization is done after the participant successfully completes all baseline measurement activities including the 2 nd dietary recall and wearing the activity monitor according to protocol."}, {"section_title": "Behavioral Lifestyle Intervention", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Intervention goals and theoretical framework-Consistent with guidelines for", "text": "pregnant women, [35,37,38] participants randomized to the behavioral lifestyle intervention are encouraged to accumulate 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity PA (e.g., brisk walking) and to eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and low in saturated and trans fats, while also balancing caloric intake to match but not exceed dietary needs for pregnancy and lactation. The MyPlate Daily Checklist for Moms (formerly Daily Food Plan for Moms) [39] is used to help participants select a balanced diet that incorporates the higher needs for some vitamins and minerals [38]. Customized calorie goals are provided. GWG goals are consistent with the 2009 IOM recommendations: 15-25 lbs for overweight and 11-20 lbs for obese women [3]. During the postpartum period, participants are encouraged to lose 1-3 lbs/wk. They also receive feedback regarding achieving a healthy BMI, although even modest weight loss affords health benefits [40]. Intervention contacts begin prior to 18 weeks gestation and continue through 6 months postpartum. Many interventions for non-pregnant populations start with frequent contacts that lessen over time. In pregnancy, barriers to lifestyle change may increase over time; thus, intervention contacts occur weekly or biweekly. All intervention components are grounded in Social Cognitive Theory [41] but are tailored to the unique needs, interests, and barriers of pregnant and postpartum women. Formative work [42,43] as well as the published body of literature in this area [44] guided our tailoring. The intervention helps participants learn to use behavioral skills and knowledge; self-regulate (set goals, self-monitor, problem solve, and use reinforcement); employ stimulus control strategies to prompt healthier choices; seek out social support; increase self-efficacy through setting and reaching progressive and attainable goals; identify high-risk situations and coping strategies; and prepare for and cope with setbacks. These strategies, while shown to be effective in changing PA and dietary intake in adults in general [45], have rarely been employed in combination in studies of pregnant and postpartum women, which could explain the modest weight outcomes in the literature [19,27]. Frequent self-monitoring of PA, diet, and weight is strongly encouraged, as self-monitoring is positively associated with behavioral adherence [45][46][47][48]. Selfmonitoring behavior is promoted through the use of bathroom scales (provided to participants) with GWG and postpartum weight loss tracking graphs, pedometers, and weekly paper logs. The paper logs include space for participants to record two behavioral goals for healthy eating and PA, and to indicate for each day (across seven days), whether that goal was met, not met, or partially met. The paper logs also ask participants to record their pedometer steps, minutes of exercise, and weight each day."}, {"section_title": "Intervention components-", "text": "The intervention is comprised of two in-depth counseling sessions (one each in early pregnancy and early postpartum), weekly or biweekly telephone counseling, behavioral podcasts with accompanying educational handouts, and a private Facebook group."}, {"section_title": "In-depth counseling sessions:", "text": "Most of the in-depth pregnancy counseling sessions take place in-person, although telephone sessions are provided for those participants who live too far away from the study office. The counseling session is the first intervention contact during pregnancy, typically lasts one hour, and occurs prior to 18 weeks gestation (and typically substantially earlier). The study interventionist provides feedback regarding the participant's dietary intake and PA (based on baseline dietary recalls and SenseWear armbands, described later). MyPlate Daily Checklist for Moms is used to support nutrition content, including calorie and food goals. Supertracker, a tool on the choosemyplate website, provides caloric needs based on the participant's age, sex, level of physical activity, height, pre-pregnancy weight, and due date. Each participant receives a personalized dietary report (includes participant data along with dietary guidelines), a personalized PA report (e.g., daily and average steps, minutes of PA, sleep, and sedentary time), and a personalized weight gain tracking graph. The weight gain tracking graph contains upper and lower recommended weight gain lines drawn over time so that participants can plot their weight each week and see how it compares to their target weight gain. The interventionist helps the participant set an initial dietary and PA goal based on an area in which current behavior is not in line with study goals and clinical recommendations. Participants receive a binder of study handouts referenced in the podcasts and discussed during pregnancy calls 1 to 10, a pedometer for tracking PA, and a bathroom scale for regular self-monitoring of weight. In postpartum, many of the in-depth counseling sessions occur in the participants' homes, but they are also provided in the study office or by telephone to accommodate participant preferences. This session takes place 6 to 8 weeks postpartum and lasts approximately one hour. The session focuses on setting goals for gradually resuming PA, meeting nutritional needs during postpartum, the benefits of breastfeeding for weight reduction, how nutritional needs are affected by breastfeeding, calorie targets for weight loss based on postpartum weight, and strategies for losing 1-3 lbs/wk. MyPlate Daily Checklist for Moms is used to support nutrition content. Supertracker, as described earlier, provides caloric needs based on the participant's age, sex, level of physical activity, height, postpartum weight, breastfeeding status, and the goal of promoting healthy weight loss. Similar to the GWG graph, all participants receive a personalized weight loss tracking graph that includes the upper (3 lbs/wk) and lower (1 lb/wk) bounds of recommended weight loss over time for six months. If this postpartum counseling session is conducted in the participant's home, the interventionist offers to do a kitchen tour and provides advice regarding food choices."}, {"section_title": "Telephone counseling:", "text": "Our formative work [43] indicated that women desired group intervention sessions. Initially, the study included 10 weekly group sessions that began immediately following the in-person counseling session. However, due to the challenges in recruiting an adequate number of women at one time to form a group and the less-than-ideal attendance at sessions, a protocol change was made very early in the study to replace these 10 group sessions with 10 individual telephone counseling calls, allowing for rolling recruitment. When the protocol was changed from group sessions to telephone counseling, all of the content was retained; just the mode of delivery changed. Only one intervention group was conducted (n=6). Each of the first 10 pregnancy telephone counseling calls lasts approximately 20 minutes. If a call is missed, the interventionist completes a makeup call where the content from two calls is combined in a longer call. Each call begins with a \"weigh-in\" where the participant reports her weight using the study-provided scale. She is encouraged to graph her weight on the weight gain tracking graph provided during the in-depth counseling session. The interventionist also plots the current weight on the HIPP copy of the weight gain graph. A discussion of where the participant's weight gain stands relative to the IOM GWG recommendations takes place. In the first call, detailed information regarding exercise safety and warning signs during pregnancy is provided. In each subsequent call, participants are asked about any changes in their pregnancy and/or health status. Responses are documented and one of the study PIs is notified of any potential increased health risk. The medical monitor is consulted as needed. Each call then includes didactic information and discussion, and the interventionist refers to handouts in the participant's binder that correspond with the content (these handouts are also emailed to the participant each week). The call content is also complementary to the content in the podcast (described in a later section). Participants earn a small incentive (e.g., cookbook, baby products) each week if they complete the counseling call and listen to the podcast. Each call emphasizes at least one key behavioral strategy (e.g., goal setting) that is applied to PA and healthy eating. Calls are interactive, supportive, and engaging. Table 1 presents the call topics and behavioral strategies for each of the 10 weeks. When the first 10 pregnancy calls end, participants receive shorter weekly or biweekly counseling calls (depending on their preference) throughout their pregnancy. The calls include a \"weigh-in,\" assessment of changes in their pregnancy and/or health status, discussion of progress toward PA and healthy eating goals set in the previous call, problemsolving regarding barriers to reaching goals when needed, and PA and healthy eating goal setting for the next week. More frequent calls or the provision of additional resources can be provided for participants who are having difficulty reaching study goals. After a participant delivers her baby, the interventionist calls the participant weekly for very brief check-in calls; weight, PA, and healthy eating topics are not discussed. After the participant's postpartum counseling session (at 6-8 weeks postpartum) and through 6 months postpartum, biweekly counseling calls are initiated to focus on postpartum weight loss. The structure of the calls is the same as the brief pregnancy counseling calls. Each telephone call is audio-recorded (after consent of the participant in writing at the time of study consent, and verbally before each call start) to aid in supervision and monitoring of quality assurance."}, {"section_title": "Behavioral podcasts:", "text": "Participants receive 10 behavioral podcasts during pregnancy and 16 during postpartum. Prior to each of the first 10 pregnancy calls, the participant is emailed (or sent via text message) a link to the corresponding podcast, and is also emailed the handouts for that week's call (also included in her binder). The email includes a summary sheet that lists each handout, anything that should be done prior to the call, a place to record questions for the interventionist, and a reminder of the incentive for completing the call and listening to the podcast for that week. The pregnancy podcasts, which parallel the content of the first 10 in-depth telephone counseling calls, provide information on recommended weight gain in pregnancy, healthy eating, and PA through intervention dialog and an audio blog of two pregnant women attempting healthy weight gain. One voice is of an African American woman and the other of a white woman. Podcasts average 21 minutes in duration (range: [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] and contain an introduction and review of the previous week's topic, an audio blog, nutrition and PA information, inclusion of a behavioral strategy, and goal setting. The structure of these podcasts was based on previous work that found podcasts effective for producing weight loss in non-pregnant adults [49,50]. Beginning at 4 weeks postpartum, 16 weekly podcasts are delivered to participants. These podcasts follow the 16 core Diabetes Prevention Program sessions [40]. The content was tailored, as necessary, to take into account the unique barriers and motivators for postpartum women (e.g., fatigue, childcare needs, breastfeeding). These podcasts emphasize gradual weight loss (1-3 lbs/wk), achieving 150 minutes/wk of PA, and eating a healthy diet within energy intake limits. An audio blog of two new moms attempting weight loss is used. The women in the postpartum podcasts are different than those in the pregnancy podcasts, although one voice is still of an African American woman and the other of a white woman. Podcasts average 20 minutes in duration (range: [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] and contain an introduction and review of the previous week's topic, audio blog, nutrition and exercise information, a behavioral strategy, and goal setting. For both pregnancy and postpartum podcasts, the participant is required to enter an ID and personal initials to download the podcast from a private website, which allows the study to track whether the participant clicked on that week's podcast. Midway through the week, reminder emails and texts are sent to participants who have not yet accessed the weekly podcast. Podcast links remain valid for the duration of the study, but participants are advised to listen to the podcasts in order of delivery as the storylines build throughout the episodes. Participants who are unable to listen to podcasts on a computer or a smartphone are mailed a copy of the audio podcast on a CD each week. Boomerang for Gmail (https:// www.boomeranggmail.com/) was used to schedule weekly delivery of podcast emails and reminders."}, {"section_title": "Private Facebook group:", "text": "Participants are encouraged to join a private HIPP Facebook group for pregnant participants during the in-depth pregnancy counseling session, and a private HIPP Facebook group for postpartum participants during the in-depth postpartum counseling session. During the postpartum in-depth counseling session (6-8 weeks postpartum), participants are removed from the HIPP pregnancy group and transitioned to the HIPP postpartum Facebook group. The private postpartum Facebook group continues through 6 months postpartum. The Facebook groups allow study participants to provide support to and receive support from other pregnant/postpartum women, and they are another vehicle for delivering messages and resources that reinforce intervention content. Intervention staff post one message per day (Monday through Friday) that reinforces behavioral skills, weight regulation (pregnancy), modest weight loss (postpartum), PA, and/or diet. Intervention staff view Facebook daily to ensure posts by participants are appropriate. Staff also respond to participant posts to encourage posting behavior. There are five categories of posts (corresponding to each day of the week): (1) recipes, meal suggestions, or local sales; (2) pregnancy or postpartum health and safety; (3) tips or suggestions (e.g., baby care, parenting, exercise, nutrition); (4) links to exercise videos; and (5) victory related to health goal (not focused on weight). These categories were selected based on previous work that used Facebook to engage participants during weight loss interventions [51,52]. Facebook content for both pregnancy and postpartum is posted on a continuous cycle, but there is enough content to prevent it from being repeated for any given participant. Because the study uses rolling enrollment (and not cohorts), the content is not matched to gestational age or weeks postpartum. The posts were designed to be appropriate regardless of gestational age (for the pregnancy Facebook group) or postpartum weeks (for the postpartum Facebook group). Posts are prescheduled using Hootsuite (https://hootsuite.com/)."}, {"section_title": "Standard care", "text": "Participants in the standard care group attend regularly scheduled clinic visits with their prenatal care providers, which typically occur monthly until 28 weeks gestation, biweekly from 28-36 weeks gestation, weekly from 36 weeks gestation until delivery, and at 6 weeks postpartum. Participants receive standard nutrition counseling provided by physicians, nurses, nutritionists, and counselors from the WIC program (if applicable). This counseling typically emphasizes a well-balanced diet and advice to take a multivitamin/iron supplement. Participants are weighed by nurses at each clinic visit but weight graphs are not provided as part of the standard care materials. To enhance retention and keep participants engaged in the study, the standard care group receives study mailings and podcasts. Study mailings, six each in pregnancy and postpartum, are sent monthly. Each mailing includes a cover letter and a commercially available educational material. During pregnancy, the mailings begin two weeks after randomization and focus on tips for a healthy pregnancy and on fetal development. During postpartum, mailings begin four weeks after delivery and focus on infant development. None of the mailings at either period include discussions of weight, PA, or diet (except for foods to avoid in pregnancy for safety reasons). Parallel to the intervention participants, standard care participants also receive 10 weekly podcasts during pregnancy and 16 weekly podcasts during postpartum that are similar in duration (pregnancy podcasts average 28 minutes, range: 17-39 minutes; postpartum podcasts average 22 minutes, range: 14-33 minutes) and identical in frequency and timing to the intervention group (see section 2.4.2.3). All podcasts are commercially available, do not include discussions of weight, PA, or diet (except for food safety issues), and focus on having a healthy pregnancy, fetal and infant development, and parenting. Participants who listen to at least 9 of the 10 podcasts receive a small incentive (e.g., baby wipes and bibs)."}, {"section_title": "Outcome evaluation", "text": "All participants are assessed at baseline (\u226416 weeks gestation), 32 weeks gestation, and 6 and 12 months postpartum. By default, all measurement visits occur at the university unless the participant expresses difficulty coming to the university and prefers to complete the visit in her home or at the prenatal clinic she attends. At each assessment, research staff obtains physical measurements (maternal weight, height, and blood pressure) and conducts interviewer-administrated questionnaires. Participants complete one dietary recall at the visit and complete the second dietary call on a random day after her visit within a week. Participants receive a SenseWear armband that assesses PA to wear for eight consecutive days after the visit. At the 6-and 12-month postpartum visits, several anthropometric measures are also taken with the infants. A description of the primary outcome, secondary outcomes, and potential mediating variable measures and citations for validity and reliability are presented in Table 2.

Self-reported pre-pregnancy weight is highly correlated with measured weights (\u22650.95), and the correlation is higher if collected in early pregnancy [53,54]. Weight at delivery is abstracted from medical records after delivery.

Race will be considered as a potential confounder for all the analyses except those addressing our third aim (focused on examining race differences), and included where needed. Because many covariates are measured at multiple time points, the covariates used as independent variables are either those prior to or concurrent with the respective outcome variable. For 6-month postpartum weight retention, we will first conduct analyses with available data. We will then use a conservative approach of carrying forward the last measurement (e.g., weight at delivery) in instances of missing data, thus assuming no change in the outcome of interest. We also will explore patterns of weight gain and weight retention by considering multiple weight measures from pre-pregnancy or baseline, to postpartum measures. To examine our third aim, which focuses on racial differences for the various outcomes, we will first examine the interaction between race and group assignment. If the interaction term is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, we will consider the four intervention/racial groups as a single variable.

More emphasis will be placed in analyses on the sensor-measured PA because it is a more objective measure and not prone to recall biases. The self-report PA measure will offer additional information about the type of PA performed in our sample. The SenseWear Armband contains a 2-axis accelerometer and four sensors to assess PA (including steps), energy expenditure, sleep, and total wear time. It has been validated, including in pregnant women [55][56][57]. Steps per day and minutes per week spent in moderate-to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) will be the main indicators of PA. Participants are instructed to wear the armband on their upper left arm over the triceps muscle for eight consecutive days (24 hours/day) and to only remove it for showers/baths, water activities, and monitor cleaning. They are instructed to record in a log when they remove or put on the monitor each day. Study staff call participants on the 2 nd and 5 th day to remind them to wear the device, answer any questions they have, and remind them to mail back the armbands. After the 8-day wearing period is over, the participants mail back the device and its accessories in a pre-paid envelope. In order to be enrolled (baseline) and receive the full study incentive (subsequent visits), the participant must wear the armband continuously for at least 5 days, including at least one weekend day, and the monitor must be worn on those 5 days for at least 21 hours/day. Participants are given the opportunity to rewear the monitor if they do not comply with the protocol or if there is an equipment issue.

Participants rate the extent to which each item describes them from (1) does not describe, (3) describes moderately, to (5) describes completely. Self-regulation for diet was assessed using a 22-item scale from the HealthStyles survey [79].

A Microsoft Access database was developed to track the delivery of all intervention activities to each participant (see Section 2.4). Thus, activities are tracked at the individual level, and type of data captured include not only the delivery of the activity, but where applicable, the duration of the activity (e.g., telephone call), information reported by the participant (e.g., weight, major barriers), and progress notes from the interventionist. All intervention counseling calls are audio-recorded. These audio recordings are used to review the quality of delivery, provide feedback to interventionists, and train new interventionists. A subsample of calls will be selected for review to ensure the inclusion of essential elements. For both the pregnancy and postpartum Facebook groups, we will capture the number of \"likes,\" responses to polls, and participant posts. If staffing allows, the nature of these posts (e.g., type of support provided) will also be coded. For both the intervention and standard care groups, the date each podcast was sent and whether the participant logged on to private website and downloaded each podcast is tracked. For standard care participants, the date each mailing was sent is tracked.

We are promoting healthy eating, active living, and appropriate weight gain that are endorsed and recommended by groups such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology [35,37,38]. In our feasibility study, no participants reported adverse outcomes associated with participation [43]. Potential participants are closely screened and those with health conditions that would be contraindicated for participation in our intervention activities in general or specific to pregnancy are excluded from the study. These exclusion criteria are based on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for pregnancy and ACOG guidelines [34,35]. Intervention contacts emphasize the safety of participants by promoting the idea of \"going at one's own pace\" and \"starting low and going slow.\" Participants receive information about exercise safety and warning symptoms. Participants who are breastfeeding are given special attention to ensure that they are obtaining adequate caloric and nutrient intake. Intervention staff consult with the medical director in instances where there is concern for the participant's safety. Referrals are made to the federal (e.g., WIC) or other local food assistance programs if participants experience food insecurity, and those with elevated levels of pregnancy or postpartum depression receive feedback on their elevated score, encouragement to consult with their health care provider regarding their symptoms, and crisis referral numbers. All participants (irrespective of randomization group assignment) complete a questionnaire of symptoms and significant medical conditions that the participants experienced since joining HIPP study or since their last visit. This form is completed at the 32-week visit and at the 6-and 12-month postpartum visits. It is also completed if a significant health issue is raised during an intervention or standard care contact outside of the measurement visit. Adverse events forms are completed and reviewed by the medical director in instances where the participant reports any of the following: heart attack, broken bone, torn ligament, fall requiring medical attention, any hospitalization, doctor-ordered bedrest, miscarriage, or still birth. Adverse events that are unexpected (nature, severity, or frequency) and related or possibly related to participation in the research are reported to the Institutional Review Boards."}, {"section_title": "Sample size justification", "text": "The primary study outcome is total GWG (lbs). Effect size estimates and standard deviations for the proposed study came from the 2009 SC birth certificates for overweight/obese African American and overweight/obese white women after adjustment for pre-pregnancy BMI. Because weight at delivery is determined by medical record abstraction, we anticipate nearly complete data for the primary outcome. With the planned sample size of 400 women, and assuming a two-sided \u03b1=0.05, we have greater than 80% power to detect a 4.5 lbs difference in total GWG between intervention and standard care participants, corresponding to a small effect size of 0.28. We anticipate that the power will be greater (or the detectable difference smaller at 80% power) because of reduced variability when controlling for other factors. Assuming 90%, 80%, and 70% completion of measurements at 32 weeks, and 6 and 12 months postpartum, with our planned sample size, we have 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 0.60 for exceeding the IOM recommendation, that is, if 52% of standard care women exceed the IOM recommendation (SC 2009 birth certificate data), we would expect only 39% of women in the intervention to exceed the recommendation. We also have at least 80% power to detect small to medium effect sizes (d = 0.28 to d = 0.34) [92,93] for each of the other continuous secondary outcomes. For examining race differences in our primary and secondary outcomes, we have to take into account expected means in each of the four groups (African American standard care, African American intervention, White standard care, White intervention). We estimate that effects will be twice as favorable in Whites as compared to African Americans. A sample size of 400 would provide 64% power to detect a small effect size for our primary outcome of interest (GWG). For the other study outcomes, there is 52% to 75% power to detect small to medium effect sizes. Data for power and effect size calculations come from the 2009 SC birth certificates data (weight gain), our feasibility data (PA and caloric intake), and other literature for weight retention, black/white differences, postpartum depression scores, and WFL z-score [15,54,94,95]."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Intent-to-treat analyses will be used to examine differences in all outcomes for the intervention and standard care groups."}, {"section_title": "Primary outcome-", "text": "We plan to conduct analyses of variance (ANOVA) for total weight gain (primary outcome), with total weight gain (continuous outcome) as the dependent variable and group membership plus potential confounding variables as independent variables.

MacKinnon et al.'s [96,97] product of coefficients approach will be used to test for the indirect effects of each hypothesized mediator (noted earlier and described in section 2.6.3) on these primary and selected secondary outcomes. To assess the magnitude of the effect for each potential mediator, asymmetric confidence limits based on the distribution of the product (\u03b1 and \u03b2 coefficients) will be constructed using the PRODCLIN program [97]. This method considers the non-normal distribution of the mediated effect by constructing upper and lower confidence limits based on the distribution of the product of two normal random variables. This approach has been shown to be more powerful than other analytic approaches in simulation studies [96,98]."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Half of all women of childbearing age are overweight or obese [4,99]. Obesity and excessive GWG put women and their offspring at risk, both in pregnancy and in later life [1,7,12,100,101]. The resultant health services costs for pregnant women and their offspring are considerable [102,103]. Thus, the rising prevalence of maternal overweight/obesity and excessive GWG poses a serious public health concern. Preventing excessive GWG to optimize maternal, fetal, and infant well-being is of great importance. The HIPP study is significant because of its focus on evaluating the effectiveness of a behavioral lifestyle intervention program on reducing excessive weight gain during pregnancy and promoting postpartum weight loss among overweight/obese women. There are a number of unique and innovative aspects of this trial. First, it is theoretically-grounded and based on formative work [42,43], using evidence-based behavior change strategies [45] delivered through traditional intervention channels (i.e., in-person and telephone-based) along with more innovative intervention channels (i.e., podcasts and social media support). Intervention messages are thus tailored to women from a southeastern state with poor maternal and child health indicators [32]. Second, the intervention fully targets PA in addition to healthy eating. Third, it includes state-of-the-art measures including staffassessed weight at multiple points during pregnancy and during the first year after delivery, objectively measured PA, 24-hour dietary recalls, and rich data on psychosocial factors, biomedical and environmental factors related to weight gain and behavioral lifestyles. This rich source of data will be useful to evaluate the impacts of our trial on primary and secondary outcomes as well as to identify possible pathways. Fourth, our study population is unique in that we include racially diverse women who are overweight or obese. Prior studies are modestly effective in helping this high-risk group to decrease total weight gain during pregnancy [19,25,27], limiting our ability to translate interventions to reduce the proportion of women gaining above IOM's recommended amount. To our knowledge, no studies have paid attention to the possible differential effectiveness of the trial in white and African American women. Fifth, the HIPP study spans from early pregnancy to one year postpartum. Pregnancy is a critical time when women are open for health messages and willing to adopt healthy behaviors. Yet women in this life stage also have barriers for them to effectively adopt healthy lifestyles. Thus, by emphasizing the maintenance of healthy behaviors and weight management skills after delivery, this study has the potential to improve long-term health outcomes for these high-risk women, which can be translated to better health outcomes for their offspring and the family as a whole. Finally, by including offspring measures of weight and adiposity, we can further examine the intervention's effect on offspring's adiposity, an important contribution as much of the research examining maternal weight in relation to offspring adiposity to date is based on observational studies [13]. There are limitations in the research design that should be noted. First, based on our formative work, women expressed a preference for a group-based intervention delivery. Thus, the original intervention included two in-person sessions, 10 group sessions, telephone counseling, podcasts, and Facebook support. Due to the hardship of forming a group of about 10 women in a timely fashion, the need to start weight gain monitoring in early pregnancy, and prospective participant and enrolled participants' unwillingness to come to the group session, we had to replace the 10 group sessions with individual telephone sessions (content remained the same). Second, due to the somewhat intensive nature of the intervention and long follow-up duration, we may not enroll women representative of the population of pregnant women. Instead, we may be biased toward enrolling more educated women with fewer barriers, such as transportation. Third, and related, we are enrolling from several towns and cities in South Carolina, and our recruitment is limited to African American and white women. Thus, our findings may not generalize to other regions of the United States (and beyond) and to other racial and ethnic groups. In spite of these limitations, the HIPP study is innovative and the findings from the study will be helpful to examine the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention in a racially diverse sample of pregnant women. Given that the intervention is theory-based, targets both diet and PA, offers weight gain graphs, provides individualized plans, and is tailored for the unique needs and barriers to behavioral changes for pregnant and postpartum women living in South Carolina, our behavioral lifestyle intervention program provides an important opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of such an intervention on preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, promoting weight loss after delivery, and advancing positive physical health for the mothers and their offspring. \u2022 Berntsen et al [57] \u2022 Craig et al [58] "}]
