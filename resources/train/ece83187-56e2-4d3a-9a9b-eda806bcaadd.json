[{"section_title": "", "text": "Our role as a provider of innovative data products was substantially enhanced in 2008 with the move of the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program to CES. Through the unique federal-state Local Employment Dynamics partnership, LEHD maintains a nearly universal quarterly national job frame (quarterly observations of workers linked to employers) based on state administrative records linked to census, survey, and other administrative data housed at the Census Bureau. From this, LEHD produces several public-use products including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and OnTheMap, which is described in more detail in Chapter 2 of this report. This past year also saw the introduction of the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS), a public-use product developed from CES's confi dential Longitudinal Business Database. Chapter 3 contains more information on the rich information about life cycle dynamics of U.S. businesses contained in the BDS. The existence of these popular products owes much to perhaps the most crucial function CES plays within the U.S. federal statistical system-providing secure and authorized researcher access to confi dential statistical microdata. Results obtained by researchers working at CES and the Census Bureau's RDCs, some dating as far back as the 1980s, inspired and informed the development of the QWI, OnTheMap, BDS, and other products. In fact, much of the current research on enhancing and developing these and other new products is carried out in the RDCs. The RDCs are operated as joint partnerships between the Census Bureau and leading research institutions. Through the RDCs, researchers with approved projects can access the Census Bureau's rich data infrastructure. The RDCs are a cost-eff ective way for the Census Bureau to leverage internal resources. Using RDCs significantly enhances its analytical and methodological capabilities by accessing external expertise. An excellent example of the benefi ts of accessing external expertise is given in Chapter 4 of this report. Chapter 4 describes methods to improve income distribution statistics generated from the Current Population Survey. Additional examples of the research conducted through the RDC network are given in this and previous CES Annual Reports and on our Web site <www.ces.census.gov>. Our RDC partners benefi t through their ability to provide their faculty and students with an unparalleled resource for applied social science research. More and more, we see RDCs used to attract talented faculty to universities with access to a RDC. I am pleased to report that the RDC network will soon be adding two nodes. First, we will be establishing a new RDC at the University of Minnesota. Second, the RDC at the University of California at Berkeley will open a branch lab at Stanford University. Branch RDCs are a new development. They are satellites of existing RDCs and share resources with the primary RDC. Branches are to be located near a signifi cant number of users and potential users that face signifi cant costs in commuting to the existing RDC, but close enough to the existing RDC to permit sharing resources, such as faculty advisors and RDC administrators. Branch RDCs are one way that the Census Bureau and its RDC partners strive to expand authorized access while keeping costs low. Finally, I want to thank all those who contributed to this report. First and foremost, I want to thank B.K. Atrostic and Cheryl Grim, who compiled and edited nearly all the material in the report. I thank also the many other contributors, from both within and outside the Census Bureau, listed in the acknowledgments section of the inside cover page. The challenges facing our nation require high-quality information about its economy and people. A key Census Bureau objective is: \"Meet the needs of policymakers, businesses, nonprofi t organizations, and the public for current measures of the U.S. population, economy, and governments\" (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007).

For confi dentiality reasons, the U.S. Census Bureau topcodes each of the 24 sources of income (11 income sources prior to 1988) in the public-use CPS. However, this topcoding-the suppression of income values above some level in the public-use CPS data for confi dentiality reasonshas not been consistent over time. Below we discuss a new set of papers that off er a solution to this problem using a series of created values, which, when used together with the public-use CPS data, will closely approximate income and inequality levels and their trends based on the internal CPS."}, {"section_title": "THE PROBLEM", "text": "Unsystematic topcoding in the public-use CPS data inconsistently restricts the ability of researchers to fully capture income and its distribution over time. Thus, researchers using scalar inequality measures such as the Gini coeffi cient with the public-use CPS will unsystematically understate both levels and trends in income inequality. In Figure 4-1, we compare the Gini coeffi cients using the topcoded public-use March CPS data with those obtained using the internal CPS data. The Public-Unadjusted series is the Gini calculated from the public-use March CPS data exactly as it is provided by the Census Bureau with no adjustments made for topcoding. Similarly, the Internal-Unadjusted series is the Gini calculated from the internal March CPS data with no adjustments made to the data. Prior to 1995, the Census Bureau reported topcoded incomes as equal to the topcode threshold, which reduced the observed income of all topcoded individuals. Using the topcode threshold led to a substantial understatement in the level of inequality and distorted the trends in inequality. Starting in 1995, the Census Bureau began providing cell means-the mean of all topcoded values for each income source-which, as can be seen in Figure 4-1, allows researchers using the Public-Unadjusted CPS data to closely match results from the internal CPS data after 1995. Unfortunately, researchers interested in longer-term income trends have largely ignored this valuable information because cell means were not available for prior years. Instead, many researchers have simply recoded topcoded incomes as equal to the topcode threshold or have opted to use relatively simple measures of inequality, such as the 90/10 ratio, to attempt to avoid topcoding problems. However, Burkhauser, Feng, and Jenkins (2009) show that even researchers using inequality measures, such as the 90/10 ratio, run the risk of understating income inequality. This is because even individuals whose total household size-adjusted income is relatively modest and hence below the 90th percentile may have one or more topcoded sources of household income. Here we discuss how newly available information that we created about the means and variances of top incomes from the internal CPS data can be used in conjunction with publicuse CPS data to largely remedy the problems resulting from inconsistent topcoding. Using the extended cell mean series from Larrimore et al. (2008) and the variances of topcoded incomes from Burkhauser, Feng, and Larrimore (2008), it is now possible to better capture the top part of the income distribution with public-use CPS data and closely replicate results found using the internal CPS data used by the Census Bureau for producing their offi cial inequality statistics (U.S. Census Bureau, various years).

Thus, in Larrimore et al. 2008we accessed internal CPS data and used it to calculate and distribute a cell mean series to the public going back to 1975. We also show that using this series will greatly improve the ability of researchers using only the public-use CPS to capture the top part of the income distribution. A cell mean more accurately captures the level of unobserved income for a given source of income in the public-use CPS data but does not provide information about its distribution. Therefore, in Burkhauser, Feng, and Larrimore (2008), we also calculate and distribute to the research community the variances of topcoded incomes for each source of income in the internal CPS. By using information on both mean and variance, it is possible to impute diff erent total household income values for each topcoded individual in the public-use CPS data. While doing so, in general, will not match an individual's actual income, it will allow the resulting distribution of income to more accurately match the distribution found in the internal CPS. Below we report how we have used both our cell mean and variance series to better estimate income and its distribution using public-use CPS data. Burkhauser et al. (2008) analyze levels and trends in inequality, using Gini coeffi cients between 1975 and 2004 derived from the internal CPS, and compare them with estimates from several series derived from the publicuse CPS. The series and their sources (internal or public-use data) are described in Table 4-1.  1998 1996 1994 1992 1990 1988 1986 1984 1982 1980 1978 1976 1975 Figure 4-2, taken from Burkhauser et al. (2008), shows that those who simply use the unadjusted public-use CPS (Public-Unadjusted) will fi nd income inequality jumps dramatically between 1994 and 1995; i.e., the Gini value increases from 0.395 to 0.422, a single year change far greater than in any prior or subsequent year. An increase in the topcode threshold as well as the use of Census Bureau derived cell mean values for all values above the topcode threshold caused this jump. Using the unadjusted internal CPS (Internal-Unadjusted), we fi nd no such increase between 1994 and 1995. Rather, what is happening is that prior to 1995, the Public-Unadjusted CPS Gini values substantially understate income inequality because they fail to fully account for income values above the topcodes. Once the Census Bureau provided the mean value of all these topcoded values, the now more precise Public-Unadjusted CPS Gini values match the higher Internal-Unadjusted Gini values. Failure to account for this change in methodology will grossly overstate U.S. inequality increases before and after 1994-1995."}, {"section_title": "CREATING MORE CONSISTENT MEASURES OF TRENDS IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME INEQUALITY", "text": "Simply ignoring Census Bureau mean values after 1994, as can be seen in the Public-NoMean Gini series, will not solve this problem.

In contrast, when we use the public-use CPS together with our extended mean series (Public-Mean) in Figure 4-2, we come much closer to matching the Internal-Unadjusted Gini values in every year.

To both control for inconsistent censoring and capture the missing part of the internal CPS data, we use a multiple imputation approach in which, for each year, outof-sample values for topcoded observations in the internal CPS are imputed based on lower insample values that we do have. Unsurprisingly, as can also be seen in Figure 4-2, we fi nd that compared to estimates derived from our multiple imputation approach (Internal-Adjusted), all the other series understate the level of inequality in all years. However, just as was the case for our Public-Mean series and the Internal-Unadjusted series it replicated, the Internal-Adjusted series reveals the same trendsan increase in inequality over the entire period 1975-2004 but with a rate of increase noticeably lower after 1993 compared to before 1993. In each series, average inequality increases much more prior to 1992 than after 1993. In addition, in each series, the jump in 1992-1993 is far higher than in any other period. This is consistent with the argument that a change in the measurement of inequality rather than a real change in inequality is its cause. To further test our Internal-Adjusted series, we compared our results to those derived by Piketty and Saez (2003) using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administrative fi les. We did so by comparing our estimates of the share of income held by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population to that found by Piketty and Saez (2003). As can be seen in Figure 4-3, we fi nd that these two estimates of the income share held by the top 90th-95th percentiles and the 95th-99th percentiles have remarkably similar levels and trends, especially given that our income units diff er as we are observing household income while they are observing the adjusted gross income of tax units.

Burkhauser and Larrimore (2008 and forthcoming) demonstrate that not correcting for topcoding in the public-use CPS can also distort the size of the earnings gap across subsets of the population. This includes the gap in mean labor earnings between individuals by sex, race, education level, and disability statuses. Researchers using the public-use CPS data without our cell mean series will understate the mean labor earnings of each of these population groups. However, because there are more males than females with topcoded earnings, even consistent topcoding will suppress a larger percentage of male earnings, thus understating the male-female earnings gap. Similarly, White, highly educated, and nondisabled individuals are topcoded at higher rates than Black, less-educated, and disabled individuals, respectively, resulting in an understatement of the race, education, and disability earnings gaps by those using the public-use CPS.  1998 1996 1994 1992 1990 1988 1986 1984 1982 1980 1978 1976 1975 IRS 90-95th share As was the case in our income inequality comparisons above, using cell means largely corrects for these topcoding-based problems in the public-use CPS.

Burkhauser, Feng, and Larrimore (2008), using variance information from the internal CPS, move beyond imputing the same value for all topcoded individuals. They use a multiple imputation approach to create a distribution for the public-use CPS with the same mean and variance of topcoded incomes found in the internal CPS.

Since the Public-NoMean compresses the distribution by assigning all topcoded individuals' income equal to the topcode threshold, it is not surprising that this series understates the log-variance seen in the internal data. Using the Public-Mean series results in log-variance of income increases since it more accurately captures the level of topcoded income.

However, failure to control for inconsistent topcoding in the public-use CPS will lead researchers to understate the levels of U.S. average income and income inequality as well as distort their trends over time. The series of papers discussed here, based on our ability to access internal CPS data, estimate and distribute the mean and variance of topcoded income values for each income source in these data. Researchers using our cell mean and variance values together with the public-use CPS data can now closely approximate income and inequality levels and their trends based on the internal CPS. It is still important to consider internal censoring when using these data, especially when observing trends across 1992-1993. However, without making out-of-sample predictions about incomes censored in the internal data, these are the best estimates available. Moreover, they will be nearly as accurate as the offi cial Census Bureau statistics that are published each year based on the internal CPS (U.S. Census Bureau, various years). The 1990 decennial census data fi les also were updated. Record layouts and variable names are now consistent with the 1970 and 1980 fi les, and some minor problems with the previous version are corrected. The complete-count fi les include basic demographic and housing information for all individuals and households at the time of enumeration.

Using internal data, researchers can construct boundaries in each year that are consistent with the original or the expanded city.
