Carriers of the 4 allele have an increased risk of developing for AD compared to with people who are homozygous for the 3 allele (the most common APOE genotype) . An important observation that tends to be overlooked is that this APOE effect varies with gender. Women are more likely to develop AD than men across most ages and APOE genotypes , but this difference is significantly more pronounced in persons with the APOE 3/4 genotype; women with the APOE 3/4 genotype are at approximately fourfold increased risk, but men with it show little to no increased risk (Payami et al., 1996; Farrer et al., 1997; Bretsky et al., 1999) . In addition to having an increased risk for AD, female 4 carriers with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD, also express more prominent phenotypic features than their male counterparts, such as lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive scores (Fleisher et al., 2005) . A large autopsy series found that female 4 carriers also had the greatest amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology (Corder et al., 2004) . To date, this interaction between gender and APOE status, evident in AD risk, MCI phenotypes, and postmortem data, has not been explored in vivo in healthy older subjects.\nPrevious resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that functional connectivity changes in the default mode network (DMN) in MCI (Sorg et al., 2007) and AD (Greicius et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2009 ) and that this default mode functional connectivity deteriorates as the disease progresses (Bai et al., 2011; Damoiseaux et al., 2011) . Recent resting state fMRI studies have investigated whether we can detect similar changes in brain functional connectivity in healthy older 4 carriers (Sheline et al., 2010; Machulda et al., 2011; Trachtenberg et al., 2011; Westlye et al., 2011) . Trachtenberg et al. (2011) found no APOE-related differences in DMN connectivity. The other three studies show significant DMN connectivity differences between 4 carriers and 3 homozygotes, although there is substantial variability in their results. None of these studies examined whether the observed default mode functional connectivity differences varied by gender.\nIn this study, we examined the effect of APOE genotype and gender on default mode functional connectivity in healthy older subjects. In line with previous research, we expected to see a pattern similar to what we have observed in AD; that is, decreased connectivity in the DMN (Greicius et al., 2004; Damoiseaux et al., 2011) , with the greatest effect in female 4 carriers. To obtain convergent evidence for these imaging findings, we also tested the same model in an analysis of spinal fluid protein levels in healthy older controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants in the University of California, San Francisco/Stanford study", "text": "Healthy older adults were recruited as part of longitudinal study of normal aging at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Resting state fMRI data and APOE genotype were available for 234 participants. Of these 234 participants, 27 were excluded because of left-handedness, 22 because of poor data quality (excessive head motion, significant signal loss, partial brain coverage), 36 because of use of psychoactive medication, and 18 because they carried the 2 allele.

Anatomical data were analyzed with FMRIB Software Library (FSL)-VBM, a voxel-based morphometry style analysis (Ashburner and Friston, 2000; Good et al., 2001) performed with FSL tools (Smith et al., 2004) . First, anatomical images were brain extracted using the Brain Extraction Tool (Smith, 2002) . Next, tissue-type segmentation was performed using FAST4 (Zhang et al., 2001) . The resultant gray matter partial volume images were then aligned to MNI152 standard space using the affine registration tool FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2002) , followed by nonlinear registration using FNIRT (Andersson, 2007) (FMRIB technical reports TR07JA1 and TR07JA2; available at www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/techrep), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field (Rueckert et al., 1999) . For the use of gray matter volume as a voxelwise regressor in the fMRI data analysis, a four-dimensional (4D) image was created by concatenating every participant's standard space gray matter image. For direct comparison of gray matter volume, the individual standard space gray matter images were averaged to create a study-specific template, to which the native gray matter images were then nonlinearly reregistered. The registered partial volume images were then modulated (to correct for local expansion or contraction) by dividing by the Jacobian of the warp field. The modulated segmented images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with \u03ed 3 mm. Finally, to test for significant differences between 4 carriers and 3 homozygotes, a voxelwise general linear model was applied using permutation-based nonparametric testing, with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) as implemented in FSL (Smith and Nichols, 2009 ) and p \u03fd 0.05 familywise error corrected.\nResting state fMRI data analysis. Image preprocessing was performed using tools from the FSL, version 4.1 (Smith et al., 2004) . The following prestatistics processing was applied: motion correction (Jenkinson et al., 2002) ; removal of nonbrain structures (Smith, 2002) ; spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width at half-maximum; meanbased intensity normalization of all volumes by the same factor (i.e., 4D grand-mean scaling to ensure comparability between datasets at the group level); high-pass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted leastsquares straight line fitting, with \u03ed 75.0 s); and Gaussian low-pass temporal filtering ( \u03ed 2.8 s). After preprocessing, the functional scan was first aligned to the participant's highresolution T1-weighted image, which was subsequently registered to the MNI152 standard space [average T1 brain image constructed from 152 normal subjects at Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)] using affine linear registration (Jenkinson et al., 2002) . To perform voxelwise between-group comparisons of resting state connectivity, the dual regression technique previously described (Filippini et al., 2009; Veer et al., 2010; Damoiseaux et al., 2011) was used. This approach entails three steps. First, create data-driven, populationspecific spatial maps showing large-scale connectivity patterns by running group independent component analysis (ICA) on the concatenated resting state data of equal numbers of 4 carriers and 3 homozygotes, men, and women (17 subjects per group; 68 total). Equal numbers of subjects per subgroup were used here to avoid introducing bias in the creation of the connectivity networks of interest. The dataset was decomposed into 30 independent components. Second, perform the actual dual regression by using all 30 independent components in a linear model fit (spatial regression) against all 131 individual datasets, resulting in specific time courses for each independent component and subject, and using these time courses in a linear model fit (temporal regression) against the subject's resting state data to estimate subject-specific spatial maps. Third, perform voxelwise between-group statistical testing on the subject-specific spatial maps using nonparametric permutation testing (5000 permutations) (Nichols and Holmes, 2002) . To control for differences in gray matter volume, the individual gray matter partial volume maps were included as a voxelwise regressor in the betweengroup comparison, as described by Oakes et al. (2007) and implemented in FSL. The DMN and a control network in which we did not expect to find any changes (i.e., the primary visual network) were selected for betweengroup analyses. In line with previous observations (Damoiseaux et al., 2011; Westlye et al., 2011) , the DMN was divided into three subnetworks (referred to here as the anterior, posterior, and ventral DMNs), identified by visual inspection of the group ICA. To assess any potential differences in modulation of these networks, we included all three networks in the analysis plus the primary visual network (identified by visual inspection as a single independent component). Figure 1 depicts a visual representation of all the networks included in the analyses. Fractionation of the DMN into several subnetworks has been observed in multiple previous studies that used a different methodology (i.e., seed-based correlations), studied a different population (i.e., younger healthy adults), or did both (Uddin et al., 2009; Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Littow et al., 2010; Westlye et al., 2011) . In addition, subdivisions of the default mode system have been associated with distinct cognitive functions (Uddin et al., 2009; Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010; Qin et al., 2011; Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2011) . We therefore believe that this fractionation is not merely a methodological artifact, but that it represents resting state networks with distinct functional attributes.\nTo find significant differences between 4 carriers and 3 homozygotes, a voxelwise general linear model was applied using permutation-based, non-parametric testing, using TFCE with p \u03fd 0.05 familywise error corrected, spatially masked with the thresholded group ICA component in question (posterior probability threshold of p \u03fe 0.5), and a cluster size \u03fe10 voxels. Given our a priori hypothesis and the reduced n when splitting by gender, we used TFCE with a more lenient threshold of p \u03fd 0.01 uncorrected, spatially masked with the thresholded group ICA component in question and a cluster size \u03fe10 voxels for the genotype-by-gender interaction analysis and subsequent post hoc comparisons."}, {"section_title": "ADNI data", "text": "Data used in this part of the study were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments, monitor their effectiveness, and lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from \u03fe50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55-90 years, to participate in the research: \u03f3200 cognitively normal older persons to be followed up for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed up for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed up for 2 years. These initial goals were met, and the ADNI project has now been extended as ADNI-2.\nSubjects. Within the ADNI database, three separate spreadsheets hold CSF measures; for our analyses, we used the original ADNI baseline data from the \"upennbiomark\" spreadsheet. In this spreadsheet, 114 healthy controls had CSF data. Of these 114 subjects, 21 were 2 carriers and therefore were excluded from our analyses. The remaining subjects were included in our analysis. Of these 93 subjects, 26 were 4 carriers (2 4 homozygotes, 1 man and 1 woman; 24 3/4 homozygotes, 16 men and 8 women) and 67 were 3 homozygotes (32 men and 35 women) (Table 1) .\nCSF analysis. CSF samples were collected at different ADNI sites as described in the ADNI procedures manual (http://www.adni-info.org/). Samples were then shipped overnight on dry ice to the ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. All analyses, as described by Shaw et al.

Mean levels of total tau, amyloid \u2424 1-42 (A\u2424 1-42 ), and phospho-tau (p-tau), in picograms per milliliter, were tested for differences between APOE genotype, gender, and the interaction between the two, using multivariate ANOVA with p \u03fd 0.05.

No differences were observed in the opposite direction, and no differences were observed in either the ventral DMN or the primary visual network.\nTo visualize the distribution of the observed effect across genotype and gender, we extracted the mean parameter estimate per group for a significant cluster in each network that showed significant differences between 4 carriers and 3 homozygotes (note: these are the individual values before the gray matter volume correction is applied). For the anterior DMN, we selected a representative cluster in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and for the posterior DMN we selected a representative cluster in the left posterior cingulate gyrus. In both clusters, women carrying the 4 allele had the lowest mean value (Fig. 2, bar graphs) . The difference across both genotype ( p \u03fd 0.001) and gender ( p \u03ed 0.005) was significant for the anterior cingulate gyrus.

In the normal population, 10 -15% of persons carry the 4 allele; among AD patients, up to 65% are 4 carriers Farrer et al., 1997) . The mechanism through which 4 exerts its effect remains elusive, but possibilities include promotion of tau hyperphosphorylation, reduction of \u2424-amyloid clearance, and inhibition of neurite outgrowth (Kim et al., 2009) . Previous studies of AD risk have shown that the 4 effect is more pronounced in women (Payami et al., 1996; Farrer et al., 1997; Bretsky et al., 1999) . With notable exceptions (Corder et al., 2004; Fleisher et al., 2005; Lehmann et al., 2006) , most studies have ignored this gender effect. No previous studies have investigated whether the interaction between gender and APOE is detectable in healthy adults. Here we have shown that this interaction is detectable in healthy older adults using two distinct AD biomarkers in two independent samples. DMN connectivity is a well replicated imaging biomarker of AD (Greicius et al., 2004; Buckner et al., 2005; Damoiseaux et al., 2011) . Our most compelling imaging results demonstrate an APOE genotypeby-gender interaction on posterior DMN connectivity. The precuneus/cuneus region of the posterior DMN showed a significant interaction, with the greatest reduction of functional connectivity in female 4 carriers (Fig. 3) . Post hoc testing was most notable for a 2000\u03e9 voxel cluster in the posterior cingulate/precuneus showing reduced connectivity in female 4 carriers compared with female 3 homozygotes ( Fig. 4 A, Table 3 ). The same comparison in men only showed reduced connectivity in 4 carriers in a small DMN cluster ( Fig. 4 B, Table 3 ). The small size and unusual location (not a core DMN region) of this cluster led us to interpret this finding cautiously and to strengthen our hypothesis that the 4 effect is mainly driven by female carriers. Comparing female and male 4 carriers revealed a decrease in female 4 carriers in three small but more strategically located DMN clusters (Fig. 4C, Table 3 ). In structural and functional connectivity analyses, the posterior cingulate/precuneus region is consistently found to be a core node in the DMN (Hagmann et al., 2008; Buckner et al., 2009 ). This region is structurally connected to the medial temporal lobes (Greicius et al., 2009) , the initial site of tau pathology in AD (Braak and Braak, 1991) . It shows reduced glucose metabolism early in AD and in asymptomatic 4 carriers (Minoshima et al., 1995; Reiman et al., 1996) . Last, this region shows reduced connectivity in AD patients compared with controls (Greicius et al., 2004) and in MCI patients compared with controls (Sorg et al., 2007) . Thus, the interaction of gender and APOE status occurs in a core DMN node and in the node most tightly linked to AD.\nIn the anterior DMN, we did not observe an APOE genotypeby-gender interaction. However, in the cluster highlighted to de- pict the directionality of the findings ( Fig. 2A) , we saw additive effects of gender and APOE genotype. This indicates that, although there is no APOE genotype-by-gender interaction, the additive effects of decreased connectivity in 4 carriers and decreased connectivity in women renders female 4 carriers most vulnerable to the observed 4 effect in this region. The observation of gender differences in resting state functional connectivity, including DMN regions, is consistent with many, but not all (Weissman-Fogel et al., 2010) , previous studies on this topic Biswal et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2011; Filippi et al., 2012) .\nOur results may explain the prominent discrepancies in the four previous studies examining the effect of APOE genotype on DMN connectivity in healthy older persons (Sheline et al., 2010; Machulda et al., 2011; Trachtenberg et al., 2011; Westlye et al., 2011) . Sheline et al. (2010) found increases and decreases in DMN connectivity in 4 carriers, Machulda et al. (2011) only found decreases, Westlye et al. (2011) only found increases, and Trachtenberg et al. (2011) found no differences in the DMN but reported differences in two hippocampal networks. The directionality of our findings is most compatible with that of Machulda et al. (2011) , who also showed decreased connectivity in 4 carriers. The discrepancy in the findings between our study and the previous four could be due to the different age ranges. The participants in our study and the Machulda et al. (2011) study were older (mean age, \u03f370 and 78 years, respectively) than those in the other three studies (mean ages, \u03f361, 63, and 45 years). Perhaps more important, the ratio of males to females varied considerably across the previous studies. In the Sheline et al. (2010) carriers and 10 female and 10 male 3 homozygotes. The discrepancy in findings across these previous studies might therefore be explained by an underlying and unexplored APOE genotype-by-gender interaction.\nWe used the ADNI CSF dataset to obtain convergent evidence of an APOE genotype-by-gender interaction in an independent cohort with an independent biomarker for AD. We found a main effect of APOE on all three markers in the expected direction and an APOE genotype-by-gender interaction in total tau levels, in which female 4 carriers had significantly elevated levels compared with female 3 homozygotes whereas male 4 carriers and male 3 homozygotes had nearly identical levels. To our knowledge this is the first report of an APOE genotype-by-gender interaction in a CSF biomarker of AD. Numerous studies have shown that AD and MCI patients have reduced CSF levels of A\u2424 1-42 and increased levels of p-tau and total tau (Tarawneh and Holtzman, 2010) . Shaw et al. (2009) have previously examined the ADNI healthy control dataset and noted an APOE effect on A\u2424 1-42 levels (reduced in 4 carriers) and p-tau levels (increased in 4 carriers) but did not find a significant APOE effect in total tau levels (Shaw et al., 2009 ). Our analysis differs in that we excluded 2 carriers and examined an APOE genotype-by-gender interaction. It is unclear why the APOE genotype-by-gender interaction was detectable in total tau levels but not in p-tau or A\u2424 1-42 levels, though this might reflect the temporal progression of biomarkers in AD pathology. It is generally accepted that \u2424-amyloid pathology precedes tau pathology by many years (Jack et al., 2010 (Jack et al., , 2011 . It is possible that p-tau changes precede total tau changes on the pathological progression to AD. This is consistent with the findings by Shaw et al. (2009) , who found that healthy 4 carriers, collapsed across gender, differed from non-4 carriers in A\u2424 1-42 levels and p-tau levels but not (yet) in total tau levels. In our analysis, female 4 carriers, presumably further along in their AD pathology, showed changes in A\u2424 1-42 levels, p-tau levels, and total tau levels, whereas male 4 carriers only manifested differences in the first two markers.\nNo differences or APOE genotype-by-gender interactions were observed for gray matter volume or memory performance. Changes in DMN functional connectivity and CSF tau protein levels seem to precede changes in brain structure and cognitive performance. This discrepancy suggests that resting state functional connectivity and CSF protein analyses may therefore be more sensitive than cognitive testing or structural MRI measures as markers of preclinical AD.\nAlthough we show that female 4 carriers have decreased DMN connectivity and increased CSF tau levels, we can only speculate about the mechanisms behind this interaction. The most obvious possibility would be some interaction between APOE status and sex hormone levels. Hundreds of studies in animals and humans have examined the effect of estrogen loss and replacement on cognition and dementia risk in older women (for review, see Henderson, 2009 ). The negative outcome of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, which showed an increased dementia risk in women taking estrogen replacement therapy, has only added to the uncertainty regarding estrogen replacement (Shumaker et al., 2004) . Regarding our findings, it is notable that the few studies of estrogen and cognition that have stratified by APOE status suggest that APOE status may be critical in evaluating estrogen replacement (Yaffe et al., 2000; Kang and Grodstein, 2010) .\nWe have demonstrated that gender influences the effect of APOE genotype on both DMN connectivity and CSF tau levels and have determined that the detrimental effect of the 4 allele is Figure 5 . CSF total tau levels provide convergent evidence for the modulation of the APOE effect by gender. The bar graph shows the significant APOE genotype-by-gender interaction observed for CSF total tau levels ( p \u03ed 0.024), in the healthy older controls of the ADNI dataset. Healthy female 4 carriers showed the highest mean total tau level. Post hoc testing revealed a significant difference between female 4 carriers and female 3 homozygotes ( p \u03ed 0.046).\nmost pronounced in women. Our results support previous work showing a higher prevalence of the 4 allele among women with AD and, more critically, demonstrate that this interaction between APOE genotype and gender is detectable in the preclinical period. Future studies using biomarkers in the preclinical stages of disease should allow us to dissect the environmental, hormonal, and genetic factors that underlie this interaction, which appears central to AD pathogenesis."}]
