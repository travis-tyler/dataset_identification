Further, we sincerely thank our local jurisdictional partners, liaisons, and coral reef managers for their tireless work in advancing the goals of coral reef conservation, and for providing useful and necessary local context and input into the development of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program Socioeconomic Surveys.\nNOAA's Office for Coastal Management \"Coastal management\" is the term used by communities and organizations striving to keep the nation's coasts safe from storms, rich in natural resources, and economically strong. The national lead for these efforts is NOAA's Office for Coastal Management (OCM), an organization devoted to partnerships, science, and good policy. Housed within the National Ocean Service, OCM oversees major initiatives that include the National Coastal Zone Management Program, Coral Reef Conservation Program, Digital Coast, and National Estuarine Research Reserve System.\nPage i\n\n\fTable of Contents\nExecutive Summary\nIn 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) underwent an external review by an expert panel to provide an independent assessment of the CRCP's effectiveness in meeting its mandates and to suggest recommendations for future improvement. One of the major recommendations of the external review was to increase the CRCP's social science portfolio and use social science strategically to improve coral reef management by engaging local communities and better assessing the social and economic consequences of management policies, interventions, and activities on local communities. In 2010, the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) Socioeconomic Component was created to standardize the collection of socioeconomic variables in the United States (US) coral reef jurisdictions, including demographics of coral reef adjacent communities, human use of coral reef resources, as well as knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of coral reefs and coral reef management. The overall goal of the socioeconomic monitoring component is to track relevant information regarding each jurisdiction's population, social and economic structure, the impacts of society on coral reefs, and the impacts of coral management on communities through the calculation of socioeconomic indicators relevant to coral reef adjacent communities and their interactions with coral reef resources.\nCoral reefs are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world, providing food for coastal communities, shoreline protection through the attenuation of wave energy, habitat for commercially important fish species, recreational opportunities for residents and tourists, and cultural value, among other ecosystem services. Understanding the complex relationship between humans and coral reef ecosystems allows natural resource managers responsible for managing coral reefs to more holistically understand the key social and ecological impacts of their strategies. Humans play a significant role in ecosystem health (or lack thereof) through their interactions with coral reef resources. Therefore, including humans in the systematic monitoring of coral reefs is critical for understanding the interconnected nature of social and ecological systems.\nThe NCRMP Socioeconomic Component uses primary and secondary data to track the status of coral reef adjacent communities in the US coral reef jurisdictions of South Florida, American Samoa, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and the US Virgin Islands (USVI). Primary data are collected through surveys of residents in each of the jurisdictions. The survey instrument used contains a \"core\" module of questions that are asked in each jurisdiction to aid in comparability across geographies, as well as a jurisdictionally-specific module that collects data to address more localized management questions. Resident surveys were completed for South Florida, American Samoa, and Hawaii in 2014; Puerto Rico in 2015; Guam in 2016; and CNMI and USVI in 2017. Secondary data were collected from a variety of sources including (but not limited to) the US Census Bureau, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and local government agencies throughout these years as well. These primary and secondary data were then operationalized into 13 socioeconomic indicators, each of which are detailed in this report.\nResults indicate significant differences across the Atlantic (South Florida, Puerto Rico, USVI) and Pacific (Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, CNMI) jurisdictions in a number of areas. Residents in Pacific jurisdictions participate in a greater number of marine activities more frequently, have more positive perceptions of marine resource condition, have higher levels of self-reported knowledge of coral reefs, agree more with the cultural importance of reefs, and participate more frequently in pro-environmental behavior when compared to residents of Atlantic jurisdictions.\nThe population of residents has increased in all jurisdictions since 2013, except for Puerto Rico and USVI; and the population of annual visitors has increased in all jurisdictions since 2013, with the exception of American Samoa. Fishing for species dependent upon coral reefs is important in all jurisdictions, with commercial fishing revenues associated with coral reef fishing reaching over $72\nPage ii\n\n\fTable of Contents\nmillion combined for all jurisdictions in 2015, representing 35% of all commercial fishing revenue. Tourism is also an important industry for the US coral reef jurisdictions, and many tourists visit these jurisdictions to specifically engage with coral reef resources. The tourism industry employed over 345,000 people in all jurisdictions combined in 2015, representing just over 8% of total employment.\nSecondary data are also gathered to assess community well-being across the jurisdictions, based on a number of variables. The proportion of adult residents with a high school diploma is above 70% in all jurisdictions; however, over half of the populations of American Samoa and CNMI are considered to be living in poverty. Median annual household income, median home value, life expectancy, and health insurance coverage rates are highest in Hawaii. The territory of American Samoa has the highest proportion of the population receiving public assistance, lowest levels of internet access, and the highest average community tenure.\nIn terms of physical infrastructure, South Florida has the highest proportion of impervious surfaces and the most annual construction permits, American Samoa has the highest proportion of households that lack complete plumbing facilities, Puerto Rico has the most operating landfills, and Guam has the highest proportion of land with military facilities.\nGovernance is also tracked with secondary data, but developing reliable indicators is a nuanced process, and suitable data sources for this indicator were difficult to obtain. Each jurisdiction was found to have its own set of challenges to overcome related to compliance, enforcement capacity, and budget constraints on a local scale; and global phenomena like climate change that may manifest locally as well.\nThis research represents the first effort by NOAA to track the socioeconomic status of the US coral reef jurisdictions in a systematic and standardized fashion, and the data represent the baseline for monitoring socioeconomic conditions into the future. Methods were developed and applied to incorporate available primary and secondary information into concise measures that can help inform future management decisions. Additionally, intra- and inter-jurisdiction comparisons will become increasingly possible, relevant, and insightful as data from future rounds surveys and secondary data collection are incorporated.\nHowever, this work is not without its challenges. Chiefly among them is the availability and consistency of secondary data throughout the US coral jurisdictions. The data from resident surveys provides the research team with geographically comparable data collected with similar methodologies to construct survey-based indicators. Unfortunately, that luxury does not exist for secondary data, and the research team is reliant upon existing datasets. Data was not always available for certain variables for all jurisdictions. For example, data on ocean economy contribution to gross domestic product, fishing licenses, visitor count data was available for South Florida counties but not for other US coral reef jurisdictions. Further, in some cases, the research team had to build indicator variables that are derived from different data sources with varying data collection methods in order to incorporate what is available. To note these challenges, each indicator is accompanied by a \"confidence ranking\" that provides additional context based on data availability constraints.\nSurvey data collection for the second round of NCRMP Socioeconomic monitoring began in April 2019. The core module of survey questions has been updated and refined for the second round of monitoring based on an assessment of which survey-based indicators needed more data, expert feedback, and the minimization of respondent burden. Continued review and refinement of these indicators and the input variable data on which they rely has the potential to increase the usefulness of the resulting series of indicator values. With this information, scientists, practitioners, and coral reef managers in the jurisdictions can integrate social and biophysical data streams to obtain more in-depth understanding of social-ecological relationships. These indicators also support communication, by taking a complex array of variables and joining them together in a single, trackable metric that encompasses the general breadth of a concept. As socioeconomic monitoring continues, these indicators will be tracked to make relevant temporal comparisons, and they will be improved as resident survey questions are refined and new data streams become available.\nPage iii\n\n\fTable of Contents\n\nContents\n\nExecutive Summary.......................................................................................ii\n\nExhibits\n\n........................................................................................................................... v\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations .................................................................................................vi\n\n1.

Background and Introduction\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) developed the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) to collect information to monitor changes in coral reef ecosystems in U.S. jurisdictions over time, including biological, climate, and socioeconomic conditions. This report represents the culmination of the first round of socioeconomic monitoring across the 7 inhabited U.S. coral reef jurisdictions, and presents 13 socioeconomic indicators that detail the status and trends related to coral reef adjacent communities in the jurisdictions.\nExhibit 1 lists the seven U.S. coral reef jurisdictions the NCRMP Socioeconomic Component addresses, and Exhibit 2 shows the geographic locations of these jurisdictions.\nExhibit 1.

The terms measure, variable, parameter, analyte, metric, and index are often used interchangeably within relevant literature describing current efforts to develop and use indicator frameworks (Bowen and Riley, 2003). However, focusing on an indicator's function can provide clarity, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has described a successful indicator as one that is able to \"...reduce the number of measures which normally would be required for an exact presentation of a situation; and simplify the process of communication to managers, stakeholders and communities\" (Bowen and Riley, 2003). Overall, indicators should be complex enough to be compelling to their intended users, but understandable and focused on answering the questions motivating the effort. Indicators are often developed to evaluate program performance, to explain the relationship between human activity and ecosystem health, or to monitor trends and conditions in ecosystem dynamics or resource use. However, focusing on an indicator's intended purpose can be challenging when using all available information obscures the underlying variation of interest. This is why designing a set of purposeful indicators is essential at the effort's inception prior to starting any data collection (Bowen and Riley, 2003).\nIn recent years, NOAA has led or contributed to a number of social or socioeconomic indicator development efforts focused on understanding the well-being, vulnerability, and resilience of U.S. fishing-dependent and other local communities using a number of methods. The following selection of NOAA and other studies illustrate some common methods used for indicator development that helped inform the current effort:\nA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) study (Dillard et al., 2013) developed a set of composite indicators for monitoring well-being at the county level in the Gulf of Mexico through collecting secondary data on social connectedness, economic security, basic needs, health, access to social services, education, safety, governance, and environmental conditions. A detailed measure selection process was used to determine an indicator component including theoretical factors (literature, prior study support, and face validity), methodological factors (data availability, consistency of data collection, and utility in applied setting), and statistical factors (descriptive analyses, correlation analyses, and exploratory factor analysis, FA). Then each indicator was used to derive composite indicators whose component values were normalized through the linear scaling method, summed as scores, and then computed as percent of possible score.\nFor the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Jepson, Colburn, and others attempted to address a gap in existing sustainable development indices that had not been implemented at the local or community level nor focused on addressing the social aspects of U.S. fisheries. This series of studies developed a suite of social indicators using a FA of time series, secondary data from government sources, and a ground-truthed cluster analysis to select a group of U.S. Southeast and Northeast communities to evaluate the derived social vulnerability and fishing-dependent indices. Prior to data collection, a group of regional fisheries experts and social scientists convened to develop the study approach, and a second workshop reviewed and suggested revisions to the indicators. Future studies incorporated new measures of climate change vulnerability along the U.S. Eastern and Gulf Coasts (Colburn and Jepson, 2012; Jepson and Colburn, 2013; Colburn et al., 2016; and Pollnac et al., 2015).\nPage 2\n\n\fFinal Report\nFor NMFS, Himes-Cornell and others developed socioeconomic and fisheries involvement indices using secondary data to assess fishing community well-being in Alaska. Each index used a principle components FA to assess the relative position of the communities and track the status of their conditions over time (Himes-Cornell and Kasperski, 2015, 2016; Himes-Cornell et al., 2016).\nSmith and Clay (2010) analyzed a set of case studies of North American marine commercial fisheries to evaluate subjective and objective measures of well-being. The study found that \"...a well-being index is useful if it (1) is easily developed from available data; (2) enables temporal and spatial comparisons; (3) can be applied at multiple scales; and (4) possesses subjective and objective elements.\" It also stated common \"problems with well-being variables are: they are typically static, covering only one point in time; data are not always readily available; predefined indices may miss situation-specific issues; and the data are expensive to collect.\"\nFor a study focusing on the vulnerability of coastal communities in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico, Morzaria-Luna et al. (2014) accessed the effect of anthropogenic stressors, including climate change, on disruptions in fishing activities. Researchers developed quantitative indicator indices using principal components analysis and spatial analysis of secondary and primary field data covering the three aspects of vulnerability: sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity. These aspects were combined into an overall score through normalization, summing of the individual factor scores assuming equal importance, and, when necessary, adjusting for directionality (i.e., low value = low adaptive capacity).\nIn 2010, NOAA developed the NCRMP to develop and summarize information on the conditions of coral reefs in the jurisdictions in three indicator groups: biological indicators, climate indicators, and socioeconomic indicators. The purpose of the socioeconomic indicators is to help answer the following questions:\n What is the status of human knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding coral reefs?  How are human uses of, interactions with, and coral dependence on coral reefs changing over\ntime?\nBecause many of NOAA's and others' efforts to protect coral reefs rely on education and changing attitudes toward reef protection, the information collected for the socioeconomic indicators assists the CRCP in ensuring programs are designed appropriately at the start, evaluating programs over time, and enabling outreach efforts that target the intended recipients with useful information.\nThe set of 13 socioeconomic indicators (Exhibit 3) were developed through an iterative, collaborative process including the convening of two NCRMP indicator development workshops in 2010 and 2012. At the 2010 workshop, a Working Group of NOAA scientists and managers with expertise on coral reef ecosystems developed an initial set of indicators. These indicators were then refined and prioritized at the 2012 workshop, in addition to participants reviewing the NCRMP and developing secondary data measures and methods (Lovelace and Dillard, 2012). Participants included more than 20 NOAA scientists and managers along with academics with theoretical and methodological expertise in indicator development, and experience in both coral jurisdictions and the sociological dimensions of natural resources. In order to ensure the NCRMP Socioeconomic Component would achieve its purpose, participants focused on addressing measurement issues, data availability, and comparability of the measures and data across the jurisdictions; and ultimately reached a consensus on the list of indicators. Exhibit 3 presents NCRMP's 13 prioritized socioeconomic indicators along with the type of data source used to support each indicator's development. These 13 socioeconomic indicators are listed in order of\nPage 3\n\n\fFinal Report\n\npriority, as identified at the 2012 workshop, along with a qualifier of whether the indicator was derived from primary or secondary data.\nExhibit 3.

Surveys were administered to residents in each of the jurisdictions, with a core module of questions (see Appendices A and B) asked in all jurisdictions as well as a jurisdictionally specific module to address more localized management needs. The respondent universe for each survey included adults aged 18 or older who live in the particular jurisdiction. The data collected by the surveys include questions for residents concerning their frequency of participation in reef activities, perception of the jurisdiction's marine resources condition, awareness and knowledge of coral reef threats, attitudes toward coral reef management strategies and enforcement, and frequency of participation in behaviors that may improve coral reef health, among other topics. At the same time, relevant secondary data were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and jurisdictional governments, among other sources. Exhibit 4 presents an overview of the surveys including the year, mode, and sample size for each jurisdiction.\nExhibit 4.

This is an essential next step in the socioeconomic monitoring process: establishing a baseline socioeconomic condition for tracking the indicators moving forward, thereby bolstering the capacity for effective monitoring using the best available and most recent science.\nThe selection of the socioeconomic indicators was informed by a need for measures that can inform local management decisions, as well as enable comparisons across jurisdictions. The challenge with this objective is that jurisdictions are associated with a wide range of physical and socioeconomic conditions; and reef habitats are subject to a wide range of stressors, governance, and use across the jurisdictions. To highlight some of these differences, Exhibit 5 presents a sample of the U.S. Census demographic data for each jurisdiction.\nExhibit 5.

The goals of this effort were to use the available data to produce indicators that could:\n\n Reflect the changing conditions of attitudes related to coral reefs of adjacent populations within and across jurisdictions;\n Be easily explained and understood by the intended reporting audiences of Congress, Agency leadership (e.g., senior staff in the National Ocean Service), local coral reef management partners, and local government leaders; and\n Inform decision-making concerning coral reef management within and across jurisdictions.\n\nCritical to the indicator development was the general incorporation of a \"wide and thin\" approach in contrast to one that was \"narrow and deep.\" In practice, this was reflected in a willingness and preference\nPage 5\n\n\fFinal Report\nto increase the number of issues/themes addressed in developing an indicator by incorporating additional relevant data, in contrast to focusing on specific components of indicators. However, there were limitations to the indicator development effort, as supported by best professional judgment and relevant literature such as Bowen and Riley (2003) and Smith and Clay (2010), including the fact that indicator development inherently requires choices and universal agreement of their construction was unlikely in all cases. The preference was to collect time-series data that have been and will continue to be available with updated annual values. For each indicator, not all desired information was available and not all information could, or should, be incorporated. This effort generally relied on data produced by a reliable (i.e., generally government) source using reasonable methods that remain relatively constant over time and are well-documented. The limited number of jurisdictions (n = 7) also constrained the use of some potential analytical and statistical techniques.\nAs a first step in the indicator development process, CRCP and Abt held a facilitated discussion at the 2018 Social Coast Forum with coastal managers and scientists. During the session, participants were introduced to the project and the list of 13 indicators (see Exhibit 3) before breaking into smaller groups to discuss key data issues and questions focusing on the indicators derived from secondary data. Participants provided initial feedback on the potential data sources for each indicator as well as proposed approaches for their development. Incorporating that feedback, Abt refined key assumptions and proposed development methods, along with continuing the collection of relevant secondary data.\nIn July and August 2018, CRCP and Abt convened the first expert workshops to present the data collected for each indicator, along with the refined assumptions and development approaches prior to calculation of the indicators and their values. A group of experts were invited to these workshops that focused on specific groups of indicators (i.e., economic impacts; attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors; management; and stressors), who had previous experience with the NCRMP effort or had expertise in the relevant socioeconomic topics, indicator development, and/or coral reef management. Each workshop included approximately 10 participants, namely NOAA scientists, coastal managers, and leading academics, who provided detailed feedback on additional secondary data sources to consider and the proposed approaches to refine data and assess limitations in operationalizing the indicators. The central proposed approach involved scaling or indexing input data variables with a value (e.g., 0\u00ad100), and then computing a weighted sum of the indexed variables based on their relevance. While the experts generally agreed with this approach, the discussion yielded several key points concerning limitations such as the relatively small sample size (n = 7 jurisdictions) for exploring potential statistical analyses (i.e., FA or principle component analysis) to help narrow or understand the significance of specific variables, as well as the feasibility of weighting or normalizing variables or grouping similar indicators. Experts expressed experience with similar challenges in developing socioeconomic indicators, and provided additional relevant studies and research to consider in the effort. A list of participants and detailed notes from the workshops are provided in Appendix C.\nIncorporating feedback from this first round of expert workshops, Abt proceeded to develop and calculate values for all 13 indicators. Prior to finalizing the indicator values, Abt and CRCP reconvened experts in a second round of workshops in December 2018. The initial group of experts from the first set of workshops were invited to attend the December workshops and about 15 participated in 2 identical sessions that reviewed methods and results for the 13 indicators. During the workshops, experts were presented with details on all data variables and refined methods used to calculate each indicator. This allowed experts a final opportunity to identify missing or suggest additional data sources; and evaluate the overall reasonableness and appropriateness of the approach, draft results, and interpretation in meeting each indicator's goal. Experts generally supported the presented methods and results; however, in one case there was a strong recommendation to decompose elements initially combined in a single indicator to produce two distinct indicators. The result was there are now indicators 5a and 5b, which\nPage 6\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nfocus on changes in resident populations and changes in annual visitors to the coral reef jurisdictions, respectively. A list of participants and detailed notes from the workshops are provided in Appendix D. Following these workshops, Abt incorporated other final revisions to the indicators such as applying final relative weighting of individual data variables for applicable indicators. Details on the specific data variables, assumptions, weighting, and calculation methods are presented in Section 2 for each indicator. Throughout the report, all dollar values have been adjusted to 2017 based on gross domestic product (GDP) deflators estimated by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2018). Further, throughout the data collection process, two indicators from the original list shown in Exhibit 4 were targeted for name changes based on data availability. First, for the \"Economic impact of dive/snorkel tourism to jurisdiction,\" it is difficult to parse out dive/snorkel tourism in a uniform way across the jurisdictions, and while coral reef-based tourism was assessed where possible, this indicator is more aptly named the \"Economic impact of tourism to jurisdiction.\" It is assumed that coral reefs and other marine areas drive much of the tourism in each of the seven jurisdictions. Secondly, Awareness and knowledge of coral reefs, which is tracked through NCRMP resident surveys, is technically a self-reported assessment of awareness and knowledge; therefore, this indicator name has been changed to \"Self-reported awareness and knowledge of coral reefs.\" Both of these name changes are reflected throughout the rest of the document.\nFinally, as a complement to the specific numeric indicator values, a confidence ranking was developed and applied for each indicator using values and criteria in Exhibit 6. Throughout the development of these indicators, the research team was constrained in the data that could be collected in two main areas: for primary data, researchers were constrained by minimizing respondent burden; and for secondary data, researchers were constrained by data availability and consistency across the jurisdictions. Many of the variables targeted for the development of secondary data indicators are not collected in a uniform, systematic way across all seven jurisdictions, which may increase the margin of error around the estimates. These confidence rankings are used to provide additional context for the indicator values, based on the constraints described above. For each indicator, notes are included discussing the rationale for each indicator's confidence ranking. As new primary data are collected for the next round of socioeconomic monitoring, these confidence rankings will be used to target primary data indictors that need improvement in terms of how they are addressed in the next round of surveys. For secondary data indicators, these confidence rankings will be used to track data availability and consistency (in a general sense) over time.\nExhibit 6. Confidence Ranking Values and Criteria\n\nConfidence Ranking Low\nMedium High\n\nCriteria for the Confidence Ranking Score\nSecondary data sources have questionable reliability either due to a lack of consistency in availability across the jurisdictions, a lack of consistency in availability across time periods, and/or a lack of consistency in a uniform data source across jurisdictions. For NCRMP survey-based indicators, the indicator relies on a single survey question that could be improved upon to fully cover the breadth of the topic with more survey questions.\nSecondary data sources are reliable but there are gaps in the available information, either within a specific jurisdiction or across the jurisdictions collectively. For NCRMP survey-based indicators, the indicator could be improved upon to fully cover the breadth of the topic either with more survey questions or a more focused targeting of current survey questions.\nSecondary data sources are highly reliable and there are few instances of missing values within or across jurisdictions. For NCRMP survey-based indicators, the indicator relies on multiple targeted survey questions that cover the breadth of the topic.\n\nBefore going into the details of how each indicator was calculated, it should be noted that respondent weights that were calculated in FL, USVI, and HI are used in all of the indicators derived from NCRMP\n\nPage 7\n\n\fFinal Report\nsurvey data; and all missing responses and answers of \"not sure\" are excluded from analysis. All of the data and results contained in this report can be considered updates from previously published reports (Gorstein et al., 2016, 2017, 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2019b; Levine et al., 2016). The indicator values for the jurisdictions presented in Section 2 were developed with the use of NCRMP survey data, archived and publically available through NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information,1 and through secondary data, publically available through various sources, but synthesized by NOAA into a database found by navigating to the NCRMP socioeconomic website.2\n\n1 - Am- eric- an S-am- oa, - Sou-th-Fl- orid-a, - Haw-ai- i , - Pue-rto-Ri- co, - Gua-m, - CNM-I, and USVI. 2 https://www.coris.noaa.gov/monitoring/socioeconomic.html\n\nPage 8\n\n\fFinal Report\n2. Indicator Development and Results\nIn this section, details are provided for each indicator with respect to its:  Goal  Input variable data  Calculation method  Key results  Caveats  Confidence ranking\nIndicator 1: Participation in Reef Activities\nGoal\nThis indicator uses NCRMP survey data to account for residents' participation in a range of coral reefrelated activities. The underlying survey data included information on the frequency of participation in each activity related to direct and indirect uses of reefs such as snorkeling, surfing, swimming, diving, fishing, and harvesting; with the specific list of activities tailored to the jurisdiction. Additional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Reef condition will be influenced by the type and amount of activities (e.g., sustainable use, carrying capacity, overfishing).\n Change in activity may be linked to carrying capacity; more activity participation equals more people obtaining reef's ecosystem services and more anthropogenic stressors, and may be consistent with an increased value of those reefs to human populations.\n Activities are tied to economy and culture, and so the type and amount/level of activity could affect reef condition.\n May be linked to overall economic conditions with individuals having more or less recreation time.\n Depends on population change since a large increase in residents or visitors could mean more marine activity participation.\nInput Variable Data\nExhibit 7 presents the NCRMP input variables for the indicator and their associated range of values. In this case, the indicator was developed using normalized additive indices developed based on grouped survey questions.\nPage 9\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 7. Indicator Inputs for Participation in Reef Activities\n\nSurvey Questions\nActivity Index: additive index of activity questions; increases as frequency of participation increases Question: How often do you usually participate in each of the following activities? [list of activities are specific to each jurisdiction]\nFishing Index: additive index of fishing questions; increases as frequency of fishing increases for various reasons Question: How often do you fish or harvest marine resources for each of the following reasons?[list of fishing reasons are specific to each jurisdiction]\n\nJurisdiction(s) Covered\nAll\nAll\n\nSource NCRMP surveys\nNCRMP surveys\n\nOther Comments\nActivity Index normalized to a 0\u00ad100 scale based on question responses of: 1 = never 2 = once a month or less 3 = 2\u00ad3 times per month 4 = 4 times a month or more Fishing Index normalized to a 0\u00ad100 scale based on question responses of: 1 = never 2 = rarely 3 = sometimes 4 = frequently\n\nCalculation Method\nThe evaluated NCRMP resident survey data included the coded responses for each surveyed resident in a jurisdiction. Respondent weights from FL, HI, and USVI were used to weight responses to best represent the jurisdiction's population where appropriate. Implicit weights of 1.0 were used in the remaining locations (AS, CNMI, GU, and PR).\n\nThis Participation in Reef Activities indicator was developed as follows:\n\n The Activity Index and Fishing Index were derived by adding up responses to the group of activity (Q1 in Appendix A) and fishing (Q2 in Appendix A) questions, respectively, then normalizing to a 0-100 scale using the minimum-maximum scaling method. A respondent had to answer every question contained in the index to receive and index value and answers of \"not sure\" were considered missing when constructing the additive indices. The minimum-maximum scaling method is defined by the following equation, where x is the value of a given variable, min is the minimum value in the distribution, and max is the maximum value in the distribution.\n\n -   -  = \n\n Respondent-weighted activity index values and respondent-weighted fishing index values, excluding responses coded as missing, were used to calculate indicator values for each survey respondent.\n The average indicator value is then calculated for each jurisdiction.\nKey Results\nAfter consulting with expert opinion, it was decided to weight the activity and fishing index at 40% and 60%, respectively. The additional weight given to the fishing index values reflects an emphasis on extractive activities associated with this variable in the belief they are more likely to have a direct impact on reef resources. Exhibit 8 presents the indicator values reflecting that weighting scheme, along with information and results for the input variables. To assist with interpretation, the indicator results were bounded by possible values from 0, reflecting no reef-related activity among residents; to 100, reflecting all residents participating to the maximum extent possible in reef-related activities, as defined by the survey.\n\nPage 10\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 8.

Survey responses were based on individuals' perceptions of status and trends, with the specific list of resources tailored to the jurisdiction.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Having the indicator may aid in seeing correlations (or a gap) between perceptions of resource condition and actual condition.\n The indicator may help evaluate links between improving public awareness campaigns and changes in residents' perceptions of resource conditions. Similarly, the indicator could also inform whether perceptions of resource conditions change following discrete bleaching and other impactful events, or as the frequency and severity of these events increase.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using data from NCRMP's resident survey. Exhibit 9 presents the NCRMP variables and the associated values for these input variables to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using normalized additive indices developed based on grouped survey questions (Condition Index, Last 10 Index) and values reported on a 1\u00ad3 Likert scale (Next 10).\nExhibit 9. Indicator Inputs for Perceived Resource Condition\n\nSurvey Questions\nCondition Index: additive index of condition questions; increases as positive perception increases Question: In your opinion, how are the jurisdiction's marine resources currently doing?

Please indicate if it has gotten a lot worse, somewhat worse, no change, somewhat better, or a lot better. [list of conditions are specific to each jurisdiction]\n\nNext10: In the next 10 years, do you think the\n\nAll\n\ncondition of the marine resources in the jurisdiction\n\nwill get worse, stay the same, or improve?\n\nNCRMP surveys NCRMP surveys\n\nOther Comments\nCondition Index normalized to a 0\u00ad100 scale based on question responses of: 1 = very bad 2 = bad 3 = neither bad nor good 4 = good 5 = very good\nLast 10 Index normalized to a 0\u00ad100 scale based on question responses of: 1 = a lot worse 2 = somewhat worse 3 = no change 4 = somewhat better 5 = a lot better\nBased on question responses of: 1 = get worse 2 = stay the same 3 = improve\n\nCalculation Method\nThe evaluated NCRMP resident survey data included the coded responses for each surveyed resident in a jurisdiction. Respondent weights from FL, HI, and USVI were used to weight responses to best represent\n\nPage 12\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nthe jurisdiction's population where appropriate. Implicit weights of 1.0 were used in the remaining locations (AS, CNMI, GU, and PR).\nThis Perceived Resource Condition indicator was developed as follows:\n This indicator was based on a mix of \"index\" variables and \"Likert/ordinal\" variables.  The \"index\" values were constrained to a defined range (0\u00ad100), while the \"Likert/ordinal\"\nvariables values have a defined set of ordinal responses.  The Condition Index and Last10 Index were derived by adding up responses to the group of\ncurrent condition (Q5 in Appendix A) and change in condition (Q6 in Appendix A) questions, respectively, then normalizing to a 0-100 scale using the minimum-maximum scaling method. A respondent had to answer every question contained in the index to receive and index value and answers of \"not sure\" were considered missing when constructing the additive indices.  For the \"Likert/ordinal\" variable (Next10), the 1-3 scale was transformed to 0-1 using the minimum-maximum scaling method, then a weighted average value of the variable was calculated and multiplied by 100 to convert the ranked responses into a numeric value on the same 0\u00ad100 scale so that it could be combined with the index variables.  Respondent-weighted Condition Index, Last 10 index, and next10 values, excluding responses coded as missing, were used to calculate indicator values for each survey respondent.  The average indicator value is then calculated for each jurisdiction.\nKey Results\nAfter consulting with expert opinion, it was decided to weight the condition index, last10 index, and next10 at 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively. The most weight was given to the current perception that assumes respondents will be more accurate without recall or anticipation. Exhibit 10 presents the indicator values reflecting that weighting scheme along with information and results for the input variables. To assist with interpretation, these results were bounded by possible values from 0, reflecting the worst possible perception of the reefs' condition over the different time periods; to 100, reflecting the best possible perception of the reefs' condition over the different time periods, as defined by the survey.\nExhibit 10.

The underlying survey data include both support and opposition toward management activities as well as agreement/disagreement about the functions of MPAs.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Results should have direct management relevance because positive attitudes toward management should result in greater compliance, which should lead to improved reef condition.\n NOAA and local resource managers are interested in knowing how supportive the general population is of coral reef management strategies and actions.\n Both management actions and support can change over time depending on political climate and effective demonstration of positive results of coral reef management.\n MPAs have been shown to be effective, and greater support for MPAs would make implementation easier and translate to positive effects on the reefs.\n More support for management eases implementation.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using data from NCRMP's resident survey. Exhibit 11 presents the NCRMP variables and the associated values for these input variables to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using normalized additive indices developed based on grouped survey questions.\nExhibit 11.

Respondent weights from FL, HI, and USVI were used to weight responses to best represent the jurisdiction's population where appropriate. Implicit weights of 1.0 were used in the remaining locations (AS, CNMI, GU, and PR).\nThe Attitudes towards Coral Reef Management Strategies and Enforcement indicator was developed as follows:\n The Positive Perception of MPAs Index and Management Support Index were derived by adding up responses to the group of MPA (Q12 in Appendix A) and management (Q13 in Appendix A) questions, respectively, then normalizing to a 0-100 scale using the minimum-maximum scaling method. A respondent had to answer every question contained in the index to receive and index value and answers of \"not sure\" were considered missing when constructing the additive indices.\n Respondent-weighted Positive Perception of MPAs Index values and respondent-weighted Management Support Index values, excluding responses coded as missing, were used to calculate indicator values for each survey respondent.\n So as not to reduce sample size due to the nature of the survey skip pattern associated with the MPA perception questions, the Positive Perception of MPAs Index and Management Support Index were not combined into a single indicator value for each survey respondent. Alternatively, an average of the two respondent weighted average index values was calculated as the indicator value for each jurisdiction in which MPA perception questions were asked, and the mean of the Management Support Index is used as the indicator value in jurisdictions without MPA perception data available.\nKey Results\nAfter consulting with expert opinion, it was decided to weight the Positive perception of MPAs Index and the Management Support Index at 50% and 50%, respectively, as there was no reason to weight one input variable more than the other given that the Positive Perception of MPAs Index variable was not available for all jurisdictions. Exhibit 12 presents the indicator values reflecting that weighting scheme along with information and results for the input variables. To assist with interpretation, these results were bounded by possible values from 0, reflecting strong disagreement with MPAs and opposition toward management strategies among residents; to 100, reflecting all residents having the highest possible agreement with MPA goals and support for management strategies, as defined by the survey.\nExhibit 12.

Although the survey questions cover a multitude of comparable and jurisdictionally specific management strategies and MPA functions, information on the perceptions of MPA functions was unavailable for FL and HI, posing challenges for comparisons across jurisdictions. Specific questions also varied across jurisdictions, and some specific management strategies proposed by the survey may have been more controversial than others.\nPage 17\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nIndicator 4: Self-Reported Awareness and Knowledge of Coral Reefs\nGoal\nThis indicator used NCRMP survey data to synthesize residents' self-reported awareness of threats to the jurisdiction's coral reef habitat and knowledge about specific ecological services the reef provides. The underlying survey data include agreement with statements about coral reef values/functions and awareness of threats to coral reefs (e.g., climate change, coral bleaching), with the specific list of threats tailored to the jurisdiction.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:  NOAA wants to track people's awareness of reef threats to understand how engaged and knowledgeable the population is.  Changes in awareness could reflect behavior changes that lead to improved reef conditions, or support for management strategies to reduce threats.  As more people are aware of threats, support for management actions to address threats may increase.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator used data from NCRMP's resident survey. Exhibit 13 presents the NCRMP variables and the associated values for these input variables to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using a normalized additive index developed based on grouped survey questions (Threat Familiarity Index) and a Likert variable with values reported on a 1\u00ad5 scale (Value_1).\nExhibit 13. Indicator Inputs for Self Reported Awareness and Knowledge of Coral Reefs\n\nSurvey Questions\nThreat Familiarity Index: additive index of threat familiarity questions; increases as familiarity increases Question: How familiar are you with each of the following potential threats facing the coral reefs in the jurisdiction? [list of threats is specific to each jurisdiction]\nValue_1: Please say whether you disagree or agree with each of the following statements: Coral reefs protect the jurisdiction from erosion and natural disasters.\n\nJurisdiction(s) Covered\nAll\nAll\n\nSource NCRMP surveys\nNCRMP surveys\n\nOther Comments\nThreat Familiarity Index normalized to a 0\u00ad100 scale based on question responses of: 1 = very unfamiliar 2 = unfamiliar 3 = neither unfamiliar nor familiar 4 = familiar 5 = very familiar\nBased on question responses of: 1 = strongly disagree 2 = disagree 3 = neither agree nor disagree 4 = agree 5 = strongly agree\n\nCalculation Method\nThe evaluated NCRMP resident survey data included the coded responses for each surveyed resident in a jurisdiction. Respondent weights from FL, HI, and USVI were used to weight responses to best represent the jurisdiction's population where appropriate. Implicit weights of 1.0 were used in the remaining locations (AS, CNMI, GU, and PR).\nThis Self-Reported Awareness and Knowledge of Coral Reefs indicator was developed as follows:\n This indicator was based on a mix of \"index\" variables and \"Likert/ordinal\" variables.\n\nPage 18\n\n\fFinal Report\n\n The \"index\" values were constrained to a defined range (0\u00ad100), while the \"Likert/ordinal\" variables values have a defined set of ordinal responses.\n The Threat Familiarity Index was derived by adding up responses to the group of threat familiarity (Q9 in Appendix A) questions, respectively, then normalizing to a 0-100 scale using the minimum-maximum scaling method. A respondent had to answer every question contained in the index to receive and index value and answers of \"not sure\" were considered missing when constructing the additive index.\n For the \"Likert/ordinal\" variable (Value_1), the 1-5 scale was transformed to 0-1 using the minimum-maximum scaling method, then a weighted average value of the variable was calculated and multiplied by 100 to convert the ranked responses into a numeric value on the same 0\u00ad100 scale so that it could be combined with the index variables.\n Respondent-weighted Threat Familiarity Index and Value_1 values, excluding responses coded as missing, were used to calculate indicator values for each survey respondent.\n The average indicator value is then calculated for each jurisdiction.\nKey Results\nAfter consulting with expert opinion, it was decided to weight the threat familiarity index and value_1 at 75% and 25%, respectively, in calculating the indicator value to avoid giving too much weight to responses for a single question (i.e., value_1) and for consistency with CRCP's greater interest in tracking threat awareness over time. Exhibit 14 presents the indicator values reflecting that weighting scheme, along with information and results for the input variables. To assist with interpretation, these results were bounded by possible values from 0, reflecting strong disagreement with reefs' shoreline protection functions and strong unfamiliarity with reef threats; to 100, reflecting all residents' agreement with reefs' shoreline protection functions and high familiarity with all coral reef threats presented in the survey.\nExhibit 14.

Added stressors brought on by increased population pressure can lead to a decline in reef condition (in the absence of adequate management).\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed with separate components for residents and visitors to the jurisdictions using secondary data. Exhibit 15 presents the data variables used to develop the components of this indicator; along with the jurisdictions covered by each, detailed sources, and comments as to missing years of data and other limitations.\nExhibit 15.

Specifically, the initial formulation combined results in the jurisdictions for changes in resident populations and annual visitors, and the expert reviewers expressed a desire for this information to be disaggregated into separate indicators that reflected changes in residents and changes in annual visitors. This recommendation was incorporated. As a result, while similar methods were used for both indicators, the methods and results for the resident and visitor indicators are presented separately, each with its own confidence ranking.\n\nPage 20\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nThe Human Population Change: Resident Population indicator was developed as follows:\n To the extent possible, annual data for resident populations in each jurisdiction were collected from the sources in Exhibit 15, primarily the U.S. Census and the United Nations, for the years 2010 through 2017.\n Annual values in each year were indexed to the jurisdiction's 2013 resident population value (2013 was selected as this was the first year the NCRMP surveys were administered).\n The resulting relative annual values for the indicator were calculated by dividing the value in a given year by the 2013 reference value.\n As a result, the indicator values are theoretically bounded by 0 at the lower end, but are unconstrained at the upper end.\nThe Human Population Change: Visitors indicator was developed as follows:\n To the extent possible, annual data for total visitors to the jurisdictions were collected from the sources in Exhibit 15 for the years 2010 through 2017.\n Annual values in each year were indexed to the jurisdiction's 2013 visitor population value (2013 was selected as this was the first year the NCRMP surveys were administered).\n The resulting relative annual values were calculated by dividing the value for the number of annual visitors in a given year by the 2013 reference population value.\n As a result of the calculation method, the indicator results are theoretically bounded by 0 at the lower end, but are unconstrained at the upper end.\nKey Results\nExhibit 16 and Exhibit 17 present the results for the resident population and visitor pressure indicator variables, respectively. To assist with their interpretation, indicator values equal 1.000 if there were the same number of residents (or visitors) in a given year compared to the 2013 reference year populations. Values greater than 1 for the indicators show increasing population relative to the reference year, while values less than 1 reflect decreasing population. The population indicator values can be interpreted as the percent change in population (e.g., a value of 1.04 would represent a 4% increase in population). The 2013 resident and visitor populations are also presented in each exhibit to help provide a relative sense of scale for the results across jurisdictions.\nExhibit 16.

Given the nature of economic impacts, an increase in impact may indicate both greater dependence on the ecosystem but also greater stress on the ecosystem. In particular, economic activity creates financial benefits to the local community but has a direct impact on biological condition as it is focused on resource extraction.\nAdditional considerations in the development of this indicator included the following.\n Variation in fishery catch could result from numerous different factors, for example: o Changes in the availability of fish, given changes in reef health; o Impactful climate hazards such as tropical cyclones or bleaching events; o Changes in dependence on ocean resources; o Changes in fishery prices, which affect the effort put into catching fish; o Changes in the value of outside labor opportunities, which also affect effort; or o Changes in fishery policies (e.g., quotas).\n Variation in fishery prices could also result from numerous different factors, for example: o Changes in catch can affect prices directly by changing supply (thus, any variable that affects catch above may also affect prices); o Changes in inflation, which affect prices (this is controlled for); or o Changes in other competing markets that affect prices (e.g., if purchasers can substitute fish from one market with fish from another, that will affect prices).\n Variation in \"normalizing\" variables (i.e., total GDP, employment, establishments) could result from numerous different factors, for example: o Changes in jurisdiction-level growth or other economic factors (interest rates, spending, etc.); or o Changes in the global economy that trickle down to jurisdictional economy.\nThis list demonstrates that variation in the indicator across time and jurisdictions is dependent on numerous factors, and thus must be interpreted taking these factors into account.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using secondary data. Exhibit 18 presents the variables used to develop this indicator along with the jurisdictions covered by each, detailed sources, and comments as to missing years of data and other limitations. This analysis notes that the variables were not mutually exclusive, and in fact in many cases will be highly correlated. For example, commercial fishery revenue is a measure of the price multiplied by the quantity of fish caught and harvested. This is directly tied to several of the other variables, including commercial fishery catch (which is an input to revenue) and living resources GDP, which measures the total value of production from several fisheries-related sectors. The number of fishery licenses will also directly affect fishery catch and fishery revenue. As a result, the choice of numerous input variables should not be thought of as the combination of several independent variables, but rather, the aggregation of several potentially correlated variables.\nThe input variables were also normalized to adjust for jurisdiction-specific factors where possible (see the shaded rows in Exhibit 18). The choice of normalization variable was to adjust for the primary variation expected to affect the numerator variable, and was determined by expert judgment. However, it is noted that there was not a single \"correct\" normalizing variable and not all non-reef variation can be removed from the input variables. This was a limitation of the exercise in creating a single indicator from numerous fishery-related variables. A selection of input variable data for the year 2015 is available in Appendix I.\nPage 23\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 18.

Some data variables were only able to be constructed at the statewide level due to limited availability. B Variables in shaded rows were also used in Indicator 7.\n\nCalculation Method\nThe Economic Impact of Coral Reef Fishing indicator was developed using the following steps:\n\n Raw variables were normalized to account for the overall size of the market, economy, or jurisdiction. There were multiple ways to adjust the input variables, and potential adjustments introduce the variation discussed at the beginning of the section. For example, commercial reef fishery revenues could be reasonably normalized using total commercial fishery revenues or by total GDP. In this case, utilizing total GDP as the denominator allows the indicator to reflect the reef fishery value as a fraction of the total size of the jurisdictional economy. If the analysis were to instead normalize using total commercial fishery revenues, then it would instead capture the size of the reef fishery relative to the total fishery.\n Indicator estimates were constructed from each of the adjusted variables, or as weighted averages of these variables. Because the variables operate on different scales, a \"composite\" indicator is not entirely driven by one variable.\n Recreational Fishing Catch and Commercial Fishing Landings and Revenue were broken down by species, and this assessment focused on highly reef-associated species wholly or predominantly residing and foraging on the reef and all non-fish marine life and fish that use the reef, but do not predominantly reside on the reef. The list of species was vetted by NCRMP fish experts from the biological monitoring teams in the Pacific and Atlantic regions, and a list of the species considered in the economic calculations is available in Appendix E.\n\nPage 26\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nKey Results\nAfter consulting with expert opinion, input variable weights were tailored in each jurisdiction based on data availability to make use of as much data as possible. As a result, jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction comparisons are less relevant with this indicator; however, the status and trends within jurisdictions can be tracked over time. Exhibit 19 presents the final input variable weighting decisions by jurisdiction. As discussed above, the various input variables are not independent of each other and are in some cases highly correlated. However, the input received was to include multiple sources of information, which may contribute variation as a result of different coral reef-related economic impacts.\nIn terms of interpretation, the scale is zero to one, with a zero meaning that coral reef fishing and the living resources sector provide no economic impact and a one meaning that coral reef fishing comprises the jurisdiction's entire fishery and the living resources sector comprises the jurisdiction's entire economy.\nIt is noted that a challenge of constructing and reporting a single indicator was that the input variables may operate on very different scales in different jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions and years, reef fishery yield as a fraction of total fishery yield may be 0.50 or greater (i.e., reef fisheries make up over 50 percent of total fishery yield). However, fishery revenues as a fraction of total jurisdiction GDP may be many orders of magnitude smaller \u00ad i.e., much less than one percent, or less than 0.01. As a result, when a weighted average of the two variables is constructed, the resulting indicator and thus indicator variation is driven chiefly by the fishery yield variable.\nExhibit 19.

Living Resources Establishments and Employment include both coral reef related living resources and non-coral reef related living resources as they could not be separated with the available data. o Most variables were only available for some jurisdictions, originated from numerous sources, or had limited years of data.\n Some data records from the commercial landings data from the PIFSC Western Pacific Fisheries Information Network may have been dropped due to confidentiality issues. Broadly, they generally don't give out data unless whatever the lowest level they give out comprises catch from at least 3 fishers.\n Fishing License data, which was only available for HI and FL, did not specifically examine coral reef fishing, but fishing more generally. In addition, recreational fishing licenses are not required in HI, which could lead to some error in estimates of recreational catch. FWC only provided the recreational fishing license revenue and not the number of licenses.\n Recreational Landings data come from the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP). Data for this program come from a network of voluntary surveys. Since these surveys are voluntary and some weight estimates are missing (Williams and Ma, 2013), there is concern related to margin of error of the estimates.\n The indicator does not include data from subsistence fishing, given lack of broadly available and consistently collected subsistence fishing data.\n Composite indicator values can be heavily influenced by results for one variable.  The use of different input variable weights by jurisdiction will obscure jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction\ncomparisons but will still provide a means for tracking changes over time within a jurisdiction.  Commercial fishing data for FL is at the county level (i.e., reflects FL), whereas recreational\nfishing data for FL is at the state level as MRIP data are not available at the county level.  As the denominator can vary across variables (i.e., total commercial reef yield/total commercial\nyield and total commercial reef revenue/total GDP), this can be considered a metric of coral reef fishing's relative impact to the economy and of coral reef fishing's relative importance to the total fishery, each interacting with one another within the composite indicator.\n\nPage 28\n\n\fFinal Report\nConfidence Ranking\nConsidering the confidence ranking criteria (see Exhibit 6), the results for the Economic Impact of Coral Reef Fishing indicator should be treated with Medium confidence given the number of reliable data sources but with some gaps in available information.\nPage 29\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nIndicator 7: Economic Impact of Tourism to Jurisdiction\nGoal\nThis indicator reflects the economic impact of tourism and recreation on the jurisdictional economy. Given the nature of economic impacts, an increase in impacts may indicate both greater dependence on the ecosystem but also greater stress on the ecosystem. In particular, economic activity creates financial benefits to the local community but has a direct impact on biological condition as more tourism can bring more people in contact with reefs. This indicator examines coral reef tourism where possible, but mainly focuses on tourism in general.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Variation in tourism-related variables could result from numerous factors, e.g.: o Changes in actual reef quality o Changes in jurisdictional spending on marketing of the reefs o Changes in global economy affecting global spending on tourism.\n Variation in \"normalizing\" variables (i.e., total GDP, employment, establishments) could result from numerous different factors, e.g.: o Changes in the jurisdiction-level growth or other economic factors (interest rates, spending, etc.) o Changes in the global economy that trickle down to the jurisdictional economy.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using secondary data. Exhibit 21 presents the variables used to develop this indicator along with the jurisdictions covered by each, detailed sources, and comments as to years of data used and other limitations. The data sources used to normalize the variables found in Exhibit 21 can be found in the shaded rows of Exhibit 18. This analysis notes that the variables were not mutually exclusive, and in fact in many cases will be highly correlated. A selection of input variable data for the year 2015 is available in Appendix I.\nExhibit 21.

To derive value added, spending, and employment related to coral reef National Parks from the National Park Service data, a review of the National Parks of each jurisdiction was conducted to decide which parks contained coral reefs.\nPage 32\n\n\fFinal Report\n\n Indicator estimates could then be constructed from each of the adjusted variables, or as weighted averages of these variables. o Because the variables operate on different scales, a \"composite\" indicator is not entirely driven by one variable.\nKey Results\nAfter consulting with expert opinion, input variable weights were tailored in each jurisdiction based on availability to make use of as much data as possible. As a result, jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction comparisons are obscured with this indicator; however, the status and trends within jurisdictions can be tracked over time. Exhibit 22 presents the final input variable weighting decisions by jurisdiction.\nIn terms of interpretation, the scale is constrained on the lower end by zero, indicating that tourism provides no economic impact; and is unconstrained at the upper bound, increasing as tourism's relative economic impact to the jurisdiction increases. The reason that this indicator is not bounded from zero to one is that the \"total arrivals/population\" variable is theoretically unbounded and is used in the calculation of the final Economic Impact of Tourism indicator.\nExhibit 22.

Associated issues included: o Many variables were not available for all jurisdictions (Tourism and Recreation GDP, Total Air Visitor Spending, etc.) o Many variables were from numerous different sources (Visitor Spending, Hotel Occupancy, etc.) o Visitor Spending had only point estimates for AS and CNMI.\n Hotel Occupancy Rate, Visitor Spending, and Visitor Arrivals did not specifically examine coral reef tourism, but tourism more generally.\n The National Park Service coral reef tourism data are a conservative estimate of total tourism as tourism outside of National Parks are not counted; however, the data provide a way to isolate a form of coral reef tourism.\n Composite indicator values can be heavily influenced by results for one variable.\n\nConfidence Ranking\nConsidering the confidence ranking criteria (see Exhibit 6), the results for the Economic Impact of Tourism indicator should be treated with Medium confidence given the number of reliable data sources but with some gaps in available information in addition to the inherent difficulty of separating out coral reef tourism data from overall tourism data when reliant upon secondary data.\n\nPage 34\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nIndicator 8: Community Well-Being\nGoal\nThe goal of this indicator was to reflect changes in well-being among residents in the jurisdictions. This effort recognizes the complex nature of attempting to quantify an essentially qualitative state such as community well-being. The proposed indicator attempts to leverage principles and approaches used by NOAA and others in similar efforts (e.g., Dillard et al., 2013; Jepson and Colburn, 2013) while accounting for the limitations of available data.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n There is the possibility for sudden, large changes in well-being in a jurisdiction following a significant or catastrophic event (e.g., hurricane, mass bleaching).\n Change is interpreted as general changes in quality of life.  Reefs in good biological condition could increase community well-being and vice-versa.  Many of the consistently available data streams lend themselves to a more \"Western\" view of\nwell-being, in which commonly used metrics in more developed nations are utilized to quantify community well-being. While recognizing that this is sometimes not optimal for small island jurisdictions that may differ in culture and in way of life when compared to U.S. states, this effort is reliant upon data that are available in order to provide a framework for comparability across the jurisdictions.\nInput Variable Data\nThe community well-being indicator was developed using secondary data. Exhibit 24 presents the input variables considered in developing this indicator along with information on the availability of the data by jurisdiction with respect to missing years and other limitations. These input variables have further been organized into general well-being categories using a framework adapted from Dillard et al. (2013). The data used in calculation of this indicator are available in Appendix I.\nExhibit 24.

Due to the high number of variables, a Principle Components Analysis and an FA were initially explored, but deemed to be insufficient due to the small number of sites (seven). A ranking exercise, based on the approach used by Breslow et al. (2017), was used to narrow the original list of potential input variables. The ranking exercise used a scale of 0\u00ad2 to indicate relevance (0 = not/somewhat relevant; 1 = relevant; or 2 = highly relevant) and availability of each variable (0 = unavailable for most jurisdictions; 1 = available for all or most but challenging to get or only somewhat available but easily accessible; or 2 = available for all and easy to get or available for all/ most but may pose minor challenges to access).\n\nUltimately, a subset of 24 input variables were selected based on data availability across the jurisdictions and organized using an adapted framework from Dillard et al. (2013).\n\nThis adapted framework included the following general categories of well-being, and data were collected for variables that influence each category (see Exhibit 24):\n\n Access to social services  Economic security\n\nPage 39\n\n\fFinal Report\n Environmental condition  Social connectedness  Basic needs  Education  Health. This Community Well-being indicator was developed as follows:  To the extent possible, annual data were collected from the sources in Exhibit 24 for the years\n2000 through 2016.  The most recent year of data were used to develop a well-being \"snapshot\"  Variables that contribute negatively to well-being were inversed so that all variables contribute\n\"positively\" to well-being (e.g., poverty rate becomes \"non-poverty rate,\" percent of impervious covers becomes \"percent of non-impervious cover,\" etc.).  All variables were scaled using the minimum-maximum method to a 0\u00ad1 scale (variables in percentage form were kept on a 0\u00ad1 scale unadjusted)  Sub-indicators for each of the aforementioned well-being categories were calculated through an equally weighted additive index and then multiplied by 100 to convert to a 0\u00ad100 scale.  These sub-indicators were then used to calculate the composite well-being indicator through an equally weighted additive method.  As a result of the calculation method, the indicator results are theoretically bounded by 0 at the lower end, and 100 at the upper end.\nKey Results\nDuring the December 2018 expert workshops, it was agreed upon to weight each input category of wellbeing indicator equally considering the demographic differences across the jurisdictions, the inherently place-based nature of well-being, and the difficulty in deeming one category of well-being to supersede over another. Exhibit 25 presents the results reflecting the equal weighting of the input variable categories presented in Exhibit 24. Weights for individual input variables in this option were based on the number of variables in a category where, with seven input variable categories, a 14.3% weight for each category was then divided by the number of input variables in the category and the resulting value was assigned to each individual input variable in the category. To assist with interpretation, a resulting value of 0 indicates the jurisdiction had zero for every variable (e.g., $0 in median household income, 100% poverty), and a value of 100 indicates that the jurisdiction had the highest level of all variables when compared to all other jurisdictions. Another important note is that the results for well-being can only be interpreted relative to one another as the data used in the minimum-maximum scaling only correspond to the seven jurisdictions.\nPage 40\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 25.

However, these metrics can be considered as the most recent status of community well-being, as it is defined in this report, based on the most recent data available.\n The direct link between human well-being and coral health is not always clear.\n\nConfidence Ranking\nConsidering the confidence ranking criteria (see Exhibit 6), the results for the Well-being indicator should be treated with Low confidence given the complex nature of the concept of well-being across such different geographies and the reliance upon a variety of different data sources for single variables. This ranking was also consistent with the recognition there are gaps in the available information for input variables that complicate some of the within and across jurisdiction comparisons, and that the \"snapshot\" approach reflects different years of data for some variables. Further, attributing some portion of wellbeing directly to coral reefs is highly difficult with the data that are available.\n\nPage 41\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nIndicator 9: Cultural Importance of Reefs\nGoal\nThis indicator used NCRMP survey data to account for residents' belief in the importance of coral reefs for a jurisdiction's cultures.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Hard to quantify in a lot of cases, but the cultural importance of coral reefs and how they impact island fishing communities is well-documented.\n Has to do with the way people interact with the resource and how they value the resource.  \"Culture\" is not just \"traditional culture\" \u00ad culture is dynamic and involving \u00ad incorporates\ntradition and current values and norms and behavior.  Some participation in traditional practices could be on the decline.  If people's culture is tied to directly to reefs, we would expect more awareness of the issue and\nmore reverence/care for the reefs, which should translate into better biological condition compared to a situation where the reefs are not culturally important and no one cares about condition.  Issue that residents could be respectful of reefs, but tourists may not be.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using data from NCRMP's resident survey. Exhibit 26 presents the NCRMP variable and the associated values for the input variable to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using values initially reported on a 1\u00ad5 scale.\nExhibit 26.

Respondent weights from FL, HI, and USVI were used to weight responses to best represent the jurisdiction's population where appropriate. Implicit weights of 1.0 were used in the remaining locations (AS, CNMI, GU, and PR).\n\nThis Cultural Importance indicator was developed as follows:\n\n For Value_4, the 1-5 scale was transformed to 0-1 using the minimum-maximum scaling method, then a weighted average value of the variable was calculated and multiplied by 100 to convert the ranked responses into a numeric value on the same 0\u00ad100 scale so that it could be compared more easily with other survey-based indicator values.\n The average indicator value is then calculated for each jurisdiction.\n\nKey Results\nExhibit 27 presents the results for the Cultural Importance indicator. To assist with interpretation, these results are bounded by possible values from 0, reflecting no cultural importance among residents, to 100, reflecting maximum importance, as defined by the survey.\n\nPage 42\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 27.

Given this and the complex, in many cases, qualitative nature of cultural importance, the results for the Cultural Importance indicator should be treated with Low confidence.\n\nPage 43\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nIndicator 10: Participation in Behaviors that May Improve Coral Reef Health\nGoal\nThis indicator used NCRMP survey data to account for residents' level of activity supporting coral reef habitats.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n To measure resident activism/apathy toward environmentally friendly behavior.  Trying to understand in what ways people interact with the environment and if NOAA can draw\nupon positive behavior for coral reef protection.  May change where targeted education and outreach are improved or if there is a new mechanism\nto support community involvement (i.e., recycling rates may change when bins are provided, make people aware, make it easy and socially desirable).  Higher levels of individual involvement in pro-environmental behavior will ideally translate into reduced environmental impacts on coral reefs and associated ecosystems.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using data from NCRMP's resident survey. Exhibit 28 presents the NCRMP variable and the associated values for the input variable to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using values initially reported on a 1\u00ad5 scale.\nExhibit 28.

Additional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n More infrastructure near reefs can cause more runoff, Land-Based Sources of Pollution, and other stressors to the ecosystem which can harm their biological condition.\n Potential differences in impact depending on the quality or nature of the infrastructure. Damaging infrastructure (i.e., impermeable surfaces like pavement) versus infrastructure with a positive or neutral impact on coral reefs (i.e., installation of rain gardens, properly management wastewater treatment plant).\n Infrastructure that is damaging in some contexts can also mitigate harm in others (i.e., paving dirt roads may reduce sedimentation).\n Depends on human population change as more people tend to need more infrastructure.  Other spatial and physical conditions could influence infrastructure's long-term impact such as\ndistance to the reef, slope, intensity of rainfall, wind direction, coastal currents, among others.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using secondary data. Exhibit 30 presents the seven data variables used to develop this indicator along with the jurisdictions covered by each, detailed sources, and comments as to years of data used and other limitations. To develop the indicator, a set of major categories for infrastructure-related stressors was identified and input variables were selected. The research starting point was ReefBase's online database, which is a project by WorldFish (member of CGIAR) (WorldFish, 2019). The database synthesizes historical information from various state reports (such as those produced by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network) across 18 human threat categories. The information was it not necessary comprehensive, but likely representative of relevant reef threats. These entries were used as a proxy to understand the importance of human stressors to each jurisdiction and identify possible data sources for further research. Researchers ultimately focused on finding consistent data across all jurisdictions for the categories of:\n Agriculture  Coastal development  Industrial and marine pollution  Military operations (due to the prevalence of vessel and amphibious training activities,\nunexploded ordinance, bombing targets, etc., especially in the territories)  Sewage  Solid waste. The data used in calculation of this indicator are available in Appendix I.\nPage 46\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 30.

All absolute value variables were normalized by the length of coastline4 (e.g., NPDES\npermits/mile of coast, toxic releases/mile of coast).  All variables were scaled using the min-max method to a 0\u00ad1 scale (variables in percentage form\nwere kept on a 0\u00ad1 scale unadjusted).  The variables were then used to calculate the composite physical infrastructure indicator through\nan equally weighted additive method.  As a result of the calculation method, the indicator results are theoretically bounded by 0 at the\nlower end, and 100 at the upper end.\n\nKey Results\nExhibit 31 presents the results of the physical infrastructure indicator. Each of the categories are weighted equally due to the varying nature of development impact and type across the jurisdictions, and the difficulty in deeming one category of physical infrastructure to be superseding over another. To assist with interpretation, a resulting value of 0 indicates the jurisdiction has zero for every variable (e.g., 0 toxic releases, no impervious cover), and a value of 100 indicates that the jurisdiction has the highest level of all variables when compared to all other jurisdictions. Another important note is that the results for physical infrastructure can only be interpreted relative to one another as the data used in the minimum-maximum scaling only correspond to the seven jurisdictions.\n\n4 Rose Atoll (AS), The Northern Islands (CNMI), and the Northwest Hawaiian Islands (HI) were not included in these calculations.\nPage 48\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 31.

However, these metrics can be considered as the most recent status of physical infrastructure, as it is defined in this report, based on the most recent data available.\n\nConfidence Ranking\nConsidering the confidence ranking criteria (see Exhibit 6), the results for the Physical Infrastructure indicator should be treated with Medium confidence given the number of reliable data sources, with some gaps in available information and that the \"snapshot\" approach reflects different years of data for some variables.\n\nPage 49\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nIndicator 12: Awareness of Coral Reef Rules and Regulations\nGoal\nThis indicator used NCRMP survey data to account for residents' level of familiarity with MPAs/marine managed areas/marine preserves.\nAdditional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Behaviors, norms, or customary rules depends on the type of protection reef has such as an MPA.  If people are not aware of rules and regulations then it is hard to follow them. Also depends on\nenforcement.  More awareness can lead to more support for and compliance with rules and regulations, ideally\nleading to improved biological condition.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using data from NCRMP's resident survey. Exhibit 32 presents the NCRMP variable and the associated values for the input variables to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using values initially reported on a 1\u00ad5 scale.\nExhibit 32.

Given data constraints, the indicator only covers governance of MPAs in coral reef jurisdictions. Additional considerations and assumptions in the development of this indicator included:\n Level of enforcement and implementation \u00ad what resources have been provided for protection and enforcement (e.g. number of officers, boats, time spent in protected areas, prosecution).\n Dependent on the intensity of use of these reefs (varies by jurisdiction).  More effective governance is hoped to decrease negative human impacts, provide a basis for\necosystem improvement and then improve biological condition.  Governance effectiveness is challenging to evaluate through secondary data alone, and assumes\ndirect connections between management action and changes in biological condition and/or human behavior.\nInput Variable Data\nThis indicator was developed using data from NOAA's MPA Checklist survey (Wusinich-Mendez and Holst, 2011). The MPA checklist has been administered to select staff involved with administering coral reef MPAs in the different jurisdictions seeking information from a prioritized subset of the coral reef sites in the jurisdiction (the survey has not been administered in FL). To date, the survey has been administered three times, in 2011, 2014, and 2017. The questions posed in the survey have changed in various iterations. There were no respondent weights associated with the survey responses.\nExhibit 34 presents the 12 variables that have data across all three iterations of the MPA Checklist survey and the associated values for these input variables to the indicator. In this case, the indicator was developed using values initially reported on a 1\u00ad3 scale.\nExhibit 34.

To assist with interpretation, these results are bounded by possible values from 1, reflecting the lowest level of effective governance of the surveyed reef habitats in a jurisdiction, to 3, reflecting exceptional governance in the surveyed reef habitats.\nExhibit 35.

However, a jurisdictionally specific question was asked in the South Florida NCRMP survey in regards to resident familiarity with various organizations and/or agencies working to protect Florida's reefs. While not a viable assessment of governance, results do indicate that South Florida residents are generally familiar with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and the FWC, and less familiar with the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Initiative and the Our Florida Reefs Community Planning Process. Although we cannot produce a governance metric for South Florida after this first round of monitoring, these results do lend some context to the state of awareness surrounding South Florida's governance of coral reefs.\n As of this time, governance as it is defined in this report is specific to MPAs and not to other aspects of environmental governance at the jurisdiction level more broadly.\n\nConfidence Ranking\nConsidering the confidence ranking criteria (see Exhibit 6), the results for the Governance indicator should be treated with Low confidence. While this measures the effectiveness of only one type of governance regime (MPAs), the checklist remains the only known uniform assessment of coral reef governance in the U.S. coral reef jurisdictions (from the perspective of managers), as a result this is an appropriate ranking considering the limited number of respondents who contribute to the MPA Checklist, the limited number of MPAs considered in the assessment, the incomplete coverage of reef habitats in the jurisdictions, the lack of data for South Florida, and the approximate nature of the relationship between the input variables and the goal of the indicator.\n\nPage 53\n\n\fFinal Report\n\n3. Further Analysis of Survey-Based Indicators\n\nSurvey-based indicators are further analyzed in this section to investigate similarities and differences across the jurisdictions, across oceanic basins, and to investigate interactions with other variables collected in the surveys. First, one-way ANOVA tests are used to test for significant differences in the means for each survey-based indicator. Exhibit 36 below details the results.\nExhibit 36.

In addition to crossjurisdictional comparisons, t-tests are used to test for significant differences in the means for each surveybased indicator across the Atlantic (South Florida, Puerto Rico, USVI) and Pacific (Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, CNMI) oceanic basins. These results are shown in Exhibit 37.\nPage 54\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 377.

Residents in Pacific jurisdictions were found to participate in a greater number of marine activities more frequently, have a more positive perception of marine resource condition, have less (although still relatively high on the scale) support for coral reef management, have a higher level of self-reported knowledge of coral reefs, agree more with the cultural importance of reefs, participate more frequently in pro-environmental behavior, and be more familiar with reef rules and regulations when compared to residents of Atlantic jurisdictions.\nA Pearson Correlation Analysis was then done to investigate if significant directional relationships exist between indicators and other variables collected in NCRMP resident surveys. Exhibit 38 details these results, while key findings are highlighted below.\nResults indicate that participation in reef activities is positively correlated with perceived resource condition, self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, cultural importance of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of coral reef rules and regulations; and negatively correlated with management support and positive MPA perceptions.\nPerceived resource condition is found to be positively correlated with participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of coral reef rules and regulations; but negatively correlated with positive perceptions of MPAs and self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs.\nPositive perceptions of MPAs is positively correlated with management support, self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, and cultural importance of reefs.\nManagement support is positively correlated with self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, cultural importance of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations.\nSelf-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs is positively correlated with cultural importance of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations.\nCultural importance of reefs is positively correlated with participation in behaviors that may improve reef health and awareness of reef rules and regulations.\nPage 55\n\n\fFinal Report\nParticipation in behaviors that may improve reef health is positively correlated with awareness of reef rules and regulations. Other variables analyzed include those who fish and gather, those who dive/snorkel, those who fish to feed themselves, those who fish to sell their catch, those who consume seafood at least once per week, those who agree that reefs are only important to fishermen, divers, and snorkelers, those who agree that reefs attract tourists, those who believe the threat level to reefs is \"large\" or \"extreme\", those who believe their community is at least moderately involved in managing coral reefs, those who report that they themselves are at least moderately involved in coral reef management, those who obtain environmental information from various sources, and demographics. Some selected results are further described below. Residents who fish or gather for marine resources are positively correlated with perceived resource condition, self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, cultural importance of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations; but negatively correlated with management support and positive perceptions of MPAs. Residents who dive or snorkel are positively correlated with the same indicators as those who fish or gather, but are not significantly correlated with management support or MPA perceptions. Residents who fish for sustenance are positively correlated with self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations. Residents who fish to sell their catch are positively correlated with perceived resource condition, selfreported awareness and knowledge of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations; but negatively correlated with positive perceptions of MPAs. Residents who consume seafood at least once per week are positively correlated with participation in reef activities, perceived resource condition, self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, cultural importance of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations; but negatively correlated with positive perceptions of MPAs. Residents who believe the threat level coral reefs are \"large\" or \"extreme\" are positively correlated with participation in reef activities, management support, positive perceptions of MPAs, self-reported awareness and knowledge of reefs, cultural importance of reefs, participation in behaviors that may improve reef health, and awareness of reef rules and regulations; but negatively correlated with perceived resource condition.\nPage 56\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nExhibit 388.

First, developing consistent indicators for each thematic area across widely different geographies is a challenge, and is constrained by a number of items including data availability or accessibility, data consistency, vast cultural differences, and the need to minimize burden placed on survey respondents. While these challenges are noted, the culmination of this effort represents NOAA's first attempt to standardize the socioeconomic monitoring of U.S. coral reef jurisdictions through systematic primary and secondary data collection and also serves as the baseline for NCRMP socioeconomic monitoring moving forward.\n\nPage 61\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nParticipation in reef activities: Results indicate that HI and AS residents participate at the highest levels, while PR residents participate at the lowest level. AS residents have the highest participation frequency in extractive activities, while HI residents have the highest participation frequency in recreational-based activities. It should be noted that although the indicator values look relatively low when compared to the 0-100 scale of the index, that does not mean that participation rates are low, but rather participation frequency is not observed to approach the maximum (as defined by the survey) in all activities for most residents, as the index measures frequency of activity participation across a wide range of activities from never, once a month or less, 2\u00ad3 times per month, or 4 times a month or more.\nPerceived resource condition: All jurisdictions hover just below or around the midpoint of the index (50), indicating that marine resource condition is not perceived as overly bad, nor overly good, in any jurisdiction. CNMI held the most positive perception of resource condition, with the most negative perception observed in PR. Overall, most residents across the jurisdictions, on average, felt marine resource condition had gotten somewhat worse over the last 10 years. The average perception of anticipated change is also below the midpoint for most jurisdictions, suggesting a lack of optimism toward future marine resource condition.\nAttitudes toward coral reef management strategies and enforcement: Jurisdictions exhibit relatively positive attitudes toward management in terms of agreement with MPA functions5 and support for management activities. The most positive perception is observed in PR, and the most negative perception was observed in AS. The latter result could be due in part to the fact that management support survey questions varied across jurisdictions (with the aim of asking locally relevant management questions), and the management strategies presented to respondents in AS were much more specific in nature than in other jurisdictions, including some recent controversial legislative actions. This indicator is targeted for improvement by including questions related to MPA functions in future surveys of FL and HI.\nSelf-reported awareness and knowledge of coral reefs: Residents of all of the jurisdictions self-reported that they were generally aware of various coral reef threats, especially tropical cyclones and pollution, and generally agreed that coral reefs provided shoreline protection. Residents across jurisdictions indicated less familiarity with threats like coral bleaching and coral disease, conditions that are not as visible from above the water. Residents of CNMI had the highest level of self-reported threat familiarity, and PR residents had the lowest levels of self-reported threat familiarity.\nHuman population change: AS, CNMI, FL, GU, and HI have all experienced a resident population increase since 2013 (the first year NCRMP surveys were administered), with the largest increase of 5% observed in FL. Conversely, PR and USVI have experienced a decrease in resident population. In terms of the visitor population, all jurisdictions except for AS have experienced an increase in visitors relative to the number of visitors in 2013. Overall, there is increasing population pressure in these coral reef adjacent communities.\nEconomic impact of coral reef fishing and dive/snorkel tourism: These indicators were highly constrained by data availability and consistency. In an effort to make use of as much relevant data as possible, the variables chosen to comprise these indicators are different for each jurisdiction, posing challenges for jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction comparisons, but allowing for these indicators to be tracked over time within each jurisdiction. Therefore, while not being able to compare results directly to one another, a few general conclusions can be drawn. The highest value for the economic impact of coral reef fishing indicator is for PR, which indicates that approximately 23% of the combined activity in commercial fishery revenue, commercial fishery yield, recreational fishery yield, business employment, and business establishments is related to fishing for reef-associated species (for fishery revenue and yield) and the living resources sector (for employment and establishments). The lowest value for the economic\n\n5 Note that questions about MPA functions were not asked in FL or HI.\n\nPage 62\n\n\fFinal Report\nimpact of coral reef fishing indicator is for CNMI, indicating that approximately 5% of the combined activity in commercial fishery revenue, commercial fishery yield, business employment, and business establishments is related to fishing for reef-associated species (for fishery revenue and yield) and the living resources sector (for employment and establishments). As for tourism, this indicator posed an additional challenge of trying to separate coral reefrelated tourism from tourism in general. At this point, secondary data is not collected in a systematic way that allows for researchers to parse out tourism directly related to reefs, so this indicator is instead a reflection of overall tourism in the jurisdictions, a sub-section of which is tied to coral reefs. In some cases (National Park tourism data), researchers were able to target data on visitation to parks that include reefs. When examining results, HI and CNMI appear to experience consistently high tourism economic impacts, and AS is observed to be the jurisdiction with the lowest tourism economic impact. Guam and USVI are also noted for their relatively higher tourism indicator values; in fact, visitor spending has exceeded resident spending in the USVI for the years 2012-2016.\nWhile the reported indicator results reflect tourism in general, there are some studies that can lend context to the economic impact of dive/snorkel tourism more specifically in the jurisdictions. Leeworthy (2018a) conducted a survey in Puerto Rico from May 2016 to April 2017, and found that 33.91% of recreating visitors were reef-using visitors. Of these reef-using visitors, 360,745 (30.8%) and 22,673 (1.9%) engaged in snorkeling and diving, respectively. Leeworthy (2018b) used these figures to estimate visitor expenditures related to diving/snorkeling, and found that over $12.7 million (2017$) in visitor expenditures can be attributed to those activities.\nIn South Florida, it was found that visitors spent 4,737,364 person-days diving and 2,125,572 person-days snorkeling in the coral reefs of Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties (Johns et al. 2001), and 3,804 persondays diving and 6,262 person-days snorkeling in the coral reefs of Martin County (Johns et al. 2004). Using the use value per person-day figures calculated in these reports, snorkeling and diving in South Florida's coral reefs produces an annual direct expenditure value of $188.5 million year 2017 dollars. A more recent study conducted by Leeworthy et al. (2010) updated the previously mentioned figures, but only for Monroe County. The updated study found that visitors spent 1,854,400 and 451,800 person-days snorkeling and diving, respectively in the Florida Keys from December 2007 \u00ad November 2008. The snorkeling figure is an increase of 8,920 from 1996, and the diving figure is a decrease of 15,470 from 1996.\nCesar and van Beukering (2004) found that visiting recreational divers in Hawaii generated $12.4 million in direct expenditures, and that visiting recreational snorkelers generated $68.1 million in direct expenditures (2017$) in 2001. Using multiplier effects, the authors calculated the total economic value added (direct and indirect) from recreational diving and snorkeling by visitors in Hawaii to be $380.7 million in 2001.\nIn 2016, it was found that Guam's coral reefs host over 300,000 tourist snorkelers and 100,000 tourist scuba divers (QMark Research 2016a, 2016b). Further, over 30% of visitors cite the marine environment as a top reason for visiting Guam (Guam Visitors Bureau 2018).\nVan Beukering et al. (2006) estimate that approximately 199,500 dives by visitors take place in Saipan annually. These dives generate an annual direct economic value of $5.1 million (2017$) on Saipan. It was also estimated that snorkel trips (including both residents and visitors) generate over $1 million (2017$) in direct economic value annually on Saipan.\nVan Beukering (2011) found that 42.46% of cruise visitors and 43.46% of air visitors report that their motivation to visit the USVI is coral reef-related. Further, the authors calculated the annual economic value of diving and snorkeling in the USVI to be 14.7 million (2017$).\nWhile these studies certainly provide more nuanced details with regards to dive/snorkel tourism and its economic impact, they were ultimately not included in the final tourism indicator calculations as these assessments are not\nPage 63\n\n\fFinal Report\navailable across all of the jurisdictions in a methodologically similar way, and the data are not tracked over time in a systematic uniform fashion.\nCommunity well-being: This also proved to be a complex indicator with data availability constraints. Variables were selected first based on relevant connections to the concept of well-being and its sub-categories (adapted from Dillard et al., 2013). The list of variables was further pared down based on their availability across jurisdictions. Once selected, the most recent year of data for each variable in each jurisdiction was used. Due to this temporal variation, this indicator can be interpreted as \"community well-being in 2018, based on the most recent data available.\" Given this framing, HI exhibits the highest level of community well-being, mostly driven by economic security and health. AS exhibits the lowest (but not necessarily \"low\") community well-being indicator value amongst the jurisdictions, and this is mostly driven by economic security and basic needs.\nCultural importance of reefs: All of the jurisdictions exhibit a relatively strong cultural connection to reefs and recognize reefs as important to their respective cultures. While all exhibited high levels of agreement with the cultural importance of reefs, HI was observed to have the highest indicator value, and PR had the lowest. This indicator is targeted for improvement in the next round of surveys as it is currently based on only one survey question.\nParticipation in behaviors that may improve coral reef health: This indicator is also targeted for improvement since it is based on a single survey question. Participation rates varied across the jurisdictions, with HI residents participating most frequently and PR residents participating least frequently.\nPhysical infrastructure: The jurisdictions experience vastly different levels of development and military presence. GU exhibits the highest level of physical infrastructure, chiefly driven by military presence relative to total coastline length, whereas AS exhibits the least physical infrastructure. At first glance, the low indicator value for physical infrastructure in FL may seem counter-intuitive given that it has a densely developed coastline and contains reefs in somewhat poor health. While the absolute value of consultation permits and NPDES permits in FL dwarf the other jurisdictions, when normalizing by miles of coastline, it tells a different story.\nAwareness of coral reef rules and regulations: All of the jurisdictions range from \"neither familiar nor unfamiliar\" to slightly familiar with MPAs/marine managed areas/marine preserves (except for PR; in which familiarity is comparatively low). This indicator is also targeted for improvement as it is based on a single question corresponding to a single generalizable regulation, and the question was not asked in FL during the first round of surveys.\nGovernance: The MPA Checklist, conducted by NOAA CRCP, was used to track governance in the jurisdictions, informed by the perceptions of jurisdictional reef managers. Based on the 2017 results, HI exhibits the highest indicator value for governance, while USVI has the lowest. As of 2017, all jurisdictions have increased their governance indicator value since 2011, indicating positive advancements in meeting or exceeding governance targets in the thematic areas of the MPA Checklist. This indicator is targeted for improvement for the next round of surveys. The research team is exploring options for conducting a more comprehensive survey of reef managers to encompass perceptions concerning governance across the entirety of each jurisdiction instead of a subset of MPA(s).\nA few indicators have been targeted for improvement in the next round of primary data collection. First, the NCRMP team will be adding a contingent valuation dichotomous choice question to the next round of surveys in order to estimate resident willingness-to-pay for coral reef conservation. This will lend more context to the economic indicators in articulating the value that residents place on coral reefs. Secondly, additional questions concerning the cultural importance of reefs and awareness of coral reef rules and regulations will be added. The participation in proenvironmental behavior question will be broken down into specific activities (e.g., recycling, volunteering with environmental groups) to understand more nuanced participation rates for different pro-environmental activities. The\nPage 64\n\n\fFinal Report\nNCRMP team will also push to include MPA questions (awareness of and agreement with functions) in future surveys in all jurisdictions. Other improvements include adding a question on the frequency of fishing for various species that are important to each jurisdiction, and adding question to examine the consumption of locally harvested coral reef seafood in addition to seafood consumption in general. These changes should improve the status of primary data collection and make certain indicators more robust as the second round of socioeconomic monitoring begins. As for secondary data, this effort proved incredibly useful in terms of identifying and synthesizing relevant data sources. For indicators derived from secondary data, researchers will always be constrained by what is available. During the second round of monitoring, the research team will continue to collect data from the sources identified in this report and will explore other data sources as they become available. Overall, this first round of indicator collection and development is significant for its accomplishment in developing and applying clear and reasonable methods to incorporate available information, much of it generated from NOAA, into concise measures that can help inform future management decisions. This is particularly true with respect to the survey-based indicators, from both the NCRMP and MPA Checklist surveys, where intra- and inter-jurisdiction comparisons will become increasingly possible, relevant, and insightful as data from future rounds of surveys and secondary data collection are incorporated. Continued review and refinement of these indicators and the input variable data on which they rely has the potential to increase the robustness of the resulting series of indicator values. With this information, scientists, practitioners, and coral reef managers in the jurisdictions can integrate social and biophysical data streams to obtain a more in-depth understanding of social-ecological relationships. These indicators also support communication, by taking a complex array of variables and joining them together in single, trackable metrics that are intended to encompass the general breadth of a concept. As socioeconomic monitoring continues, these indicators will be tracked to make relevant temporal comparisons, and they will be improved as resident survey questions are refined and new data streams become available.\nPage 65\n\n\fFinal Report\n5.

Program: Socioeconomic Indicator Development Webinar Series \u00ad Round 1\nExpert Panel on Attitudes, Perceptions, and Behaviors Indicators (July 27, 2018)\nParticipants:\n Experts: o Chris Wynveen (Baylor University) o Dalton Helsey (University Miami) o Dr. Gary Green (University of Georgia) o Kirsten Oleson (University HI-Manila) o Kirsten Leong (Pacific Island Fisheries Island Center) o Nadine Heck (University of California Santa Cruz)\n NOAA: Jarrod Loerzel, Matt Gorstein, Chloe Fleming, Peter Edwards  Abt Associates: Kelly Peak, Susan Taylor, and Claire Goydan\nNotes: Indicator 1: Participation in reef activities\nDiscussion question: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering?\nParticipants generally agreed that the existing questions related to participation in reef activities were appropriate. They agreed that the questions are useful but in some cases are not specific enough to reefs (e.g., \"recreation activities\"), and in other cases may miss interactions with marine resources more generally. One participant was concerned that question structure may prime participants to think about coral reefs in a specific way (e.g., generate some sort of desirability bias). One participant also noted that it would be useful to know the extent to which participants undertook harvest versus non-harvest (e.g., catch and release) activities.\nIndicator 2: Perceived resource condition\nDiscussion question: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering?\nParticipants generally agreed with the data, but one participant noted that crowd sourcing questions would be a useful addition.\nIndicator 4: Awareness and knowledge of coral reefs\nDiscussion question: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering?\nParticipants noted that questions may receive different responses if you ask whether \"water quality is an issue for them, the ecosystem, or the region.\" Participants also noted that it will be useful to understand why people are concerned about coral reefs. Another participant noted that understanding awareness of disease is important, too.\nIndicator 9: Cultural importance of reefs\nDiscussion question: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering?\nParticipants discussed trade-offs between open ended and closed form questions. Some participants also\nPage 95\n\n\fFinal Report\nnoted the value of exploring place attachment literature and to investigate the PIFSC Community Profiles \u00ad Technical Memoranda. Discussion questions: Are there additional cultural data variables that should be considered? How do we gather more qualitative (rather than spatial or quantitative) aspects of culture in a consistent way? Participants discussed place-attachment surveys, and other information available through citizen science and other outlets (e.g., Coral Restoration Consortium for FL).\nIndicator 10: Participation in behaviors that may improve coral reef health\nDiscussion questions: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering? What type of behaviors have a relevant impact on coral reef health? Participants provided feedback that it would also be useful to ask about indirect effects, and also to get information about behaviors that arise upstream (e.g., homeowners upstream).\nIndicator Development Methodology\nDiscussion questions: Which variables should be weighted more/less heavily? Is one indicator sufficient or is there a need for multiple indicators? Should we consider creating Uber or grouped indicators? Participants noted that the right variable depends on the question, and some participants also noted that collapsing or combining variables loses information. One participant suggested looking at the Great Barrier Reef Report card as an example.\nPage 96\n\n\fFinal Report\nExpert Panel on Economic Indicators (July 30, 2018) Participants:\n Experts: o Amy Freitag (Oxford Lab in MD, works on FL Keys project looking at economic impact of new management scheme) o Gabe Sataloff (NOAA Office for Coastal Management, geospatial analyst, ENOW) o Jen Raynor (economist in Pacific Islands Science Center) o Kirsten Oleson (Professor at University of Hawaii, economic impacts on Palau National Marine Sanctuary, working with Hawaii team on 30x30 initiative) o Scott Crosson (NMFS, commercial and recreational fisheries in Caribbean and Florida) o Giselle Samonte (economist at Office of Habitat Conservation) o Maya Ward (Hawaii Coral Reef Initiative, PhD student at UH, 30x30 initiative) o Nadine Heck (research scientist at UC Santa Cruz)\n NOAA: Jarrod Loerzel, Matt Gorstein, Chloe Fleming, Peter Edwards  Abt Associates: Kelly Peak, Susan Taylor, and Miranda Marks\nNotes:\nIndicator 6: Economic impact of coral reef fishing to jurisdiction \u00ad Data\nDiscussion question: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering?\nParticipants noted that MRIP doesn't completely capture subsistence fishing. Participants also noted that both ENOW and ENOW Self-Employed should be utilized, and that recreational fishery data is under the Ocean Recreation/Tourism files. Participants agreed that separating reef and bottom fish from all species was a valuable step. Participants also agreed that there is a limitation associated with splitting out reef fish from a broader set of species. The discussion also acknowledged the challenges associated with consistency across regions.\nIndicator 7: Economic impact of dive/snorkel tourism to jurisdiction \u00ad Data\nDiscussion question: Is this the right data? Any other secondary sources we should be considering?\nParticipants generally agreed that the ENOW recreation data was a reasonable source for recreationrelated data, and identified tourism-office expenditure information as another useful source of data (e.g., survey being done in Hawaii on snorkel/dive tourism). Note that expenditure surveys do not reflect nonmarket value of reefs. One participant also noted that increasing tourism may decrease value of reef to residents. There was some discussion of scaling down overall tourism to reflect reef-related tourism.\nRefining Data\nDiscussion questions: Which variables are most relevant and reflective of the economic impacts of coral reefs in each jurisdiction? Is it more informative to understand the absolute size of the coral reef economy across regions, or to understand how the economy changes in importance within a jurisdiction?\nParticipants agreed better to control for relative size of economy and show normalized figures.\nIndicator Development Methodology\nDiscussion questions: Which variables should be weighted more/less heavily? Is one indicator sufficient or is there a need for multiple indicators? Should we consider creating Uber or grouped indicators?\nParticipants identified sources of information related to social and resilience indicators, and one participant noted that value of taking a composite estimate and breaking it down into smaller pieces.\nPage 97\n\n\fFinal Report\nExpert Panel on Management Indicators (July 30, 2018)\nParticipants:\n Experts: o Chris Wynveen (Baylor University researching human dimensions of resource management, stakeholder involvement and public outreach) o Kirsten Oleson (University of Hawaii, economics professor) o Kirsten Leong (Social Scientist with NOAA fisheries and Pacific Island Fishery Science Center) o Maya Ward (Hawaii Coral Reef Initiative, Economics PHD student at University of Hawaii at Manoa) o Nadine Heck (Research Scientist at the University of California Santa Cruz) o Supin Wongbusarakum (Pacific Island Fishery Science Center in Honolulu, Pacific Islander Coordinator for the Global Modeling Network, build capacity and support economic monitoring)\n NOAA: Jarrod Loerzel, Matt Gorstein, Chloe Fleming, Peter Edwards  Abt Associates: Kelly Peak, Susan Taylor, and Sara Sokolinski\nNotes: Indicator 3: Attitudes toward coral reef management strategies and enforcement\nDiscussion question: What types of data should feed into these indicators?\nParticipants discussed the use of the MPA survey and what benefits it captured. It captures the managerial and economic benefits and not the biological and physical benefits. A participant asked how do we value cultural/heritage benefits. For example, Micronesia experience shows the importance of incorporating the local knowledge and community input into management. There was a question on traditional knowledge in American Samoa and CNMI. Local partners wanted the question, but it does not mean the same thing in different jurisdictions. A participant suggested using the phrasing \"way of life.\"\nParticipants asked if there was a way to ask people what they want/expect from management. However, it was pointed out that most people don't know which agency is responsible for managing different resources. For example, people confuse state fisheries with NOAA. In Florida a question was asked about familiarity with different organizations, but that does not necessarily translate to knowing what they do.\nParticipants discussed how the needs of this ecosystem approach are met. Survey questions must balance between the average person and key/minimal resource users. Questions could gauge the public's knowledge of ecosystem approaches but must be worded carefully. However, a participant pointed out that it is the individual responses that make it an ecosystem approach. Questions should include maps and being very clear on boundaries and what is being asked. Specific boundaries were not presented because they would change from year to year. Questions were asked more generally on opinions on zoning and MPAs. Some jurisdictions (Florida) pushed back against using the terminology MPA which limited some questions from being included.\nIndicator 12: Awareness of coral reef rules and regulations\nDiscussion question: Are there additional, relevant rules and regulations related to coral reefs in the jurisdictions (beyond MPAs) that should be considered?\nPage 98\n\n\fFinal Report\nA participant asked about questions on how people protect coastal resources. There were questions on how involved in management people were. The participant pointed out there are many informal/ traditional rules and will forward on a tool for Pacific Islands for MPA management questions.\nIndicator 13: Governance\nDiscussion question: What governance topics are most relevant to coral reef conservation?\nParticipants discussed the need to define MPA clearly. In the survey it is defined as an area of the ocean where human activity is restricted to protect living, nonliving, cultural, and/or historic resources. However, secondary sources use NOAA's definition which limits most if not all of local, smaller areas. A participant suggested that state agencies should have maps of these and they could send one for Hawaii. This has already been done by NOAA, but there are significant gaps in small scale MPAs.\nA participant suggested GIS data could be combined with biological data to create effectiveness measures over time rather than static. Time series biological data would be needed. Another participant suggested asking performance questions on whether their voice was involved in decision making or that the agencies are transparent. One participant suggested looking into violations or citations. This is difficult to interpret because no citations could be caused by high compliance or low enforcement. When correlated with budgets, more citations could be overzealous officers. Employment is a good proxy and employment officers per unit area could be reflective of employment investments. Law enforcement can be hard to deal with because they don't all report to the same place.\nA participant also suggested the investment of division of land and natural resources as percentage of state government budgets. This would require bounding the number of local institutions. NOAA asked should this be institutions raising awareness for wetland restoration, coastal development, or entirely coral reef specific. Participants suggested anything related to watersheds would be extremely related and that categorical weighting could be used. For the weighting, participants suggested asking local managers what the top issues affecting the jurisdiction. A participant also noted that University of Hawaii is collecting information and mapping environmental groups.\nIndicator Development Methodology\nDiscussion questions: Which variables should be weighted more/less heavily? Is one indicator sufficient or is there a need for multiple indicators? Should we consider creating Uber or grouped indicators?\nDifferent indicators will use different methods depending on what suits each best. A participant cautioned calculation of an additive index. The weighting will be based on decisions on the theoretical foundation done by Abt literature review and expert opinion. Participants discussed the bias in weighting using expert opinion. For example, management perspectives will weight differently than other stakeholders. A participant stated that a theoretical model would be superior and sent along an article on trust and management. Another participant suggested looking for more literature on tracking intangible benefits.\nPage 99\n\n\fFinal Report\nExpert Panel on Stressor Indicators (August 28, 2018)\nParticipants:\n Experts: o Kirsten Leong (Social Scientist with NOAA PIFSC) o Stephanie L. Wear (TNC) o Peter Schuhmann (UNCW) o Michael Schuett (Texas A&M) o Sarah Cooley (Ocean Conservancy) o Ranjan Muthukrishnan (University of Minnesota) o Amy Freitag (NOAA) o Alastair Harborne (FL International University) o Kelly Biedenweg (University of Washington) o Liz Shaver (TNC/Reef Resilience Network) o Jessica Levy (Coral Reef Foundation)\n NOAA: Jarrod Loerzel, Matt Gorstein, Chloe Fleming, Seann Regan  Abt Associates: Kelly Peak, Susan Taylor, and David Cooley\nNotes: Indicator 5: Human population change near coral reefs\nDiscussion questions: Key population demographics? Time to observe change/signal? Data sources? Response to findings in papers? Use finer resolution data (block group) to identify populations physically closest to reef? And/or appropriate distances/buffers? Limitations of ACS and World Bank Data?\nBruno et al. Paper: One participant suggested that this paper is not widely accepted in the coral reef ecology community because of the wide population grid used and other issues. There is an alternative paper from Scripps (Jennifer Smith) that a participant said they would sent to us that uses Reef Risks population numbers as a proxy. A participant pointed out challenges associated with the use of county-level data, rather than a finer resolution, such as Census block. Another participant stated that ACS monthly data can be a problem because it's a moving target and that Census block data also has its limitations. Participants suggested that watershed-level data could be the most useful and has been used in other work. However, although USGS provides data on watersheds, they do not align well with social datasets, such as population.\nParticipants suggested capturing rates of tourism, both air and cruise travelers. A participant mentioned the Bob Leeworthy studies from the Caribbean and/or Florida Keys. NOAA staff mentioned having some tourism data. A participant has a questionnaire of people with boat registrations, with questions such as how often do they take their boats out, where do they go, etc.\nIndicator 8: Community well-being\nDiscussion questions: Which variables should be downloaded annually to better understand linkage between social conditions and reef health? Which variables are the leading or most relevant for indicator development? Are there any important variables missing?\nParticipants discussed data and variables to include. All datasets are important and this cannot be condensed to 1 or 2. Homeownership is not best and disparity or economic status would be better. It is good to have a suite of variables. Perhaps include a measure of governance or corruption. Each jurisdiction would could have a different key indicator. A PCA analysis would not be the same across jurisdictions. For social, a participant suggested voting or church participation and/or number of churches\nPage 100\n\n\fFinal Report\nper 1,000 people. However, a participant pointed out there could be major religious that skew things. Another participant suggested number of community centers or environmental organizations. A participant cautioned using Dillard et al./U.S.-centric data. For example, what constitutes community well-being and security does not necessarily translate across jurisdictions.\nIndicator 11: Physical infrastructure\nDiscussion questions: What types of infrastructure have the most relevant impact on coral reef health? Is this the right data? Other sources that should be considered? Local stressors: Largest impact on coral reefs? Impact change by jurisdiction? Distance or buffer for impact area? Recreational fishing needs to be captured and a participant suggested looking at the size/location and structure of marinas or maybe number of boats or number of gasoline pumps. Another suggested including how many boats and gear are in the water. Participants also suggested looking at industrial activities such as mining and sand dredging, finding data on infrastructures with pipes such as sewers, and reviewing the characterization of the sewer quality, infrastructure and improvements. (Ex. Are there overflow systems? EPA or local water/environmental agencies may have this). Another suggestion was collecting data on building permits, noting that there is a wide range in geology and topography across jurisdictions (water and sediment flow). Assuming newer facilities are less bad than older facilities (WWRP/landfills; quality vs quantity), look at the age of infrastructure and regulations when it was built. Participants mentioned tourism and the number of beds available (from tourism boards) or tourism stress/degradation (number of dive charters and their behavior). Participants discussed coastal development and whether industrial or tourism made the most impact. Average incomes could inform development types as not all industries are the same. Sewage and water quality measures could be used but actual discharge data from septic systems is better. Finally, one participant suggested analyzing data on rainfall patterns and impermeable surfaces in each jurisdiction.\nIndicator Development Methodology\nDiscussion questions: Which variables should be weighted more/less heavily? Is one indicator sufficient or is there a need for multiple indicators? Should we consider creating Uber or grouped indicators? Resilience indicator literature has lots of discussion on how to combine indicators. There have been lots of working groups convened to tackle same issues. There are merits to statistical analysis types mentioned but sometimes better to keep it simple; easily read and translated.\nPage 101\n\n\fFinal Report\nAppendix D: Second Indicator Development Workshops \u00ad Notes and List of Participants, December 2018\nFinal Webinar: Developing Socioeconomic Indicators for NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring Program, Session 1 (December 13, 2018)\nHigh level questions for experts: Are we using best available data?

In general, participants agreed with the data sources utilized and did not suggest\nPage 102\n\n\fFinal Report\nadditional sources. Participants generally noted the limitations of performing data transformations on the raw data, which the Abt Team agreed is a limitation of this exercise. Both Abt and the participants also discussed how different transformations can demonstrate a different story \u00ad for example, normalizing variables will provide a sense of the relative importance of the variable to the local economy but does not show the absolute differences across regions. Presenters and participants also noted that the more complex the transformation, the harder it is to refer back to the raw inputs. A general theme of the conversation was the challenge associated with interpreting the indicator values, which are based on an aggregation of data streams. Another general theme was that of missing variables, which was more relevant for non-survey based variables. Finally, participants suggested that different uses may require different organization of the data.\nPage 103\n\n\fFinal Report\nFinal Webinar: Developing Socioeconomic Indicators for NOAA's National Coral Reef Monitoring Program, Session 2 (December 17, 2018)\nHigh level questions for experts: Are we using best available data?

Presenters agreed with comments on using the reference year, indexing and normalizing. A common theme in the feedback was the difficulty in disentangling various drivers of specific variation, and that there may be advantages to letting the data stand on its own rather than aggregating it. We discussed various options for weighting the variables. Participants also noted that there is significant variation in data quality among sources and across jurisdiction, which is a noted caveat for this process. Another theme that came up was that there may be significant spatial variation within the districts that is difficult to tease out. It was agreed upon to separate residents and visitors for the human population trends indicator, so as to tell each story individually. It was also agreed upon to weight each sub-category of community well-being equally as it can get largely subjective to rate any sub-category as more important than another. For similar reasons, it was agreed upon to weight each topic addressed by the MPA checklist equally when calculating the governance indicator. It was also suggested to better\nPage 104\n\n\fFinal Report\nseparate out commercial fisheries landings and revenue data for the five South Florida counties, rather than the entire state of Florida. A final thought proposed by participants centered on the use of a \"confidence ranking,\" taking into account the quantity and quality of available data comparable across the jurisdictions, in order to lend necessary context to the final results.\nPage 105\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nAppendix E: List of Species6 for Economic Impact of Coral Reef Fishing Indicator\nTable E-1: List of Pacific Species

Indicator\n1. Summary a) Recurring messages related to governing7 coral reef habitat: i) Management and enforcement structures vary considerably across jurisdictions. ii) The regulatory framework also varies considerably by jurisdiction: (1) several jurisdictions have adequate rules \"on the books\" that could result in effective governance of coral reef habitat. (2) some jurisdictions lack adequate rules. iii) Adequate enforcement is a challenge everywhere. Jurisdictions identified one or more of the following enforcement challenges: (1) limited dedicated resources, (2) a lack of political will, (3) inadequate training or organization, or (4) a lack of commitment to enforcement or compliance. iv) Jurisdictions see improving coral reef education for residents8 and visitors as one key to improving governance. b) Challenges and opportunities for developing a quantitative governance indicator: i) Challenge: The variation in the management structures between jurisdictions severely limits the potential for consistent data that can be collected to inform development of a quantitative governance indicator, outside of a survey effort. ii) Challenge: Non-survey information is available that could be quantified but may miss important components of overall nature and impact of governance: (1) For example: Count the number of regulations applicable to or targeting coral reef habitat in each jurisdiction and track them over time, but the impact of a change in the number of regulations has little direct bearing on governance without also recognizing potential changes in the commitment to enforcement (e.g., fewer regulations could be beneficial if paired with an improved commitment to enforcement). iii) Opportunity: Data collected through three rounds of the MPA Capacity Assessment Tool, commonly referred to as the \"MPA Checklist\", provides a systematic and consistent source of data to evaluate governance over time, although there are still limitations to this approach. (See Section 3 of this Appendix for more details). c) Recommended next steps: i) Calculate a governance indicator based on the MPA Checklist results. (1) Abt team completed this and submitted the results to NOAA. ii) Identify gaps in the MPA Checklist and propose solutions for future iterations of the Assessment Tool (See Section 3 of this Appendix for more details).\n2. Jurisdiction summary notes a) Background about calls:\n7 We have been presenting and defining the governance indicator in our calls to encompass the regulatory, educational, and enforcement activities in an area intended to preserve and improve the ecological health reef habitat to promote and sustain its long-term use by resident and visiting populations. As a result, governance and management were presented as effectively interchangeable in our conversations with representatives from the jurisdictions.\n8 Residents here can also include local commercial and recreational fishing and tour operators.\nPage 111\n\n\fFinal Report\n\ni) Spoke with the coral reef and/or fisheries liaison in each of the 7 jurisdictions in the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP)\nii) Calls occurred between September 13 and October 17, 2018. iii) The calls were informal discussions guided by the call objectives and facilitated by Abt\nAssociates. iv) Table 1 lists the jurisdiction representatives who participated in each call.\n\nTable 1.

(2) Provide an overview of governance as defined in footnote #1 above to set the stage for a discussion of local governance of coral reef habitat. (3) Gain a better understanding of local coral reef governance. (4) Solicit opinions about what information a governance indicator should incorporate.\n\nvi) Call structure: (1) We did not have a standard set of questions for each discussion, but rather let the conversations flow organically.\n\nPage 112\n\n\fFinal Report\n(2) Following introductions, the Abt team began the conversations by requesting that the call participants provide us with an overview of local coral reef governance, including any challenges they face, considering: (a) Formal, informal, traditional, and modern ways of governance of affected resources and populations. (b) If effective governance be measured? If so, how? (c) How are local populations informed of existing regulations? Do they modify their behavior? (d) Issues related to enforcement, including who has the enforcement authority, how well regulations are enforced, and how well resourced enforcement agencies are.\nb) High level summary of what we learned from the jurisdiction calls and resources i) Three factors that influence governance9 (1) Government Management: (a) Federal and state laws, regulations, and initiatives; (b) Type of management (MPAs, preserves, national parks, etc.); (c) Enforcement; (d) Fishing [licenses; regulations (take, seasonal, etc.); gear restrictions, etc.]; and (e) Political process (will, turnover, commitment, etc.). (2) Market Forces: (a) Tourism and (b) Commercial fishing. (3) Civil Society: (a) Local/regional level (e.g. NGOs) management efforts and initiatives; (b) Individuals/Residents [resident attitudes (behaviors, perception, support, etc.); individual enforcement; traditional and cultural beliefs]; and (c) Education and outreach efforts. ii) The summary matrix organizes what we heard from the jurisdictions into three factors (Appendix D). iii) Call notes provided in Appendix H.\nc) Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) i) Take home messages10: (1) Strong public support for management and enforcement; strong traditional conservation values. (2) Relatively high level of management and enforcement: (a) CNMI has 7 MPAs, enforced by the Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) & Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality (BECQ); (b) CNMI shared 17 management-related documents with us; and (c) Management framework for MPAs is \"very outdated\" and doesn't address current conditions. (3) Increasing tourist pressure.\n9 This framework is based off of work done from 2011-2014 to assess the capacity of coral reef management by SustainaMetrix. See the project's summary report for additional information.\n10 These messages come from our conversations with the jurisdiction and review of the background material they provided.\nPage 113\n\n\fFinal Report\n(4) Notable of CNMI: part of the Micronesia Challenge, an agreement between CNMI, Guam, and others to effectively conserve 30% marine resources and 20% terrestrial resources across Micronesia by 2020.\nii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) Background documents provided and summary notes were provided to NOAA on Google\nDrive.\nd) Hawaii i) Take home messages: (1) All waters (and therefore reefs) are under jurisdiction of the state, except for a portion of the low-lying atolls in the Northern part of Hawaii which also has some Federal management; (2) Strong regulations for coral protection and many management efforts, but there is a low to medium level of commitment and enforcement; (3) One of the biggest obstacles to effective management is the lack of data on the status and trends of many important resources and ecosystem components; (4) Community-based management, including Community Based Subsistence Management Areas (native communities can apply to have more stewardship and management of the areas around them), has been effective in a number of locations; strong native sense of duty to protect reefs; (5) HI tries to ensure that key socioeconomic and cultural concerns are well integrated in research and management; (6) HI has 34 MPAS. The large number of restricted-access or restricted-fishing areas gives the impression of a substantial network of actively managed and protected marine areas, but the reality is that the majority of those areas are small (only 11% of HI ocean area is under any type of protection) and nearly all allow some or several forms of fishing within their boundaries (NOAA, 2008); and (7) Hawaii does not require a fishing license for recreational fishing so they have no idea how many fish are being caught or of the actual level of effort as the lack of licenses prevents creel studies. ii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) HI did not provide any additional background material.\ne) Florida i) Take home messages: (1) Florida has 3 managed marine areas (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Tortugas Ecological Reserve, Biscayne National Park) and one management initiative (Southeast Florida Coral Reef Initiative). (2) FL has a complex management structure that involved federal, state, and county level agencies. Southern two-thirds of the coral reef habitats are within areas that receive federal protection and management, everything else is state and county managed. Some of the agency partnerships (including between federal and state agencies, or state and local, etc.) work well; for others the coordination can be tricky and political. (3) The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has a coral reef program that governs the reef system in the Northern 1/3 of the reef habitat, but it does not have an enforcement arm. (4) FL passed a state wide coral reef protection act in 2009 that makes it illegal to take or damage corals, but it is not well enforced. In March the FL legislature designed a\nPage 114\n\n\fFinal Report\nSoutheast FL coral reef conservation area but it doesn't have any special management plan or policies (this addresses the Northern 1/3 of the coral habitat). (5) FWC has enforcement officers but they can't get into the water so they can never verify take or reef damage. Officers are also poorly paid so there is a lot of turnover. (6) Dana Wusinich-Mendez believes that the governance issues spring from a lack of proper training, experience and/or coordination versus not enough enforcement activity. (7) In FL the regulations are often times too complex to effectively apply them, e.g., they have a different regulation for every different kind of species you can pull from the ocean (i.e., have season and harvest limits versus general restrictions on where the fishing can occur). (8) Recreational fishery community has a strong legislative presence because they have sector backing so hire lobbyists to prevent creating protected areas; commercial fishing is limited by Guide Licenses and permits (i.e., captains have to pay for permits, but there is not a limit on permits); dive and snorkel operators just have to meet Coast Guard vessel operating requirements versus being permitted to interact with reefs. (9) Surveys have shown a low level of understanding of general public awareness of good coral reef conservation practices and regulations. ii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) Background documents provided and summary notes were provided to NOAA on Google Drive.\nf) American Samoa i) Take home messages: (1) 42% of residents surveyed had a government sponsored marine management program in their village; 50% of them rated the programs as highly effective. (2) Management structure includes several types of MPA programs (including village-level), a NOAA sanctuary program, and National Reef Park sites. (3) In AS, there is a marine tenure system where the communities play a strong role in reef management and oversee a lot of their own resources. (a) They have their own village by-laws and set their own boundaries. (b) Coral reef programs have a strong community engagement component which helps also to address land-based impacts to reefs (c) Deputize village leaders to help with enforcement (d) Different models from 100% independent to a blend of local and federal support (e) Some challenges but in general the community level management works well (4) Main threats to reef are fisheries, climate change, and land-based pollution: (a) Fisheries: There isn't much of a commercial fishery sector; not much trade in reef species. Artisanal and recreational fishing. (b) Climate change: sea level rise, mass bleaching, Crown of Thorns sea star outbreaks, and more intense cyclones. (c) Pollution: from human waste due to poor water management systems, leaching contaminants from legacy military installments, and pesticides from agriculture. (5) Not many tourists on AS. Most are family or friends and so learn local rules. Those that do come mainly go to National Park. Villages have signed leases to National Parks and so there is an agreement about visitors' use of the resources in these areas. ii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) Background documents provided and summary notes were provided to NOAA on Google Drive.\nPage 115\n\n\fFinal Report\ng) Puerto Rico i) Take home messages: (1) In PR, corals are in state water. There are 40 MPAs, with 6 of the sites designated as notake areas. (2) No local law enforcement. Also indirect enforcement issues, e.g., water quality, navigation. The will to carry through with enforcement is a bigger issue in PR than the lack of resources. They rangers are dedicated but haven't been able to secure the equipment they need to patrol. There is only one NOAA law enforcement officer in charge of the entire Caribbean but he recently retired. (3) One of the biggest pressures on reefs is recreational use of the reefs, lack of education among recreational users of the reefs. Some places are more aware (e.g., areas where the Sierra Club is partnering with communities). In many cases the material is available but it isn't being pushed into the communities. Only gets shared when someone asks for it. More reactive than proactive. (4) Commercial fishers don't believe science behind restrictions so they are not likely to follow them. (5) Recreational fishers are supposed to have a license but the infrastructure to issue and enforce licenses isn't in place. (6) In PR, traditional knowledge does not play a role in conservation. ii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) Background documents provided and summary notes were provided to NOAA on Google Drive. iv) Additional contacts (note: we did not speak with any of these individuals): (1) Eileen Alicea, a NOAA staff person who has worked extensively with DNER on issues regarding corals and law enforcement. (2) Tania Metz, DNER Coral Reef Program Coordinator (3) Ruperto Chaparro, Executive Director of Sea Grant Puerto Rico (4) Jose Rivera, NOAA Habitat Conservation Division\nh) U.S. Virgin Islands i) Take home messages: (1) Reefs are managed by the Department of Planning and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Protection and the Division of Fish and Wildlife. In general the agencies work well together. USVI is a small community so that has an influence on how everybody works together. (2) They do have boundaries in place but there are maintenance issues; there is no budget to repair or maintain them. (3) Enforcement had gotten better for a time but then went through a rough leadership transition and they lost a lot of staff. Poor enforcement isn't the MPA managers' fault because they have no control over enforcement. (4) No informal community-based protection areas. In general, local population is skeptical of national parks because they see it as the federal government pushing their interests and not looking out for local interests. (5) There is a strong need for more public outreach and engagement. (6) No recreational fishing license. ii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) Background documents provided and summary notes were provided to NOAA on Google Drive.\nPage 116\n\n\fFinal Report\n\ni) Guam i) Take home messages: (1) A mix of protected areas owned mainly by territory, federal government (National Parks Service); the military; and some NGOs. Boundaries between federal and territorial areas aren't clear so there is spatial overlap. Instead of double the enforcement, these areas tend not to get any. (2) Territorial MPAs enforced; federal enforcement doesn't have any personnel or capacity largely because of past mismanagement that resulted in budget cuts. (3) Small community involved in MPA management and there are differences in management approaches. (4) No fishing license required. (5) There are fishing restrictions in many areas but people don't take them seriously because they're not well enforced. No effective recognition for native Chamorro people to fishing rights. (6) Locals are mostly aware of them of rules, but they won't follow them if they don't see other people following them. Tourists are the bigger concern; many don't speak English. Types of tourists have been changing from organized group tours to independent, less well-regulated tourists. Hotels are adverse about supporting educating tourists because they don't want anything to affect their guests' stay. ii) Call notes provided in Appendix H. iii) Background documents provided and summary notes were provided to NOAA on Google Drive.\nj) Additional sources of information on local governance of coral reef habitat (1) Local contacts often recommended we review additional sources of information to help further understand their governance issues. (2) These additional resources are saved in the Google Drive, and also specifically linked by jurisdiction below. (3) If the resource is only available online then a link is provided in the call notes.\n\n3.

create a quantitative indicator\nvii) Limitations of this approach & proposed solutions (1) Gap: Limited scope. The MPA checklist does not cover every MPA, only those prioritized by the jurisdiction. It also does not cover coral reefs areas outside the MPAs. Florida is completely excluded from the assessment, as it did not identify priority MPAs for the checklist. (a) Solution 1: Use the checklist for more, if not all, coral reef areas in each jurisdiction. (b) Solution 2: Include Florida (2) Gap: Self-assessment. The MPA manager or other MPA staff complete the checklist for their MPA. This does not always include the perspective of all parties familiar with the MPA. (a) Solution 1: Approach the checklist with a two pronged approach: conduct jurisdiction-wide meetings where a larger group of those involved with coral reef management in the jurisdiction come together to collectively discuss the checklist responses. (b) Solution 2: Collect anonymous responses from multiple people involved in MPA or coral reef management. (3) Gap: Identify the potential for additional questions on the next survey round (a) Solution 1: Identify a consistent person or position (or multiple positions) who could be regularly contacted to provide a response on a Likert scale for status of local reef governance.\nPage 119\n\n\fFinal Report\n(b) Solution 2: Conduct an informal gap assessment asking coral reef managers what questions should be included in the next checklist.\n(4) Gap: New assessment areas added in 2017 \u00ad no time series data available for those questions.\n(5) Gap: Complexity of governance issue is difficult to convey in a survey with pre-defined response options. (a) Solution 1: Either as part of the survey, or potentially through other administrative reporting mechanisms to avoid issues with approval as part of a survey, develop either an open ended survey question or request an annual update on the status of coral reef governance in the jurisdictions that would ask respondents to summarize existing challenges, opportunities for improvement, and prioritize next steps. Can be short but creates a record that could be informative for management.\nviii) Methods for creating governance indicator (1) Draft of the quantitative indicator, including methods, delivered to NOAA on November 12 for review and comment.\nPage 120\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nAppendix G: Summary Matrix of Notes for Governance Indicator\n\nThese notes represent a summary collection of thoughts Abt heard during calls with the jurisdictions and key points that were extracted from the background documents (see Appendix F, Section 2.a, for additional details).

Below we briefly highlight key takeaways from each of the discussions.\nAmerican Samoa Call (10/3/18)\nParticipants discussed the current governance structure, including both MPAs and village governance systems. Also discussed were the different kinds of MPA programs. The representatives noted that there are also National Reef Park sites which are out in the villages and under the jurisdiction of Federal National Parks. The liaisons also noted that village MPAs have their own village governance system, and communities oversee a lot of their own resources. They have their own village by-laws, and set their own village boundaries. It took years to integrate village with local governance so they could coordinate activities within coastal villages. About 10 years ago, AS adopted some of the village by-laws to assist in monitoring and enforcing local regulations. Each village is different \u00ad have different by-laws to meet different needs and priorities as important to them for consumption and resources. Given the marine tenure system, local villages can manage their own coral reefs. Participants discussed whether there is enough flexibility to address problems locally with guidance or advice from NOAA or others. The sanctuary program has their own system which includes a lot of community engagement. This was important because it helped address the land-based impacts to reefs such as land-based pollution.\nParticipants also discussed the main threats to reefs and whether they were related to the ongoing landbased activities. Local partners are looking at different impacts, both human + climate change and looking at including restoration of coral reefs. In reality there are challenges to this system. It is not that easy to get the management or governance through the community. However, they are still working on the approach and hope to expand it. The primary threats to the reefs are fisheries decline, climate change, and land-based sources of pollution. Population on American Samoa isn't changing that much so development (e.g., building that fills in wetlands, construction runoff) isn't impacting the reefs as much as it might be in other places.\nCommonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Call (9/12/18)\nParticipants discussed the significant amount of local information related to coral reef governance that has been collected by the region. This includes elder fisher interviews, socio-economic surveys, household surveys, and various management plans. CNMI is preparing for another socioeconomic assessment for 2019 and 2020. In terms of management, participants discussed how CNMI provides guidance to local and tourists about dos and don'ts on the reef. This is primarily done through the Coral Reef Initiative. The participants also discussion various issues related to who manages different local areas as well as restrictions on fishing near coral reefs. A general takeaway was that what is most effective are other rules such as gear restrictions for fishing. For example, you can't use gill nets, scuba, and other fishing techniques for harvest. Those rules are archipelago-wide. Finally, participants discussed issues related to tourists or burden/stress from local populations. The general assessment was that tourism may provide a significant stress and threat on reefs.\nFlorida Call (10/2/2018)\nParticipants discussed several topics, including the Outreach Florida Planning Process, enforcement, \"ground level\" activities, coverage, and other issues. The discussion laid our jurisdictional management and acknowledged the complexity of broad authority combined with site-specific authority. Florida may\nPage 128\n\n\fFinal Report\nbe in a better position than some other places given they have relatively more staff, though there are some gaps and turf-related issues. The participants discussed the DEP Coral Reef Conservation program, which came about because of local action strategy process. They have a staff \u00ad manager and administrative support staff, plus focus area/threat area coordinators, i.e. land-based pollution, diving, maritime and coastal construction, etc. \u00ad who advise the program manager and upper levels. There is also a reef injury prevention program, which provides rapid response capacity.\nThe participants also discussed that FL is an open access state, with 9 inlets in SE FL. This creates some challenges. Finally, the participants suggested that a governance indicator would ideally include some qualitative backstory, and that NOAA should think through the audience and purpose for the indicator.\nFlorida, Caribbean and Atlantic Call (10/15/2018)\nParticipants discussed the end goal of the project. A NOAA participant expressed concern over developing a suite of questions about governance because the jurisdictions are so different. A participant developed an assessment tool to measure governance of MPAs against the goals of coral programs. NOAA then uses the results to identify areas where their program can provide capacity and support. They have done this assessment every 3 years since 2010 \u00ad last one in 2017. The assessment covers legally recognized protected areas that meet the definition of an MPA, but they can include community-based protected areas. They did not do the assessment in every MPA.\nThe participants discussed the state's approach to managing coral reef habitat. Within the state there are two primary management agencies: Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) \u00ad DEP has authority over habitat and water quality; Fish and Wildlife over critters and fish. All the counties have resource management divisions that play a role in permitting and monitoring habitat. They have installed mooring buoys to prevent direct impact. The participants also discussed the DEP's coral reef conservation program and the state-wide coral reef protection act. Participants noted challenges associated with enforcing this, though they noted that FWC has a substantial enforcement capacity. They noted that because they don't have the ability to dive, it hinders their ability to assess coral reef damage.\nGuam Call (10/17/2018)\nThe participants discussed that MPAs do not manage the reefs. Participants reported that territorial MPAs have take prohibitions that are somewhat enforced, vs. federal MPAs that have limited or no enforcement. NPS and military have two each, and the wildlife refuge claims some. The participants also discussed the MPA checklist, and reported some limitations of this. Enforcement issues and existing regulations were also discussed, including regulations such as no chemicals, no dynamite, and some mesh limits. They noted that MPAs do have limited take. Participants also noted that regulations are fairly well known, though there are infractions. The participants discussed a big issue with traditional fishing rights, which occurred between 2008 and 2010. There was a movement to try to establish recognition for Chamorro people to gain rights to fishing. Law was passed but not fully implemented. One participant noted that resources are challenged and have many more users than CNMI (who self-enforce). There is selfenforcement for more traditional villages but not as much for MPAs.\nThe participants noted that education for tourists has waxed and waned, and they have a coral reef management fellow right now tasked on working on that. It was noted that approximately 1.5 million tourists came to Guam in the last year, mostly from Japan, China, Korea, and Russia. It was noted that there is still a big gap in reaching out to tourists. Some issues with enforcement were brought up including tourists fishing in preserves and tourists/companies trampling in preserves. In 2004 they passed\nPage 129\n\n\fFinal Report\nan eco-permit law to regulate non-fishing activities, but they had a change in leadership and never moved forward after that. Not much has happened other than jet ski regulation.\nHawaii Call (9/2/2018)\nThe participants discussed several topics. First, they discussed how NOAA's coral program helps to coordinate funding for coral-related activities but in Hawaii, the Hawaii Department of Aquatic Resources (DAR) is the primary agency responsible for the reefs. For marine life, DAR is in control from the high tide mark to EEZ of the state (200 mi out). They don't have authority on the land, but we do fund projects on land. Northern part of Hawaii is low-lying atolls. Federal government manages a portion of it, state does as well. It includes sanctuaries and monuments.\nThe participants noted that in terms of fisheries, Hawaii does not require a license to do recreational fishing which is a huge gap. Last state in the nation. No idea how many people fish. Other states when you get a license you agree to inspections. In Hawaii, officers can't inspect coolers even with probable cause \u00ad they have to catch someone in the act. The participants also discussed how fishing may place greater pressure on the reefs than tourism. However, there is also significant tourism. In terms of enforcement, participants discussed how Hawaii Division of Conservation and Resource Enforcement (DOCAR), a state, sister agency to DAR, is charged with enforcement. But there are very few staff doing marine enforcement, especially when compared with land-based enforcement staff. Other than lack of license, Hawaii does have strong regulations for coral protection. Fishing is the largest one.\nParticipants also noted that the Native Hawaiians have a creation chant that calls out life emerging from the ocean and coral reefs having the first life. This suggests a strong sense of duty to protect coral reefs and environment among natives. They are very involved to protect coastal and other areas. Participants discussed the Community Based Subsistence Management Areas, a new program where native communities can apply to have more stewardship and management over the areas surrounding them.\nPuerto Rico Call (10/4/18)\nParticipants discussed several topics. First, they discussed management boundaries. Corals are in state water so the local DNER has jurisdiction over the corals. They manage and enforce local regulations. Participants noted that for fisheries, local law enforcement has always been a major issue. It is the building block of any management plan. For corals, there are indirect enforcement issues \u00ad water quality, navigation. PR doesn't have a problem with illegal harvesting but do have a recreational use problem. Then participants discussed both self and peer enforcement activities, of which there are some but not extensive. Sierra Club works with communities to establish protected areas and increase local awareness.\nIn terms of tourism, participants noted that lot of pocket efforts for outreach and education, but not a comprehensive approach to educating tourists. DNER has an outreach and education division that provide educational materials and gives workshops. Participants also noted that there is not much traditional knowledge related to conservation.\nUS Virgin Islands Call (10/16/2018)\nParticipants discussed several topics related to governance. First, they discussed boundary issues and the MPA management checklist. Participants noted that informal community-based protection is less developed, and the education and outreach programs could be improved. In terms of tourism, participants suggested that tourists coming from US are used to regulations so they know there are restrictions in\nPage 130\n\n\fFinal Report\nprotected areas. In terms of management, corals are managed by Planning and Natural Resources \u00ad specifically coastal zone management. Some authority also falls under the Division of Fish and Wildlife and the Division of Environmental Protection. Water quality issues are managed by DEP as well, including storm water management, and discharges under the Clean Water Act. Participants noted several studies that had been performed which are relevant and will be shared.\nPage 131\n\n\fFinal Report\n\nAppendix I: Supplementary Data Tables for Secondary Data
