Since a substantial proportion of treated tumors can have nonenhancing tumor progression (1, 6) , and progression of nonenhancing tumor can lead to neurologic decline, there is an emergent need for consideraton of nonenhancing tumor burden in an updated response criteria in neuro-oncology, which was further outlined in the Jumpstarting Brain Tumor Drug Development Coalition and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Workshop in January 2014 (8, 9) . Damadian (10) first documented distinct differences in proton relaxation rates between normal and cancerous tissues as early as 1971, which was also confirmed by various groups in the subsequent years (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Clinical diagnosis and monitoring of brain tumors with MRI, however, remains reliant on the use of T 1 or T 2 \"weighted\" images, which express qualitative changes in the MR signal. T 2 relaxometry can theoretically be performed using a simple modification to the standard T 2 -weighted MRI sequence that results in obtaining multiple images at various echo times, which is essentially \"free\" information (i.e. no substantial added scan time). This information can in theory be used to create quantitative maps of T 2 , which is specific for various tissue types including cancer but relatively independent of MR acquisition parameters such as echo time (TE). For example, an early study by Hoehn-Berlage et al. (16) weighted images being associated with nonenhancing tumor (17) . This difference in T 2 relaxation rates between edema, tumor, and normal tissues has been characterized in both rodent models (18) and in human tumors (19) (20) (21) . Additionally, studies have shown that T 2 relaxation tends to be monoexponential (16) , suggesting evaluation of nonenhancing tumor may be possible with a single T 2 parameter. We hypothesize that \"effective\" T 2 relaxometry performed using the turbo spin echo may be useful for objectively defining nonenhancing tumor tissue using a specific range of T 2 values.\nAccurate measurements of T 2 relaxation times typically involve using relatively time inefficient multiecho Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequences. Dual echo turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences are an attractive clinical alternative to CPMG sequences (22, 23) , allowing for \"effective\" T 2 estimation (T 2 eff ) in clinically feasible scan times and clinically useful spatial coverage for a variety of anatomical locations (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . In the current study we examined the stability of T 2 eff estimates in a standard water phantom across a variety of scanners, used dual echo TSE data from 50 patients with a range of glioma grades scanned on a variety of scanners and field strengths to define T 2 eff characteristics for various tissues, then applied this information to a cohort of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with radiation therapy, a cohort of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with concurrent radiation therapy and temozolomide, and a set of recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab to determine whether the volume of T 2 eff -defined nonenhancing tumor can be used to predict progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\nResearch.

The coefficient of variance of T 2 eff measurements across the 3T scanners was 3.1% and across all 1.5T scanners was 4.5%, suggesting long-term stability was similar to the stability across scanners at a single time point. T 2 eff measurements on 3T MR scanners were significantly lower than 1.5T scanners (Figure 2 threshold of 125ms could be used to stratify NET from NAWM with a sensitivity of sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 97% at 1.5T, and 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity at 3T. Thus, we propose using a range of T 2 eff values between 125ms < T 2 eff < 250ms, on both 1.5T and 3T MR scanners, to objectively define NET for the purpose of tumor burden quantification. Figure 4C shows a patient with a recurrent glioblastoma containing a large, well-circumscribed NET appearing as slightly T 2 hyperintense on T2-weighted images at 3T. T 2 eff maps clearly show that this NET falls largely within the defined range of 125ms < T 2 eff < 250ms. Conversely, Figure 4D also shows a patient with recurrent glioblastoma scanned at 3T with a large extent of edematous tissue, as demonstrated by the \"finger like\" extensions of very bright T 2 hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images. Consistent with these qualitative observations, most of this lesion had elevated Next, we aimed to test whether the volume of NET burden following radiation therapy combined with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide was a prognostic predictor in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma ( Figure 5D-F Lastly, we tested whether early NET response measured as the change in NET volume before and after bevacizumab therapy could be used to predict survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma ( Figure 5G-I) . The average volume of NET burden for the cohort prior to and after bevacizumab therapy was estimated at 30.3cc \u00b1 3.7cc (S.E.M.) and 15.8cc \u00b1 3.5cc (S.E.M.), respectively. The average change in NET volume was -14.5cc \u00b1 2.7cc (S.E.M.). Results demonstrated that changes in NET volume before and after bevacizumab therapy could be used to identify patients who progressed within 6 months of completion of the first dose of bevacizumab ( Figure 5G ; ROC AUC = 0.7786 \u00b1 0.0967, P = 0.022), as well as patients who expired within 9 months of completion of the first dose of bevacizumab ( Figure 5G ; ROC AUC = 0.8681 \u00b1 0.07399, P = 0.002). A decrease in NET volume greater than 50% was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 71% for identifying patients that will progress within 6 months of starting bevacizumab therapy, along with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 67% for identifying patients that will expire within 9 months of starting bevacizumab therapy. Patients showing a \"response\", or more than 50% decrease in NET volume after bevacizumab therapy, had a significantly longer PFS ( Figure 5H "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Results from the current study support the hypothesis that T 2 maps quickly obtained using dual echo TSE images can be used to objectively define and quantify NET burden. Results support the concept that quantification of NET is clinically meaningful and prognostic, as demonstrated both by the prognostic significance of NET tumor burden following radiation therapy with or without temozolomide as well as the change in NET volume as a simple response measure during bevacizumab therapy in recurrent glioblastoma. This is a particularly timely question as this concept has come into serious debate recently (30) . In particular, studies have suggested Results demonstrate that T 2 eff measurements using dual echo TSE are relatively stable, varying approximately 3-5% over time and across scanners of similar field strength when evaluated in phantoms. This is consistent with previous reports showing variation in normal tissues of between 5-15% (23, 33, 34) , on par with errors due to the specific pulse sequence and vendor specific errors (35) . T 2 estimation using dual echo TSE techniques, however, has been shown to slightly overestimate T 2 by as much as 10% (26, (36) (37) (38) . This bias in T 2 estimation arises from multiple sources, including the use of only a few echoes for estimation, spurious signals from stimulated echoes, radiofrequency pulse imperfections, and different phase encoding profile orders (26, 39, 40) . Despite this inaccuracy, T 2 mapping using dual echo TSE acquisition has proven very useful for identification of various pathologies, including Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases (23, 37, 41, 42) . Techniques to overcome this slight bias have been developed (39), although they remain relatively cumbersome to implement and are not often used in clinical practice. Importantly, the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) chose to implemented dual echo T 2 -weighted TSE for estimation of pathology-specific changes in quantitative T 2 ; thus, a standardized dual echo TSE sequence is openly available from all major MRI vendors, which further supports the view of using dual echo T2-weighted TSE to quantify \"ef- Additional considerations and study limitations should also be addressed. For example, white matter changes after radiation therapy may have confounded our interpretation of various tissue types; however, we strategically included recurrent glioma patients in our training cohort in order to provide a more robust range of T2 values that might include treatment-related changes. Lastly, the current study lacks separate, independent validation of the primary findings. Future studies aimed at independent validation in a randomized clinical trial, along with comparison to other imaging biomarkers, is warranted in order to establish effective T 2 maps as a surrogate for quantifying NET burden in patients with gliomas.
