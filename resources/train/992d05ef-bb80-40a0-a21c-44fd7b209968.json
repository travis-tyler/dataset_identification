In volunteering, individuals can take responsibility for their community, learn to understand the conditions that other people face, and appreciate the value of community participation (Calabrese and Schumer 1986; Youniss, McLellan, and Yates 1997; Nolin et al. 1997; Smith 1999; Metz and Youniss 2003) .\nMany schools and postsecondary institutions have established programs that promote, and in some cases require, student community service (Frase 1995; Nolin et al. 1997) . Education administrators have emphasized student volunteerism by incorporating service experiences into classroom activities and graduation requirements (Kraft 1996; Skinner and Chapman 1999; Stukas, Snyder, and Clary 1999; Eyler 2002) . Past research has found that students who participate in these programs tend to have stronger ties to school, peers, and the community, as well as a higher exhibition of other positive social behaviors (Nolin et al. 1997; Youniss, McLellan, and Yates 1997; Smith 1999; Metz and Youniss 2003) . Given these potential benefits, it is important to understand the characteristics and patterns of volunteering among young adults.\nThe National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) provides insight into community service from high school through young adulthood. Previous research using the NELS:88 1992 senior class found that 44 percent reported performing community service when asked about the past 2 years (1990-92) (Frase 1995) . Females, Whites, Asians, and students from households of higher socioeconomic status were more likely to volunteer than other seniors. In the early 1990s, high school students were most often motivated to volunteer for \"strictly voluntary\" reasons (table 1) . Thirty-eight percent said their participation was strictly voluntary compared to 17 percent who were strongly encouraged by someone else, 7 percent who were required for class, and 9 percent who were required for other reasons."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "This Brief extends these cross-sectional findings about high school volunteering and examines the volunteering activities and patterns of the same 1992 senior cohort 2 years and 8 years after most cohort members had graduated from high school. The characteristics of young adult volunteers, their motivation for volunteering, and the types of organizations for which they volunteered may have important implications for their participation in community service later in life; encouraging early involvement with volunteer organizations may lead to an enduring habit of service (Smith 1999; Metz and Youniss 2003) . By identifying the patterns of persistence and desistence in volunteering by young adults, a portrait of these initial, formative years is described. To that end, this Brief provides estimates of the prevalence and quality of volunteering activities by individual demographic characteris-tics in 1990-92, 1994, and 2000 Consistent volunteers were more likely to be female (14 percent) than male (11 percent). They were also more likely to be from higher SES households. Twenty percent of young adults from high SES households were consistent volunteers compared to 10 percent from middle SES households and 6 percent from low SES households. No differences in the percentage of consistent volunteers were detected between race/ethnicity groups with one exception. All race/ethnicity groups reported higher percentages of consistent volunteers than Native Americans.\nA number of young adults volunteered in one period only (table 2). Fourteen percent of young adults volunteered only in high school , 9 percent volunteered only in 1994, and another 9 percent in 2000.\nAs reported for this same high school senior sample in 1990-92 (Frase 1995), volunteering patterns varied by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status over the 10-year period.\nVolunteering differences by sex. Overall, females were more likely than males to volunteer at least once in this 10-year period (73 percent vs. 63 percent, respectively) (table 2). Females were more likely than males to volunteer in high school (50 percent vs. 38 percent, respectively), but no difference in the level of participation by sex was detected 2 years out of high school (39 percent and 38 percent, respectively). By 2000, however, male volunteering had declined once again and females were more likely to volunteer than males (37 percent vs. 29 percent, respectively). For males, no differences were detected in the percent volunteering between high school and 2 years after high school (38 percent in both cases). Males were less likely to volunteer 8 years out of high school in 2000 (29 percent) than they were in both 1990-92 and 1994 (38 percent in both cases).\nExamining individual patterns, females were more likely to volunteer both in 1990-92 and 1994, and in 1990-92 and 2000 (table 2) . Asians also showed a decrease in volunteering from 1990-92 to 2000 (46 percent vs. 27 percent, respectively).\n2 Whites (69 percent) and Blacks (70 percent) were both more likely than Hispanics (62 percent) to volunteer at least once during the study period.\nExamining individual patterns, Whites were more likely to volunteer in 1990-92 and 1994 than Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans (table 2) . Twenty-six percent of Whites volunteered in high school and 1994 compared to 17 percent of Blacks, 19 percent of Hispanics, 20 percent of Asians, and 10 percent of Native Americans.\nVolunteering differences by SES. Overall, young adults from higher SES households were more likely to volunteer than young adults from lower SES households for all time periods (table 2) . In high school, 60 percent of students from high SES households volunteered compared to 41 percent from middle SES households and 28 percent from low SES households. By the year 2000, volunteering by individuals in the high SES households had dropped to 39 percent. However, individuals from high SES households were still more likely to volunteer in the year 2000 than those from both low and middle SES households. Volunteering by individuals from low SES households did not show a detectable change from high school through 1994 and 2000 (28, 26, and 25 percent, respectively) . Volunteering by individuals from middle SES households decreased from the 1990-92 high school years (41 percent) to 1994 (35 percent), but no differences were detected between 1994 and 2000 (33 percent).\nExamining individual patterns, young adults from high SES households were more likely to volunteer both in 1990-92 and 1994, and in 1990-92 and 2000 than young adults from low SES households (table 2) .

These life changes place additional constraints on time and finances that may limit involvement in unpaid community service. On the other hand, many colleges and universities provide their students with the opportunities and resources to engage in such service, which may increase the level of participation among young adults. In this section, the characteristics of young adults who perform volunteer service 2 years after high school and the organizations for which they volunteer are examined. 4 In 1994, 2 years after scheduled high school graduation, 39 percent of the young adult cohort performed some type of unpaid community service (table 3) . This was a decline from the 44 percent of the cohort who volunteered in high school (table 2). The type of organization for which young adults volunteered in 1994 was varied (table 3) . Twelve percent of young adults volunteered for churchrelated organizations, 11 percent in hospital settings, and 10 percent for youth organizations.\nVolunteering differences by sex: 1994. As noted earlier, 38 percent of males and 39 percent of females volunteered in 1994 (table 3) . In 1994, 12 percent of males volunteered for church-related organizations, 11 percent for youth organizations, and 9 percent for hospitals and for sports clubs. Thirteen percent of females volunteered for church-related organizations and hospitals, and 10 percent volunteered for youth organizations.\nVolunteering differences by race/ethnicity: 1994. In 1994, the only racial or ethnic difference detected was the 7 percentage point gap between Whites and Hispanics (table 3) . Forty percent of Whites volunteered compared to 33 percent of Hispanics. In terms of organizational preference, Blacks were more likely to volunteer for church-related organizations (15 percent) than any other type of organization.\nVolunteering differences by SES: 1994 . Some high school volunteering patterns were still evident 2 years later. As in high school, young adults from high SES households were more likely to volunteer than those from middle and low SES households in 1994 (53 percent vs. 35 and 26 percent, respectively) (table 3). This SES pattern also held for specific organizations. Young adults from high SES households were more likely to volunteer for churchrelated, youth, and hospital organizations than individuals from both middle and low SES households. Young adults from low and middle SES households preferred to volunteer with church-related organizations compared to other types of participation."}, {"section_title": "Volunteering differences by high school volunteering:", "text": "1994. Many high schools have implemented community service programs seeking immediate benefits to the student and community; another common intention is to spark a lifetime interest in volunteering (Metz and Youniss 2003; Sobus 1995; Stukas, Snyder, and Clary 1999; Youniss, McLellan, and Yates 1997) . Examining the relationship between high school volunteering and volunteering later in life, students who volunteered in high school were more likely to volunteer 2 years later (54 percent) than students who did not volunteer in high school (27 percent) (table 3) . Additionally, the relationship between high school volunteering and future volunteering may be related to the motivation behind high school volunteering. Students who volunteered solely because it was required-mandatory volunteers only-were still more likely to volunteer 2 years later than those who did no volunteering in high school (37 percent vs. 27 percent, respectively) (table 3). However, both mandatory volunteers and students who did not volunteer were less likely to volunteer in 1994 than students who volunteered because they were strongly encouraged or for strictly voluntary reasons (56 percent).

When comparing the 2000 volunteering of persons whose only reported motivation for high school service was that it had been required-by court order, for school, or for another reason-to that of those who did not volunteer in high school between 1990 and 1992, no difference could be detected (28 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively). Any positive impact that mandatory high school service had on facilitating future volunteer service as demonstrated in 1994 was not detected in 2000.

While these findings are not exhaustive or definitive, they point to several trends of interest.\nOne trend is the general decrease in unpaid community service in the years after high school. As young adults moved on from high school into the worlds of postsecondary education and/or employment, fewer chose to take part in volunteering activities. While about 68 percent volunteered at least once, 12 percent volunteered consistently across these three survey periods. Individual patterns of volunteering revealed a range of onset and differing degrees of persistence among young adults in their volunteering activities. The general decrease in volunteering may result from any number of factors; possible causes include the weakening of incentives for service-such as school credit or approval from prospective postsecondary schools-after high school, a reduced number of visible and easily accessible volunteering opportunities in the lives of college students and young working adults, or a simple change in priorities or reduction in free time after leaving high school. A more detailed examination of this phenomenon would be of interest to those who would promote lifelong volunteering in general, or who belong to groups (e.g., religious organizations) seeking to retain young volunteers as they move into adulthood.\nAnother notable trend is that overall volunteering decreased after high school for most groups. Specifically, volunteering decreased for Whites, Asians, males, females, and persons from middle and higher socioeconomic households. The decrease in volunteering followed different patterns over time for these groups; however, examining the social, religious, economic, and/or cultural factors that may play a role in shaping these patterns might contribute to a better understanding of what influences young adults to stop volunteering, or to volunteer persistently.\nA final trend of interest concerns the motivation to volunteer. Compulsory unpaid service has long been a subject of debate. Many have raised criticisms; Sobus (1995) , for example, questioned the psychological wisdom of schools formally requiring prosocial behaviors. Others charge that such requirements cheapen true voluntarism, can act as a guise for school-sponsored political activism, and may in fact reduce future volunteering (Stukas, Snyder, and Clary 1999) . On the other hand, the advent of community service requirements in schools is testament to some school officials' belief that requiring community service is a sound educational practice (Eyler 2002; Metz and Youniss 2003) . This movement is supported by research that reports many individual and community benefits associated with volunteering (Metz and Youniss 2003) . This debate clearly involves considerations beyond the empirical trends discussed here. Still, those trends This group reported performing volunteer work that was court-ordered, required for class, and/or required for another reason, and did not also indicate any other motivation. Table 4 . Percentage of young adults participating in unpaid volunteer or community service activities, by service type and select student characteristics: 2000 are worth noting: there is a positive relationship between high school volunteering that was not motivated solely by a requirement, and later service; and no relationship between high school volunteering motivated by a requirement, and later service.\nData from NELS:88 provide a valuable look at volunteering by young people, an activity that is widely heralded but not fully measured or understood. These empirical findings demonstrate that community service is a common part of the American young adult experience-at some point during the decade following their entry into high school, two-thirds of young people volunteered with churches, youth groups, hospitals, schools, sports teams, or some other organizations. Beyond this basic finding, however, is evidence of great variety in who volunteers, when, and for what. As schools and communities continue to promote unpaid service as a means to individual character and societal improvement, the relevance of empirical data about volunteering among young people will only increase."}, {"section_title": "Technical Notes", "text": "Definition of terms and criteria used. This Brief examines what the NELS:88 refers to as \"unpaid volunteer or community service activities.\" For the sake of brevity, other terms are used interchangeably with this one, including \"volunteering\" and \"unpaid community service.\" Note that these terms are applied to service activities that were court-ordered, required for a class, or required for another reason, and were therefore not literally voluntary. On the other hand, the terms are meant to exclude any work for which participants received compensation, even in the case of a stipend-granting community service program whose staffers may be popularly referred to as \"volunteers.\"\nThe definitions of several other terms and criteria also bear explaining:\nIn Table 2 , \"1990-92 volunteer\" refers to respondents who in 1992 reported having performed unpaid community service in any category, and for any motivation, \"(d)uring the past two years (from January 1, 1990 to the present).\" \"1994 volunteer\" and \"2000 volunteer\" refer to respondents who reported unpaid community service in any category, and for any motivation, during the previous 12 months from the survey interview date.\nThe NELS:88 collected information regarding the individual's motivation to participate in high school unpaid community service. For the period of 1990-92, students reported whether their volunteering could be described as any of the following: strictly voluntary, court-ordered, required for a class, required for other reasons, or strongly encouraged by someone else (table 1) . These responses were not mutually exclusive; students could have volunteered multiple times for different reasons. In Tables 3  and 4 , under high school volunteer, \"Any\" refers to any respondent who reported any unpaid community service activities in 1990-92. \"Mandatory\" refers to any respondent who reported performing volunteer work that was court-ordered, 7 required for class, or required for another reason, and who did not also indicate any other motivation. \"Strictly voluntary or encouraged\" refers to any respondent who reported volunteer work that was either strictly voluntary or strongly encouraged. The respondent may have also reported mandatory volunteering as another reason in addition to either of these two.\nInformation on demographic and other individual characteristic was obtained from composite variables available on the NELS:88/2000 public-use ECB/CD as follows:\n\u2022 Respondent's sex was obtained from F4SEX.\n\u2022 Respondent's race/ethnicity was obtained from F4RACE, which includes the following categories: Asian/Pacific Islander; Hispanic; Black, not Hispanic; White, not Hispanic; and Native American/Alaska Native.\n\u2022 Socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained from F2SES1Q, which is a quartile coding of the composite variable, F2SES1. F2SES1 provides an SES scale score for each individual that is derived from the following parent questionnaire data obtained in the base year (1988): father's education level, mother's education level, father's occupation, mother's occupation, and family income. Respondents were considered to be from households of \"high\" SES if their households' SES fell in the highest quartile of all respondents' households. Households in the lowest quartile were considered \"low\" SES, and households in one of the two middle quartiles were considered \"middle\" SES.\nInformation about the type of high school volunteering that students performed in 1990-92 is presented in table A1. This information is similar to the information presented in Frase (1995) . The table is provided here with the estimates recomputed using the NELS:88/2000 fourth follow-up datafile and the fourth follow-up panel weight, F4F2PNWT.\nGiven the definitions and coding procedures used in this Brief, there are a number of limitations the reader should consider regarding the findings. First, the time periods and reference periods related to volunteering are not consistent across surveys. Respondents are given a 2-year reference period in high school and a 12-month reference period for both 1994 and 2000. The resulting estimates of high school volunteer participation in this report are, however, somewhat consistent with other studies of volunteering at this stage in life. The National Household Education Surveys of 1996 and 1999 show that 56 and 61 percent of students in grades 11 and 12 participated in community service, respectively (Kleiner and Chapman 1999) . Given the methodological differences between these two studies and the historical changes in volunteering as suggested by Kleiner and Chapman (1999) , the estimates in this report are expected and consistent.\nThe survey follow-up periods vary from 2 years between 1990-92 and 1994 and 6 years between 1994 and 2000. Another important limitation is the lack of consistent items across surveys to measure volunteering. Finally, the sample used in this analysis focused on respondents who were in the 12th-grade cohort in the second follow-up survey. This excludes individuals who had dropped out of school in previous waves, did not participate in the second follow-up or were missing for some other reason. Each of these factors could lead to an over-or underestimation of volunteering. In addition, if different groups are disproportionately impacted by these limitations, this introduces the potential for bias estimates."}, {"section_title": "Survey Design and Methodology", "text": "NELS:88 surveyed a middle school/junior high school cohort, the 8th-grade class of 1988. Along with student surveys, NELS:88 included surveys of parents, teachers, and school administrators. The study also administered cognitive tests in reading, mathematics, science, and social studies to the sample members. High school transcripts were collected in 1992 and postsecondary education transcripts were collected in the fall of 2000. The sample was \"freshened\" at each of the first two followup studies, 8 generating a 10th-and a 12th-grade nationally representative sample in the first follow-up (1990) survey and the second follow-up (1992) survey, respectively. Thus, NELS:88 follows an 8th-, 10th-and 12th-grade cohort over time.\nThe fourth follow-up (NELS:88/2000) took place in 2000, the year in which most sample members turned 26 years of age and typically were 8 years removed from high school enrollment. This follow-up study focused on the educational and labor market processes and transitions experienced by young adults. Interviewing began in January 2000. Interview topics included experiences with postsecondary education, labor market participation, jobrelated training, community integration, and marriage and family formation.

In order to maintain consistency in weights across the multiple data collection waves of NELS:88 (i.e., to ensure that weighting totals reflected the population totals of the original group of interest), multidimensional raking was also applied to these nonresponse-adjusted weights. The raking was performed with respect to base-year through fourth follow-up-study response status, dropout status, race/ ethnicity, sex, and school characteristics.\nThe estimates in this report were produced using F4F2PNWT, the panel weight for 12th-grade members of the NELS:88 sample who were respondents during the second (1992), third (1994), and fourth (2000) follow-ups.
