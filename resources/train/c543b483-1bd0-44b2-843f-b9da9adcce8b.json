With the lack of curative treatment for dementia due to AD, research is moving toward the prodromal and preclinical stages of AD [2] . Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to the subjective experience of cognitive decline, without objective impairment on cognitive assessment [3] . Compared to individuals without SCD, cognitively normal elderly subjects experiencing complaints have an increased risk of subsequent objective cognitive decline, that is, progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, SCD has been suggested to be a possible first symptomatic expression of preclinical AD [2, 3] .\nThe conceptual framework on SCD published by the international Working Group (SCD-I) has a focus on SCD as an early harbinger of AD, proposing the SCD-plus criteria as potential risk factors for preclinical AD [3] . However, SCD may also precede other dementia subtypes with a gradual onset, such as vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLBs), or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although individuals with SCD have an increased risk of dementia [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , the incidence rate of progression from SCD to AD dementia, and especially to non-AD dementia, has not been estimated before.\nFor cognitively normal individuals, risk factors of dementia include higher age, lower education, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 status [10, 11] . Whether these risk factors influence the risk of progression to AD and non-AD types of dementia in patients with SCD in a similar way remains to be further investigated.

Fig. 2 shows the percentages of dementia diagnoses in community cohorts and memory clinics. In a multilevel model, we compared percentages of dementia diagnoses in community and memory clinic cohorts and found that individuals with SCD in communitybased cohorts more often received a diagnosis of VaD (23% community vs. 9% memory clinic [P 5 .01]).

We found an overall dementia incidence rate in individuals with SCD of 17.7 per 1000 person-years, compared to 14.2 in controls without SCD. Particularly, in memory clinic patients with SCD, the risk of non-AD dementia is strongly increased. In line with incidence studies of dementia subtypes [19, 20] , roughly one of 3 incident dementia in individuals with SCD cases was due to non-AD. Of note, non-AD dementia in memory clinics often comprised FTD or DLB, while in community-based cohorts, VaD was relatively more common. Other determinants of incident dementia included higher age, lower baseline cognition, and APOE \u03b54 carriership.\nOur data clearly showed that recruitment setting modifies the risk of progression from SCD to dementia. It is well known that recruitment setting (i.e. memory clinic vs. community) affects studies in SCD [3, 21, 22] . However, the number of studies directly comparing recruitment setting is small [9, [23] [24] [25] . A previous meta-analysis suggested that the annual conversion rate from SCD to dementia did not differ between memory clinics and community cohorts [9] , and likewise at first sight, our memory clinic cohorts also had only slightly higher incidence rates (20.1/1000 person-years) compared with community cohorts (15.4/1000 person-years). However, heterogeneity between studies has repeatedly been mentioned in SCD studies [9, 21] , and a recent study showed that progression to MCI is more common in individuals with SCD recruited at a memory clinic than in a community-based setting [26] . We also observed great heterogeneity between cohorts in study design, center, and patient characteristics, and to allow meaningful pooling of data, we used a multilevel statistical approach, carefully taking into account center differences. Particularly, memory clinic cohorts were on average a decade younger, explaining their overall lower incidence. When we stratified by age, our data revealed that in every age bin, incidence of dementia is higher in the memory clinic than in the community-based cohorts of individuals with SCD. The only exception was the oldest age bin .90 years, where data in memory clinics were simply lacking, and the incidence of dementia in community-based cohorts was high. Our data illustrate that memory clinic patients who actively seek help for their perceived cognitive problems, indeed, are more likely to experience the first (preclinical) signs of a neurodegenerative disease [23, 24] .\nOur findings provide evidence that SCD is not only a potential harbinger of AD but also of other dementia. Two-third of incident dementia in individuals with SCD was attributable to AD dementia, whereas approximately one-third was attributable to another type of dementia. The relative frequencies of individuals with SCD progressing to FTLD, DLB, and VaD seemed comparable with previous dementia incidence studies [19, 20, [27] [28] [29] . In memory clinic cohorts, DLB and FTLD were more frequently diagnosed than in community cohorts. By contrast, VaD was more often diagnosed in the older community cohort individuals with SCD. This difference could be a reflection of differing operationalization of diagnostic criteria for dementia, which may be handled differently between settings [30] , for example, VaD in memory clinic settings often requires neuroimaging criteria, whereas in community-based settings such a diagnosis may be based on clinical presentation only. Diagnosis of DLB or FTLD requires careful neurological examination by an expert neurologist, available mostly in specialized clinics rather than in community settings. Also, individuals with early VaD or DLB might be referred for evaluation to general neurology, instead of a memory clinic, as patients complain rather of neurological symptoms, such as parkinsonism or gait change, than memory decline. Furthermore, individuals with FTLD may be less likely to participate in voluntary studies because of disease characteristics [31] .\nThe large majority of individuals with SCD in both memory clinic and community-based cohorts did not progress to any type of dementia, but rather remained cognitively normal. Despite the growing interest in SCD as a putative first syndrome stage of AD, the group of individuals seeking help where a neurodegenerative disorder can be excluded as cause of their problems also merits our attention. From studies in the field of MCI and early studies in SCD, it is clear that, for example, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have particularly good negative predictive value, illustrating that their optimal clinical use is for reassurance of individuals with normal biomarkers [32, 33] . Alternative causes of SCD could be subclinical psychiatric disorders, personality traits, or surmenage. Individuals with SCD who are unlikely to progress to AD or non-AD Fig. 4 .

We evaluated which determinants contributed to an increased risk of progression from SCD to dementia and found that higher age, lower baseline MMSE, APOE \u03b54 status, and recruitment setting resulted in an increased risk of dementia, which is consistent with the literature [9, 34, 35] . We found that higher age contributed relatively more to the risk of AD than non-AD dementia in individuals with SCD. A possible explanation could lie in the fact that some non-AD dementia, such as FTLD, are relatively more often diagnosed at a younger age, thus reflecting less contribution of a higher chronologic age in the risk of non-AD dementia in comparison with AD dementia [31] . The effect of MMSE on the risk of clinical progression also seemed stronger for AD than for non-AD. The MMSE is mainly designed as a global cognitive screening tool and most sensitive for disturbances in memory and orientation [18] . Because the memory domain is relatively less affected in non-AD dementia, it is conceivable that MMSE is less sensitive for non-AD dementia [36] . APOE \u03b54 status was associated with an increased risk of dementia, which appeared to be attributable to the risk of AD but not to non-AD, which is in agreement with the literature [37, 38] .\nThe limitations of the study include the substantial heterogeneity in cohort characteristics. The heterogeneity includes differences in demographics of participants among centers and substantial inherent center characteristics such as the definition of SCD, the administered SCD questionnaires, the use of (magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, or cerebrospinal fluid) biomarkers in the diagnostic process, and the outcome measures (differences in dementia criteria used). Furthermore, recruitment setting has been shown to be a moderator of SCD results, as discussed previously. Nonetheless, we were able to combine these cohorts by using a multilevel statistical approach, using shared-frailty Cox models and taking into account random center effects. Our results underline the importance of the harmonized research criteria for SCD, which have been put forward by the SCD-I working group [3, 39] . In this study, we had no information available on different domains of cognitive complaints, such as memory domains versus nonmemory domains. As onethird of dementia diagnoses were non-AD, evaluation of SCD in nonmemory domains using questionnaires and also qualitative assessment is of interest to better understand the underlying pathology of SCD [40] . Also, we had no comprehensive cognitive test battery or biomarker data available for a large part of our cohort, and we cannot exclude the possibility of misdiagnosis in a number of cases. Future studies should include a wider range of cognitive tests and biomarkers to further evaluate the process of differentiating between AD and non-AD types of dementia. We did not take into account all available SCD cohorts, but this collaborative study did originate from the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment's SCD Professional Interest Area, including all centers that wanted to contribute data. The strengths of the study, therefore, include the large sample of SCD patients, with participating centers from around the world. Furthermore, this is the first time that the incidence of non-AD dementia is evaluated in the context of SCD.\nMembers of the international SCD Working Group (SCD-I) have published a conceptual framework on SCD research to facilitate harmonization of SCD research [3, 39] . The framework, however, is focused on the detection of preclinical AD and not so much on the preclinical stages of other dementia. The risk of preclinical AD has been suggested to be specifically modified by self-reported memory decline [7] , and a large overview of SCD measures indicated that most instruments indeed evaluate memory-specific decline [3, 21] . However, as approximately one-third of progressing patients in our SCD sample progressed to another type of dementia than AD, the importance of nonmemory characteristics needs to be considered when evaluating SCD.
