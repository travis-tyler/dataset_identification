Characteristics of atmospheric equatorial Kelvin waves and mixed Rossby-Gravity (MRG) waves as well as their relationship with tropical convective activity associated with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were analyzed. Kelvin waves and MRG waves were identified by using a Space-Time Spectral Analysis (STSA) technique, where the differences in the strength of both waves were quantified by taking the wave spectrum differences for each ENSO phase. Our result showed that Kelvin wave activity is stronger during an El Nino years, whereas the MRG wave activity is stronger during the La Nina years. Seasonal variations of Kelvin wave activity occurs predominantly in MAM over the central to the east Pacific in the El Nino years, while the strongest seasonal variation of MRG wave activity occus in MAM and SON over the northern and southern Pacific during La Nina years. The local variation of Kelvin wave and MRG wave activities are found to be controlled by variation in lower level atmospheric convection induced by sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Equatorial planetary waves (EPW) are one of the dominant modes of synoptic-to-subseasonal variability in the tropics. They are generated by diabatic heating due to organized tropical large-scale convective heating in the equatorial belt [1] [2] [3] . The amplitude is captured clearly in the equatorial belt between 20\u00b0N and 20\u00b0S [1] . EPW causes predominant disturbances in the equatorial atmosphere such as inducing mean-meridional circulation that is important for the heat balance of the equatorial belt [4] [5] , affecting the patterns of low level moisture convergence, and controling the distribution of tropical convective heating and storms in large longitudinal distances [4] . In addition, EPW also plays an important role in modulating rainfall in the tropics [3] , circulation Walker [6] , Madden and Julian oscillation (MJO) [7] and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [5] . Two dominant atmospheric equatorial waves has an important role in the region is equatorial Kelvin waves and Mixed RossbyGravity (MRG) waves. In this study our analysis will focus on understanding the nature of Kelvin waves and MRG waves during ENSO events.\nEl Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon characterized by anomalous ocean warming over the eastern equatorial Pacific ocean [8] . ENSO can be classified into normal, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phases. The term El Ni\u00f1o refers to a large-scale periodic warming in sea surface temperatures across the central and east-central Equatorial Pacific. On the other hand, La Ni\u00f1a represent periods of below-average sea surface temperatures across the east-central Equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon affects the climate over sizable portions of the globe, including some regions far removed from the tropical Pacific Ocean [9] . Warming in the tropical ocean (i.e., increased sea surface temperature -SST) will increase the evaporation and hence, the formation of large scale convective clouds. The process causes latent heating in the upper atmosphere which is very important ingredient to generate more EPW activity [10] . Kelvin waves and MRG waves are well observed within the anomalies of SST, precipitation, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) in the tropics [3] . Therefore, in this study we used both SST and OLR datasets as a proxy to isolate the Kelvin wave and MRG wave activity. The goal of the current study is to investigate the impact of ENSO on seasonal variation of Kelvin wave and MRG waves and the involved mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "ENSO phases were identified by using Running 3-month ONI Mean Values data.

The data used is the average of the daily OLR anomalies for ~ 40 years Based on figure 2 and figure 3, shows that there are many waves associated with ENSO phenomenon. This wave is the result of the classification of basic types of interference waves around the equator by n integer associated with the number called nodal meridional wave mode [13] . For n = -1, commonly known as the Kelvin wave, only affects the zonal oscillations [14] [4] . For n = 0, there are two groups of waves have propagation to the east and the west. The wave that moves to the east known as Inertio-waves or Gravity-wave. While the wave that spreading to the west is called Mixed Rossby-Gravity waves. This wave modes associated with antisimetry perturbation of meridional wind and equatorial relatively perturbation of meridional wind [13] . In general, for n \u2265 1 there are three groups, namely the Rossby for the wave that move to the west and Gravity waves for the wave that move to the east and to the west [13] .\nOverall for each phase of ENSO, at a equivalent depth of 12-50 m to a Kelvin wave signal (n = -1) was detected in symmetrical components.

Similarly, the pattern of warming and cooling of sea surface temperatures MAM and JJA period will be followed by convection and circulation signal corresponding Walker circulation. As for normal conditions, do not see the lag time between the heating and cooling of the sea surface temperature OLR anomaly and the Walker circulation.\nBased on the above, the mechanism of wave generation Kelvin and MRG can simply be explained as follows.

The Kelvin waves ad MRG waves have been isolated by using space-time spectral analysis (STSA) and composite analysis. The key results are summarized as follow:\n(1) ENSO phenomenon significantly influences seasonal variation of Kelvin and MRG wave activity. the El Nino years, while MRG wave activity are observed over the northern and southern Pacific during La Nina years. The local variation in Kelvin waves and MRG waves is to be likely controlled by the variation in the lower level convection due to warming in sea surface temperatures over these regions. It is indicated by a shift in the center of convection activity towards the central Pacific to the east following the shift in Kelvin wave acitivity. While increase in wave activity MRG are more related to the convection over the the northern and southern equatorial Pacific ocean. The results of this study is expected to improve the prediction skill of the intra-seasonal climate in the tropicas based on the knowledge of atmosphere-ocean coupled mechanism. Further studies are required to investigate in more detail how tropical ocean influence the generation of Kelvin waves and MRG waves in opposite ENSO phase and their associated implication on surface climate."}]
