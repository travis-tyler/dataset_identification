Memory loss is an early and predominant feature of AD. 1 Patients with late-onset AD tend to display a pattern of disproportionately more impaired memory relative to executive function, yet about one-fifth of people with AD have been found to have executive predominance with executive function scores lower than memory scores. 2 Over the last 2 decades, amyloid 42 (A\u03b2 42 ), phosphorylated tau, and total tau (t-tau) in the CSF have been identified as important biomarkers of the pathophysiologic process underlying AD. 3, 4 However, the correlation of these biomarkers with the rate of cognitive deterioration is inconsistent. Searching for additional biomarkers associated with cognitive decline in AD is of critical importance in enabling earlier diagnosis, tracking mental status, and developing new treatments.\nNeurogranin (Ng), a postsynaptic protein, is elevated in the CSF of patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to participants with normal cognition (NC). [5] [6] [7] High CSF Ng levels correlate with poor Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in these participants. 8, 9 Levels of Ng predict progression of MCI to AD. 10 To study the role of Ng in specific cognitive domains, we examined whether high CSF Ng would predict cognitive performance in participants at risk for AD. We hypothesized that high CSF Ng would be a sensitive predictor of memory loss and executive dysfunction. In this study, baseline levels of CSF Ng were analyzed in relation to baseline memory, executive function, global cognition, and function scores in participants with NC and MCI.

There is no significant difference between age and years of education between the NC and MCI groups. The MCI group has a higher percentage of men, a higher percentage of APOE e4 carriers, and significantly lower MMSE and higher CDRSB score. CSF Ng is increased in the MCI group, and t-tau and p-tau are also significantly higher in the participants with MCI. A\u03b2 42 is lower in the MCI than the NC group.\nAssociation of CSF Ng levels with memory scores in cross-sectional study There was a significant association between baseline levels of CSF Ng and baseline memory scores in the pooled participants with NC and MCI (table 2).

There was no association between baseline CSF Ng and baseline executive function in both unadjusted and multivariableadjusted models (table 2) .\nAssociation of CSF Ng levels with memory and executive scores over a period of 8 years Longitudinal analysis of NC and MCI participants showed that baseline CSF Ng levels predicted decline in both memory and executive function over an 8-year period. Table 3 demonstrates that baseline CSF Ng was associated with memory decline per year (\u03b2 = \u22120.049, p < 0.0001), and after accounting for age, sex, education, and APOE e4 status, this association remained (\u03b2 = \u22120.031, p = 0.0068). There was an association of baseline CSF Ng with executive function decline per year (\u03b2 = \u22120.056, p < 0.0001), and this association remained after adjustment for age, sex, education, and APOE e4 status in model 3 (\u03b2 = \u22120.035, p = 0.0169).

However, only baseline ADAS-Cog 13 was associated with CSF Ng when APOE e4 status was corrected for (\u03b2 = 0.11, p = 0.04). In model 4, CSF Ng was not associated with any of these cognitive measures after adjustment for tau and A\u03b2 42 .\nLongitudinal analysis revealed an association between CSF Ng and all of the cognitive scores analyzed: ADAS-Cog 11 (\u03b2 = 4.77, p < 0.01), ADAS-Cog 13 (\u03b2 = 5.42, p < 0.001), MMSE (\u03b2 = \u22122.07, p < 0.001), and CDR Sum of Boxes (\u03b2 = 1.215, p < 0.001). In models 2 and 3 in which demographic information and APOE e4 status were corrected, the longitudinal associations remained significant.

Table 4 reveals that baseline CSF Ng was not associated with longitudinal memory decline in healthy controls (\u03b2 = \u22120.029, p = 0.133) but was associated with memory decline in participants with MCI (\u03b2 = \u22120.068, p = 0.0031).

Increased CSF Ng levels can predict decline in both memory and executive function. CSF Ng is associated with memory decline per year when age, sex, education, and APOE e4 status are accounted for, but the association is not present when t-tau and A\u03b2 42 are corrected for. Similarly, higher CSF Ng is associated with a decline in executive function over time. The association between CSF Ng and executive function is present when age, sex, and education are accounted for, but the association is not present when APOE e4 status, t-tau, and A\u03b2 42 are accounted for.\nCorrelation of CSF Ng levels with t-tau and A\u03b2 42 levels To evaluate the relationship between CSF Ng and t-tau and A\u03b2 42 , a Pearson correlation test was performed. Increasing levels of CSF Ng were associated with increasing t-tau levels (r = 0.69, p < 0.0001). Conversely, increasing levels of CSF Ng were associated with decreasing A\u03b2 42 levels (r = \u22120.33, p < 0.0001)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, cross-sectional analysis showed that high CSF Ng was significantly associated with lower memory scores in pooled participants with NC and MCI. Longitudinal analysis revealed that baseline CSF Ng was significantly associated with both memory and executive function decline in the pooled sample. In addition, Ng predicted memory, executive function, and global cognitive decline over an 8-year period. Finally, a significant association of CSF Ng with memory and executive function decline was associated only with individuals with MCI.\nIn AD, memory impairment is an initial and central presentation in most patients. 1, 14 Amnestic MCI has a higher likelihood of progression to AD compared to nonamnestic MCI. 15 This is consistent with neuropathologic studies showing that the limbic system has degenerative changes in the early stage of AD. 16 Although a clear, disproportionately severe episodic memory disorder was observed in patients with amnestic MCI, increasing evidence also shows that there is a dysexecutive form of MCI associated with AD. 2, 17, 18 The molecular mechanism underlying memory and executive dysfunction remains unclear.\nNg, a postsynaptic protein, has been shown to be associated with synaptic plasticity. 19 Deletion of the Ng gene in mice results in decreased short-and long-term plasticity and impaired spatial memory. 19, 20 Ng influences synaptic plasticity by regulating the level of calmodulin and the pattern of calcium/calmodulin-dependent postsynaptic signaling at dendritic spines. 21 In AD, a marked reduction in Ng levels is found in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. 22 In this study, high CSF Ng was significantly associated with poor memory scores in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. This finding suggests that Ng plays an important role in memory dysfunction in AD. Given the fact that excitatory synapses terminating on dendritic spines are involved in the formation of new memories and are damaged in AD, changes of the levels of postsynaptic proteins in CSF in relation to memory function are to be expected. 23, 24 However, high CSF Ng levels were associated with worse executive function only in the longitudinal analysis, not the cross-sectional analysis. This finding raises several possibilities. First, the participants with MCI in this study may have had a relatively subtle deficit of executive function at baseline. Alternatively, the neuropsychological battery used in this study may have been too insensitive to detect dysexecutive function in MCI. Another possible explanation is that our MCI group is composed of a more amnestic phenotype than dysexecutive phenotype because our population has a high percentage of APOE e4 carriers in the MCI group (53%). A previous study noted that APOE e4 carriers were more common in the amnestic group than the dysexecutive phenotype. 17 As a result, the association of memory dysfunction with CSF Ng was readily apparent. Finally, it is possible that there is a temporal relationship between involvement of memory and executive function in the pathophysiologic process of AD. Declining performance on episodic memory was found to occur 7 years before diagnosis, while declining performance on executive function was found to accelerate 2 to 3 years before diagnosis. 25 Nevertheless, our findings provide evidence that Ng is involved in executive dysfunction in patients with MCI.\nIn this study, we further investigated the utility of CSF Ng as a maker for global cognition and functional status. We confirmed that high CSF Ng was associated with global cognitive impairment cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In addition, high CSF Ng was associated with poor functional scores longitudinally. These findings suggest that CSF Ng has potential to monitor the progress of this disease, serving as a biomarker for assessing the effect of treatment. Abbreviations: MCI = mild cognitive impairment; NC = normal controls; NG = neurogranin. CSF Ng is not significantly associated with memory or executive function decline over time in NC. In participants with MCI, CSF Ng is an effective predictor of decline in memory and executive function without adjustment. When age, sex, and education are adjusted for, memory decline is still predicted by Ng, but executive function no longer is. When APOE e4 status is adjusted for in additional to the confounders, Ng is not a significant predictor for memory or executive function.\nIn this study, the association of Ng with memory, executive function, and global cognitive and functional measures was no longer present when tau and A\u03b2 42 were controlled for in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. It is suggested that tau and A\u03b2 42 are the key factors involved in postsynaptic injury in patients with MCI. This finding is supported by our correlation analysis. A recent study also reports that the association of Ng with regional brain atrophy was found in individuals with A\u03b2 pathology. 26 Emerging evidence suggests that A\u03b2-induced synaptic dysfunction is dependent on NMDA receptor-mediated pathways, leading to dendritic spine loss. [27] [28] [29] Tau pathology has been reported to contribute more to synapse degeneration and resultant dementia. 30, 31 The involvement of amyloid and tau pathology in synaptic damage requires further investigation.\nFinally, in this study, we show that Ng was associated with memory and executive scores over time only in patients with MCI. It is suggested that elevated CSF Ng levels are especially related to the pathologic process of cognitive impairment in the early stage of the disease. Our findings are consistent with a recent study showing that individuals with progressive MCI have elevated CSF Ng levels that are associated with accelerated deterioration in the ADASCog subscale. 9 In the NC subgroup, there were no significant associations between cognitive function and Ng. Ng may therefore serve as a useful marker in conjunction with A\u03b2 42 and t-tau to distinguish between MCI and NC. Ng has also been reported to be a useful biomarker for differentiating NC from MCI. 8 This study has limitations. First, as with any longitudinal study of the elderly, attrition rate is a concern. We conducted an association study at the 36-month follow-up when dropout rate is less of an issue than at the 96-month follow-up (tables e-1-e-12, http://links.lww.com/WNL/A210). We also performed an analysis in the participants who completed the 96-month follow-up. We found that Ng also predicts memory and executive function decline longitudinally then. Nevertheless, we are aware that high dropout rates can cause the remaining participants to constitute a biased sample. The data should be interpreted with caution. Second, we examined the association of Ng only with memory, executive function, ADAS-Cog 11 and 13, MMSE, and CDR Sum of Boxes scores. It would be interesting to examine a more complete cognitive profile, including visuospatial and language domains, to see the timing and degree of association between CSF Ng and additional measures. Third, the findings relating Ng to cognitive measures disappear when tau and A\u03b2 42 are included in the statistical models. It would be important to replicate these findings with other statistical models. The interactions and common pathways between Ng and A\u03b2 42 and t-tau warrant further exploration. Fourth, data are also needed to clarify the temporal course of CSF Ng across the spectrum of MCI and AD and whether the rate of CSF Ng change parallels declines in cognition. Finally, because the ADNI cohort is a selected convenience sample of volunteers, sample selection bias should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of the data."}, {"section_title": "Author contributions", "text": "Dr. Sun had full access to all of the data in the study, initiated the study concept, was involved in study design, interpreted data, and edited the manuscript.
