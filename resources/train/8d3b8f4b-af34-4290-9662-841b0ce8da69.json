[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The effects of tropical cyclone impacts on society are becoming more apparent every year, with losses from hurricane events expected to become more financially damaging in the future (Klotzbach et al. 2018). This was evident with Hurricane Harvey, a major hurricane that made landfall in Texas on August 26, 2017 and made significant impacts with its high winds, extreme precipitation, and storm surge in the Greater Houston Region (Blake and Zelinsky 2018). Texas is a state that is vulnerable to hurricanes since it is in the western section of the Gulf of Mexico; there have been 37 tropical cyclones that affected the Houston area from 1950-2017 (Trepanier and Tucker 2018). Though the effects of historical storms have been extensively studied on the state of Texas and the Greater Houston Region, there have been few studies examining the combined effects of the three hazards-winds, precipitation, and storm surgeassociated with these storms and the physical, economic, and social losses that result in this area, particularly from the recent Hurricane Harvey. There have been many studies examining the relationship between climate change and hurricanes, though some results continue to be debated (GFDL 2018a). However, there is agreement in that future hurricanes will most likely have higher rainfall rates than the storms we see currently (Knutson et al. 2010;Knutson et al. 2013;Knutson, Sirutis, and Zhao 2015;Wright, Knutson, and Smith 2015). Hurricane Harvey produced unprecedented rainfall amounts in southeast Texas, with all previous tropical cyclones precipitation records shattered (Blake and Zelinsky 2018). With major demographic shifts around the country, especially the trend of people moving to the southeast U.S. and along the coastlines, property damage and growing populations are becoming more at risk from hurricane impacts (Burton 2010). Improving our understanding of risk and vulnerability in the Greater Houston Region can help to mitigate and prepare communities for future storms, as well as understand the implications of the most recent storm to impact the area (Klotzbach et al. 2018). Using GIS-based software to make informed decisions on regional and community preparedness has become more popular in recent years, particularly to illustrate hazard impacts on society. Though there are numerous ways to quantify the risks associated with tropical cyclones using GIS, most studies focus on either high winds, extreme precipitation, or storm surge as individual hazards. This project addresses this shortcoming by focusing on all three hazards and modelling the physical, economic, and social losses in the Greater Houston Region, including those from Hurricane Harvey, using FEMA's HAZUS-MH model. This thesis will examine this through three objectives: 1. Update HAZUS-MH with more recent input variables and databases. 2. Identify the areas of Houston that are most vulnerable to the three hazards of extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge. 3. Assess Houston's specific losses from Hurricane Harvey. In this study, hurricane event risk will be evaluated for nine counties in southeast Texas that make up the Greater Houston Region. To obtain the most up-to-date assessment, the outdated default data included in HAZUS-MH will be replaced with current information with the use of the Comprehensive Data Management System (CDMS). The updated data will then be used in HAZUS-MH to provide a probabilistic overview of the consequences of hurricanes and to estimate the losses that specifically occurred during Hurricane Harvey. An assessment of the probable and actual losses in the Greater Houston Region can help to establish ways to improve current mitigation and preparedness strategies.

They are categorized as hurricanes in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans and typhoons in the Western Pacific Ocean when they reach sustained surface winds of 33 m/s or higher (Montgomery and Farrell 1993). Tropical cyclones are categorized based on their wind speeds via the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (Table 1, adapted from Schott et al. 2012), which was updated in 2012 to specifically highlight peak winds. The earlier versions of this scale, originally developed by Saffir (1973) and Simpson (1974),"}, {"section_title": "Category Sustained Winds (m/s)", "text": "Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds 1 33-43 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage. 2 43-49 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage."}, {"section_title": "(major) 49-58", "text": "Devastating damage will occur. 4 (major) 58-70 Catastrophic damage will occur. 5 (major) 70 or higher Catastrophic damage will occur. incorporated other features of hurricanes, such as central pressure and storm surge, so that the scale could describe the impacts of these destructive storms. Changes were made because recent hurricanes, such as Hurricane Charley (2004) and Hurricane Ike (2008) had extents and peak storm surges that exceeded the ranges of earlier versions of the scale. To reduce public confusion about the impacts associated with storms of various categories on the scale, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) removed the storm surge ranges, flood impact, and central pressure descriptions and revised it to be specifically for sustained winds. Each category on the scale, ranging from 1-5, with 5 having the most destructive impacts, has descriptive statements of the damage that can occur if an area is impacted by the strength of hurricane. For example, Category 1 hurricanes have sustained winds between 33 and 42 m/s and can inflict some damage upon landfall, while Category 5 hurricanes have sustained winds of 70 m/s or higher and produce catastrophic damage when within range of populated areas (Schott et al. 2012). Hurricanes usually start as easterly waves, which have cyclonic vorticity and enough atmospheric instability for tropical cyclogenesis. Easterly waves form in sub-Saharan Africa and make their way across the Atlantic Ocean, becoming more powerful as they progress. The wave becomes classified as a tropical depression when the winds begin to rotate counterclockwise around a low-pressure center, but remain below 16 m/s. A tropical depression can become stronger when the conditions continue to be favorable across the Atlantic Ocean, transitioning to a tropical storm with winds ranging from 17 to 32 m/s or even further to a Category 1 hurricane and beyond. For this to happen, the atmosphere needs to be unstable or have a disturbance to produce strong thunderstorms, sea surface temperatures should be at least 27\u00b0C, the ocean depth should be at least 45 meters, and a deep layer of humid air, little to no wind shear, and a strong Coriolis force must be present (Emanuel 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Damages and Losses from Hurricanes", "text": "Damages associated with tropical cyclones are usually due to the three main attributes from this destructive natural hazard: extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge (Emanuel 2005). However, social factors may be influencing the amount of physical, economic, and social losses that have come out of more recent North Atlantic hurricane seasons, such as risk perception and self-assessment of levels of emergency preparedness (Kashem, Wilson, and Zandt 2016). In recent decades, the United States has experienced several major demographic shifts, with the most significant being a trend in people moving to the southeast and along the coasts of the country (Burton 2010). In Texas, specifically, the population of coastal counties, which includes the three major metropolitan areas of Brownsville, Corpus Christi, and Houston, continues to grow at an unprecedented rate (Dixon and Fitzsimons 2001). In turn, there has been an increase in development, including housing, infrastructure, and commercial buildings, making them more vulnerable to hurricane damages from the winds, rainfall and storm surge (Dixon and Fitzsimons 2001). Although trends in landfalling hurricanes in the contiguous United States have more significantly increased and decreased in frequency, hurricane-related damages have had a notable increase, likely due to the increases in population and development along the Gulf and east coasts (Klotzbach et al. 2018). It is also expected that future losses from hurricane events will be financially damaging to local, state, and federal agencies (Klotzbach et al. 2018). Storm surge is defined by the NHC as a storm's abnormal rise of water above the predicted astronomical tides and is produced by water being pushed toward the shore by the force of tropical cyclone-strength winds rotating (NHC 2019b). Storm surge is particularly hard to predict for any given location because of different factors, such as storm intensity, forward speed, geographical extent of the storm, angle of approach to the coast, central pressure, and the shape and characteristics of coastal features, such as barrier islands. Storm surge is destructive due to the weight of water (approximately 1008 kg/m 3 ), and, along with big waves, can destroy any structure that is not specifically designed to withstand those forces. Salt water intrusion from the ocean into estuaries and bayous can endanger public health, kill vegetation, and force wildlife away from the flooded areas (Emanuel 2005;NHC 2019b). The potential impacts of storm surge on the Texas coastline, specifically in the Houston/Galveston area, were studied in the years following Hurricane Ike. Torres et al. (2015) looked at the hydrologic contributions and interactions of hurricane storm surge and rainfall-runoff for the Houston Ship Channel by implementing a hurricane shifting modeling framework that preserves the spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall and wind fields. While storm surge consistently dominated the flooding potential in the area, the rainfall-runoff volume contributed more than 50% of the volume share in the overall storage budget (Torres et al. 2015). Moreover, using a methodology for estimating the annual probability of the joint hazard of storm surge and extreme winds based on the bivariate copula model for Galveston, Texas, Trepanier et al. (2015) found that the probability peaks in September and a Category 3 hurricane with a storm surge of at least 4 meters has a 1.7% chance of occurring every year. Hurricanes can result in billions of dollars-worth of losses when they make The top vulnerable states in the U.S. to hurricanes when it comes to insured coastal properties are New York, Florida, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Jersey (NOAA 2019)."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change and Hurricanes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Precipitation", "text": "One of the most prominent features of tropical cyclones is the extreme precipitation that causes inland flooding, which can greatly affect the people and environment, as well as result in significant economic damage and loss of life (Paul and Sharif 2018). Precipitation from tropical cyclones accounts for a large percentage of the total annual precipitation and extreme precipitation events along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts (Knight andDavis 2007, 2009). Texas, specifically, receives an average of 123.5 mm of precipitation from tropical cyclones per year, which is about 13% of the state's mean annual precipitation (Zhu and Quiring 2013). Though the human influence has not been definitively detected for this feature of hurricanes, tropical cyclone precipitation is expected to increase in the future due to the increase in atmospheric moisture from anthropogenic warming; there is a projected average of 10-15% increase for a 2\u00b0C warming scenario (GFDL 2018a). Though there is disagreement and uncertainty on the extent of how much tropical cyclone precipitation will increase in the future, there is a consensus that future hurricanes will most likely have higher rainfall rates than the storms seen today (Knutson et al. 2010;Knutson et al. 2013;Knutson, Sirutis, and Zhao 2015;Wright, Knutson, and Smith 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Intensity and Frequency", "text": "In a 2\u00b0C warming scenario, it is likely that global tropical cyclone intensity can increase anywhere from 1-10%, according to climate model projections (Knutson, Sirutis, and Zhao 2015;Knutson et al. 2010). Furthermore, the global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach the Category 4 or 5 level on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale will also likely increase, but there is less confidence in the number of storms of these strengths since the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease throughout the century (Knutson et al. 2013;Bender et al. 2010). More intense hurricanes, in turn, suggest that there is a large destructive potential in any given storm. Vecchi, Swanson, and Soden (2008), however, show that the relationship between rising sea-surface temperatures and the destructive potential of a tropical cyclones is only statistical, not physically meaningful, and convey that current measurements show longterm trends of Atlantic hurricane activity that are much more conservative. Though the global mean temperature and sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic show statistically significant warming trends, the historical hurricane record for the basin does not have enough compelling evidence to prove that this warming will induce a long-term increase in tropical cyclones (GFDL 2018a). Vecchi and Soden (2007)  It is difficult to predict the frequency of future intense tropical cyclones for a myriad of reasons, such as model parameter constrictions and idealized assumptions that do not reflect real-world conditions (Knutson and Tuleya 2004;Knutson et al. 2008). Using an 18-model average of climate change projections, Bender et al. (2010) estimate that the frequency of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes can increase by as much as 81% by the end of the century since observed tropical cyclones at that magnitude have increased linearly in the last 60 years. However, the confidence of these projections is low since there is little evidence to lead to that conclusion that anthropogenic climate change will lead to a large increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic (GFDL 2018a). Another factor in the difficulty in understanding how Atlantic hurricanes have changed historically is the lack of accurate records and observations from before 1965 (Vecchi and Knutson 2008). When assessing Atlantic HURDAT (Jarvinen, Neumann, and Davis 1984;McAdie et al. 2009), the hurricane database managed by the NHC, many studies have concluded that the increase in tropical cyclones in this basin since the late 19 th century is most likely due to the improved monitoring from advances in technology and observation methods, such as the implementation of satellite data (Vecchi and Knutson 2008;Landsea et al. 2010;Vecchi and Knutson 2011;Villarini et al. 2011). Furthermore, Landsea et al. (2010) noticed that there has been a significant increase in the number of tropical cyclones with durations of less than two days since the 1800s. Though there is no clear indication that climate change is the cause of this, it does verify that the improvement of observational practices may be the explanation for the historical increase in tropical cyclone frequency (GFDL 2018b)."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge", "text": "Due to sea level rise from anthropogenic climate change, it is predicted that tropical cyclones will likely produce higher levels of storm surge (IPCC 2014). Moreover, the vulnerability of coastal regions to storm surge is also expected to increase because of the increase of commercial, residential, and infrastructural development in the most susceptible areas to tropical cyclones (GFDL 2018a). The average rate of global sea level rise has been about 3.1 mm/year since the start of satellite sea level recording in 1993 (Lindsey 2018). Throughout the 21 st century, sea level rise will most likely exceed levels observed from 1971-2010 for a myriad of future carbon emission scenarios (IPCC 2014). Part of the increased risk in higher levels of storm surge are due to the rise in global sea levels (Rahmstorf 2017). Sea levels have risen about cm since 1900, with the rate accelerating in the last 25 years and expected to increase further in the future (Chen et al. 2017). This is occurring because continental ice melts from global warming, which is adding water to the oceans (Rahmstorf 2017). The severity of storm surge that will happen in the future will depend on the size and intensity of the tropical cyclone, meaning that larger and more powerful storms will likely produce more storm surge (Rahmstorf 2017). With these factors expected to increase due to climate change, storm surge should also become more of a threat (Rahmstorf 2017).\nTo estimate the losses from storm surge, a combined hurricane and flood hazard analysis was run for Galveston County, Texas. Since HAZUS-MH is unable to produce results for a probabilistic scenario, Hurricane Ike was simulated for Galveston as a historical scenario (FEMA 2018d). This alternate study region was chose for both the hurricane and flood models because the area must be about the size of one coastal county (FEMA 2018d). The hurricane wind model is run first using the SLOSH model to produce estimates of the coastal still water elevations (FEMA 2018d). The \"No Waves\" option was selected for this scenario, where the SWAN model is skipped entirely and the Flood Model assumes depth-limited waves at the coastline rather than using significant wave heights produced by the SWAN model, so that the analysis could be completed with no issues (FEMA 2018d). The initial water level with respect to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 was estimated to be 0.964 ft above sea level by using the NOAA tide forecasts and the pre-storm tide anomaly, which is the difference between the forecast and observed water levels two days before landfall at Galveston Pier 21 (NOAA 2008). This shows the water level along the coast that would have been expected in the absence of the hurricane near the center of the study region at the time of \nThe storm surge from Hurricane Harvey was simulated for Galveston County, Texas using a combination of the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind and Flood Models. This hurricane scenario was imported from HURREVAC into the model, with the storm track beginning at a location less than 24 hours before landfall (FEMA 2018d). All the parameters of this simulation were the same as the Hurricane Ike simulation described in Chapter V. The only exception was the initial water level with respect to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, estimated to be 0.7 ft at Galveston Pier 21 (NOAA 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricanes That Have Affected Houston, Texas", "text": "Houston, Texas is vulnerable to tropical cyclones due to its geographical location along the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Carr (1967)  Liu (2012) discovered that the residents of the Gulf Coast showed no significant changes in preparedness and evacuation plans in a comparison of interviews conducted one month before and one year after Hurricane Ike. This emphasizes how the increase in access of information to minority groups can be beneficial for disaster resiliency and quicker recover time (Chen, Banerjee, and Liu 2012). The storm surge that affected the Houston area from Hurricane Ike also had significant consequences. Schiller (2011) used GIS to find which areas in the counties surrounding Houston would be flooded from a 2-m and 5-m storm surge and approximated that the daily wage loss can run into millions of dollars. Because of this storm surge from the hurricane, studies have examined the potential benefits of putting a levee, commonly known as the \"Ike Dike,\" along the coastline of Galveston Island to protect the surrounding communities from this effect of major hurricanes (Subramanian et al. 2013;Pan 2015;Atoba et al. 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Harvey", "text": "Hurricane Harvey started out as a wave off the west coast of Africa on August Aghababei, Koliou, and Paal 2018; Sreetharan, Batten, and Lawler 2018; Pan, Yan, and Archer 2018)."}, {"section_title": "HAZUS-MH", "text": "The development of hazards models using GIS has become a growing topic of research in recent years. For example, by exploring the results of a hydraulic GIS model, Colby, Mulcahy, and Wang (2000) found that in the wake of Hurricane Floyd 1999, their methods showed a better representation of the flooding than FEMA's Q3 100-year and 500-year floodplain maps of the same area. However, tropical cyclones involve three hazards: extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge. Therefore, more studies are beginning to use multi-hazard models to conduct hurricane risk analyses to understand how all three phenomena affect an area at the same time, particularly in the context of economic losses. After finding the aggregated average number of tropical cyclones that have affected the Caribbean over the last 30 years, Bertinelli, Mohan, and Strobl (2016) concluded that a 50-year event could cost about $8 billion, but the risks and losses differ across the many islands in the region. Moreover, using a combination of models can create results that are in line with what was observed. Pan 2015developed a general framework to estimate the cost of damages from Hurricane Ike using models that included direct and indirect impacts on the economy using GIS. Using this combination of models, Pan (2015) found that Ike was the third costliest hurricane to impact the U.S. at the time and the results were like what was observed in the aftermath of the storm. The use of GIS-based models can also help the user to visualize the impacts of hurricanes from maps created from model runs. Estimating hurricaneinduced damage and risk to utilities in Florida, Xu and Brown (2008) presented maps developed from a probabilistic hurricane simulation model that shows peak wind gusts and, compared to the American Society of Civil Engineers 7 wind map of the state, indicated that the results are similar to what is observed in reality. Due to the fact that tropical cyclones are associated with multiple hazards, there is a need to integrate all aspects of the coast; GIS is one of the most appropriate tools to use for this study due to its versatility (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2009;Andrews, Gares, and Colby 2002). The Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH) model is multi-hazard risk assessment tool developed by FEMA and is used by local government agencies and community emergency managers to aid in mitigation, response, and recovery (Schneider and Schauer 2006). The model estimates the potential physical, economic, and social losses from many types of natural hazards and has had many successful applications in the government and private sectors (Schubert et al. 2015;Jaiswal et al. 2017;Blankenship 2009). HAZUS-MH utilizes the ArcGIS software developed by the Environmental Systems Research Institute to present the data (Schneider and Schauer 2006). The user can use HAZUS-MH as a way to analyze past storms by using historical data, hypothetical storms by creating a user-defined hurricane scenario from user-defined input, and present storms for disaster planning and response (Beckmann and Simpson 2006). The Hurricane Wind Model within HAZUS-MH contains many different models, including a hurricane hazard model, terrain model, and wind pressure and windborne debris model, all of which are updated versions of the original models developed by  and . The hurricane hazard model is composed of a storm track and wind field model, as well as a hurricane rainfall model. The mean simulated rate of landfalling hurricanes has a 95% confidence interval for the observed intense hurricanes categorized by both central pressure and estimated wind speed. The hurricane rainfall model is empirical and considers the increase in rainfall rate with increasing storm intensity by deeming a factor that regards the effect of the rate of change in central pressure on rainfall rate and another factor that models the asymmetric distribution of rainfall that is a function of storm translation speed. Rainfall rates far from the storm center tended to be overestimated, but a calibration factor is used to provide reasonable estimates of rainfall rates from all areas of the storm. The terrain model considers the fact that as ground surface becomes rougher, the wind speeds near the ground decrease, but the upper level winds remain the same. However, the hurricane model yields estimates of wind speeds for open terrain conditions. In addition, there are no direct databases that describe surface roughness over regions in the U.S. Therefore, the model uses information on land use and land cover to estimate surface roughness from the National Land Cover Data compiled by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium   . The damage loss estimation model within HAZUS-MH approximates damage with an engineering-based load and resistance model . The costs are estimated using a combination of a cost estimated model and an empirical model developed using insurance data . Both models have been validated through comparisons of model and actual losses with reasonable outcomes and are acceptable to use for loss estimation . HAZUS-MH is mostly used to estimate potential losses and identify risks from seismic activity, such as earthquakes (Jaiswal et al. 2017;Remo and Pinter 2012;Schmidtlein et al. 2011;Padgett, Nielson, and DesRoches 2008). In general, the studies that use HAZUS-MH that involve hurricane risk only consider one of the hazards associated with tropical cyclones: extreme winds. After using the probabilistic mode from HAZUS-MH to estimate wind speed and the deterministic mode to find the wind swath, Scheitlin et al. (2011) produced a 100-year hurricane wind gust of 58 m/s on Santa Rosa Island within a 90% confidence interval and found that at least 25% of the residential and commercial buildings would be damaged in their hypothetical simulation. The model was tested for Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a place that is not only vulnerable to hurricanes, but also needs to act in the case of a state-wide emergency; understanding the risks for that area is essential to the safety of the entire area and results can be applied to nearby places (Scheitlin et al. 2011). Moreover, to quantify the resilience of residential buildings against a hurricane event, Tokgoz and Gheorghe savanna, and woodlands (Climate of Texas 2012). Southeast Texas, specifically, has a very low elevation, especially near the coast (Rajsekhar, Mishra, and Singh 2013), and is more developed than other areas of the state (Figure 1). Houston, Texas, a major city in southeast Texas, is one of the most rapidly growing cities in the U.S., with an estimated 2017 population of over 2 million people and the expectation of it growing further to become the third most populous city in the country in the late 2020s (About Houston: "}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "This study uses a myriad of datasets, some of which are provided as the default data of HAZUS-MH, and others that are updated as part of Objective 1 of this thesis. The HAZUS-MH inventory contains hazard and boundary map data, as well as a proxy for the general building stock for the continental U.S., Hawaii, and the U.S. Territories (FEMA 2019c). Furthermore, it consists of national data for essential facilities, high potential losses facilities, transportation systems, lifeline systems, agriculture, vehicles, and demographics, most of which are updated for the purposes of this thesis (FEMA 2019c). A full description of the databases that were not specifically updated for this study can be found at https://www.fema.gov/summary-databases-hazus-multi-hazard. A more detailed explanation of the datasets that were updated for this study is provided in Chapter IV of this thesis. Objective 2 of this thesis will use the probabilistic mode of the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model. The storms that will be simulated for the analysis are part of the software's 100,000-year database of pre-generated peak wind gust speeds for each census tract in the U.S. The Hurricane Wind Model takes rainfall into account, so two of the three hurricane hazards will be analyzed in this part of the objective. Since the HAZUS-MH cannot estimate losses from storm surge in a probabilistic simulation, both the Hurricane Wind Model and the Flood Model will be run using the historical storm Hurricane Ike to simulate storm surge conditions in Galveston County. These data will be used to determine which areas of the Greater Houston Region are the most vulnerable to high winds, extreme rainfall, and storm surge. The developers of HAZUS-MH recently released a service package to the most recent version of the model, Version 4.2, which includes the additions of Hurricanes Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), Irma (2017), Maria (2017), and Nate (2017) to the historical storm database (FEMA 2018b). Objective 3 of this study will use Hurricane Harvey for the storm simulation in the Hurricane Wind Model for the wind and rainfall analysis. However, the developers discourage users from applying this storm to a storm surge analysis (FEMA 2018b). Therefore, the hurricane aspect of the storm surge analysis for this objective will use a storm advisory file from HURREVAC, a decision support tool of the National Hurricane Program and is administered by FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Hurricane Center (HURREVAC 2019). This option is included within the User-Defined Scenario option in HAZUS-MH and updated with hurricane tracks through the year 2017 (FEMA 2018d). When an existing forecast is selected, hurricane radii, and wind speeds are reduced to default factors (FEMA 2018d)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Objective 1: Update HAZUS-MH with more recent input variables and databases", "text": "The HAZUS-MH data inventory includes a vast amount of information for any of the hazards that can be run in this model: earthquake, flood, tsunami, and hurricane. Data that are used in all HAZUS-MH analyses include information about buildings and describes the materials that they are made from, as well as how the building is used. The material descriptions are referred to as general building types and includes descriptions such as wood, concrete, steel, masonry, and manufactured homes. Buildings can be used in many ways, such as residential, commercial, and industrial. In addition, lifelines, which are utilities that, if not available, make it difficult for normal community functioning to proceed, and replacement costs are economic factors that can be affect by hazard. For a social standpoint, demographics are common in many hazard analyses. All the information provided in the inventory can and, where possible, should be enhanced with improved data, such as those that are up-to-date or provided by local governments. The data are verified and inputted by the CDMS, which validates that user data are compliant with the requirements for the HAZUS-MH software to work properly. The primary function of the CDMS is to allow users to query and explore the inventory and supports the transfer of data into and out of the major statewide databases (Mickey 2004). The datasets that have been updated or replaced using the CDMS are described in Tables 3, 5, 7, and 8 in Chapter IV. Using a combination of updated and default data within HAZUS-MH constitutes the study to be designated a Level 2 analysis ( Using the updated datasets provided by Objective 1, a probabilistic scenario of hurricanes will be simulated to determine the areas of the Greater Houston Region that are most vulnerable to the three hazards that are involved in the hurricane event: extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surge. HAZUS-MH includes a 100,000-year database of pre-generated peak wind gusts for each census tract in the U.S. that will simulate every possible storm scenario for the study area. The hurricanes included in the database vary in size, strength, speed, and direction, providing an objective way to compare risk in different areas of the region. The probabilistic scenario option in HAZUS-MH looks at the simulated storms that intersect the study area and the total losses from those are ranked. Then, the storm that caused that loss is used to make a wind-speed map. The HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model uses several models to estimate losses in a study area. The hurricane risk model included in the overall wind model consists of three parts: a wind field model, a hurricane track model, and a rainfall model. The wind field model solves the full non-linear equations of motion of translating hurricanes and establishes parameters for a fast-running simulation. This model also accounts for storm asymmetries, changing sea surface roughness, and air-sea temperature differences. The hurricane track model simulated the entire track of a tropical storm and allows the storms to curve, as well as change speed and intensity as they move. Based on the HURDAT database, this model can show hurricane wind risk over large regions. Rainfall is one of the most difficult parameters to simulate in any hurricane model because it involves the non-linear interactions of weather fronts and topography. The rainfall model uses central pressure deficit, storm category, and storm translation speed to estimate precipitation in a hurricane. The validation of this model was done with rainfall measurements from Hurricanes Hugo (1989), Bertha (1996), Fran (1996), and Bonnie (1998) (Mickey 2004). HAZUS-MH Version 4.2 produces reasonable estimates of rainfall, but there is an expectation of significant variation with actual events due to unmodeled events (FEMA). Other models within the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model include a terrain model and a tree blow down model. A terrain model is necessary because surface roughness from buildings, trees, vegetation, and hills can slow down wind due to friction, which a hurricane model should consider for loss estimation. The tree blow down model shows the effects of trees during a wind storm. Though trees can provide shelter to structures, thus reducing wind pressure, falling trees produce a strike hazard to structures and add debris to dispose of after a storm. The tree database in HAZUS-MH includes three types of trees (deciduous, coniferous, and mixed), tree density measured in stems per acre, and tree height, distributed between three broad categories of 30-40 ft, 40-60 ft, and greater than 60 ft (Mickey 2004). HAZUS-MH estimates physical, economic, and social losses in several ways. The model takes into consideration wind pressure, wind-borne debris, and building resistance when estimating physical losses. In HAZUS-MH, wind pressure is calculated as a function of wind speed, wind direction, and location of the wind on a building. In practice, design wind loads on buildings are determined using wind tunnel data or building code provisions based on wind tunnel data. There are two wind-borne missile models in the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model, one is for residential buildings that account for shingles, wood, and sheathing-type missiles, and the other for commercial buildings that considers gravel missiles from built-up roofing. The building debris model is based on damage states for structural and non-structural components of the HAZUS-MH model buildings and considers the typical density of that debris type. Each building type has a set of debris functions related to terrain, where rougher terrains produce less building debris. There are many ways a building can be resistant to the effects of hurricanes, such as having precautionary water resistance measures, masonry reinforcements, shuttering, improvement of roof-wall connections, and roof-deck attachments, tie downs, and roof covers. The physically based damage-to-loss model in HAZUS-MH computes direct economic losses using the explicit costing of windows, doors, sheathing, and roof covers, and the implicit costing of the estimates of volume of water entering through failed windows and doors. The estimates of the tree analysis are based on the tree coverage database, the tree blow down model, and the expected green weight of tree stems for trees greater than 30 feet tall. The eligible tree debris is an estimate made for all areas, though there may not be data for more sparsely populated areas; the volume of trees is based on 10 yd 3 /ton. The terrain analysis parameters show roughness lengths where higher roughness creates more drag at the surface, which yields lower wind speeds. The direct economic impacts that are estimated in HAZUS-MH include annual gross sales, business inventory, disruption costs, restoration time, and income and wage losses. Social losses determined in this model show the need for public shelters in the aftermath of a hurricane. The parameters that are considered are age, ethnicity, income, home ownership, and the damage states of the different types of buildings (Mickey 2004). There are several ways that HAZUS-MH presents results from a probabilistic scenario of the Hurricane Wind Model. The model can randomly select seven storms from the 100,000-year database with return periods of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 years, which represents the physical, economic, and social losses for each return period. The return periods are based on total direct economic losses for the entire study region. In addition, there is a full set of results provided; that contains damage, debris, shelter estimates, and dollar losses, among other results. The direct physical losses that are presented from this model include the structural damage for buildings and the extent of losses on the essential facilities. The structural damage for buildings involves the damage state probability counts and losses by occupancy and building type, while the essential facility losses show the loss of use measured in days and the damage state probability. The debris results show building debris in terms of wood and masonry, as well as steel and concrete, and the tree debris as related to building density, length of roads, and census block shapes. Trees downed near streets, highways, or buildings, make up the great majority of trees brought to curbs for collection and disposal. The direct economic losses from the general building stock include building losses, which are calculated from the structural, non-structural, content, and business inventory and interruption losses, which are estimated from wage, income, proprietor losses, and costs from rental and relocation. There is also an uncertainty analysis within the results of a HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model run. The forecast uncertainties model uses statistics to forecast errors compiled from the period from 1993 to 2004 to simulate a range of possible outcomes. The results report displays the 5 th and 95 th percentiles of the simulated outcomes. HAZUS-MH can automatically save result reports and create thematic maps of results on the fly, but this can increase the analysis processing time (Mickey 2004). When estimating the losses from storm surge in HAZUS-MH, the user must use a combination of the Hurricane Wind Model and the Flood Model. Because the model is unable to determine storm surge from a probabilistic scenario and the study area cannot be larger than one county (FEMA 2018d), the storm surge from Hurricane Ike, a historic storm in the HAZUS-MH inventory, will be simulated and analyzed to determine the potential storm surge as compared to Hurricane Harvey in Objective 3. HAZUS-MH uses three industry standard models that are used simultaneously to determine the storm surge in a study area: the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model, the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model, and a modified version of the Wave Height Analysis for Flood Insurance Studies (WHAFIS) model (Mickey 2004). Using this combination of storm surge models allow for the estimation of economic losses to the general building stock for hurricane scenarios on coastal flood regions (Mickey 2004). Only the direct economic losses are output results from HAZUS-MH as a table or report; maps are unable to be generated in this hazard scenario, but results can be compared to flood maps from FEMA and other government agencies (Mickey 2004). The losses that are estimated by HAZUS-MH allow for a user, government agency, or private organization in planning for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery for future tropical cyclones. This methodology considers many aspects of the built and natural environment, as well as a wide range of losses that can occur when a tropical cyclone impacts an area. The results of this objective will provide a reliable preliminary assessment of the weaknesses in the structures in the Greater Houston Region."}, {"section_title": "Objective 3: Assess Houston's specific losses from Hurricane Harvey", "text": "Objective 3 is like Objective 2 in that HAZUS-MH will be run for the Greater Houston Region. However, this portion of the study will have a historic storm scenario and a user-defined storm scenario for Hurricane Harvey. The results of these two scenarios will be compared to the results from Objective 2 to see if the areas that are most vulnerable to specific aspects of hurricanes were greatly affected by Harvey. The historic scenario will be used for the Hurricane Wind Model, while the storm surge will be calculated from the user-defined storm scenario. Assessing the results from Hurricane Harvey with the updated data from Objective 1 can help to evaluate current mitigation strategies in the Greater Houston Region and to understand how Harvey was unique in comparison to the probabilistic scenario. Objective 3 will differ from Objective 2 in that the HAZUS-MH Flood Model will be used to determine the full extent of losses. The Greater Houston Region was not greatly affected by the extreme winds from Hurricane Harvey; losses related to the hurricane's winds are more apparent near the location of the its first two landfalls, which are southwest of the study area. The losses in the Houston area were almost entirely determined by the flooding, which came through the combination of the hurricane stalling for several days and the amount of precipitation in the region that were observed as a result. Because of this, only Harris County, which comprises of both the riverine and coastal features, as well as contains the city of Houston, will be used for this part of Program, which pays claims to victims during the recovery period based on the depreciated value of a building . However, using the   as the relationship between the depth of flooding and the annual probability of inundation greater than that depth and can be shown in a depth-frequency curve. A Level 1 analysis is used in this study because the Flood Information Tool, provided by HAZUS-MH and similar to the CDMS, is not used to preprocess the site-specific flood hazard data or facilitate the import of these data into the Flood Model to run a further analysis of the damage and loss associated with the flooding . However, the data inputted into the model in Objective 1 are used for basic loss estimation. The flood hazard analysis begins with determining the terrain of a study area through the use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) . This is determined through HAZUS-MH, which has the capability of importing the raster files directly from the USGS National Elevation Dataset based on the spatial extent of the study region; it also clips the rasters to the watersheds that intersect the study area FEMA 2018c). Topographic information is necessary for a flood hazard analysis because the boundary and depth of flooding is determined by the differences between the ground and flood surfaces ). Because Harris County is subject to a riverine flood hazard from its many rivers, but particularly from Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River, a stream network was generated to identify the river reaches in the study area (FEMA). The Flood Model processes the DEM of the study region to determine the locations of the streams (FEMA 2018c). A hydrological analysis must also be done in order to delineate the floodplain in the area (FEMA 2018c). Harris County also has coastal areas, so a coastal flood hazard also had to be run for this study. The shoreline is determined by the DEM; the 100-year still water elevation and vertical datum for each shoreline segment were found through the use of the Harris County Flood Insurance Study (FEMA 2018c(FEMA , 2017a. Delineating the floodplain also had to be performed for the coastal regions (FEMA 2018c). A single return period of 200 years was selected for both the riverine and coastal analyses since Hurricane Harvey was determined to have a return period of approximately 230 years, in terms of its winds and precipitation (Trepanier and Tucker 2018). The HAZUS-MH Flood Model analyzes the impact of both hazards on the data inventory independently so that it can compare the resulting losses to determine which hazard has the greatest impact on that structure type (FEMA 2018c). floodwaters move with an extremely high velocity, the structures and foundations become separated, or there are flood-borne debris impacting the building, but these situations are rare (Scawthorn, Flores, et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "HAZUS-", "text": "The direct economic losses that are estimated in the Flood Model are building repair and replacement costs, building content losses, building inventory losses, relocation expenses, income and wage losses, and rental income losses. Income losses are dependent on the necessary time to completely restore business operations, which includes the time needed for physical restoration of a building from cleaning up, repairing, getting the required inspections and permits, and the delay of contractor availability. These are indirect losses that HAZUS-MH accounts for in the loss estimation. Therefore, a flood-specific restoration model was developed to provide that estimate of time required based on occupancy type and flood depth at 4-ft increments. The total restoration time increases with flood depth until the building reaches 50% damage; after that point, the building is considered to be totally lost and it is assumed that the building will be demolished and rebuilt (Scawthorn, Flores, et al. 2006). Social losses are estimated in the HAZUS-MH Flood Model in terms of shelter needs. The algorithm used in the Flood Model is the same as the Earthquake Model, but slightly adjusted to demonstrate the differing shelter needs; sheltering related to floods is based on the number of displaced people in inundated areas in a study area and are modified by taking into account income and age (Scawthorn, Flores, et al. 2006). This is because those who have lower income and those who are part of younger or elderly families tend to seek shelter more than those who are more financially established (Scawthorn, Flores, et al. 2006). The individuals from displaced households also are made up of people who live in areas that were evacuated from an issued warning or who cannot get to their properties because of flooded or damaged roadways, though their structure may not be damaged (Scawthorn, Flores, et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER IV", "text": "UPDATING HAZUS-MH DEFAULT DATA"}, {"section_title": "Updated Datasets", "text": "The categories of data that are updated as part of Objective 1 are essential facilities, high potential loss facilities, transportation systems, and utility systems.

When the replacement cost was not included in the new dataset, the average value from the default HAZUS-MH data was calculated and the inflation percentage, found using the U.S. Department of Labor's Inflation Calculator (DOL 2019), was accounted for and added since most of the default data were collected between 1999 and 2001.

An early effort to calculate hurricane return periods was based on hurricane landfalls that occurred in the U.S. from 1886 to 1970 by Simpson and Lawrence (1971), where they studied the return periods for all hurricanes within 80-kilometer coastal segments, ranging from Texas to Maine. Elsner and Kara (1999) focused on counties along the coast, finding return periods that ranged from 4 years for Monroe County, Florida to about 100 years for some counties in Georgia and Maine. By analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of tropical cyclone strikes from 1901-2005 at 45 different locations from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine, Keim, Muller, and Stone (2006) found that the return period of tropical storm-strength systems or greater for southeast Texas is three years, on average. The expected return period of an event similar to Hurricane Harvey, in terms of its combined wind and precipitation measurements, in Houston, Texas is estimated to be 230 years (Trepanier and Tucker 2018). For each county in the Greater Houston Region, results were calculated for each return period based on the 100,000-year database of storms included in HAZUS-MH. To compare to the results from Hurricane Harvey (see Objective 3), the 10-year, 200-year, and 1000-year return periods will be analyzed for the purpose of this objective.

The probable storm tracks of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000-year return periods are shown in Figure 3. The types of hurricanes that occur the most often, the 10year and 20-year storms, probably would not make a direct impact on the Greater Houston Region since they tend to track south of the area.

For example, on the eastern side of the Greater Houston Region in Liberty and Chambers counties, the wind speeds are higher in the 200-year return period than in the 1000-year return period.

Minor damage includes a maximum of one broken window, door, or garage door, moderate roof cover loss that can be covered to prevent additional water entering the buildings, with marks or dents on walls that require painting or patching for repair. The moderate damage category is given when there is major roof cover damage, moderate window breakage, and minor roof sheathing failure, which results in damage to the interior of the building from water. Severe damage occurs when there is major window damage or roof sheathing loss, major roof cover loss, and extensive damage to the interior of the building from water.

This is probably because this type of storm occurs the most often of all the return periods, thus most buildings are well-prepared for such frequent events. There were little to no buildings with damage states that would greatly impair their functionality if a 10-year hurricane were to impact the Greater Houston damage, while more than 25% of agricultural buildings will fall into the severe or the complete destruction categories.

The 10-year event results in an estimated loss of over $358 million, while the 200-year event shows a $56.6 billion loss and the 1000-year event shows an estimated $131.9 billion loss. Most buildings in the study area are residential, therefore they experience the greatest economic loss. All the occupancy classes experienced a great increase in losses from the most frequent type of storm to the least likely storm scenario.\nThe direct economic losses from the combined wind and flood analysis of Galveston County by occupancy class for Hurricane Ike exceeds $63 billion, with most costs coming from the damages to residential buildings, particularly with the building replacement costs and content losses ( Figure 22). Commercial buildings also had significant losses in those categories, estimated to be more than $386 million.

The residential and wooden structures experienced more damage than any other category of building and the 1000-year hurricane return period scenario caused the most damage in the Greater Houston Region. The losses greatly increased as the return period increased; this trend could be seen in every result throughout this chapter. The losses that come from the different hurricane scenarios show that any tropical cyclone to impact the Greater Houston Region, whether directly or indirectly, can result in billions of dollars' worth of damages. This can mean that mitigation strategies need to improve in order to reduce the impact costs, as well as recovery time in the aftermath of the storm, in this area. This is apparent with the residential and wooden buildings that are in the counties around the central Harris County, where Houston is located. Most of the people working in the city would live in the outer suburbs of the area; with many of those people affected by a tropical cyclone, the economy of this major city would also be impacted.

Only the hospitals on the outskirt areas of the Greater Houston Region would have loss of use of less than 3 days."}, {"section_title": "Fire Stations", "text": "For the 10-year, 200-year, and 1000-year return period hurricane events and their relation to the days lost for the fire stations in the Greater Houston Region, these facilities have zero days lost (Figure 15), meaning that they can have full use during an emergency during tropical cyclone impact and post-storm recovery efforts."}, {"section_title": "Police Stations", "text": "There is full use of the police stations during a 10-year hurricane event ( Figure   16). Though there is mostly no loss of days in the 200-year return period scenario, the facilities that do have losses are near the coast and near the probabilistic hurricane track. However, the loss of use is only about one day. In the 1000-year hurricane, there are more police stations that are affected and have more than one day of loss of use; these facilities are primarily located in Galveston County."}, {"section_title": "Emergency Response Centers", "text": "Like the other essential facilities, there are little to no expected days lost for the emergency response centers.

Some schools in the Greater Houston Region can have as many as 195 days lost in the wake of a 200-year hurricane. The facilities with the most days are located near the coast or near the probabilistic storm track. For the 1000-year hurricane return period, schools near the coast and along the probabilistic storm track have the most expected days with loss of use, the highest being 208 days. In both the 200-year and the 1000-year events, the days lost decrease as the distance from the coast or the storm track increases. The schools that are located more inland or on the edges of the study area have less loss of use ( Figure 18).

Eligible trees are the downed trees that would likely be collected and disposed of at the public's expense (FEMA 2018d). In each scenario, trees have the highest amount of debris because they are the lightest debris type. Concrete and steel, being the heaviest, are expected to produce the least debris. The eligible trees amount is lower than expected, since trees that are downed would likely need to be disposed of if they are blocked a road or on power lines. In the 1000-year hurricane event, there are be more than 60 million tons of trees that become debris in the high winds and extreme precipitation of the hurricane. \nThere was no debris caused by Hurricane Harvey's winds in this study area.\nThe debris that the HAZUS-MH Flood Model analyzes is separated into three categories: building finish, structural, and foundation; it is estimated as the expected weight of each debris type in tons (Figure 37). Building finish produced the highest amount of debris in the floodwaters, with the total estimated to be approximately 250,000 tons. The foundation and structural debris are much lower than the finish debris and are estimated to weigh around 165,000 tons.

The probabilistic 10-year, 200-year, and 1000-year hurricane return periods and the resulting number of displaced households in the Greater Houston Region indicates that the number of census tracts with a great number of displaced households decreases from the 200-year return period to the 1000-year return period ( Figure 20). This is due to the location of the storm track, which results in wind damage, as well as the census tract's proximity to the nearby waterbodies, which can be a reason for damage from flooding."}, {"section_title": "Short-Term Shelter Needs", "text": "Societal impacts can also be explained in terms of the short-term shelter needs. The number of shelters needed in the wake of 10-year, 200-year, and 1000-year hurricanes ( Figure 21) correspond with the number of displaced households because people will need to access them quick, and at a short distance from their homes.

Education buildings also had over $600,000 in output loss, making it the second highest loss for this scenario. "}, {"section_title": "Displaced Population and Short-Term Shelter Needs", "text": "The displaced population due to a 200-year flood is approximately 84,000 people with the need for about 5,800 short-term shelters throughout Harris County. However, this data is based on the 2010 U.S. Census, so it may not reflect what would be needed for a present-day storm. This displaced population is also small in percentage in comparison to the entire county, which was around 4 million in 2010 (Houston city, Texas 2019). Nonetheless, almost 100,000 people displaced is significant and would still need to be addressed with urgency in the wake of a flood. There were no significantly damaged manufactured homes reported in the results of the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model. However, there were some losses associated with the minor damages to those structures; they were small and estimated to be $2,370. In the storm surge analysis, it was noted that the commercial and industrial buildings had high economic losses, while the educational and governmental buildings had much lower damage costs. This is most likely because the latter structures tend to be located more inland. Furthermore, manufactured homes are not located in the floodplains in this scenario since the losses are much lower in comparison to the other building types. With 51 ft in riverine flooding estimated for a 200-year flood, it is expected that the losses coming from the downtown Houston area will be much higher since the city was built around Buffalo Bayou and other rivers. The coastal flooding in Harris County is estimated to be about half of the riverine flooding at around 27 ft, but can potentially be more dangerous and devastating because of the lower elevation of the coastal area. This low and flat topography of the area can cause the floodwater to be more widespread, affecting more people and property. Hurricane Harvey made landfall as a major hurricane well southwest of the Greater Houston Region, so the intense winds that were observed were not near this study area. The winds that were in this region were of tropical storm-strength; the buildings in this region are most likely able to withstand that force. However, it is obvious that the structures located within the riverine and/or coastal Objective 2 sought to find which areas of the Greater Houston Region were the most vulnerable to the three hazards associated with tropical cyclones: high winds, extreme precipitation, and storm surge. The winds and precipitation were analyzed using the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model. The probabilistic mode was used to determine the probable storm tracks of the 10, 200, and 1000-year return periods to compare the most and less frequent hurricanes, as well as the strength of the storm that is most like the strength of Hurricane Harvey. The results of this objective showed the losses dramatically increased as the return period of the storm also increased. Furthermore, the residential and wood buildings received the most damage of all structure types in all three scenarios, meaning that more people and property, and fewer businesses, would be greatly affected by the winds of a tropical cyclone in the study area (Figures 38 and 39). The effects of storm surge were found using a combination of the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind and Flood Models for Hurricane Ike in Galveston County, Texas; only the direct economic losses were able to be produced. Residential and wood buildings again had the highest losses from this hurricane hazard, but the structures made of masonry also had losses estimated to be in the millions of dollars. The areas of the Greater Houston Region that are most vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes depend on the storm track and the proximity to the coast. The western part of Chambers County that shares its boundary with Galveston Bay, for example, has high losses in the 200year return period scenario because it experiences the coastal effects of the storm, as well as the closeness to the storm track, meaning higher winds. Since higher winds are closer to the center of the storm, and therefore the storm track, those census blocks that are intersect or are near the storm track experience the most losses. In the final objective of this thesis, the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model was run with a historical Hurricane Harvey. Though this model accounts for winds, precipitation, and size of storm, as well as many other attributes of a hurricane, the results of this model show that, in general, winds would produce a lot of damage, but this turned out to not be an issue with Harvey in the Greater Houston Region. The "}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "The results of this study have various implications for other areas of the U.S. Though there is debate on exactly how climate change will affect hurricanes, there is agreement that tropical cyclones are expected to be able to produce more precipitation, though hurricanes will most likely occur less frequently and have stronger winds (Knutson et al. 2010;Knutson et al. 2013;Knutson, Sirutis, and Zhao 2015;Wright, Knutson, and Smith 2015). Hurricanes affect Texas about once every 2-3 years, but some of the most recent notable storm, such as Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Harvey, have made a lasting impact on the people of the Greater Houston Region. However, there has been an increase in development in this area of the county, making people more vulnerable to hurricane damages from wind, rainfall, and storm surge than before (Dixon and Fitzsimons 2001). Hurricane preparedness officials fear that the general public will think that large loss of life and property will diminish in future tropical cyclone events because of advanced technology and improved forecasting (Blake, Landsea, and Gibney 2011). Yet, NOAA directors and other prominent meteorologists and climatologists have stressed the importance of proper hurricane preparedness plans to be formulated, maintained, and executed in the most vulnerable areas of the U.S. so that losses can be reduced in the future (Blake, Landsea, and Gibney 2011). The methodology used in this thesis can be applied to other areas of the U.S. and to other hurricanes for comparison. Applying the HAZUS-MH Flood Model to supplement the results of the Hurricane Wind Model can also help to understand the combined effects of hurricanes that produce more flooding effects than wind damages. Because climate change is expected to affect hurricanes, particularly with the increase in precipitation, it is important to understand all implications of hurricanes, not just the winds. The results of this study can benefit federal, state, and local governments and organizations in understanding the significance of the damages created by a unique tropical cyclone, such as Hurricane Harvey. Recent hurricanes have caused record-setting precipitation, flooding and storm surge, and loss of homes throughout the Greater Houston Region and southeast Texas, so coordinate at all levels of government were necessary to ensure that the hazard mitigation, emergency preparedness strategies, emergency response, and the disaster recovery were as efficient as possible. For example, before Harvey made landfall, FEMA sent supplies and personnel to join the Texas Division of Emergency Management and other local agencies to respond to the devastation (FEMA 2017b). In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, FEMA distributed $1.5 billion in federal funds, which included assistance grants, low-interest disaster loans, and flood insurance advance payments (FEMA 2017b). In the months after Harvey, FEMA conducted an after-action report to evaluate their response to the entire 2017 North Atlantic Hurricane Season and have taken the recommendations of improvement, such as supporting states in building a greater capacity to respond to and recover from disasters by maintaining financial support while correctly sizing the federal deployment footprint, and implemented them into their future strategic plans (FEMA 2018a). Having knowledge of how a hurricane can affect a certain area can provide the general public and decision makers with the necessary information to maintain and increase preparedness at all levels (Demuth et al. 2012). This can also lead to the effects of the three hazards of hurricanes being lessened (Demuth et al. 2012). Furthermore, understanding how climate change might affect hurricanes in the future and their possible effects to the environment can play a role in protecting lives and property (Demuth et al. 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "One of the limitations of this study is the use of a model to estimate losses. The most apparent examples of this are the results from the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model's simulation of Hurricane Harvey for the Greater Houston Region. Although the hurricane model accounts for a myriad of hurricane features, such as rainfall rate, it did not correctly evaluate the damages that Harvey caused on the study area in terms of the flooding from by the immense precipitation. In turn, the HAZUS-MH Flood Model was run to represent that hazard. Future research utilizing this methodology will have to keep in mind that the HAZUS-MH Hurricane Wind Model is best suited for hurricanes whose winds were the biggest drivers of losses; the flood model may have to be used in order to estimate the total losses. Another limitation was the data used in Objective 1 of this thesis. The data found from the various federal departments and organizations had to be manipulated for successful inclusion in the model. In some cases, the only the only publicly available data did not include all the necessary components for a full analysis for some facilities. For example, the data associated with highway bridges did not include a record of the year built or remodeled for all the highways in the Greater Houston Region; understanding the age and materials used to build a structure can help to estimate its vulnerability to hurricane-strength winds and floods. More comprehensive data with all the necessary attributes would be needed in future research using any of the models included in HAZUS-MH. Statistical significance was also not able to be calculated because HAZUS-MH produced the same results every time it was run with the considered parameters in both the Hurricane Wind Model and the Flood Model. However, testing of the models and statistical analyses were performed during the development stages and can be found in the technical manuals of the models. The Greater Houston Region in southeast Texas is an area in the U.S. that is vulnerable to tropical cyclone impacts. The effects of climate change on hurricanes were evident when Hurricane Harvey produced record-setting rainfall in this area. Though hurricane and flood models, such as those included in HAZUS-MH, can estimate the physical, economic, and social losses associated with storms such as Harvey, some caution must be taken get a clear picture of the potential impacts of future storms. Regardless, the population of this area is at risk for tropical cyclone impact, which will continue to increase if actions far beyond the current efforts are not taken to mitigate these hazards."}]
