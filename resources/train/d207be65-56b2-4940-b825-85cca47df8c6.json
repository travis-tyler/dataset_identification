Since 1969, assessments have been conducted periodically in reading, mathematics, science, writing, history, geography, and other fields. By making objective information on student performance available to policymakers at the national, state, and local levels, NAEP is an integral part of our nation's evaluation of the condition and progress of education. Only information related to academic achievement is collected under this program. NAEP guarantees the privacy of individual students and their families.\nNAEP is a congressionally mandated project of the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. Department of Education. The Commissioner of Education Statistics is responsible, by law, for carrying out the NAEP project through competitive awards to qualified opanizations. NAEP reports directly to the Commissioner, who is also responsible for providing continuing reviews, Including validation studies and solicitation of public comment, on NAEP's conduct and usefulness.\nIn 1988, Congress established the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) to formulate policy guidelines for NAEP. The Board is responsible for selecting the subject areas to be assessed from among those included in the National Education Goals; for setting appropriate student performance levels; for developing assessment objectives and test specifications through a national consensus approach; for designing the assessment methodology; for developing guidelines for reporting and disseminating NAEP results; for developing standards and procedures for interstate, regional, and national comparisons; for determining the appropriateness of test items and ensuring they are free from bias; and for taking actions to improve the form and use of the National Assessment.\nThe National Assessment Governing Board\n\nMark D.

Carlson Educational Testing Service\nThe 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) monitored the performance of students in American schools in the subject areas of reading, mathematics, science, and writing. The national sample involved nearly 124,000 public and nonpublic-school students who were 9-, 13-, or 17 years old or in grades 4, 8, or 12.\nThe purpose of this technical report is to provide details on the instrument development, sample design, data collection, and data analysis procedures of the 1996 assessment. Detailed substantive results are not presented here but can be found in a series of NAEP reports on the status of and trends in student performance; several additional reports provide information on how the assessment was designed and implemented.

Also a sample of approximately 125,000 fourth-graders in 47 states and jurisdictions was assessed as part of the 1996 state assessment in science. A representative sample of about 2,500 students was selected in each jurisdiction for each subject at each grade level. The state-level sampling plan allowed for cross-state comparisons and comparisons with the nation in fourth-grade science and fourth- and eighth-grade mathematics achievement. Technical details of the state assessments are not presented in this technical report but can be found in the state technical reports.\nAN OVERVIEW OF NAEP IN 1996\nFor the 1996 assessment, NAEP researchers continued to build on the original design technology outlined in A New Design for a New Era (Messick, Beaton, & Lord, 1983). In order to maintain its links to the past and still implement innovations in measurement technology, NAEP continued its multistage sampling approach. Long-term trend and short-term trend samples use the same methodology and population definitions as in previous assessments. Main assessment samples use innovations associated with new NAEP technology and address current educational issues. Longterm trend data are used to estimate changes in performance from previous assessments; main assessment sample data are used primarily for analyses involving the current student population, but also to estimate short-term trends for a small number of recent assessments. In continuing to use this two-tiered approach, NAEP reaffirms its commitment to maintaining long-term trends while at the same time implementing the latest in measurement technology.\nA major new design feature was introduced for 1996 to permit the introduction of new inclusion rules for students with disabilities (SD) and limited English proficient (LEP) students, and the introduction of testing accommodations for those students. The 1996 national NAEP incorporated a multiple sampling plan that allowed for the study of changes in NAEP inclusion and accommodation procedures. In order to provide for studies of the effects of these changes, students from different samples were administered the NAEP instruments using different sets of inclusion rules and accommodation procedures. Testing accommodations were provided for SD and LEP students in certain samples who could be assessed, but not with standard instruments or administration procedures.\n3 0\n\n\fIn the 1996 assessment, many of the innovations that were implemented for the first time in 1988 were continued and enhanced. For example, a variant of the focused balanced incomplete block (focusedBIB) booklet design that was used in 1988 and has continued to be used in other assessment years, was used in the 1996 main assessment samples in mathematics and science. In the focused-BIB design, an individual receives blocks of cognitive items in the same subject area. The focused-BIB design allows for improved estimation within a particular subject area, and estimation continues to be optimized for groups rather than individuals.\nIn 1996, NAEP continued to apply the plausible values approach to estimating means for demographic as well as curriculum-related subgroups. Proficiency estimates were based on draws from a posterior distribution that was based on an optimum weighting of two sets of information: the student's responses to cognitive items, and his or her demographic and associated educational process variables. This Bayesian procedure was developed by Mislevy (see Chapter 11 or Mislevy, 1991). The 1996 procedures continued to use an improvement that was implemented first in 1988 and refined for the 1994 assessment. This is a multivariate procedure that uses information from all scales within a given subject area in the estimation of the proficiency distribution on any one scale in that subject atea.\nA major improvement used in the 1992 and 1994 assessments, and continued in 1996, was the use of the generalized partial credit model for item response theory (IRT) scaling. This allowed the incorporation of constructed-response questions that are scored on a multipoint rating scale into the NAEP scale in a way that utilizes the information available in each response category.\nOne important innovation in reporting the 1990 assessment data that was continued through 1996 was the use of simultaneous comparison procedures in carrying out significance tests for the differences across assessment years. Methods such as the Bonferroni allow one to control for the type I error rate for a fixed number of comparisons. In 1996, a new procedure that provided more powerful procedures that control for the false discovery rate were implemented for some comparisons. Tests for linear and quadratic trends were also applied to the national trend data in reading, mathematics, science, and writing.\nORGANIZATION OF THE TECHNICAL REPORT\nPart I of this report presents the details of the design of the 1996 National Assessment, summarized in Chapter 1.

Allen and Eugene G. Johnson Educational Testing Service\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe 1996 National Assessment collected information on the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of young Americans in mathematics, science, reading, and writing. The three components of the National Assessment were the main assessments of mathematics and science, the long-term trend assessments of mathematics, science, reading, and writing, and special assessments of aspects of mathematics and science. The basis for the information collected for the National Assessment was a complex sample survey involving nearly 124,000 students, consisting of national samples of public- and nonpublic-school students who were in grades 4, 8, and 12 or were 9-, 13-, or 17-year olds. Additional NAEP data came from the State Assessment program, which in 1996 assessed mathematics at grades 4 and 8 in representative samples of public- and nonpublic-school students in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS), Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS), and Guam. The 1996 State Assessment program also assessed science at grade 8 in representative samples of public- and nonpublic-school students in 43 states, the District of Columbia, DDESS, DoDDS, and Guam; DDESS and DoDDS fourth-grade students were assessed as part of a separate special science assessment.\nThis chapter describes the design for the 1996 assessment and gives an overview of the steps involved in its implementation, from the planning stage through the creation of edited data files. The major components of the implementation are presented here with references to other chapters in Part I that provide greater detail on each aspect of the assessment. The procedures used for the analysis of the data are summarized in the overview to Part II and discussed in detail in the remaining chapters in that part of the report. Excluded from this technical report are the details of the design and analysis of the 1996 State Assessments, which instead appear in the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Mathematics (Allen, Jenkins, Kulick, & Zelenak, 1997), and in the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Science (Allen, Swinton, Isham, & Zelenak, 1998). Also excluded are the details of the analyses of special studies of advanced matheniatics and science students and of students receiving special theme-related and estimation mathematics items.

To do this well, confounding effects due to changes from one assessment to the next in assessment instrumentation or in assessment procedures must be minimized. This implies a stability in the measurement process over time. At the same time, the assessment must remain current by allowing the introduction of new curriculum concepts and changes in educational priorities and by permitting the use of new measurement technology. The objectives for an assessment are determined through a consensus process in which committees of subject matter experts, scholars, and citizens representing many diverse\n\n6\n\n3 3\n\n\fconstituencies and points of view are assembled to determine the educational goals that students should achieve. Satisfying these objectives often requires changes in assessment instrumentation and methodology.\nIn order to meet the goals of measuring trends reliably and responding to changes in the current thinking about subject areas, NAEP has instituted a multicomponent assessment system where each component is itself a set of assessments designed to accomplish a specific goal. There are three components in the 1996 National Assessment design: (1) main assessments; (2) assessments for longterm trend; and (3) special assessments. In particular, the main assessments respond to changes in curriculum on a regular basis, while the long-term trend assessments are not changed and measure longer-term trends in a valid way. These are discussed in detail in this chapter.\nSeveral improvements were made in the design of NAEP in the 1984 and succeeding assessments. Until the 1984 assessment, NAEP was administered using matrix sampling and tape recorders; that is, by administering booklets of exercises using an aurally presented stimulus that paced groups of students through the individual assessment exercises in a common booklet. In the 1984 assessment, BIB spiraling, which does not include aural pacing, was introduced in place of taped matrix sampling. The NAEP design now includes sampling grade populations as well as the age populations that NAEP originally assessed. The definitions of student age and the time of year in which the assessment takes place have been made uniform so that students in the fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grades are assessed. To shorten the timetable for reporting results, the period for national data collection was decreased in 1992, 1994, and 1996 from the five-month period used in 1990 to a three-month period in the winter (corresponding to the period used for the winter half-sample of the 1990 National Assessment). To enhance the coverage of the subject areas assessed, the number of items measuring knowledge and skills was increased for the 1992, 1994, and 1996 assessments.\nA special feature of the 1996 main and state assessments was the introduction of new rules for inclusion of students with disabilities (SD) and limited English proficient (LEP) students in NAEP assessments (presented in Chapter 5). A subsample of the schools selected for participation in the 1996 assessments used the old inclusion rules (sample type 1; 51) to determine whether students should be included in the assessment and another subsample used the new inclusion rules (sample type 2; S2). In addition to the two groups of schools using the old and new inclusion rules without offering students special testing accommodations, the 1996 main assessments included a third group of schools that used the new inclusion rules and offered students within those schools accommodations to the standard NAEP administration procedures (sample type 3; S3). Figure 1-1 contains the layout of the pieces of the sample collected for each grade of the main assessment of mathematics.\nThe accommodations provided by NAEP in the main assessments were meant to match those specified in the student's individualized education program (IEP) or those ordinarily provided in the classroom for testing situations. The most common accommodation was extended time. The samples of students from the third group of schools that used the new inclusion rules and offered students accommodations were not included for most analysis and reporting purposes, although the results for these samples were studied in follow-up analyses. In the State Assessments, no special accommodations were offered. The information in Chapters 3 and 5 applies to schools and students in all of the sample types, while the data analysis chapters reflect schools and students in reporting samples only.\nThe new inclusion rules are applied only when a student has been categorized in his or her IEP as a student with disabilities (SD) or as a limited English proficient (LEP) student; all other students were asked to participate in the assessment. For this reason, the sample of students that was selected for most analysis and reporting purposes for the main mathematics assessment consisted of students from two\n4\n\n\fGROUPS OF STUDENTS\nNOT SD/LEP1\n\nFigure 1-1 Subsamples of the Mathematics Assessment:1996\n\nSample Type 1 OLD INCLUSION RULES\n- NO ACCOMMODATIONS -\n\nGROUPS OF SCHOOLS\n\nSample Type 2 NEW INCLUSION RULES\n- NO ACCOMMODATIONS -\n\nSample Type 3\nNEW INCLUSION RULES\n- A rrnn,uu rem A InfAMO\n\nAI\n\nINCLUDED SD/LEP1\n\nB1\n\nEXCLUDED SD/LEP1\n\nc33\n\nStudents with Disabilities/Limited English Proficient 2 Results for students in subsamples B2, A3, and B3 were not reported in NAEP 1996 Mathematics: Report Card for the Nation and the States. 3 Students in subsamples CI, C2, and C3 were not included in the assessment.\n\ngroups: those who were not categorized as SD or LEP students and who were from schools providing no accommodations and used either set of inclusion rules (A1 and A2 in Figure 1-1); and those who were categorized as SD or LEP students and who were from schools providing no accommodations and using only the old inclusion rules (B1 in Figure 1-1). The advantage of this reporting sample is that it preserves trend with previous assessments and it makes use of most of the data from the assessment. The main science assessment sample did not include students from schools using the old inclusion rules. The sample of students that was selected for most analysis and reporting purposes for the main science assessment consisted of students from the schools using new inclusion rules, but not providing any accommodations (A2.and B2 in Figure 1-1). The advantage of this reporting sample is that it makes use of the most up-to-date inclusion rules and begins a science trend line.\nSpecial analyses that used the national science and mathematics assessment data to compare the old and new inclusion rules and examine the effect of offering testing accommodations indicated little difference in proportions of students included in the assessment. More students were included in the assessment when they were offered accommodations; however, a portion of students who would have participated in the assessment under standard conditions was assessed with accommodations when they were offered. A result of this is that fewer students were assessed under standard conditions when accommodations were offered. The students from the schools offering accommodations were not included in the analyses or results contributing to the Mathematics or Science Report Cards, so they did not affect the measurement of the 1990, 1992, and 1996 Oend for mathematics. The results from the science assessment were not compared to those from previous assessments.\nNAEP's design for 1996 required collecting 24 different samples in order to conduct the assessments. The various samples collected and reported for the 1996 assessment are summarized in Table 1-1.\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n8\n3 6-\n\n\fTable 1-1 NAEP 1996 Student Samples\n\nSample\n\nBooklet IDs\n\nMode\n\nCohort Assessed\n\nTime of Testing'\n\nReporting\n\nAge Modal Sample\n\nDefinition Grade\n\nSize2\n\n9[Math Main] 13[Math Main] 17[Math Main]\n4 [Math-Estimation] 8 [Math-Estimation] 12 [Math-Estimation]\n\n101-129, 921 101-130, 921\n101-130\n127 127 127\n\nPrint Print Print\nTape Tape Tape\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96 .1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 3/29/96 1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n\n6,627 7,146 6,904\n2,023 2,183 1,849\n\n4 [Math-Theme] 8 [Math-Theme] 12 [Math-Theme]\n8 [Math-Advanced] 12 [Math-Advanced]\n\n128, 129 128, 129 128, 129\n130 130\n\nPrint Print Print\nPrint Print\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\nGrade 8 Grade 12\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 3/29/96 1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n\n3,790 4,027 3,735\n2,337 2,965\n\n9 [Science Main] 13 [Science Main] 17 [Science Main]\n\n201-237 Print 201-237 Print 201-240 Print\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n\n7,305 7,774 7,537\n\n12 [Sci-Advanced]\n13 [Sci-State]\n9 [MS-LTTrend] 13 [MS-LTTrend] 17 [MS-LTTrend]\n\n238-240 Print\n\nGrade 12\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n\n2,431\n\n201-237 Print\n\nGrade 8\n\n1/29/96 - 3/4/96\n\n*3\n\n91 93 91 93 84 85\n\nTape Tape Tape\n\nAge 9 Age 13 Age 17\n\n1/3/96 - 3/8/96\n\nCY\n\n4\n\n5,414\n\n10/9/95 - 12/22/95\n\nCY\n\n8\n\n5,658\n\n3/11/96 - 5/10/96 Not CY\n\n11\n\n3,539\n\nFinal makeup sessions for the winter session (January 3-March 29, 1996) were held April 1-5, 1996. 2 The total number of students assessed in the reporting sample of the national assessment was 43,293 for the main assessment, 29,792 for the long-term trend assessment, and 25,340 for the special studies. 3 Note: consists of distinct samples in 48 jurisdictions\n\nLEGEND:\n\nMath Sci RW MS Print Tape\n\nMathematics Science Reading and writing Mathematics and science Print administration Audiotape administration\n\nMain LTTrend CY\nNot CY\n\nMain assessment, print administration Long-term trend assessment Calendar year: birthdates in 1986 and 1982 respectively for ages 9 and 13 Age 17 only: birthdates between October 1, 1978 and September 30, 1979\n\nEach row of.Table 1-1 corresponds to a particular sample and each column of the table indicates the following major features of that sample:\n1. Sample is the sample identifier. The first part of the sample code is a number (the age class) representing the student cohort included in the sample (note that this part of the code does not indicate whether an age or grade sample was selected); the second part, in brackets, denotes the specific sample type. For example, 9[Math Main] is a main assessment mathematics sample for grade 4, assessed in print mode. A full description of the purposes for the various sample types is given below.\n2. Booklets gives the identifier numbers for the booklets used for the assessment of the particular sample.\n\n3 6\n\n9\n\n\f3. Mode indicates the mode of assessment, which may be print or tape. NAEP originally assessed students using a tape recorder in addition to booklets, thus pacing the students through exercises at a fixed rate. In 1996, NAEP used a paced audiotape for its mathematics and science long-term trend assessments. However, most other assessments in 1996 used printed instructions with the student expected to read the exercises. The only other exception was the 1996 assessment of mathematics estimation skills.\n4. The cohort assessed denotes the age, grade, or age/grade of the population being sampled. For example, grade 4 represents students who are in the fourth grade; an age 17 cohort consists of students (in any grade) who are 17 years old. Samples for the 1996 main assessments were selected on the basis of grade only. The traditional NAEP samples used in long-term trend estimation were defined by age only. However, the 1996 reading and writing long-term trend assessments were defined by being either of a particular age or of the modal grade for students of that age. For reading and writing, results are reported for grade and age samples, respectively. The definitions of age, and thus the corresponding grade, have changed in ways that are described in Section 1.2.1.\n5. Time of testing indicates the time of year in which the assessment is performed. NAEP traditionally assessed 9-year-olds in the winter, 13-year-olds in the fall, and 17year-olds in the spring; like the 1994 main assessment, in 1996, all grades were assessed in the winter (between January 3-March 29, 1996; final makeup sessions were held April 1-5, 1996).\n6. Age definition is denoted as calendar year (CY) or not calendar year (Not CY). NAEP originally defined age by birth within a calendar year at ages 9 and 13 but defined age 17 as being born between October 1 of one year and September 30 of the next. In the 1996 main assessments, no students were selected on the basis of their age.\n7. The modal grade is the grade attended by most of the students of the sampled age. For example, if an age 17 sample is listed as having a modal grade of 11, then most of the 17-year-old students, as defined, are in the eleventh grade. The definition of age affects the modal grade of the sample. All students sampled for the 1996 main assessments were in the grade defined by the cohort assessed.\n8. The reporting sample size is the number of students in the sample who were actually administered the assessment and whose results were used in the NAEP subject-area reports.\n1.2.1 The 1996 NAEP Samples\nThe NAEP samples in 1996 consisted of four types: the samples from the National Assessmentthe main NAEP samples, the long-term trend samples, and the special studies samples and the State Assessment samples.\nThe Main NAEP Samples. The main NAEP samples are labeled in Table 1-1 as [Math Main] and [Science Main]. The samples used complex spiraling procedures (defined in Section 1.5), and were intended to form the basis for future assessments. Each sample was assessed in the winter period (January 3 through March 29, 1996). In these samples, only grade populations were sampled, although\n\n10\n\nL.\n\n3 7\n\n\fage/grade populations were assessed in previous assessment years. The main NAEP samples, and their purposes, are as follows:\n[Math Main] are grades 4, 8, and 12 mathematics assessment samples used for measuring mathematics achievement in 1996. The fourth- and eighth-grade samples also provided the comparison groups for the 1996 State Assessment of mathematics in grades 4 and 8. These samples used print administration.\n[Science Main] are grades 4, 8, and 12 science assessment samples used for measuring science achievement in 1996. The eighth-grade samples also provided the comparison groups for the 1996 State Assessment in science in grade 8. These samples used print administration.\nThe Long-Term Trend Samples. The long-term trend samples are labeled as [RW-LTTrend] and [MS-LTTrend] in Table 1-1. Each sample was defined in the same way as equivalent samples in previous assessments and used the same assessment technology as was used in those assessments. Therefore, the long-term trend samples are directly comparable to those from previous assessments and so can be used for continuing the NAEP long-term trend lines. Because these samples were designed to link the 1996 data with data from previous assessments, they are also referred to as bridge samples. The long-term trend samples and their purposes are as follows:\n[RW-LTTrend] are age/grade samples used for estimating long-term trends in reading and writing. These samples used assessment booklets identical to those initially used in 1984 and subsequently used in 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 (many of the items were also used in pre-1984 assessments). As in 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994, print administration was used. These samples used the age definitions and time of testing originally used by NAEP in the 1970s and the early 1980s. The estimates of reading achievement from these samples link to eight previous reading assessments (1971, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994); the estimates of writing achievement link to five previous writing assessments (1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994).\n[MS-LTTrend] are age-only samples used for estimating long-term trends in mathematics and science achievement. These samples used the same age definitions and time of testing as were used since 1969 and used the same assessment instruments as were used in the 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994 long-term trend assessments of mathematics and science. As in previous assessments, the administration of the mathematics and science questions was paced with an audiotape. The estimates of science achievement from these samples link to eight previous science assessments (1970, 1973, 1977, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994); the estimates of mathematics achievement link to seven previous assessments (1973, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994).\nThe Special Studies Samples. Three sets of samples were collected as part of special NAEP studies. The samples used special innovative procedures to allow the study of specific aspects of mathematics and science. Each sample was assessed in the winter period (January 3 through March 29, 1996). In these samples, only grade populations were sampled. The special studies samples, and their purposes, are as follows:\n[Math-Estimation] are samples of specially selected students in grades 4, 8, and 12 who were administered mathematics estimation booklets in separate paced-tape sessions. The students are representative of the fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students in the nation.\n\n3 8\n\n11\n\n\f[Math-Theme] are samples of specially selected students in grades 4, 8, and 12 who were administered mathematics theme booklets. These samples were assessed in print administrations. The students were selected to represent the national populations of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students. The students in these samples were assessed in separate sessions.\n[Math-Advanced] and [Sci-Advanced] are samples of specially selected students in grade 8 (for mathematics only) and grade 12 (for mathematics and science) who received advanced mathematics and science booklets. They were assessed in separate sessions. The students were selected from students who were taking advanced courses in mathematics or science.\nThe State Assessment Samples. In Table 1-1, 9[Math-State], 13[Math-State], and 13[Sci-State] are samples of fourth- and eighth-grade public- and nonpublic-school students from each of the states and jurisdictions participating in the 1996 State Assessment of mathematics, and eighth-grade public- and nonpublic-school students from each of the states and jurisdictions participating in the 1996 State Assessments of science.2 The assessment booklets were the same print-administered booklets as those used for the matching samples 9[Math Main], 13[Math Main], and 13[Science Main] but the administrative procedures varied from that of the national assessment in that state personnel collected the data.\n1.2.2 NAEP Assessments Since 1969\nTable 1-2 shows the subject areas, grades, and ages assessed since the NAEP project began in 1969. As can be seen, in addition to the 1996 subject areas of mathematics, science, reading, and writing, several other subject areas have been assessed over the yearssocial studies, U.S. history, civics, citizenship, geography, literature, music, career development, art, and computer competence. Many subject areas are reassessed periodically to measure trends over time.\nAssessments were conducted annually through 1980, but budget restrictions since then have reduced data collection to a biennial basis. Since its inception, NAEP has assessed 9-year-olds, 13-yearolds, and in-school 17-year-olds, although the age definitions changed in 1986 and again in 1988. Because of budget restrictions, NAEP no longer routinely assesses out-of-school 17-year-olds or young adults. (A separate assessment of young adults of ages 21 to 25 was conducted in 1985 under a separate grant.)\nThe table also indicates that in 1984, NAEP began gathering data by grade as well as by age, a practice that had been continued in assessments up to 1994; the 1996 national assessment included gathered data by grade only. It should be noted that somewhat different age definitions were used in the 1984, 1986, and 1988 assessments. In the 1984 assessment, the two younger ages were defined on a calendar-year basis, while the 17-year-olds were defined on an October 1 to September 30 basis. This resulted in modal grades of 4, 8, and 11. To allow for age cohorts that were exactly four years apart, in the 1986 main assessment all ages were defined on an October 1 to September 30 basis, resulting in modal grades of 3, 7, and 11. Special studies (Kaplan, Beaton, Johnson, & Johnson, 1988) were conducted to measure the effect of the changes in age definition. Because of problems encountered in assessing third graders, in 1988 the ages were redefined on a calendar-year basis, with the modal grades being 4, 8, and 12. These were the age definitions used in the 1990, 1992, and 1994 main assessments.\n2 Fourth-grade students in DDESS and DoDDS schools were assessed as a separate special science assessment.\n12\n3 9\n\n\fTable 1-2 National Assessment of Educational Progress Subject Areas, Grades, and Ages Assessed: 1969-1996\n\nAssessment Year\n\nSubject Area(s)\n\nGrades/Ages Assessed\n\nGrade Grade Age Grade Grade Age Grade Grade Age Age\n\n3\n\n4\n\n9\n\n7\n\n8\n\n13\n\n11\n\n12 17 170S1 Adult\n\n1969-70\n1970-71 1971-72 1972-73\n\nScience Writing Citizenship\nReading Literature\nMusic Social Studies\nScience Mathematics\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\n1973-74 Career and Occupational\n\nDevelopment\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nWriting\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\n1974-75\n\nReading Art Index of Basic Skills\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1975-76 Citizenship/Social Studies\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX .X\n\n1976-77\n\nScience Basic Life Skills2 Sci/ RD / Energy / Health2\n\n1977-78 Mathematics Consumer Skills2\n\n1978-79 Writing, Art, and Music\n\n1979-80 Reading/Literature Art\n\n1981-82\n\nScience2 Mathematics and Citizenship/Social Studies\n\n1984 Reading Writing Writing (long-term trend)\n\n1985 Adult Literacy2\n\n1986 Reading\n\nX\n\nMathematics\n\nX\n\nScience\n\nX\n\nComputer Competence\n\nX\n\nU.S. History2\n\nLiterature2\n\nReading (long-term trend)\n\nMathematics (long-term trend)\n\nScience (long-term trend)\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX XX XX XX\nXX XX XX XX\nXX XX XX\n\nX X\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX X\nX X X\nXX\nX\nX X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X\n\nI Age 17 students who had dropped out of school or had graduated prior to assessment. 2 Small, special-interest assessment conducted on limited samples at specific grades or ages.\n\n(continued)\n\n4 0\n\n13\n\n\fTable 1-2 (continued) National Assessment of Educational Progress Subject Areas, Grades, and Ages Assessed: 1969-1996\n\nAssessment\n\nYear3\n\nSubject Area(s)\n\n1988 Reading\n\nWriting\n\nCivics\n\nU.S. History\n\nDocument Literacy2\n\nGeography2\n\nGrades/Ages Assessed\n\nGrade Grade Age Grade Grade Age Grade Grade Age\n\n3\n\n4\n\n9\n\n7\n\n8\n\n13\n\n11\n\n12 17\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nXX\n\nAge\n170S1 Adult\n\n1990 1992 1994\n\nReading (long-term trend) Writing (long-term trend)\n\nMathematics (long-term trend)\nScience (long-term trend) Civics (long-term trend)\n\nReading Mathematics Science Reading (long-term trend) Writing (long-term trend)\n\nMathematics (long-term trend)\nScience (long-term trend) Trial State Mathematics\n\nReading Writing Mathematics Reading (long-term trend) Writing (long-term trend)\n\nMathematics (long-term trend)\nScience (long-term trend) Trial State Mathematics Trial State Reading\n\nReading\n\nU.S. History\n\nGeography\n\n/\n\nReading (long-term trend))\n\nWriting (long-term trend)1\n\nMathematics (long-term trend)\nScience (long-term trend) Trial State Reading\n\nXX XX\nX X\nXX XX XX XX XX\nX X\nXX XX XX XX XX\nX X X X\nXX XX XX XX XX\nX X X\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX X X\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX X X\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nAge 17 students who had dropped out of school or had graduated prior to assessment. 2 Small, special-interest assessment conducted on limited samples at specific grades or ages. 3 It should be noted that somewhat different age definitions were used in the 1984, 1986, and 1988 assessments. In the 1984 assessment, the two younger ages were defined on a calendar-year basis, while the 17-year-olds were defined on an October I to September 30 basis. This resulted in modal grades of 4, 8, and I I. To allow for age cohorts that were exactly four years apart, in the 1986 main assessment all ages were defined on an October I to September 30 basis, resulting in modal grades of 3, 7, and I I. Special studies (Kaplan, Beaton, Johnson, & Johnson, 1988) were conducted to measure the effect of the changes in age definition. Because of problems encountered in assessing third graders, in 1988 the ages were redefined on a calendar-year basis, with the modal grades being 4, 8, and 12. These were the age definitions used in the 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 main assessments.\n(continued)\n\n14\n\n4 1\n\n\fTable 1-2 (continued) National Assessment of Educational Progress Subject Areas, Grades, and Ages Assessed: 1969-1996\n\nAssessment Year3\n1996\n\nSubject Area(s)\n\nGrades/Ages Assessed\n\nGrade Grade Age Grade Grade Age Grade Grade Age\n\n3\n\n4\n\n9\n\n7\n\n8\n\n13 11\n\n12 17\n\nMathematics Science Reading (long-term trend) Writing (long-term trend)\nMathematics (long-term trend)\nScience (long-term trend) State Mathematics State Science\n\nX X XX XX\nX X X X\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX X\nX X X X\n\nAge\n170S1 Adult\n\nAge 17 students who had dropped out of school or had graduated prior to assessment.\n\n3 It should be noted that somewhat different age definitions were used in the 1984, 1986, and 1988 assessments.

These were the age definitions used in the 1990, 1992, 1994,\n\nand 1996 main assessments.\n\n1.3 DEVELOPMENT OF ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES, ITEMS, AND BACKGROUND QUESTIONS\nIn 1996, NAEP conducted main assessments of students at all three grade levels in mathematics and science. These assessments entailed the generation of a large number of cognitive items items measuring knowledge and skills. In addition, a large number of background and attitude questions were asked of students, and school, teacher and instructional questions were asked of principals and teachers. Details on the item development procedures for the 1996 main assessment are given in Chapter 2; this section provides an overview. (In addition to the main assessments and the special assessments, long-term trend studies were conducted in reading, mathematics, science, and writing. Since the instruments used for these studies consisted entirely of items used in previous assessments, no developmental tasks were required for their use in the 1996 assessment.)\nIn addition to the cognitive items, several questionnaires were developed: a common student Background Questionnaire given to all assessed students of a given grade, a School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire, Teacher Questionnaires for teachers of fourth- and eighth-grade students in mathematics and science and for teachers of twelfth-grade students who were assessed in advanced mathematics, and an SD/LEP Student Questionnaire. Each of these questionnaires was developed through a broad-based consensus process.\nAll items in the assessment underwent extensive reviews by subject area and measurement specialists, as well as careful scrutiny to eliminate any potential bias or lack of sensitivity to any group. Further, the items were field tested on a representative group of students. Based on the results of the field test, items were revised or modified as necessary and then again reviewed for bias. With the help of staff and outside reviewers, the Instrument Development Panels selected the items to include in the assessment. After the items were selected and formed into the final groupings or blocks of items, they\n\n15\n4 2\n\n\fwere carefully reviewed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB).\nThe assessment instruments included multiple-choice items, constructed-response items scored dichotomously, constructed-response items scored polytomously, and cluster items in both mathematics and science. The constructed-response items were professionally scored as described in Chapter 7.\n1.4 THE 1996 SAMI'LE DESIGN\nThe sample for the 1996 NAEP assessment was selected using a complex three-stage sample design. The three-stage sample design includes (1) the sampling of students from (2) selected schools within (3) 94 selected geographic areas, called primary sampling units (PSUs), across the United States. The 1996 sample design differed from previous years due to oversampling of SD/LEP students. With the inclusion of the different inclusion rules and the availability of accommodations, the sample design was similar to that used in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 and is described in detail by Westat, Inc., the firm contracted by NCES to select the sample, in The 1996 NAEP Sampling and Weighting Report (Wallace & Rust, 1999). The following sections provide an overview of the five steps used to draw NAEP samples using the three-stage sample design. Further details are given in Chapter 3. Steps 3 and 4 describe the assignment of sample types and assessment sessions to the second sampling unit schools. Steps 5a through 5c contain procedures for the collection of data for SD/LEP students, teachers, and schools.\nc:> Step 1: Primary Sampling Units\nIn the first stage of sampling, the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) was divided into geographic primary sampling units (PSUs). Each PSU met a minimum size requirement and generally comprised either a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA), a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), a single county, or a group of contiguous counties. The PSUs were classified into four regions (Northeast, Southeast, Central, West), each containing about one-fourth of the U.S. population. In each region, PSUs were additionally classified as MSA or nonMSA. This resulted in eight subuniverses of PSUs.\nNinety-four of the PSUs were selected for the 1996 main assessment. Twenty-two PSUs were designated as certainty units because of their size, and were included in the sample with certainty. The remaining smaller PSUs were not guaranteed to be selected and were accordingly designated as noncertainty PSUs. Within each major stratum (subuniverse), further stratification was achieved by ordering the noncertainty PSUs according to several additional socioeconomic characteristics. Seventytwo PSUs were selected, one per stratum from each of the.noncertainty strata, with probability proportional to size (total population from the 1990 census). To enlarge the samples of Black and Hispanic students, thereby enhancing the reliability of estimates for these groups, PSUs from the highminority subuniverses were sampled at twice the rate of those from the other subuniverses. This was achieved by creating smaller strata within the high-minority subuniverses.\nFor the long-term trend samples, 52 PSUs were selected: 10 PSUs were selected with certainty; six additional PSUs were selected from the 12 remaining main sample certainty PSUs; and 36 PSUs were selected from the 72 noncertainty strata independently of PSU selections for the main samples.\n\n16\n\n4 3\n\n\fED. Step 2: Selection of Schools\nIn the second stage of sampling for the main assessments, the public schools (including Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools and Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools) and nonpublic schools (including Catholic schools) within each of the selected PSUs were listed according to the grade ranges associated with the three age classes. An independent sample of schools was selected separately for each of the grades so that some schools were selected for assessment of two grades, and a few were selected for all three. Schools within each PSU were selected (without replacement) with probabilities proportional to assigned measures of size with oversampling of nonpublic schools and of schools with high minority enrollment. Overall probabilities of selection for high-minority schools were twice those for other schools while the probabilities of selection of nonpublic schools were triple those of low-minority public schools of the same size. The increased probabilities of selection enlarged the samples of Black and Hispanic students and the samples of students from nonpublic schools, thereby enhancing the reliability of estimates for these groups. Details of the probabilities used for school selection appear in Chapter 3.\nThe samples of schools for the long-term trend assessments were drawn in a manner very similar to that used for the main assessments. The chief difference in the two samples was that nonpublic schools and schools with high minority enrollment were not oversampled for the long-term trend assessments. Schools were not selected for both main and long-term trend assessments at the same age/grade.\nFor the main samples, the overall school cooperation rate was 86 percent for grade 4, 83 percent for grade 8, and 79 percent for grade 12. For the long-term trend samples, the overall school cooperation rate was 85 percent for age class 9, 84 percent for age class 13, and 81 percent for. age class 17. In certain instances, refusing schools were replaced by substitutes according to the rules indicated in Chapter 3.\nED Step 3: Assigning Sample Type to Schools\nIn order to determine the effect of using different criteria for excluding students from the assessment, three different sample types were assigned to the schools selected for the main assessment. In sample type 1 schools, the inclusion criteria for the main samples were identical to those used in 1990 and 1992. In sample type 2 schools, new 1996 inclusion criteria were used. In sample type 3 schools, the new 1996 inclusion criteria were used and accommodations were offered to SD/LEP students. More detailed information on assigning sample type to schools is provided in Chapter 3.\nStep 4: Assigning Assessment Sessions to Schools\nSessions were assigned to the selected schools found to be in-scope at the time of session assignment, as described in Chapter 3. Sessions were assigned to schools with three aims in mind. The first was to distribute students to the different session types across the whole sample for each age class so that the target numbers of assessed students would be achieved (in each sample type separately in the main assessments). The second was to maximize the number of different session types that were administered within a given selected school, without creating unduly small sessions. The third was to give each student an equal chance of being selected for a given session type regardless of the number of sessions conducted in the school.\n\n4 4\n\n17\n\n\fc:> Step 5: Sampling Students\nIn the third stage of sampling, a consolidated list was prepared for each school of all grade- and age-eligible students (for long-term trend) or all grade-eligible students (for the main assessments) for the age class for which the school was selected. To provide the target sample size, a systematic selection of eligible students was made from this list, if necessary. In small- and medium-sized schools all eligible students were in the sample. For schools assigned to more than a single session type, students were assigned by Westat district supervisors to one of the various session types (audiotape or print administration) using specified procedures. No student was assigned to more than one session.\nStep 5a: Excluded Students\nDespite NAEP's goal to assess all selected students, certain selected students were judged by school authorities as being incapable of participating meaningfully in the assessment. For each student who was excluded, school staff who had knowledge of the student's capabilities completed an SD/LEP student questionnaire, listing the reason for exclusion and providing some background information. For each SD/LEP student who was included in the assessment, school staff also completed an SD/LEP student questionnaire.\nSpecific guidelines for exclusion were provided for all samples in the 1996 assessment. However, somewhat different criteria were used for the long-term trend samples than for the main assessment samples. In addition, the inclusion criteria for the main samples differed by sample type.\nThe exclusion guidelines for the long-term trend samples were the same as those used in previous assessments. Three types of students could be excluded under these guidelinesnon-English speaking students, students with mental retardation who are educable but who were judged incapable of meaningfully responding to exercises appropriate to their age level, and students so functionally disabled that they could not perform in the NAEP assessment situation.\nAs stated previously, for the main samples, the procedures for assessing students with disabilities (SD) and students of limited English proficiency (LEP) varied by sample type. The exclusion procedure used in sample type 1 differed somewhat from that used in sample types 2 and 3. In sample type 1 schools, the inclusion criteria for the main samples were identical to those used in 1990 and 1992. These criteria were intended to be somewhat more rigorously defined than those used in the long-term trend samples. In sample type 2 schools, new 1996 inclusion criteria were used. In sample type 3 schools, the new 1996 inclusion criteria were used and accommodations were offered to SD/LEP students. The new inclusion criteria was developed to more closely match the procedures used by many states and school districts in testing situations. Both sets of the inclusion rules are presented in Chapter 5.\nStep 5b: Sampling Teachers\nTeachers of fourth- and eighth-grade students assessed in mathematics and science and twelfth-grade students assessed in advanced mathematics were identified and asked to complete a questionnaire (described in Chapter 2) about their background and\n18\n4 5\n\n\fexperiences and about instructional practices, by class, for any classes containing assessed students.\nStep 5c: The School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires\nA School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire was mailed to every sampled school by Westat before the assessment for completion by the principal or school administrator. The Westat supervisor then collected the questionnaires and returned them to ETS. The School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire is described in Chapter 2.\n\n1.5 ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS\nFour types of instruments were used in the 1996 assessment: student assessment booklets (which included the student common Background Questionnaire as well as cognitive items), SD/LEP Student Questionnaires, Teacher Questionnaires, and a School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire. This section provides an overview of these instruments; more detailed information can be found in Chapter 4.\nThe student common Background Questionnaires were completed by the students participating in the 1996 assessment. These questionnaires included questions about the students' race/ethnicity, parental education levels, and other background variables specified by NCES and a committee of survey, content, and education experts. These questionnaires appeared at the beginning of some student assessment booklets and at the end of others. The student assessment booklets also included subject-related background questions about instructional opportunity, and interest in and attitudes towards the subject area.\n\n1.5.1 Siudent Assessment BookletsMain Assessment\n1.5.1.1 Student Assessment BookletsMain AssessmentMathematics\nEach student assessed in mathematics received a booklet containing a set of general background questions, content questions, subject-specific background questions, and questions about his or her motivation and familiarity with the assessment materials. The content questions were assembled into sections or blocks. Students in the main assessment were given three 15-minute blocks. Those sampled for the theme assessment completed one 15-minute block and one 30-minute block. Those sampled for the advanced study at grade 8 completed three 20-minute blocks; at grade 12 advanced sample students completed three 30-minute blocks. Students in the estimation sample completed one 15-minute block from the main assessment and two paced-tape sections. The overall assessment time for each student was approximately 63 minutes.\nThe assembly of blocks into booklets for the main assessment and their subsequent assignment to sampled students was determined by a balanced incomplete block (BIB) design with spiraled administration. The student booklets contained two five-minute background sections, a one-minute background section, and three 15-minute blocks of items according to a BIB design.\nThe BIB design for the 1996 national mathematics assessment was focused by subject area, so that students received booklets containing only blocks of mathematics questions (not science). The BIB design also balances the order of presentation of the 15-minute blocks of itemsevery 15-minute block\n\n4 6\n\n19\n\n\fappears as the first cognitive block in two booklets, as the second cognitive block in two other booklets, and as the third cognitive block in another two booklets.\nThe design used in 1996 required that 13 blocks of mathematics items at each grade be assembled into 26 booklets. Theme blocks were placed in two other booklets, and estimation blocks in one other booklet. At grades 8 and 12, the advanced study was placed in one additional booklet. Once assembled, the main assessment booklets were then spiraled and bundled. Spiraling involves interweaving the booklets in a systematic sequence so that each booklet appears an appropriate number of times in the sample. The bundles were designed so that each booklet would appear equally often in each position in a bundle.\nThe final step in the BIB-spiraling procedure was the assigning of the booklets to the assessed students. The students within an assessment session were assigned booklets in the order in which the booklets were bundled. Thus, most students in an assessment session received different booklets. In the assessment design, representative and randomly equivalent samples of students responded to each item at a given grade level.\nChapter 4 provides more detail on the contents of the mathematics instruments.\n1.5.1.2 Student Assessment BookletsMain AssessmentScience\nEach student assessed in science received a booklet containing general background questions, content questions, subject-specific background questions, and questions about his or her motivation and familiarity with the assessment materials. The content questions were assembled into sections or blocks. Students in the main assessment were given three 20-minute blocks at grade 4, and three 30-minute blocks at grades 8 and 12. The last block in every book was a hands-on block. Those sampled for the advanced study at grade 12 completed four 30-minute blocks. The overall assessment time for each student was, on average, 120 minutes.\nThe assembly of blocks into booklets for the main assessment and their subsequent assignment to sampled students was determined by a complex design with spiraled administration. The student booklets contained two five-minute background sections, a one-minute background section, and three blocks of items.\nThe design for the 1996 national assessment was focused by subject area, so that students received booklets containing only blocks of science questions (not mathematics). The design also balances the order of presentation of the blocks of items, except for the hands-on blocks, which always appear in position three of a booklet. All other blocks appear an equal number of times in position one and position two. Further, the design was set up to ensure that no student answered more than one themebased block (though some students did not receive any). This design allows for some balancing of the impact of context and fatigue effects to be measured and reported, but makes allowance for the difficulties and disruption of administering hands-on blocks. It also takes into account the limited breadth of content coverage included in the theme blocks.\nThe design used in 1996 required that fifteen blocks of mathematics items at each grade be assembled into 37 booklets. At grade 12, the advanced study was composed of three additional booklets. Once assembled, the main assessment booklets were then spiraled and bundled. Spiraling involves interweaving the booklets in a systematic sequence so that each booklet appears an appropriate number of times in the sample. The bundles were designed so that each booklet would appear equally often in each position in a bundle.\n20\n4 7\n\n\fThe final step in the spiraling procedure was the assigning of the booklets to the assessed students. The students within an assessment session were assigned booklets in the order in which the booklets were bundled. Thus, most students in an assessment session received different booklets. In the assessment design, representative and randomly equivalent samples of about 2,000 students responded to each\nitem at a given grade level.\nChapter 4 provides more detail on the contents of the science instruments.\n\n1.5.2 Student Assessment BookletsLong-Term Trend Samples\nThere were two distinct long-term trend samples in the 1996 assessment, each of which required reprinting booklets used in previous assessments:\nReading-Writing Long-Term Trend: Six booklets were used at each of the three age/grades for the purposes of measuring long-term trends in reading and writing. These booklets were identical to booklets used in the 1984 main assessments of reading and writing and in the 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 long-term trend assessments of those subjects. Each booklet consisted of a common background block in the beginning of each booklet and three cognitive blocks, either two reading and one writing or one reading and two writing. All cognitive blocks also contained subject-related background questions. The booklets were administered without audiotape and were spiraled together for administration.\nMathematics-Science Long-Term Trend: These instruments were used for the measurement of mathematics and science and were identical to booklets administered in 1990, 1992 and 1994. These booklets contained 15-minute blocks of mathematics and science items; each mathematics block and each science block was administered using audiotape pacing. (At the younger two ages, the booklets also contain a block of reading items, which was print-administered.) There were three booklets each at age 9 and age 13 and two booklets at age 17. The common background questions appeared at the beginning of each booklet. Combined, the booklets at an age contain three blocks of mathematics items and three blocks of science items. Because of the audiotape pacing, each booklet was administered in a separate session.\n\n1.5.3 Other Instruments\nBesides the student assessment booklets, other instruments provided data relating to the assessment:\nThe SD/LEP Student Questionnaires were completed by the teachers of those students whO were selected to participate in the assessment sample who had disabilities (SD) or were classified as Limited English Proficient (LEP). The questionnaires were completed for all SD or LEP students, whether or not they actually participated in the assessment. The questionnaires asked about the nature of the student's disability and the special programs in which the student participated. The response rates for this questionnaire ranged from 92 to 95 percent for the different student samples. The criteria used for excluding students are described in Chapter 5.\nTeacher Questionnaires were administered to the teachers of fourth- and eighth-grade students assessed in mathematics and science and teachers of twelfth-grade students who were assessed in advanced mathematics. The Teacher Questionnaire included a general section that contained questions\n\n21\n\nk\n\n4 8\n\n\fabout the teacher's background and experience. The rest of the questionnaire contained questions about instructional practices, by class, for any classes containing assessed students. The response rates ranged from 95 to 100 percent for the different student samples.\nSchool Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires were completed by school principals or their representatives, who provided information about school administration, staffing patterns, special programs, subject requirements, and school resources. The response rates for the different student samples ranged from 92 to 95 percent.\n1.6 FIELD OPERATIONS AND DATA COLLECTION\nField operations and data collection for the 1996 assessment were the responsibility of Westat, Inc., and are documented in Chapter 5. The field operation was conducted by a staff at Westat's home office and a larger staff in the field. The Westat home-office staff coordinated all activities related to field operations and managed materials distribution and home-office receipt of assessment reporting forms. The field staff consisted of area supervisors, assessment supervisors, and exercise administrators. The assessment supervisors, who were trained by Westat, were each responsible for the assessment activities in one or more PSUs. Although ETS made initial contact with participating school districts, each assessment supervisor was primarily responsible for making follow-up contacts with these districts, recruiting and training exercise administrators to work with them in administering the assessment sessions, arranging the assessment sessions, and selecting the sample of students to be assessed within each school. The assessment supervisors and the exercise administrators administered the assessments, filled out the necessary forms, performed process control, and shipped the assessment booklets and forms to National Computer Systems (NCS), the subcontractor responsible for processing NAEP materials and data.\nGaining school cooperation was the joint responsibility of Westat and ETS. ETS made the preliminary contacts preparatory to obtaining school cooperation by first contacting the Chief State School Officers, informing them that schools within their states had been selected for the assessment and, in a later letter, listing the selected schools and districts. Later mailings were sent to superintendents of public schools and parochial schools and principals of other nonpublic schools for all schools selected in the assessment. These materials provided an explanation of NAEP, a list of the selected schools in the official's jurisdiction, and a cover letter explaining that a Westat district supervisor would contact them to set up an introductory meeting. Westat district supervisors then scheduled and conducted introductory meetings (both by telephone and in person), worked with the schools to schedule the assessments, and, with the exercise administrators, conducted the assessments. The overall participation rate of schools originally selected in the 1996 assessments was 83 percent for the main samples and 84 percent for the long-term trend samples. Further detail on school participation rates is given in Chapter 3.\nThe main assessment sessions were conducted between January 3 and March 29, 1996, at all three grade levels. The age 9/grade 4 long-term trend assessments were carried out between January 3 and March 8, 1996; the age 17/grade 11 long-term trend samples were conducted between March 11 and May 10, 1996. The age 13/grade 8 long-term trend assessments were carried out between October 9 and December 22, 1995. When the main assessments of the long-term trend subjects were first collected in 1987 and 1986, studies were completed to take into account the difference in assessment time across the samples (Kaplan, Beaton, Johnson, & Johnson, 1988).\nTwo special studies that required additional steps in the sampling process were included in the 1996 main assessment. One of these special studies involved students who were eligible for advanced mathematics or science sessions. Advanced sessions were only available to designated students at grade 8\n22\n4 9\n\n\fin mathematics and at grade 12 in mathematics and science. Further details on the advanced sessions is provided in Chapters 3 and 5.\nThe other special study involved applying two versions of the SD/LEP \"inclusion\" criteria for NAEP assessments and, in some schools, offering accommodations for testing students designated as SD/LEP. In the study, the school sample was divided into three subsamples: S1 (sample type 1), S2 (sample type 2), and S3 (sample type 3). The purpose of these subsamples was to collect data under the same conditions as previous assessments in order to maintain trend in mathematics within NAEP; evaluate the impact of a revised, more specific set of inclusion criteria; and evaluate the combined effect of the new criteria and the use of accommodations for testing students. Further details on this special study are provided in Chapters 3 and 5. Results for the study appear in the SD/LEP report along with a technical procedural appendix describing the special analyses completed for the study.\nAn automated management system tracked and recorded the progress of field work throughout the 1996 assessment period. In addition, progress was constantly monitored through telephone reports held between the area supervisors and the assessment supervisors and between the area supervisors and the home office staff.\nBoth Westat and ETS participated in the quality control of the field administration, which involved on-site visits by Westat and ETS staff to verify the sampling of the students and to observe the conduct of the assessment by the supervisors and the exercise administrators.\n\n1.7 MATERIALS AND DATA PROCESSING\nAfter completing an assessment session, Westat field supervisors and exercise administrators shipped the assessment booklets and forms from the field to National Computer Systems for entry into computer files, professional scoring, and creating the data files for transmittal to ETS. Careful checking assured that all data from the field were received. More than 134,000 booklets and questionnaires were received and processed for the national portion of the 1996 assessment. The extensive processing of these' data is detailed in Chapter 6.\nThe student data were transcribed into machine-readable form by scanning the student instruments with an optical scanning machine. An intelligent data entry system was used for resolution of the scanned data, the entry of documents rejected by the scanning machine, and the entry of information from the questionnaires. Additionally, each piece of input data was checked to verify that it was of an acceptable type, that it was within a specified range or ranges of values, and that it was consistent with other data values. The entry and editing of materials is discussed in Chapter 6.\n\n1.8 PROFESSIONAL SCORING\nItems requiring a written response from the student (constructed-response items) were included in the main and state assessments in mathematics and science and in the long-termtrend assessments in reading, mathematics, and writing. More than nine million constructed responses were read and marked by the professional scoring staff for the national and state portions of the 1996 assessment.\nImage processing and scoring were again used in 1996. Images of students' responses to the constructed-response items were scanned into computerized form, then scored online by professional raters.\n\n0\n\n23\n\n\fChapter 7 describes the professional scoring operation, including an overview of the scoring guides, the training procedures, and the scoring process for each subject area.\n1.9 CREATION OF THE DATABASE\nBefore analyses could begin, the student response data, school, teacher, and SD/LEP student questionnaire data, and all sampling weights had to be integrated into a coherent and comprehensive database. This database, which was used for all analyses, was also the source for the creation of two NAEP database productsthe item information database and the secondary-use data files. Secondary-use data files include sample control statement files for SAS and SPSS statistical systems and the NAEP Data on Disk product suite. The Data on Disk products, including a complete set of secondary-use data files on CD-ROM, PC-based NAEP data extraction software, and NAEP analysis modules, make secondary use of NAEP data much easier than it has been in the past. The quality of the data resulting from the complete data entry system, from the actual instruments collected in the field to the final machine-readable database used in analysis, was verified by selecting field instruments at random and performing a character-by-character comparison of these instruments with their representations in the final database. Chapter 8 provides details on the database, quality control activities, and database products.\n24\n5 1\n\n\fChapter 2\nDEVELOPING THE NAEP OBJECTIVES, ITEMS, AND BACKGROUND QUESTIONS FOR THE\n1996 ASSESSMENTS OF MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE'\nStephen Lazer Educational Testing Service\n2.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn 1996, the main NAEP assessments were conducted in mathematics and science.2 Long-term trend assessments were also conducted in reading, writing, mathematics, and science; these assessments are composed of instruments identical to those used in previous years. Additional data were gathered under the auspices of the State Assessment program, which in 1996 assessed mathematics at grades 4 and 8 using representative samples of public7 and nonpublic-school students in 44 states3, the District of Columbia, Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS), Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS), and Guam. The 1996 State Assessment program also assessed science at grade 8 using representative samples of public- and nonpublic-school students in 43 states, the District of Columbia, DDESS, DoDDS, and Guam; DDESS and DoDDS students were also assessed in science at grade 4. A summary of the main assessment subject areas follows:\nMathematics: A mathematics assessment was administered to national samples at grades 4, 8, and 12. This assessment was designed around the measurement of five mathematics content areas, and continued a trend line begun in 1990. In other words, many of the assessment questions were used in the 1990 and 1992 NAEP assessments; others were newly developed for 1996. A mixture of multiple-choice, short constructed-response, and extended constructed-response questions made up the assessment; in aggregate, well over half of the student assessment time was spent answering constructed-response questions. On some portion of the assessment, students were required to use calculators and other hands-on materials. In addition to the instruments used to generate the main reporting scales, three supplemental mathematics surveys were conducted at the national level. At each grade, special instruments were administered to representative national samples that were designed to measure the estimation skills of students. Second, separate samples at all grades were given \"thematic\" instruments constructed to measure the ability of students to solve in-depth mathematics problems. Finally, at grades eight and twelve a special study was conducted. In this study, students with advanced mathematics training were administered special assessment booklets whose contents were more advanced than those of the main assessment.\nScience: A science assessment was administered to national samples at grades 4, 8, and 12. The assessment measured a broad range of science-education outcomes. Because the 1996 science assessment was based on a new framework, it represents the beginning of a\nI Stephen Lazer manages assessment development activities for the NAEP program at ETS. 2 Copies of the frameworks for these assessments are available from the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) http://www.nagb.org. 3 Not all participating jurisdictions gathered both public- and nonpublic-school samples.\n25\n\n\fnew trend line. The assessment involved three different types of testing. Some portions covered general scientific knowledge and skills. Others sections of the survey tested students abilities to answer questions in an in-depth thematic or topical area. Finally, each sampled student completed a component that involved conducting a hands-on science experiment. A combination of multiple-choice, short constructed-response, and extended constructed-response questions made up the assessment; in aggregate, well over half of the student assessment time was spent answering constructed-response questions. In addition to the main assessment, a special study of students with advanced scientific training was conducted at grade 12.\nFrom its inception, NAEP has developed assessments through a consensus process and the 1996 instruments were no exception. Under the direction of the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), educators, scholars, and citizens representative of many diverse constituencies and points of view designed assessment frameworks for both subject areas. Staff at Educational Testing Service (ETS) who were subject-area experts in their respective fields worked with subject-area consultants well versed in assessment methodology to develop assessment questions appropriate to the objectives. All questions underwent extensive reviews by subject-matter specialists, measurement specialists, and ETS employees. Questions were assembled and printed into booklets suitable for matrix sampling and then administered either by a trained field staff (for the national program) or by state or local school district staff (for the State Assessment program) to stratified, multistage probability samples of students.\nAll 1996 assessment development efforts were governed by four major considerations:\n1. The primary goal of the development process was to craft instruments that matched the content definitions included in the assessment frameworks, which was developed\nthrough consensus processes conducted under the auspices of the National\nAssessment Governing Board (NAGB).\n2. As outlined in the ETS proposal for the administration of the NAEP cooperative agreement (ETS, 1992), the development of the items was guided by an Instrument Development Committee and further reviewed by state representatives and classroom teachers from across the country. In addition, the items had to be carefully reviewed for potential bias.\n3. As described in the ETS Standards of Quality and Fairness (ETS, 1987), all materials developed at ETS were in compliance with specified procedures. In\nparticular, all questions were carefully reviewed for content accuracy, testworthiness, and potential bias.\n4. As per federal regulations, all NAEP cognitive and background items were submitted to a federal clearance process. This process involved review of all cognitive items by\nNCES and NAGB, and review of all background questions by the Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB), the Information Management Team (EMT) of the Department of Education, and NCES.\nThe development effort for the 1996 assessment included questionnaires' for students, teachers, and school administrators, in addition to a substantial number of cognitive items for both subject areas.\n\n4\nThese questionnaires can be obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\n26\n\n5 3\n\n\fThe following sections include general overviews about setting objectives and developing items and specific details about developing subject-specific objectives and assessments. A list of the consultants who participated in the 1996 development process is included in Appendix A.\n2.2 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE 1996 ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORKS\nThe subject-area objectives for each NAEP assessment are determined through a legislatively mandated consensus process. These ,objectives typically take the form of frameworks, or matrices, delineating the important content and process areas to be assessed. In addition to these broad . frameworks, the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and therefore NAGB, provided detailed descriptions of item types and the numbers of items to be selected for each category. The various frameworks for the 1996 assessments are described below.\nThe frameworks for the main 1996 NAEP assessments were developed through consensus processes conducted by the CCSSO working under contract to NAGB. The projects involved participation and review by many groups, including teachers, content-area scholars, educational policymakers, and members of the general public. In addition to people directly involved in the framework development processes, the documents were reviewed by state education and testing officials, by representatives of professional associations, and by researchers. In addition, the frameworks were the subject of testimony at public hearings arranged to allow the widest possible participation in the consensus process. The objectives resulting from these processes reflect neither a narrowly defined theoretical framework nor the view of every participant. They do, however, represent the thinking of a broad cross-section of individuals who are expert in the various content areas and who are deeply committed to the improvement of American education.\nThe framework that governs the 1996 NAEP mathematics assessment is an enhanced version of the framework that governed the development of the 1990 and 1992 assessments. This framework was originally developed under the auspices of the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO); it was revised in 1991-1992 through a consensus project managed by the College Board. It was this enhanced framework that governed the instrument development activities related to the 1996 assessment. The revisions to the framework were minor, and allow for continued measurement of educational progress through comparisons with 1990 and 1992 results. The mathematics framework is organized according to a five-by-three matrix of content strands by mathematical abilities. The content strands, which make up the main reporting subscales, are:\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations; Measurement; Geometry and Spatial Sense; Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability; and Algebra and Functions.\nIn addition, the assessment was designed to measure the three mathematical abilities of:\nConceptual Understanding, Procedural Knowledge, and Problem Solving.\n\n5 4\n\n27\n\n\fAll exercises in the assessment were classified as measuring one of the content strands and one of the abilities. Additional specifications in the framework are related to an assessment dimension referred to as mathematical power. Mathematical power is conceived as consisting of mathematical abilities within a broader context of reasoning and with connections across the broad scope of mathematical content and thinking. Communication is viewed as both a unifying thread and a way for students to provide meaningful responses to tasks.\nThe framework for the 1996 science assessment is structured according to a matrix organized according to two major dimensions:fields of science and knowing and doing science. The fields of science, which make up the subscales on which assessment results are analyzed and reported, are the earth, physical, and life sciences. The cognitive dimension, knowing and doing science, is organized into three categories, conceptual understanding, scientific investigation, and practical reasoning. In addition, the framework includes requirements for measurement of content that crosses other categorical boundaries. Specifically, the nature of science and themes are categories that should integrate the three fields of science, rather than represent separate content.\n2.3 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING THE ITEMS\nA carefully developed and tested series of steps, similar to those used for past NAEP assessments, was utilized to create assessment items that reflected mathematics and science objectives and that measured achievement related to them (see Sections 2.4 through 2.6 for more detail). The steps were as follows: ,\n1. NAGB provided item specifications and frameworks in each subject area.\n2. The Instrument Development Committees in both subject areas provided guidance to\nNAEP staff about how the objectives could be measured given the realitic constraints of resources and the feasibility of measurement technology. The\ncommittees made recommendations about priorities for the assessment (within the context of the assessment framework) and the types of items to be developed.\n3. Items were chosen for the assessment through an extensive selection process that involved the input of practitioners from across the country as well as from members of the Instrument Development Committees.\n4. Specialists with subject-matter expertise, skills, and experience in creating items according to specifications were identified from inside and outside ETS to develop and review the assessment questions.\n5. The items were reviewed and revised by NAEP/ETS staff and external test\nspecialists.\n6. Representatives from the State Education Agencies met and reviewed all items and background questionnaires that were scheduled to be part of the state assessment.\n7. Language editing and sensitivity reviews were conducted as required by the ETS Standards for Quality and Fairness.\n8. Field test materials were prepared, including those necessary to secure clearance by the Office of Management and Budget.\n28\n5 5\n\n\f9. A. field test was conducted in many states, the District of Columbia, and three\nterritories.5\n10. Representatives from State Education Agencies met and reviewed the field test results for all exercises selected for the state assessment.\n11. Based on the field test analyses, new items for the 1996 assessment were revised, modified, and re-edited, where necessary. The items once again underwent the full range of ETS reviews.\n12. The Instrument Development Committees approved the selection of items to include in the 1996 assessment.\n13. After a final review and check to ensure that each assessment booklet and each block met the overall guidelines for the assessment, the booklets were typeset and printed.\nThe following sections describe the development of the mathematics and science assessments in more detail.\n2.4 DEVELOPING THE MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT\n2.4.1 Overview\nThe framework that governs the 1996 NAEP mathematics assessment is an enhanced version of the framework used on the 1990 and 1992 assessment. Similar to other NAEP assessments, the 1990 mathematics framework was developed through a broad-based consensus process managed by the CCSSO. In 1991-1992, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) contracted with The College Board to reView and revise the framework in preparation for the assessment originally planned for 1994 and administered, in fact, in 1996. The development process involved a committee of mathematicians and mathematics education specialists. Educators, scholars, and citizens, representative of many diverse constituencies and points of view, participated in the national consensus process to review and revise objectives for the assessment.\nThe instrument used in the 1996 mathematics assessment was composed of a combination of new items developed for administration in 19966 and items from the 1992 and 1990 assessments. Those items that were carried over from the 1992 and 1990 instruments comprised approximately 60 percent of the 1996 instrument. The remaining portion was made up of new items developed according to the recommendations included in the enhanced assessment specifications. Maintaining approximately 60 percent of the instrument across the two assessment years (1992 and 1996) allowed for the reporting of\n\n5 In this case, two field tests were conducted. The mathematics and science assessments were originally scheduled for 1994; thus a 1993 field test was conducted. This field test was designed to provide replacement items for those released in mathematics and all exercises needed in the new science assessment. Because the assessments were delayed until 1996, a supplementary field test was conducted in 1995. In mathematics, this field test was used for the development of theme and advanced blocks, and in the development of assessment accommodations. In science, the 1995 field test was used to develop more general science exercises\nfor the main assessment. 6 As was noted above, many of the new items were originally scheduled for use in 1994; however, the mathematics assessment was deferred'until 1996. Other items were developed and field tested in 1995. For purposes of this report, wewill refer to all\nexercises that were used in 1996 but that were not part of earlier NAEP surveys as having been \"newly developed for 1996.\"\n\n56\n\n29\n\n\ftrends in mathematics performance. At the same time, developing a new set of items made it possible to release approximately 40 percent of the 1992 assessment for public use.\nIn developing the new portion of the 1996 NAEP mathematics assessment, the same procedures used in 1992 were followed; however, new items were constructed to meet the demands of the revised framework. All items underwent extensive reviews by specialists in mathematics, measurement, and bias/sensitivity; items developed for grades four and eight were also reviewed by state representatives. The core goals of the ETS assessment development process and procedures used to realize these goals are outlined in the introduction to this chapter and in Section 2.3.\nThe following sections include a detailed description of the development of the framework, objectives, and items for the 1996 NAEP mathematics assessment. Section 2.4.8 describes the student background questionnaires and the reading teacher questionnaire. Additional information on the structure and content of assessment booklets can be found in Chapter 4. Various committees worked on the development of the framework, objectives, and items for the mathematics assessment. The list of committee members and consultants who participated in the 1996 development process is provided in Appendix A.\n2.4.2 Development of the Assessment Framework\nNAGB is responsible for developing assessment objectives and test specifications for NAEP surveys. Appointed by the Secretary of Education from lists of nominees proposed by the board itself in various statutory categories, the 26-member board is composed of state, local, and federal officials, as well as educators and members of the public.\nUnder contract with NAGB, The College Board convened a committee during 1991 and 1992 to develop an enhanced version of the framework that had been used during the development of the 1990 and 1992 assessments (the 1992 mathematics assessment had already been developed at the time the development of this enhanced framework was begun). The enhanced version was needed to better reflect the rapid evolution of mathematics instruction that was underway in the early 1990s as a result of the emergence of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics. The Standards were rapidly becoming one of the acknowledged barometers for measuring achievement. The development process for the enhanced framework was based on consensus building, and included the committee listed in Appendix A.\nDuring this development process, input and reactions were continually sought from a wide range of members of the mathematics field, experts in assessment, school administrators, and state staff. In particular, the process was informed by recommendations of leading professional organizations in mathematics.\n2.4.3 Framework and Assessment Design Principles\nThe planning committee involved in the review and revision of the NAEP mathematics framework was given a number of working guidelines and goals by the National Assessment Governing Board and by the steering committee that oversaw the process. These guidelines directed the planning committee to develop assessment specifications that called for performance-oriented exercises that focus on problem-solving and provide students with opportunities to communicate their understandings in mathematics. The framework should, according to these guidelines, embody a broad view of mathematics\n30\n5 7\n\n\fthat addressed the high levels of mathematical literacy needed for employability, personal development, and citizenship. Also, the framework should take into account findings of contemporary research on mathematics and mathematics education, and would expand the range of assessment tools to include formats that more closely resembled classroom activities.\nThe development was further guided by the consideration that the assessment should reflect many of the states' curricular emphases and objectives in addition to what various scholars, practitioners, and interested citizens believed should be included in the curriculum. Accordingly, the committee focused on several general principles in revising the NAEP mathematics assessment. These principles are:\nThe purpose of the NAEP mathematics assessment is to provide information about the progress and achievement of students in general rather than to test individual students' ability. NAEP is designed to inform policymakers and the public about mathematics ability in the United States. Furthermore, NAEP state data can be used to inform states of their students' relative strengths and weaknesses.\nThe term \"mathematical literacy\" encompasses such broad skills and abilities as being able to reason numerically, algebraically, geometrically, spatially, and with data; identify and apply problem-solving strategies appropriately in situations; and use the language of mathematics to construct clear and coherent responses to problems or tasks.\nThe mathematics assessment should use authentic problems and tasks that address\nimportant mathematics concepts and skills so that the assessment tool will\ndemonstrate a close link to desired classroom instruction and students' mathematics experiences.\nEvery effort should be made to make the best use of available methodology and resources in driving assessment capabilities forward.\nEvery effort must be made in developing the assessment to represent a variety of opinions, perspectives, and emphases among professionals in universities, as well as in state and local school districts.\n2.4.4 Framework for the 1996 Assessment\nThe framework for the 1996 mathematics assessment is organized according to a five-by-three matrix of content strands by mathematical abilities. The content strands are:\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations; Measurement; Geometry and Spatial Sense; Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability; and Algebra and Functions.\n31\n\n\fThese content strands were assessed across the three mathematical abilities of:\nConceptual Understanding, Procedural Knowledge, and Problem Solving.\nFigures 2-1 and 2-2 describe the five content strands and three mathematical abilities that guided the development of the 1996 mathematics assessment.\nFigure 2-1 Descriptions of Content Strands in Mathematics\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations\nThis strand focuses on students' understanding of numbers (whole numbers, fractions, decimals, integers, real numbers, and complex numbers), operations, and estimation, and their application to realworld situations. Students will be expected to demonstrate an understanding of numerical relationships as expressed in ratios, proportions, and percents. Students also will be expected to understand properties of numbers and operations, generalize from number patterns, and verify results.\nMeasurement\nThe measurement strand focuses on understanding of the process of measurement and on the use of numbers and measures to describe and compare mathematical and real-world objects. Students will be\nasked to identify attributes, select appropriate units and tools, apply measurement concepts, and\ncommunicate measurement-related ideas.\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\nAs described in the NCTM Standards, spatial sense must be an integral component of the study and assessment of geometry. Understanding spatial relationships allows students to use the dynamic nature of geometry to connect mathematics to their world.\nThis content strand is designed to extend well beyond low-level identification of geometric shapes into transformations and combinations of those shapes. Informal constructions and demonstrations (including drawing representations), along with their justifications, take precedence over more traditional types of compass-and-straightedge constructions and proofs. While reasoning is addressed throughout all of the content strands, this strand continues to lend itself to the demonstration of reasoning within both formal and informal settings. The extension of proportional thinking to similar figures and indirect measurement is an important connection here.\n(continued)\n32\n5 9\n\n\fFigure 2-1 (continued) Descriptions of Content Strands in Mathematics\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\nThe important skills of collecting, organizing, reading, representing, and interpreting data will be assessed in a variety of contexts to reflect the pervasive use of these skills in dealing with information. Statistics and statistical concepts extend these basic skills to include analyzing and communicating increasingly sophisticated interpretations of data. Dealing with uncertainty and making predictions about outcomes require an understanding not only of the meaning of basic probability concepts but also the application of those concepts in problem-solving and decision-making situations.\nQuestions will emphasize appropriate methods for gathering data, the visual exploration of data, a variety of ways of representing data, and the development and evaluation of arguments based on data analysis. Students will be expected to apply these ideas in increasingly sophisticated situations that require increasingly comprehensive analysis and decision making.\nAlgebra and Functions\nThis strand extends from work with simple patterns at grade 4, to basic algebra concepts at grade 8, to sophisticated analysis at grade 12, and involves not only algebra but also precalculus and some topics from discrete mathematics. As described in the NCTM Standards, these algebraic concepts are developed throughout the grades with informal modeling done at the elementary level and with increased emphasis on functions at the secondary level. The nature of the algebraic concepts and procedures included in the assessment at all levels reflects the NCTM Standards. Students will be expected to use algebraic notation and thinking in meaningful contexts to solve mathematical and real-world problems, specifically addressing an increasing understanding of the use of functions (including algebraic and geometric) as a representational tool.\n\n6 0\n\n33\n\n\fFigure 2-2 Descriptions of Mathematical Abilities\nConceptual Understanding\nStudents demonstrate conceptual understanding in mathematics when they provide evidence that they can recognize, label, and generate examples and nonexamples of concepts; use and interrelate models, diagrams, manipulatives, and varied representations of concepts; identify and apply principles (i.e., valid statements generalizing relationships among concepts in conditional form); know and apply facts and definitions; compare, contrast, and integrate related concepts and principles to extend the nature of concepts and principles; recognize, interpret, and apply the signs, symbols, and terms used to represent concepts; or interpret the assumptions and relations involving concepts in mathematical settings.\nConceptual understanding reflects a student' s ability to reason in settings involving the careful application of concept definitions, relations, or representations of either. Such an ability is reflected by student performance that indicates the production of examples, common or unique representations, or communications indicating the ability to manipulate central ideas about the understanding of a concept in' a variety of ways.\nProcedural Knowledge\nStudents demonstrate procedural knowledge in mathematics when they select and apply appropriate procedures correctly; verify or justify the correctness of a procedure using concrete models\nor symbolic methods; or extend or modify procedures to deal with factors inherent in problem settings.\nProcedural knowledge includes the various numerical algorithms in mathematics that have been created as tools to meet specific needs efficiently. Procedural knowledge also encompasses the abilities to read and produce graphs and tables, execute geometric constructions, and perform noncomputational skills such as rounding and ordering. These latter activities can be differentiated from conceptual understanding by the task context or presumed student backgroundthat is, an assumption that the student has the conceptual understanding of a representation and can apply it as a tool to create a product or to achieve a numerical, result. In these settings, the assessment question is how well the student executed a procedure or how well the student selected the appropriate procedure to effect a given task.\nProcedural knowledge is often reflected in a student's ability to connect an algorithmic process with a given problem situation, to employ that algorithm correctly, and to communicate the results of the algorithm in the context of the problem setting. Procedural understanding also encompasses a student' s ability to reason through a situation, describing why a particular procedure will give the correct answer for a problem in the context described.\nProblem Solving\nIn problem solving, students are required to use their accumulated knowledge of mathematics in new situations. Problem solving requires students to recognize and formulate problems; determine the sufficiency and consistency of data; use strategies, data, models, and relevant mathematics; generate,\nextend, and modify procedures; use reasoning (i.e., spatial, inductive, deductive, statistical, or\nproportional) in new settings; and judge the reasonableness and correctness of solutions. Problem solving situations require students to connect all of their mathematical knowledge of concepts, procedures, reasoning, and communication/ representational skills in confronting new situations. As such, these situations are, perhaps, the most accurate measures of students' proficiency in mathematics.\n\n34\n\n61\n\n\fTables 2-1 and 2-2 show the percentages of assessment time that the framework indicates should be devoted to each content strand and mathematical ability.\n\nTable 2-1 Percentage Distribution of Items by Grade and Content Strand\nas Specified in the NAEP Mathematics Framework\n\nContent Strand\n\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 8\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations' Measurement Geometry and Spatial Sense Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability Algebra and Functions\n\n40%-70% 20%\n15% 10% 15%\n\n25%-60% 15% 20% 15% 25%\n\nI For this category, these percentages are the minimum and maximum that are acceptable, respectively.\n\nGrade 12\n20%-50% 15% 20% 20% 25%\n\nTable 2-2 Percentage Distribution of Items by Grade and Mathematical Ability\nas Specified in the NAEP Mathematics Framework\n\nMathematical Ability\n\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 8\n\nGrade 12\n\nConceptual Understanding\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\nProcedural Knowledge\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\nProblem Solving\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\nNote: Some items carry multiple classifications.\n\n24.5 Developing the Cognitive Items\nThe 1996 assessment was designed to serve a dual purpose: to meet the content specifications elaborated in the revised NAEP mathematics framework and to allow for the measurement of changes in student mathematics achievement (that is, to permit linking to the 1990 and 1992 NAEP mathematics assessment). Because of these objectives, the following strategies were adopted in developing the 1996 mathematics assessment. First, at each grade, 8 of the 13 blocks used in the 1992 assessment were carried forward and used in 1996. Items were developed and field tested in 1993 to replace the five blocks from the 1992 assessment that had been released for public use. In addition, other portions of the 1993 field test were used to develop special components of the assessment. To this end, a new block of \"estimation\" exercises was developed, as were exercises for a special study of students at grades eight and twelve who had received advanced mathematics training. Given the fact that the mathematics assessment was delayed from 1994 until 1996, a supplemental field test was held in 1995 (exercises were developed for this field test in 1994). This round of exercise development was used to build extra exercises for the estimation and advanced components of the assessment. It was also used to build \"theme blocks,\" which were intended to measure in-depth mathematics problem-solving ability.\nThe development of cognitive items involved careful field testing, both locally and nationally, of grade-appropriate questions and tasks for the assessment. Items were selected from a pool of questions that were written by teachers from across the country as well as by mathematics assessment specialists on\n35\n6 \u00b0\n\n\fstaff at ETS. The framework stated that the assessment should include some performance-based questions and tasks that require students to reason and make connections within and across different content strands of mathematics. Final selections of questions used in the 1996 assessment were approved by the Mathematics Instrument Development Committee.\nThe assessment included constructed-response (short and extended) and multiple-choice items. The decision to use a specific item type was based on a consideration of the most appropriate format for assessing the particular objective. Both types of constructed-response items were designed to provide an in-depth view of students' ability to communicate their understanding of important concepts in mathematics. Short constructed-response questions (scored with either a 2- or 3-level scoring rubric) were used when students needed to respond briefly in order to demonstrate full comprehension. Extended constructed-response questions (scored with a 4- or 5-level scoring rubric) were used when the task required more thoughtful consideration of the problem and engagement in more complex reasoning processes. Multiple-choice items were used when a straightforward, single correct answer was required.\nA carefully developed and proven series of steps was used to create the assessment items. These steps are described earlier in the chapter under Section 2.3.\nAs was mentioned above, the assessment was designed to allow for measurement of trends. Therefore, eight 15-minute blocks at each grade were included in the 1996 assessment that had been a part of the 1992 assessment (and in some cases the 1990 assessment). These blocks were used in precisely the same form as they were in 1992. In addition, one of the paced-tape estimation blocks was carried forward from 1992. The remainder of the exercises used in 1996 were newly developed during either the 1992-1993 or 1994-1995 development cycles.\n\n2.4.6 Development of the Operational Forms\nThe field tests of new items for the 1996 assessment were conducted in February and March, 1993 and February and March, 1995. The field test involved a convenience sample in which roughly 500 responses were obtained to each item.\nThe field test data were collected, scored, and analyzed in preparation for meetings with the Mathematics Instrument Development Panel. The objectives that guided the review of these items were:\nto determine which items were most suitable for assessing understanding in\nmathematics in accordance with the framework;\nto select items that displayed appropriate statistical attributes;\nto determine the need for revisions of items that lacked clarity, or had ineffective item formats;\nto prioritize items to be included in the assessment; and,\nto determine appropriate timing for assessment items.\nCommittee members, ETS assessment staff, and NAEP/ETS staff reviewed the materials. Item analyses (which provided the mean percentage of correct responses, the r-biserial correlations, and the difficulty level for each item) were used as a guide in identifying and flagging for further review those\n\n36\n\n63\n\n\ftest questions that were not measuring the intended objective well. In addition, another meeting of representatives from state education agencies was convened to review the field test results for exercises included in the grade four or eight assessments.\nOnce the committees had selected the items, all items were rechecked for content, measurement, and sensitivity concerns. The federal clearance process was initiated in June 1993 with the submission of draft materials to NCES. The package containing the set of cognitive items assembled into blocks and questionnaires was submitted in August 1993. A revised package with the new thematic blocks and the adjusted advanced and estimation blocks was submitted in July, 1995. Throughout the clearance process, revisions were made in accordance with changes required by the government. After approval, the blocks (assembled into booklets) and questionnaires were readied for printing in preparation for the assessment.\n2.4.7 Distribution of Assessment Items\nThe mathematics assessment developed for use in 1996 was organized according to a series of blocks, each containing a set of questions. Some of the blocks were unique to a particular grade level. Other blocks were designed to be given to students in two grades (either 4 and 8 or 8 and 12) and a few blocks (a small percentage of the blocks used to measure trend) overlap all three grades.\nAt each grade, the main component of the assessment used for the creation of reporting scales included thirteen different 15-minute blocks of multiple-choice and constructed-response questions (some with both regular and extended constructed-response questions). Two additional books containing 30-minute theme blocks of multiple-choice and constructed-response questions were also used. Two estimation blocks at each grade were part of a special study and were presented to students by a pacedaudiotape to assess students' estimation skills. Two 20-minute grade 8 special study blocks and two 30minute grade 12 special study blocks targeted students in advanced mathematics courses. Of the 13 blocks at each grade that were used for the main assessment:\nthree to five blocks at each grade level included items designed to be answered using\na calculator. For the grade 4 calculator blocks, students were provided with a 4-function calculator, while at grades 8 and 12 the students were provided with a scientific calculator (students were also provided calculators for the theme blocks\nand allowed to use their own calculators on the advanced blocks)\none block at all grade levels contained questions requiring the use of a\nprotractor/ruler (ruler only for grade 4)\ntwo blocks at each grade involved the use of manipulatives; several of the theme blocks involved the use of manipulatives as well\nseven blocks at grade 4 and eight blocks at each of grades 8 and 12 included\nextended constructed-response items. The extended constructed-response mathematics items call for the student to work through a complex problem, require about five minutes to complete, and were scored on a 0-5 point scale. The theme and advanced blocks also included extended constructed-response items.\n\n6 4\n\n37\n\n\fThe sections that follow discuss the distribution of exercises on the mathematics assessment. For purposes of this discussion, we will limit the calculations to exercises that appeared as part of the main assessment, or BIB. Special study, theme, and estimation blocks will be discussed below.\nFigure 2-3 lists the total number of items at each grade level in the main portion of the 1996 assessment. Of the total of 360 items, there were 194 unique multiple-choice items and 166 unique constructed-response items. Some of these items were used at more than one grade level. As a result, the sum of the items that appear at each grade level is greater than the total number of unique items.\n\nFigure 2-3 Total Number of Items for the 1996 Mathematics Main Assessment\n\nGrade 4\n79 Multiple-Choice' 58 Short Constructed-Response2 7 Extended Constructed-Response\n\nGrade 8\n92 Multiple-Choice' 65 Short Constructed-Response2 8 Extended Constructed-Response\n\nGrade 12\n93 Multiple-Choice' 66 Short Constructed-Response2 8 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n50 Multiple-Choice 33 Short Constructed-Response 7 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n37 Multiple-Choice 26 Short Constructed-Response 8 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n52 Multip e-Choice 45 Short Constructed-Response 8 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n14 Multiple-Choice 18 Short Constructed-Response 0 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n26 Multip e-Choice 14 Short Constructed-Response 0 Extended Constructed-Response\n\nI These item counts include 15 multiple-choice questions that were presented at all three grades. 2 These item counts include 7 short constructed-response questions that were presented at all three grades.\n\nIn the development process, every effort was made to meet the content and process targets specified in the assessment framework. Tables 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5 show the approximate percentage of aggregate assessment items devoted to each content strand at each grade level. Percentages are based on the classifications agreed upon by NAEP's 1996 Mathematics Instrument Development Committee, and confirmed by independent reviewers.\n\n38\n6 5\n\n\fTable 2-3 Distribution of Assessment Items for the Mathematics Assessment, Grade 4\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1996\n\nNumber Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage\n\nof items Of items of items of items of items of items\n\nContent Strand\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations 52\n\nMeasurement\n\n21\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n14\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\n\n8\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n14\n\nTotal\n\n109\n\n48% 19% 13% 7% 13% 100%\n\n63\n\n40%\n\n59\n\n41%\n\n31\n\n20%\n\n25\n\n17%\n\n27\n\n17%\n\n25\n\n17%\n\n20\n\n12%\n\n17\n\n12%\n\n17\n\n11%\n\n18\n\n13%\n\n158\n\n100%\n\n144\n\n100%\n\nMathematical Ability Conceptual Understanding Procedural Knowledge Problem Solving Total\n\n42\n\n39%\n\n64\n\n40%\n\n61\n\n42%\n\n31\n\n28%\n\n31\n\n20%\n\n32\n\n22%\n\n36\n\n33%\n\n63\n\n40%\n\n51\n\n35%\n\n109\n\n100%\n\n158\n\n100%\n\n144\n\n99%\n\nTable 2-4 Distribution of Assessment Items for the Mathematics Assessment, Grade 8\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1996\n\nNumber Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage\n\nof items Of items of items of items of items of items\n\nContent Strand\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations 45\n\nMeasurement\n\n21\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n26\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\n\n19\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n26\n\nTotal\n\n137\n\n33% 15% 19% 14% 19% 100%\n\n58\n\n32%\n\n48\n\n29%\n\n32\n\n17%\n\n27\n\n16%\n\n36\n\n20%\n\n31\n\n19%\n\n28\n\n15%\n\n25\n\n15%\n\n29\n\n16%\n\n34\n\n21%\n\n183\n\n100%\n\n165\n\n100%\n\nMathematical Ability Conceptual Understanding Procedural Knowledge Problem Solving Total\n\n59\n\n43%\n\n67\n\n37%\n\n57\n\n35%\n\n41\n\n30%\n\n45\n\n24%\n\n46\n\n28%\n\n37\n\n27%\n\n71\n\n39%\n\n62\n\n38%\n\n137\n\n100%\n\n183\n\n100%\n\n165\n\n101%\n\n66\n39\n\n\fTable 2-5 Distribution of Assessment Items for the Mathematics Assessment, Grade 12\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1996\n\nNumber Percentage Number Percentage Number Percentage\n\nof items Of items of items of items of items of items\n\nContent Strand\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations 37\n\nMeasurement\n\n23\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n24\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\n\n22\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n38\n\nTotal\n\n144\n\nMathematical Ability\n\nConceptual Understanding\n\n53\n\nProcedural Knowledge\n\n48\n\nProblem Solving\n\n43\n\nTotal\n\n144\n\n26% 16% 17% 15% 26% 100%\n37% 33% 30% 100%\n\n43\n\n24%\n\n41\n\n25%\n\n29\n\n16%\n\n23\n\n14%\n\n31\n\n1.8%\n\n27\n\n16%\n\n29\n\n16%\n\n34\n\n20%\n\n47\n\n26%\n\n42\n\n25%\n\n179\n\n100%\n\n167\n\n101%\n\n70\n\n39%\n\n66\n\n40%\n\n52\n\n29%\n\n51\n\n31%\n\n57\n\n32%\n\n50\n\n30%\n\n179\n\n100%\n\n167\n\n101%\n\nBefore proceeding, it is worth saying a few words about the other assessment components. The estimation blocks were given to nationally representative samples of students at each grade. Estimation was not given at the state level. Students in the estimation sample took one block from the main BIB. In addition, they took two estimation blocks. Both estimation blocks were administered by a paced-tape method.' The first estimation block was all multiple-choice, and was carried forward intact from 1992. It contained 20 items at grade 4, and 22 items at grades 8 and 12. The second estimation block was newly developed for 1996. It contained 13 items at grade 4 (10 multiple choice and 3 constructed-response), 15 at grade 8 (9 multiple-choice), and 16 at grade 12 (all multiple-choice). Trend was measured on this assessment component.\nTheme blocks were also given to nationally-representative samples at all grades. Students in the theme sample first completed one block from the main assessment BIB. Then they were administered one 30-minute theme block. These blocks called for in-depth examination of mathematical problems, and for the use of a variety of mathematics skills. At grade 4, the two theme blocks included a total of one multiple-choice question and 13 constructed-response items. At grade 8, the total was 8 multiple-choice items and 13 constructed-response items. At grade 12, the total was 8 multiple-choice items and 10 constructed-response exercises.\nFinally, the advanced special studies were administered to samples of students meeting certain course-taking criteria at grades 8 and 12 (algebra or higher at grade 8, and calculus, precalculus, or algebra three at grade 12). Students took a linking block composed of exercises from the main assessment and then two 20-minute blocks (at grade 8) or two 30-minute blocks (grade 12) of advanced exercises. These blocks contained 9 multiple-choice and 13 constructed-response items at grade 8, and 7 multiplechoice and 15 constructed-response items at grade 12.\n\n7 The blocks were paced so students had to estimate rather than calculate the answer.\n40\n6 7\n\n\f2.4.8 Questionnaires\nAs part of the national.assessment (as well as the State Assessment), a series of questionnaires was administered to students, teachers, and school administrators. Similar to the development of the cognitive items, the development of the policy issues and questionnaire items was a consensual process that involved staff work, field testing, and review by external advisory groups. A Background Questionnaire Panel drafted a set of policy issues and made recommendations regarding the design of the items. They were particularly interested in capitalizing on the unique properties of NAEP and not duplicating other surveys (e.g., the National Survey of Public and Private School Teachers and Administrators, the School and Staffing Survey, and the National Educational Longitudinal Study).\nThe Panel recommended a focused study that addressed the relationship between student achievement and instructional practices. The policy issues, items, and field test results were reviewed by the group of external consultants who identified specific items to be included in the final questionnaires. In addition, the Mathematics Instrument Development Panel and state representatives were consulted on the appropriateness of issues addressed in the questionnaires as they relate to mathematics instruction and achievement. The items underwent internal ETS review procedures to ensure fairness and quality and were then assembled into questionnaires.\nStudent Questionnaires\nIn addition to the cognitive items, the 1996 assessment included three student questionnaires; two sets of general and mathematics background items designed to gather contextual information about students, their instructional experiences in mathematics, and their attitudes toward mathematics, and one set of background items, given to students at the end of each booklet to determine their motivation in completing the assessment and their familiarity with assessment tasks. In order to ensure that all fourthgrade students understood the items and had every opportunity to respond to them, the three questionnaires were read aloud by administrators as fourth-grade students read along and responded in their booklets. Background questionnaires were not read aloud to eighth- and twelfth-grade students.\nThe Student Demographics (common background) Questionnaire included items about race/ethnicity, language spoken in the home, mother's and father's level of education, reading materials in the home, homework, attendance, which parents live at home, and which parents work. This questionnaire was the first section in every booklet. In many cases the items used were continued from prior assessments, so as to document changes in contextual factors that occur over time.\nThe second section of background items was the Mathematics Background Questionnaire. Categories of information represented in this section include:\nTime Spent Studying Mathematics: Students were asked to describe both the amount of instruction they received in mathematics and the time spent on mathematics homework.\nInstructional Practices: Students were asked to report their instructional experiences related to mathematics in the classroom, including group work, special projects, and writing in response to mathematics. In addition, they were asked about the instructional practices of their mathematics teachers and the extent to which the students themselves discussed what they did in class and demonstrated use of skills and strategies.\n\n6 8\n\n41\n\n\fAttitudes Towards Mathematics: Students were asked a series of questions about their attitudes and perceptions about mathematics.\nThe Student Motivation Questionnaire asked students to describe how hard they tried on the NAEP mathematics assessment, how difficult they found the assessment, how many items they thought they got right, how important it was for them to do well, and how familiar they were with the assessment format.\nTeacher, School, and SD/LEP Student Questionnaires\nTo supplement the information on instruction reported by students, the mathematics teachers of the students participating in the mathematics assessment were asked to complete a questionnaire about their instructional practices, teaching backgrounds, and characteristics. The teacher questionnaire contained two parts. The first part pertained to the teachers' background and general training. The second part pertained to specific training in teaching mathematics and the procedures the teacher uses for each class containing an assessed student, as well as collecting information on teachers' awareness and knowledge of the NCTM Standards.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire, Part I: Background and General Training included questions pertaining to gender, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience, certification, degrees, major and minor fields of study, course work in education, course work in specific subject areas, amount of in-service training, extent of control over instructional issues, and availability of resources for their classroom.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire, Part II: Training in Mathematics and Classroom Instructional Information included questions on the teacher's exposure to various issues related to mathematics and teaching mathematics through pre- and in-service training, ability level of students in the class, whether students were assigned to the class by ability level, time on task, homework assignments, frequency of instructional activities used in class, methods of assessing student progress in mathematics, instructional emphasis given to the mathematics abilities covered in the assessment, and use of particular resources.\nA School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire was given to the principal or other administrator of each school that participated in the assessment. This information provided an even broader picture of the instructional context for students' mathematics achievement. This questionnaire included questions about background and characteristics of school principals, length of school day and year, school enrollment, absenteeism, dropout rates, size and composition of teaching staff, policies about grouping students, curriculum, testing practices and uses, special priorities and school-wide programs, availability of resources, special services, community services, policies for parental involvement, and school-wide problems.\nThe SD/LEP Student Questionnaire was completed by the teachers of students who were selected to participate in the assessment sample who were also identified as students with a disability (SD) or categorized as being of limited English proficiency (LEP). Some of these students were determined by the school to be ineligible to be assessed. In order to be excluded from the assessment, a student must have been identified as SD and must not have been mainstreamed at least 50 percent of the time, or was categorized as LEP. In addition, the school staff would have needed to determine that it was inappropriate to include the student in the assessment. This questionnaire asked about the nature of the student's disability or about the student's native language, and the special programs in which the student participated.\n6 9\n42\n\n\f2.5 DEVELOPING THE SCIENCE ASSESSMENT\n2.5.1 Overview\nThe science framework for the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) was produced under the auspices of the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). The consensus process was managed by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) who worked with the National Center for Improving Science Education and the American Institutes for Research. Items were developed that were aligned with the specifications described in the framework and were extensively reviewed by specialists in science, measurement, and bias/sensitivity, as well as by government officials and state representatives.\nThe following sections include a detailed description of the development of the framework, objectives, and items for the 1996 NAEP science assessment. Section 2.5.8 describes the student background questionnaires and the science teacher questionnaire. Additional information on the structure and content of assessment booklets can be found in Chapter 4. Various committees worked on the development of the framework, objectives, and items for the mathematics assessment. The list of committee members and consultants who participated in the 1996 development process is provided in Appendix A.\n\n2.5.2 Development of the Assessment Framework\nNAGB is responsible for setting policy for NAEP; this policymaking role includes the development of assessment frameworks and test specifications. Appointed by the Secretary of Education from lists of nominees proposed by the Board itself in various statutory categories, the 26-member board is composed.of state, local, and federal officials, as well as educators and members of the public.\nThe science framework for the NAEP 1996 assessment was developed over a 10-month period between October 1990 and August 1991. The following sections discuss how the specifications and items for science assessment were developed. The assessment instrument, the student assessment booklets, and the student, teacher, school, and SD/LEP questionnaires are also described.\nA consensus process run by CCSSO was used to produce the science framework. This process involved two'committees: a Planning Committee that conducted much of the actual framework development and a steering committee that provided policy and general guidance for the project. As general guidelines for the Planning Committee, the Steering Committee that recommended that the framework and ensuing science assessment have the following five characteristics:\nThe framework should reflect the best thinking about the knowledge, skills, and competencies needed for a high degree of scientific understanding among all students in the United States. Accordingly it should encompass knowledge and use of organized factual information, relationships among concepts, major ideas unifying the sciences, and thinking and laboratory skills. In addition, the framework should be based on current understandings from research of teaching, learning, and students' performance in science.\nThe framework and the assessment should address the nature and practices of knowing in science, as different from other ways of knowing; reflect the quantitative aspects of science as well as the concepts of life, earth, and physical sciences; deal\n\n7 0\n\n43\n\n\fwith issues raised by the role of science and technology in society; include practical problem solving in science; take into account the developmental levels of students; and ensure that students with diverse backgrounds are assessed in ways that provide them with equal and fair opportunities to reflect their knowledge and performance.\nAssessment formats should be used that are consistent with the objectives being assessed. A variety of strategies for assessing student performance are advocated, including performance tasks that allow students to manipulate physical objects and draw scientific understandings from the materials before them; constructed-response items that provide insights into students' levels of understanding and ability to communicate in the sciences, as well as their ability to generate, rather than simply recognize information related to scientific concepts and their interconnections; and multiple-choice items that probe students' conceptual understanding and ability to connect ideas in a scientifically sound way.\nThe assessment should contain a broad enough range of items at different levels of proficiency for identifying three achievement levels for each grade.\nInformation on students' demographic and other background characteristics should be collected. Additional information should be collected from students, teachers and administrators about instructional programs and delivery systems, so that their relationships with student achievement can be ascertained and used to inform program and policy decisions.\nA Planning Committee was established to identify goals and objectives and to produce the framework. This Planning Committee met monthly from November 1990 through April 1991 and was joined in the first meeting and final meeting by the Steering Committee, which reviewed and reacted to all framework drafts. During this development process, input and reactions were continually sought from a wide range of committee members both within the field of science and external to it. A list of committee members who participated in the developmental process is provided in Appendix A.\n2.5.3 Framework for the 1996 Assessment\nThe framework for the 1996 science assessment is represented as a matrix with two dimensions represented by three fields of science (earth science, physical science, and life science) and three elements of knowing and doing science ( conceptual understanding, scientific investigation, and practical reasoning). In addition, there are two overarching domains that describe science and nature of science and themes. Figures 2-4 to 2-6, respectively, describe the three fields of science, the elements of knowing and doing science, and the overarching domains.\n44\n\n\fFigure 2-4 Descriptions of the Three Fields of Science\nEarth Science\nThe earth science component assessed centers on objects and events that are relatively accessible or visible. The concepts and topics covered are solid earth (lithosphere), water (hydrosphere), air (atmosphere), and the earth in space. The solid earth consists of composition; forces that alter its surface; the formation, characteristics, and uses of rocks; the changes and uses of soil; natural resources used by humankind; and natural forces within the earth. Concepts and topics related to water consist of the water\ncycle; the nature of oceans and their effects on water and climate; and the location of water, its distribution, characteristics, and effect of and influence on human activity. The air is broken down into\ncomposition and structure of the atmosphere (including energy transfer); the nature of weather; common weather hazards; and air quality and climate. The earth in space consists of setting of the earth in the solar system; the setting and evolution of the solar system in the universe; tools and technology that are used to gather information about space; apparent daily motions of the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars; rotation of the earth about its axis, the earth's revolution around the sun; and tilt of the earth's axis that produces seasonal variations in the climate.\nPhysical Science\nThe' physical science component relates to basic knowledge and understanding concerning the structure' of the universe as well as the physical principles that operate within it. The major sub-topics probed are matter and its transformations, energy and its transformations, and the motion of things. Matter and its transformations are described by diversity of materials (classification and types and the particulate nature of matter); temperature and states of matter; properties and uses of material (modifying properties, synthesis of materials with new properties); and resource management. nergy and its transformations involve different forms of energy; energy transformations in living systems, natural physical systems, and artificial systems constructed by humans; and energy sources and use, including distribution, energy conversion, and energy costs and depletion. Motion is broken down into an understanding of frames of reference; forces and changes in position and motion; action and reaction; vibrations and waves as motion; general wave behavior; electromagnetic radiation; and the interactions of electromagnetic radiation with matter.\nLife Science\nThe fundamental goal of life science is to attempt to understand and explain the nature and function of living things. The major concepts assessed in life science are change and evolution, cells and their functions, organisms, and ecology. Change and evolution includes diversity of life on earth; genetic variation within a species; theories of adaptation and natural selection; and changes in diversity over time. Cells and their functions consists of information transfer; energy transfer for the construction of proteins; and communication among cells. Organism are described by reproduction, growth and development; life cycles; and functions and interactions of systems within organisms. The topic of ecology centers on the interdependence of lifepopulations, communities, and ecosystems.\n\n742\n\n45\n\n\fFigure 2-5 Descriptions of Knowing and Doing Science\nConceptual Understanding Conceptual understanding includes the body of scientific knowledge that students draw upon\nwhen conducting a scientific investigation or engaging in practical reasoning. Essential scientific concepts involve a variety of information including facts and events the student learns from science instruction and experiences with the natural environment and scientific concepts, principles, laws, and theories that scientists use to explain and predict observations of the natural world.\nScienttfic Investigation Scientific investigation probes students' abilities to use the tools of science, including both\ncognitive and laboratory tools. Students should be able to acquire new information, plan appropriate investigations, use a variety of scientific tools, and communicate the results of their investigations.\nPractical Reasoning Practical reasoning probes students' ability to use and apply science understanding in new, real-\nword applications.\nFigure 2-6 Descriptions of Overarching Domains\nThe Nature of Science The nature of science incorporates the historical development of science and technology, the\nhabits of mind that characterize these fields, and methods of inquiry and problem-solving. It also encompasses the nature of technology that includes issues of design, application of science to real-world problems, and trade-offs or compromises that need to be made.\n(continued)\n\n46\n\n73\n\n\fFigure 2-6 (continued) Descriptions of Overarching Domains\nThemes\nThemes are the \"big ideas\" of science that transcend the various scientific disciplines and enable students to consider problems with global implications. The NAEP science assessment focuses on three themes: systems, models, and patterns of change.\nSystems are complete, predictable cycles, structures or processes occurring in natural phenomena. Students should understand that a system is an artificial construction created to represent, or explain a natural occurrence. Students should be able to identify and define the system boundaries, identify the components and their interrelationships and note the inputs and outputs to the system.\nModels of objects and events in nature are ways to understand complex or abstract phenomena. As such they have limits and involve simplifying assumptions but also possess generalizability and often predictive power. Students need to be able to distinguish the idealized model from the phenomenon itself and to understand the limitations and simplified assumptions that underlie scientific models.\nPatterns of change involve students' recognition of patterns of similarity and differences, and recognition of how these patterns change over time. In addition, students should have a store of common types of patterns and transfer their understanding of a familiar pattern of change to a new\nand unfamiliar one.\n\nTable 2-6 summarizes the distribution of assessment time across the three fields of science earth, physical, and life.

In addition, it indicated that at least 30 percent of students should complete portions of the assessment involving in-depth examination of certain themes or topics in science.\n\n2.5.4 Developing the Cognitive Items\nThe 1996 assessment was designed to meet the content specifications elaborated in the framework. Because of the broad content and skills definitions included in the framework, and the need to assess hand-on and theme-based science skills, the exercise development effort was extensive. At each grade, enough blocks were field tested to support 13 operational blocks; each block was 20 minutes at grade 4 and 30 minutes at the older two levels.8 In addition, other portions of the 1993 field test were used to develop exercises for a special study of students at grade twelve who had received advanced science training. Given the fact that the science assessment was delayed from 1994 until 1996, a supplemental field test was held in 1995 (exercises were developed for this field test in 1994). This round of exercise development was used to build extra exercises for the general science and advanced components of the assessment.\nThe development of cognitive items involved careful field testing, both locally and nationally, of grade-appropriate questions and tasks for the assessment. Items were selected from a pool of questions\n8 Most of the development and field testing were conducted during 1992 and 1993; supplemental development and field testing of general science blocks was conducted during 1994 and 1995.\n48\n75\n\n\fthat were written by teachers from across the country as well as by science assessment specialists on staff at ETS. The framework stated that the assessment should include some performance-based questions and tasks that require students to reason and solve problems representing real-life applications of science. Final selections of items used in the 1996 assessment were approved by the Science Instrument Development Committee.\nThe assessment included constructed-response (short and extended) and multiple-choice items. The decision to use a specific item type was based on a consideration of the most appropriate format for assessing the particular objective. Both types of constructed-response items were designed to provide an in-depth view of students' ability to communicate their understanding of important concepts in science. Short constructed-response items (scored with either a 2- or 3-level scoring rubric) were used when students needed to respond briefly in order to demonstrate full comprehension. Extended constructedresponse items (scored with a 4- or 5-level scoring rubric) were used when the task required more thoughtful consideration of the problem and engagement in more complex reasoning processes. Some items also required diagrams, graphs, or calculations. It was expected that students could adequately answer the short constructed-response items in about two to three minutes and the extended constructedresponse items in about five minutes. In addition, blocks of items were developed thatrequired the manipulation of equipment (hands-on tasks) and others were developed that assessed each of the three themes: systems, models, and patterns of change. In the case of some of the hands-on blocks, compound items were created in which student responses to a variety of items were scored as a single item. Multiple-choice items were used when a straightforward, single correct answer was required.\nA carefully developed and proven series of steps was used to create the assessment items. These steps are described earlier in the chapter under Section 2.3.\n2.5.5 Development of the Operational Forms\nMost of the items for the 1996 science assessment were field tested in February and March 1993; however, since the assessment was delayed from 1994 to 1996 an opportunity was afforded for further items to be field tested in February and March 1995. Each of these field tests involved students in many states and were intended to try out the cognitive items and hands-on-tasks and to give jurisdictions and contractors practice and experience with the proposed materials and tasks. Approximately 500 responses were obtained for each item in each field test.\nThe field test data were collected, scored, and analyzed in preparation for meetings with the Science Instrument Development Committee. The objectives that guided the review of these items were:\nto determine which items were most suitable for assessing understanding in science in accordance with the framework;\nto select items that displayed appropriate statistical attributes;\nto determine the need for revisions of items that lacked clarity, or had ineffective item formats;\nto determine appropriate timing for assessment items.\nCommittee members, ETS assessment staff, and NAEP staff reviewed the materials. Item analyses (which provided the percentage of correct responses, the biserial correlations for multiple-\n49\n76\n\n\fchoice and items with a two-level scoring guides, and percentages of responses in each category or at each level of the scoring guide and the polyserial correlations for other constructed-response items) were used as a guide in identifying and flagging for further review those test items that were not measuring the intended objective well.\nOnce the committees had selected the items, they were rechecked for content, measurement, and sensitivity concerns. In addition, a meeting of representatives from state education agencies was convened to review the items chosen for the components of the operational assessment that were to be administered at the state level (that is, the grade 8 assessment). The federal clearance package containing 13 blocks of cognitive items was submitted to NCES in August 1993. A further clearance package containing two blocks of items was submitted to NCES in 1995. Throughout the clearance process, revisions were made in accordance with changes required by the government. Upon approval, the 15 blocks (assembled into booklets) and questionnaires were ready for printing in preparation for the assessment.\n2.5.6 Distribution of Assessment Items\nThe science assessment developed for use in 1996 was organized according to a series of blocks, each containing a set of items. Some of the blocks were unique to a particular grade level. Other blocks were designed to be given to students in two grades (either 4 and 8 or 8 and 12).\nAt each grade, the main component of the assessment used for the creation Of reporting scales included fifteen different blocks of multiple-choice and constructed-response items (some with both regular and extended constructed-response items). These blocks each were 20-minutes long at grade four and thirty minutes at the other levels. Three 30-minute special study blocks targeted students in advanced mathematics courses. Of the 15 blocks at each grade that were used for the main assessment:\nfour blocks at each grade level required students to complete a hands-on science task\nthree blocks at each grade required students to work in-depth in a single thematic or topical area\neight blocks at each grade covered general knowledge and concepts in the fields of science\nFigure 2-7 lists the total number of items at each grade level in the 1996 assessment. Of the total of 438 items, there were 167 unique multiple-choice items and 271 unique constructed-response items that made up the 1996 science assessment. Some of these items were used at more than one grade level. As a result, the sum of the items that appear at each grade level is greater than the total number of unique items.\n\n50\n\n77\n\n\fFigure 2-7 Total Number of Items for the 1996 Science Main Assessment\n\nGrade 4\n50 Multiple-Choice' 69 Short Constructed-Response 18 Extended Constructed-Response\n\nGrade 8\n77 Multiple-Choice 93 Short Constructed-Response 25 Extended Constructed-Response\n\nGrade 12\n71 Multiple-Choice 90 Short Constructed-Response 27 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n40 Multiple-Choice 50 Short Constructed-Response 14 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n46 Mu ltiple-Choice\n50 Short Constructed-Response 17 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n50 Mu ltiple-Choice\n66 Short Constructed-Response 23 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n10 Multiple-Choice 19 Short Constructed-Response 4 Extended Constructed-Response\n\n21 Multiple-Choice 24 Short Constructed-Response 4 Extended Constructed-Response\n\nI The percentage of time for multiple-choice items is low because the hands-on tasks and theme blocks contain very few multiple-choice items and take up 47% of the assessment time at each grade level.\n\nTable 2-9 summarizes the distribution of assessment time across the three fields of science. Since these fields make up the core of the Science Framework, care has been taken to ensure the greatest possible congruence between the proportions used in the assessment and those indicated in the assessment specifications.\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\nTable 2-9 Distribution of Assessment Time by Field of Science\n\nEarth Science Physical Science\n\nLife Science\n\n33%\n\n34%\n\n33%\n\n30%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n33%\n\n.33%\n\n34%\n\n51\n78\n\n\fTable 2-10 summarizes the assessment in terms of percentage of time devoted to different cognitive domains. The classification of items into these domains was conducted by both ETS staff and members of\nthe instrument development committee. Every effort was made to meet the specified targets.\n\nTable 2-10 Distribution of Assessment Time Across Cognitive Domains (Knowing and Doing)\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\nConceptual Understanding\n45% 45% 44%\n\nScientific Investigation\n38% 29% 28%\n\nPractical Reasoning\n17% 26% 28%\n\nExercises assessing each of the fields of science and each of the cognitive domains also probe three themes, (models, systems, and patterns of change), and the students' knowledge of the nature of science.

Students who were in their fourth year of high-school science were sampled. Each participant took a linking block made up of 17 exercises from the main assessment, and three special advanced blocks: one in biology, one in chemistry, and one in physics. Each of the advanced blocks contained seven multiplechoice and nine constructed-response items.\n\n52\n79\n\n\f2.5.7 Questionnaires\nAs part of the national assessment (as well as the State Assessment), a series of questionnaires was administered to students, teachers, and school administrators. Similar to the development of the cognitive items, the development of the policy issues and questionnaire items was a consensual process that involved staff work, field testing, and review by external advisory groups. A Background Questionnaire Committee drafted a set of policy issues and made recommendations regarding the design of the items. They were particularly interested in capitalizing on the unique properties of NAEP and not duplicating other surveys (e.g., the National Survey of Public and Private School Teachers and Administrators, the School and Staffing Study, and the National Educational Longitudinal Study). The policy issues, items, and field test results were reviewed by the group of external consultants who identified specific items to be included in the final questionnaires. In addition, the Science Instrument Development Committee and state representatives were consulted on the appropriateness of issues addressed in the questionnaires as they relate to science instruction and performance. The items underwent internal ETS review procedures to ensure fairness and quality and were then assembled into questionnaires. The questionnaires were then submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval.\nStudent Questionnaires\nIn addition to three blocks of cognitive items, each booklet in the assessment included three student questionnaires. Two of these were sets of general and science background questionnaires designed to gather contextual information about students, their instructional experiences in science, and their attitudes toward science. The third questionnaire was given to students at the end of each booklet to determine students' motivation in completing the assessment and their familiarity with assessment tasks.\nThe Student Demographics (common background) Questionnaire included questions about race/ethnicity, mother's and father's level of education, types of reading materials in the home, and school attendance.\nThe Science Background Questionnaire included questions that addressed the following.\nAttitudes Towards Sciences: Students were asked a series of questions about their attitudes and perceptions about science.\nTime Spent Studying Science: Students were asked to describe both the amount of\ninstruction they received in science and the time spent on science homework.\nInstructional Practices: Students were asked to report their instructional experiences related to science in the classroom, including group work, special projects, and writing in response to science. In addition, they were asked about the instructional practices of their\nscience teachers.\nThe Student Motivation Questionnaire asked students how many questions they thought they got right on the NAEP science assessment, how difficult they found it, how hard they tried, how important it was for them to do well, and how often they wrote long answers on tests or assignments for science.\n\n8 0\n\n53\n\n\fTeacher, School, and SD/LEP Student Questionnaires\nTo supplement the information on instruction reported by students, the science teachers of the students participating in the assessment were asked to complete a questionnaire that addressed teachers' background and general training as well as their science preparation and information concerning science instruction.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire, Part I: Background and General Training included questions about gender, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience, certification, degrees, major and minor fields of study, course work in education, course work in specific subject areas, amount of in-service training, professional development activities, and availability of resources for their classroom.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire, Part II: Science Preparation and Science Instructional Information included questions on the number and types of science courses taken over the past two years, membership in science organizations, frequency of instructional activities such as asking students to prepare a written science report or an oral science report, emphasis on objectives such as developing science problem-solving skills, methods used to assess student progress in science, and ability level of students in class.\nA School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire was given to the principal of each school that participated in the assessment program. This questionnaire asked about background and characteristics of school principals, length of school day and year, school enrollment, absenteeism, dropout rates, size and composition of teaching staff, policies about grouping students, curriculum, testing practices and uses, special priorities and school-wide programs, availability of resources, special services, community services, policies for parental involvement, and school-wide problems.\nThe SD/LEP Student Questionnaire was completed by the teachers of those students who were selected to participate in the assessment sample and were identified as students with a disability (SD) or were categorized as being of limited English proficiency (LEP). Some of these students were determined by the school to be ineligible to be assessed. In order to be excluded from the assessment, a student must have been identified as SD and must not have been mainstreamed at least 50 percent of the time, or was categorized as LEP. In addition, the school staff would have needed to determine that it was inappropriate to include these students in the assessment. This questionnaire asked about the nature of the student's disability or about the students' native language, and the special programs in which the student participated.\n\n54\n\n81\n\n\fChapter 3\nSAMPLE DESIGN1\nLeslie Wallace and Keith F. Rust Westat, Inc.\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe samples for the 1996 NAEP assessment were selected using a complex multistage sample design involving the sampling of students from selected schools within 94 selected geographic areas, called primary sampling units (PSUs), across the United States.\nThe long-term trend sample design had four steps in the selection process and the main sample design had five steps in the selection process:\n1. selection of geographic PSUs (counties or groups of counties), 2. selection of schools within PSUs, 3. assignment of sample type to schools (main samples only), 4. assignment of session types to schools, and 5. selection of students for session types within schools.\nThe samples were drawn for the three different age classes,2 and for each age class the samples were of two distinct types. The first type consisted of the cross-sectional or \"main\" samples, while the second type consisted of the long-term trend samples. The populations surveyed with each of these sample types are defined in Table 1-1 in Chapter 1. Separate samples of schools were required forthe long-term trend samples and main samples, because of various differences in the calendar period for test administration, the format of the administration, the fact that the trend samples include age-based samples, whereas main samples do not and, in the case of age class 17, the grade definition of the population of interest. (See the description of Table 1-1 in Chapter 1.)\nIn addition to representing the respective populations as a whole, for the main samples there was oversampling of nonpublic schools, and of public schools with moderate or high enrollment of Black or Hispanic students (see Section 3.3). This oversampling was undertaken to increase the sample sizes of nonpublic-school students and minority students, so as to increase the reliability of estimates for these groups of students. These oversampling rates have been used in the past several rounds of NAEP. The oversampling rates were based on experience, after attempting to report results for these groups in assessments where no oversampling was used.\nI Ralph Di Gaetano, Keith F. Rust, and Leslie Wallace were responsible for the design and implementation of the sampling process for the 1996 NAEP assessments. 2 The term \"age class\" is used in this report when it is appropriate to discuss one of the three student cohorts in a general way (not necessarily in reference to a specific sample). For the 1996 assessment, age class 9 refers to age 9 or grade 4 long-term trend, or grade 4 main sample students; age class 13 refers to age 13 or grade 8 long-termtrend, or grade 8 main sample students; and age class 17 refers to age 17 or grade 11 long-term trend, or grade 12 main sample students.\n55\n\n\fThe overall assessment period fell into three time periodsfall, winter, and spring. Not all\nassessment components were conducted in each time period. Table 3-1 shows therelationship between the various sample components and the assessment periods. The sizes of the PSU and school samples and the procedures for their selection were determined by the assessment period, as well as by the population\nto be surveyed and the method of administration in each case.\n\nTable 3-1 Assessment Type by Age Class and Assessment Period\n\nAge Class/Assessment\n\nFall\n\nWinter\n\n9 Main Long-Term Trend\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96 1/3/96 3/8/96\n\n13 Main Long-Term Trend\n\n10/9/95 - 12/22/95\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n\n17 Main Long-Term Trend\n\n1/3/96 - 3/29/96\n\nSpring\n^\n3/11/96 - 5/10/96\n\nSpecial trend samples were required because:\nThe long-term trend samples had different school and student eligibility requirements than the main samples. Both grade- and age-eligible students were targeted in long-term trend, and only grade-eligible students were targeted in the main samples. This meant that schools with any of several grades were eligible for long-term trend (grades 2 to 6 for age class 9, grades 6 to 9 for age class 13, and grades 9 to 12 for age class 17), while only schools with grades 4, 8, or 12 were\neligible for the main samples.\nThe conditions for administration of the assessment varied considerably between the main sample and long-term trend sample sessions.\nThe need in the long-term trend samples for four distinct session types for age class 9 and 13 and three for age class 17, together with the need for up to six distinct session types for the main samples, made it not feasible to conduct both main sample sessions and long-term trend sessions in a given school. For long-term trend, the session types were spiral booklets 51-56 and tape booklets 91-93 for ages 9 and 13, and spiral booklets 51-56 and tape booklets 84-85 for age 17. For the main samples, the session types were mathematics, science, mathematics estimation, and mathematics theme at all grades (4, 8, and 12), advanced mathematics at grades 8 and 12, and advanced science at grade 12.\nFor age classes 13 and 17, the main sample administrations were conducted in the winter; while the long-term trend sample administrations were conducted in the fall\n\n56\n83\n\n\fand spring respectively. The fall and spring administration periods match\nadministration periods used in NAEP as far back as 1969-71.\nThis chapter gives details of the sample selection procedure, and information on the results of the sampling process. Further details are given in the report The 1996 NAEP Sampling and Weighting Report (Wallace & Rust, 1999).\n\n3.2 PRIMARY SAMYLING UNITS\nIn the first stage of sampling, the United States (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) was divided into geographic primary sampling units (PSUs). The PSUs are those that were used beginning in 1994 and incorporate 1990 U.S. Census information. With a few exceptions, each PSU met a minimum size requirement (a 1990 U.S. Census population of at least 60,000 in the Northeast and Southeast and 45,000 in the Central and West regions) and comprised either a consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA), a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), a single county, or (more likely in the case of nonMSA PSUs) a group of contiguous counties. In the case of New England MSAs, which are not formed from whole counties, the corresponding New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs), which are defined in terms of whole counties, were designated as PSUs. The PSUs were designed to serve as the PSUs for NAEP samples from 1994 until 2002. Thus 1990 total population was used as a size measure, rather than 1990 school age population, as this was considered likely to correlate more highly with school age population over this period. Each PSU was contained entirely within one of the four NAEP regions defined in Table 3-2. These NAEP regions were used to stratify the PSUs, ensuring that each region was adequately represented in the various assessment samples.\n\nTable 3-2 Geographic Regions Used for Stratification\n\nNortheast\n\nSoutheast\n\nCentral\n\nWest\n\nConnecticut Delaware District of Columbia Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia'\n\nAlabama Arkansas Florida Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee Virginia' West Virginia\n\nIllinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North Dakota Ohio South Dakota Wisconsin\n\nAlaska Arizona California Colorado Hawaii Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Oregon Texas Utah Washington Wyoming\n\nThat part of Virginia that is part of the Washington, DC-MD-VA metropolitan statistical area at the time of the 1990 Census, is included in the Northeast region; the remainder of the state is included in the Southeast region.\n\n57\n8 4\n\n\fIn a few cases an MSA crossed region boundaries. Such MSAs were split into two or more PSUs as necessary (e.g., the Cincinnati OH-KY-IN MSA was split into the Cincinnati OH-IN PSU in the Central region and the Cincinnati KY PSU in the Southeast). Ninety-four PSUs were selected for the main samples and 52 PSUs were selected for the long-term trend samples, as described below.\nFor the main samples, the 22 largest PSUs were included with certainty. The inclusion of these PSUs in the sample with certainty provided an approximately optimum, cost-efficient sample of schools and students when samples were drawn within them at the required national sampling rate. The 22 largest PSUs by region were:\n\n22 Largest PSUs by Region\n\nNortheast: > Baltimore, MD MSA > Boston-Lawrence-Salem-Lowell-\nBrockton, MA NECMA > New York-Northern New Jersey-Long\nIsland, NY-NJ CMSA (excluding that part in CT)\n> Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton,\nPA-NJ-DE-MD CMSA\n> Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, PA CMSA > Washington, DC-MD-VA MSA\nSoutheast: > Atlanta, GA MSA > Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FL CMSA > Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL\nMSA\n\nCentral: > Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN-WI CMSA > Cleveland-Akron, OH CMSA > Detroit-Ann Arbor, MI CMSA > Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN-WI MSA > St. Louis, MO-IL MSA\nWest: > Dallas-Fort Worth, TX CMSA > Denver-Boulder, CO CMSA > Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, TX CMSA > Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside, CA CMSA > Phoenix, AZ MSA > San Diego, CA MSA > San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, CA CMSA > Seattle-Tacoma, WA CMSA\n\nThe remaining smaller PSUs were not guaranteed to be selected for the sample. These were grouped into a number of noncertainty strata (so called because the PSUs in these strata were not included in the sample with certainty), and one PSU was selected from each stratum. The PSUs were classified into four regions, each containing about one-fourth of the U.S. population. These regions were defined primarily by state (Table 3-2). In each region, noncertainty PSUs were classified as MSA (metropolitan) or nonMSA (nonmetropolitan) according to 1990 definitions. The resulting major strata are shown in Table 3-3.\n\nRegion\nNortheast Southeast Central West Total\n\nTable 3-3 The Sampling Major Strata and the Number of Noncertainty Strata in Each\n\nNumber of Strata for MSA PSUs\n\nNumber of Strata for NonMSA PSUs\n\n6\n\n4\n\n12\n\n12\n\n8\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n36\n\n36\n\nTotal Strata\n10 24 20 18 72\n\n58\n\n\fWithin each major stratum, further stratification was achieved by ordering the noncertainty PSUs according to several additional socioeconomic characteristics, yielding 72 strata. The number of such strata formed within each major stratum is shown in Table 3-3. The strata were defined so that the aggregate of the measures of size of the PSUs in a stratum was approximately equal for each stratum. The size measure used was the population from the 1990 Census. The characteristics used to define strata were the percent minority population, the percentage change in total population since 1980, the per capita income, the percent of persons age 25 or over with college degrees, the percent of persons age 25 or over who completed high school, and the civilian unemployment rate. Up to four of these characteristics were used in any one major stratum. For each major stratum, the characteristics used were chosen by modeling PSU-level mean reading proficiency scores for 1988, 1990, and 1992. The characteristics chosen were the best predictors of PSU-level mean reading proficiency scores in these models. One PSU was selected with probability proportional to size from each of the 72 noncertainty strata. That is, within each stratum, a PSU's probability of being selected was proportional to its population. The PSUs were selected with probability proportional to size (PPS) with the twin aims of obtaining approximately self-weighting samples of students, and having approximately equal workloads in each PSU.\nSamples of 94 PSUs each were drawn for the 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 main samples simultaneously. They were drawn to minimize overlap of the PSUs from one assessment to the next, except that certainty PSUs were retained in each assessment year, and some of the larger noncertainty PSUs are in the sample for more than one of these assessment years. Each main sample of 94 PSUs was drawn from a population of about 1,000 PSUs. Primarily because of the use of MSAs as PSUs, PSUs varied considerably as to their probability of selection, since they varied greatly in size. In 1996, the 36 selected noncertainty MSA PSUs had probabilities of selection ranging from 0.04 to 0.58, while the 36 selected nonMSA PSUs had probabilities ranging from 0.03 to 0.08. Parts of 43 states were included in the main sample PSUs.\nFor the long-term trend samples, 52 PSUs were selected. The long-term trend samples were much smaller than the main samples and used separate field staff. Fewer PSUs were used for the long-term trend samples to avoid having the sample spread too thinly across PSUs. The long-term trend PSUs were drawn for 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 to minimize overlap of the trend PSUs from one assessment to the next, and to minimize overlap between trend and main samples within the same assessment.\nThe 10 largest main sample certainty PSUs were also included with certainty in the long-term trend samples. Six additional PSUs were selected systematically and with probability proportional to the 1990 population from the 12 remaining main sample certainties. Finally, 36 PSUs were selected from the 72 noncertainty strata so that the overall procedure was equivalent to systematic sampling with probabilities proportional to the 1990 population. The 72 noncertainty strata from the main sample design were paired, and one PSU per pair was selected for the trend samples. Note that the noncertainty long-term trend PSUs are not a subsample of the noncertainty main sample PSUs, in order to minimize the burden on a given school district in any one year.\n3.3 SELECTION OF SCHOOLS\nIn the second stage of sampling, the public schools (including Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools and Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools) and nonpublic schools (including Catholic schools) were listed according to the grade ranges associated with the three age classes. The lists of schools were obtained from two sources. Regular public, BIA, and DoDEA schools were obtained from the 1994 list of schools maintained by Quality Education Data, Inc. (QED). Regular public schools are_schools with students who are classified as being in a specific grade (as opposed to\n59\n86\n\n\fschools having only \"ungraded\" classrooms). This includes statewide magnet schools and charter schools. Catholic and other nonpublic schools were obtained from both QED and the Private School Survey (PSS) developed for the National Cenier for Education Statistics' 1993-1994 School and Staffing Survey. The majority of the PSS list comes from complete enumeration of schools, but a small portion of the PSS list was restricted to a sample of counties selected for the survey. Certain PSS counties,\ngenerally large in population, were also included, independently by chance, in the NAEP sample PSUs. The schools from such counties were added to the NAEP sampling frame after steps were taken to eliminate duplicates with the QED list of nonpublic schools. In previous years, nonpublic schools were also obtained from telephone directories. This process was not repeated in 1996 because the use of the PSS files supplanted the need for this supplement.\n\nTable 3-4 shows the numbers of schools included in the various sampling frame components. The population of eligible schools for each age class was restricted to the selected PSUs. Main sample\nschools were selected from the 94 main sample PSUs and long-term trend schools were selected from the 52 long-term trend PSUs. Note that there are relatively large numbers of nonpublic schools that are listed in the QED or PSS only. The discrepancy between the schools contained in the PSS dataset versus those in the QED dataset is primarily due to two factors: (1) the relative outdatedness of the two school lists, and (2) PSS's inclusion of a special area supplement designed to find schools not normally available on lists.\n\nTable 3-4 Grade Definition of School Eligibility for Sampling Frame Inclusion\nand Frame Sizes, Main and Long-Term Trend Samples1\n\nSample'\n\nSampling Frame Included Schools\nWith Any of Grades\n\nPublic3\n\nNonpublic Nonpublic Nonpublic\n\nfrom QED from PSS from QED\n\nOnly4\n\nOnly4\n\nand PSS4\n\nMain Samples\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\n4\n\n18,046\n\n1,308\n\n1,716\n\n7,300\n\n8\n\n6,093\n\n1,029\n\n1,322\n\n6,409\n\n12\n\n4,357\n\n578\n\n869\n\n2,474\n\nLong-Term Trend Samples\n\nAge Class 9\n\n2 5\n\nAge Class 13\n\n6 9\n\nAge Class 17\n\n9 12\n\n15,873 13,667 3,495\n\n1,147 1,089\n491\n\n1,600 1,474\n829\n\n6,019 6,592 2,106\n\niThe numbers in this table reflect the full samples, including all sample types (see Section 3.4). 2 Age Class\" is a term that refers to either an age or a grade definition of the samples. For the 1996 main assessments, unlike for previous main assessments, only grade samples were drawn. Long-term trend age class definitions vary by subject area. They are explained more fully in Chapters 14 through 17.\n3 Public, B1A, and DoDEA schools\n4 Catholic and other nonpublic schools\n\nAny school having one or more of the eligible grades, and located within an appropriate PSU, was included in the sampling frame of schools (the list of schools from which the samples of schools\nwere drawn) for a given sample. For each age class in the long-term trend samples, only a fraction of one percent of age-eligible students was enrolled in ineligible schools. An independent sample of schools was selected for each of the age classes, separately for main and long-term trend. Thus, some schools were selected for assessment of two age classes, and a few were selected for all three. For all three age classes, a sample of schools was first drawn for the long-term trend assessments. The schools selected for\n\n60\n87\n\n\flong-term trend at a particular age class were excluded from the sampling frame when the samples of schools for the corresponding grade were drawn for the main assessments. In addition, the schools selected for the 1996 NAEP State Assessment program at grade 8 were excluded from the sampling frame for the main samples at that grade. In regard to both of these situations, adjustments were made to the sampling weights to reflect the appropriate probabilities of selection to yield unbiased estimates for both long-term trend and main samples.\nFor each NAEP sample, schools were selected (without replacement) across all PSUs with probabilities proportional to assigned measures of size. In those certainty PSUs included in both main and trend samples, the probability of selection for long-term trend for any school in a given age class was capped at 0.5, to ensure that adequate schools remained to be selected for the main sample. For long-term trend samples, the measure of size used for each school was the estimated number of age eligible students in the school, since for each age class the large majority of students selected were assigned to sessions for which only students of the appropriate age were eligible. In most schools having the modal grade, some additional students were selected who were in the modal grade but not age-eligible, so that the maximum sample size of students within a school was about 80 grade- and age-eligible students. Equal measures of size were assigned to schools containing estimates of age-eligible students ranging from 20 to 60 for each age class. Schools with more than 60 age-eligible students were selected with probabilities proportional to the measure of size. Schools with fewer than 20 estimated age-eligible students were assigned somewhat lower measures of size, and thus lower probabilities of selection, since assessment in these schools involved substantially higher per-student administrative costs.\nFor the main samples, equal measures of size were assigned to schools containing estimates of grade-eligible students ranging from 20 to 120 (for grade 4), 20 to 150 (for grade 8), or 20 to 180 (for grade 12). Schools larger than the indicated maximum size were selected with probabilities proportional to the measure of size. This procedure was used so as to obtain approximately selfweighting samples of students (i.e., students selected with approximately equal overall probabilities) at each grade. Three variations to the overall goal of self-weighting samples were implemented. Schools with fewer than 20 estimated grade-eligible students were assigned somewhat lower measures of size, and thus lower probabilities of selection. This was designed to increase cost efficiency. Each public school designated as high-minority (with over 10 percent Black and/or Hispanic enrollment for grades 4 and.8, or over 15 percent Black and/or Hispanic enrollment for grade 12) was given double the probability of selection of a public school, not designated high-minority, of similar size in the same PSU. Such high-minority schools were oversampled in order to enlarge the sample of Black and Hispanic students, thereby enhancing the reliability of estimates for these groups. For a given overall size of sample, this procedure reduces somewhat the reliability of estimates for all students as a whole and for those not Black or Hispanic. Each nonpublic school was given triple the probability of selection of a public school not designated high-minority of similar size in the same PSU. These greater probabilities of selection were used to ensure adequate samples of nonpublic-school students in order to allow the derivation of reliable estimates for such students. No subgroups (high minority schools or nonpublic schools) were oversampled in the long-term trend samples.\nThe total number of schools selected for each age class in both the long-term trend and main samples was such that the predesignated student sample sizes would be achieved by selecting all eligible students in a selected school, up to the maximum sizes indicated above. The target sample size also allowed for losses due to nonparticipation of selected schools and students and the exclusion of students from the assessment. This design, with the important exceptions described above, had the goal of yielding a sample of students in a given age class or grade with approximately uniform probabilities of selection. The efforts to oversample nonpublic-school students and minority students in the main samples and the practical constraints on the sample size within each school resulted in some substantial violations\n\n8 3\n\n61\n\n\fof this general goal. The distributions of selection probabilities of the selected students, as reflected in their sampling weights, are mentioned in Chapter 10.\nThe QED files do not contain schools that opened between 1994 and the time of the assessments. Therefore, special procedures were implemented to be sure that the NAEP assessment represented students in new public schools. Small school districts, which generally contained only one eligible school for a given age class, were handled differently from large school districts, which generally contained more than one eligible school for a given age class. In small school districts, the schools selected for a given age class were thought to contain all students in the district that were eligible for the assessment. Districts containing such schools in the school sample were asked if other schools with the appropriate grades for the assessment existed, and if so, they were automatically included in the assessment. For large school districts, a district-level sampling frame was constructed from the schools on the QED file that were eligible for one of the national assessments. Then districts were sampled systematically with probabilities proportional to a measure of size. In most cases, the measure of size was total district enrollment, but a minimum measure of size was used in districts below a certain cutoff. Each sampled district was asked to update lists of eligible schools according to information on the QED files. Sampling frames of eligible new schools for these large districts were then constructed separately for both main and long-term trend samples at each age class, and separate samples of new schools were selected systematically with probability proportional to eligible enrollment using the same sampling rates as for the original sample. Seven new schools were added to the main samples: two at grade 4, three at grade 8, and two at grade 12. Four new schools were added to the long-term trend samples: one at age class 9, three at age class 13, and none at age class 17. Although new school sampling procedures were applied at age class 17, no new schools were selected since schools with the necessary characteristics were not available. All new schools added to the sample were obtained from large districts.\nIn a few PSUs where school refusals were relatively heavy for a particular sample, substitute school selections were made, replacing the refusals (to the extent feasible) with schools from within the same PSU and similar in size, affiliation (public, Catholic, or other nonpublic), grade span, and minority composition. The goal of this procedure was to maintain the student sample sizes needed, while keeping variance and nonresponse bias at acceptable levels. For the main samples, 31 substitute schools were selected using this procedure (10 at grades 4 and 8, and 11 at grade 12), and 28 substitute schools were selected for the long-term trend samples (15 at age class 9, 7 at age class 13, and 6 at age class 17). Tables 3-5 and 3-6 show the number of in-scope schools selected, cooperating, and substituted, in the main and long-term trend samples, respectively. The participation rates given are based on the original sample of schools (excluding substitutes). School participation rates for grade 8 and nonpublic schools in the main samples appear lower compared to those achieved in 1994, while the rates for public schools appear higher. The other response rates are comparable for the two years. Note that since the response rates quoted do not include the substitute selections, the potential for nonresponse bias is likely to be a little less than these rates would indicate. This is because the substitute selections were chosen based on their similarity to the initially refusing selections.\nFor the main samples, the schools that were participating with no eligible students left for testing had all of their eligible students tested for State NAEP, so that no students were left for the main samples. These schools were accounted for by treating them as nonrespondents for weighting. For longterm trend at age class 13, the considerable numbers of schools selected with no eligible students enrolled resulted primarily from the fact that some schools with grades 6, 7, or 9, but no grade 8, were sampled. Such schools had a reasonable chance of containing some age 13 students. Often they did have a number of eligible students, but sometimes they had none. Because of the grade structure of schools, this occurred most often for age class 13.\n62\n8 9\n\n\fTable 3-5 School Sample Sizes, Refusals, and Substitutes for the Main Samples'\n\nStatus\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12 Total Public2 Nonpublic3\n\nSelected, in scope Refusals Participation rate of originally selected schools 1994 participation rate Participating, no eligible students enrolled Participating, no eligible students left for testing4 Substitutes participating Final assessed sample\n\n723 99\n86% 86%\n0\n20\n1\n605\n\n761 127\n83% 86%\n0\n42\n1\n593\n\n779 160\n79% 79%\n1\n27 2\n593\n\n2,263 386\n83% 83%\n1\n89 4 1,791\n\n1,392 212\n85% 82%\n0\n30 4 1,154\n\n871 174\n80% 85%\n1\n59 0 637\n\n1 The numbers in this table reflect the full samples, consisting of schools in the S 1, S2, and S3 samples.

These sample types are described in Section 3.4.\n\n3.4 ASSIGNMENT OF SAMPLE TYPE TO SCHOOLS\nIn order to determine the effect of using different criteria for including students with disabilities and limited English proficient students in the assessment, three different sample types were assigned to the schools selected for the main assessment. In sample type 1 (S1) schools, the inclusion criteria for the main samples were identical to those used.in 1990 and 1992 and were intended to be somewhat more rigorously defined than those used in the long-term trend samples. In sample type 2 (S2) schools, new 1996 inclusion criteria were used. In sample type 3 (S3) schools, the new 1996 inclusion criteria were used and accommodations were offered to students with disabilities (SD) and students of limited English proficiency (LEP). For more details of the inclusion criteria and their implementation, and the accommodations offered students, see Chapter 5. The information in this chapter and in Chapter 5 applies to all three sample types or subsamples.\n\n9 0 63\n\n\fSample type was assigned to schools separately for each grade. For schools that were not also selected for the State Assessment program, sample type was assigned as follows. At grade 4, 20 percent of the schools were assigned sample type 1, 45 percent were assigned sample type 2, and 35 percent were assigned sample type 3. At grade 8, one-sixth of the schools were assigned sample type 1, and fivetwelfths each were assigned sample types 2 and 3. At grade 12, two-thirteenths of the schools were assigned sample type 1, six-thirteenths were assigned sample type 2, and five-thirteenths were assigned sample type 3. Sample type was assigned so that a variety of schools with respect to region, school type, urbanization, and size were in each sample type at each grade.\nFor schools selected for both the main samples and State Assessment program, sample type was initially assigned as described above, and then reassigned for the main samples as follows. Schools retained their initial sample type assignment for the State Assessment. For the national assessment, schools were ultimately assigned the same sample type as for the State Assessment, with one exception. Schools that were initially assigned to sample type 3 for the national assessment and sample type 2 for the State Assessment, retained these different respective sample types for each assessment. For all other schools, the sample type for the main samples was switched to match the state sample type. The effect of this procedure was to assign sample type 1 to somewhat more schools and sample types 2 and 3 to somewhat fewer schools at grades 4 and 8 than initially assigned.\n3.5 ASSIGNMENT OF SESSIONS TO SCHOOLS\nSessions were assigned to the selected schools found to be in-scope at the time of session assignment in the following manner. First, the number of sessions per school was established (three sessions per school were specified for the long-term trend samples and for sample type 1 for the main samples. Five sessions per school were specified for sample types 2 and 3 for the main samples at grades 4 and 8, and six sessions per school were specified for sample types 2 and 3 for the main samples at grade 12). This was the maximum number of sessions that could be administered without creating unduly small session sizes with few eligible students. Thus, in most long-term trend schools, for example, three sessions were conducted. However, schools with fewer than 20 eligible students were asked to conduct only a single session.\nSession types associated with each sample are listed in Table 3-7. In the main samples, four to six different session types were conducted at each grade (mathematics, science, mathematics estimation, and mathematics theme at all grades; advanced mathematics at grades 8 and 12; and advanced science at grade 12). All of the session types were not offered for all samples. For long-term trend, four session types were conducted at age classes 9 and 13 (spiral plus three tape sessions), and three session types were conducted at age class 17 (spiral plus two tape sessions). Schools could be assigned multiple sessions of the same type (for example, two spiral and one tape sessions in long-term trend, or three mathematics and three science sessions in the main samples).\nSessions were assigned to schools with three aims in mind. The first was to distribute students to the different session types across the whole sample for each age class so that the target numbers of assessed students would be achieved (in each sample type separately in the main assessments). The second was to maximize the number of different session types that were administered within a given selected school, without violating the minimum session sizes discussed above. The third was to.give each student an equal chance of being selected for a given session type regardless of the number of sessions conducted in the school.\n64\n)k 91\n\n\f3.6 SAWLING STUDENTS\nTo facilitate the sampling of students, a consolidated list was prepared for each school of all grade-eligible and age-eligible students (for long-term trend) or all grade-eligible students (for the main assessments) for the age class for which the school was selected. A systematic selection of eligible students was made from this list (unless all students were to be assessed) to provide the target sample size. For schools assigned more than a single session type (the vast majority), students were assigned by Westat district supervisors to one of the various session types using specified procedures.\nFor each age class, separately for the long-term trend and main samples, maxima were established as to the number of students who would be selected for a given school. In those schools that, according to information on the sampling frame, had fewer eligible students than the established maxima, each eligible student enrolled at the school was selected in the sample for one of the sessions assigned to the school. In other schools, a sample of students was drawn, and then students were assigned to sessions as appropriate. For the main samples, the maximum sample sizes were established by sample type in terms of the number of grade-eligible students: 72 at grades 4 and 8, and 90 at grade 12 for sample type 1; 120 at grade 4, 160 at grade 8, and 180 at grade 12 for sample types 2 and 3. For the long-term trend samples, the maximum at each age class was 60 age-eligible students (about 80 grade- plus age-eligible students in most schools). Note that the number of students actually selected for assessment in a longterm trend sample school generally fell somewhat below 80, because students who were selected for one of the long-term trend tape-administered sessions and were in the modal grade but not age-eligible were subsequently dropped from the sample. Similarly, in the main assessments, at grades 8 and 12 in sample types 2 and 3, students selected for the advanced mathematics and advanced science assessments, who were subsequently found to be ineligible on the basis of their courses taken, were dropped from the samples. This reduced the sample size somewhat in these schools.\nThe sample of students to be selected in each school was derived in the following manner, both for main and for long-term trend samples. On the basis of data obtained from the school characteristics and policies questionnaire (or the sample frame when the questionnaire data were not obtained in time) an estimate of the number of eligible students was established for each school. For the main samples, the estimated number of grade-eligible students was used; for the long-term trend samples, the number of age-eligible students was used. A Session Assignment Form was generated for each school, showing the line numbers (described below) of the students to be selected, indicating the type of session to be taken by each such student. These line numbers were generated using a sampling interval designed to give the appropriate sample size for each school. Thus, the overall sampling interval was 1.0 for schools in which all eligible students were to be assessed. The appropriate sampling interval was specified for schools with larger numbers of eligible students, such as to give the appropriate maximum sample size (described above for each age class) in the case that the school had an enrollment of eligible students exactly equal to that predicted.\nIf the Westat supervisor found that, when applied to the numbered list of eligible students assembled in the field for each school, the line numbers generated gave rise to a sample in excess of 120 percent of the appropriate maximum sample size limit specified above, he or she called Westat's central office. By use of a personal computer, new line numbers based on the actual number of eligible students were generated and relayed to the supervisor. A similar revision to the line numbers was made in the case of a school with a sampling interval in excess of 1.0, and eligible enrollment less than 80 percent of that initially estimated. In this latter case, the sample size was increased to the appropriate level. This procedure gave a suitable compromise between control over the sampling rate within each school and operational autonomy and flexibility for Westat field supervisors. Note that in all cases, sampling\n9 2\n65\n\n\fintervals were generated in Westat's central office, and stored for use in sample weighting. Supervisors were not required to derive or record within-school sampling rates.\nTable 3-7 shows the number of students per school who were assessed for each assessment. Note that, for the various print samples, the number of students assessed per item per school is quite low, even though typically dozens of students were assessed in total in a particular school. Thus, the extent of clustering of the sample is in general quite modest, because most sampled schools conducted a few different assessments with a moderate number of students in each, and more importantly because the use of BIB-spiraling in the print-administered sessions greatly alleviated the effects of clustering the samples of students within schools, for item-level data.\n\nTable 3-7 Number of Students Per School for Each Session Type'\n\nSample\n\nSession Type\n\nNumber of\nAssessed Students\n\nNumber of\nSchools\n\nMean Number of Students Per Assessment Per School\n\nMean Number of Students Per Item Per\nSchool\n\nAge Class 9 Long-Term Trend\n\nPrint Booklets 51-56 Tape Booklet 91 Tape Booklet 92 Tape Booklet 93\n\n5,019\n\n215\n\n23.3\n\n3.9 7.82\n\n1,852\n\n127\n\n14.6\n\n14.6\n\n1,721\n\n116\n\n14.8\n\n14.8\n\n1,840\n\n125\n\n14.7\n\n14.7\n\nGrade 4\n\nPrint Mathematics\n\n10,830\n\n445\n\n24.3\n\n5.6\n\nMain\n\nPrint Science\n\n11,578\n\n421\n\n27.5\n\n4.5 - 7.42\n\nTape Mathematics Estimation\n\n2,115\n\n120\n\n17.6\n\n17.6\n\nPrint Mathematics Theme\n\n4,004\n\n230\n\n17.4\n\n8.7\n\nAge Class 13 Long-Term Trend\n\nPrint Booklets 51-56 Tape Booklet 91 Tape Booklet 92 Tape Booklet 93\n\n5,493\n\n221\n\n24.9\n\n4.1 - 8.32\n\n1,928\n\n128\n\n15.1\n\n15.1\n\n1,866\n\n125\n\n14.9\n\n14.9\n\n1,864\n\n124\n\n15.0\n\n15.0\n\nGrade 8\n\nPrint Mathematics\n\n11,521\n\n411\n\n28.0\n\n6.5\n\nMain\n\nPrint Science\n\n11,971\n\n346\n\n34.6\n\n5.6 - 9.42\n\nTape Mathematics Estimation\n\n2,244\n\n104\n\n21.6\n\n21.6\n\nPrint Mathematics Theme\n\n4,227\n\n175\n\n24.2\n\n12.1\n\nPrint Advanced Mathematics\n\n2,365\n\n253\n\n9.3\n\n9.3\n\nAge Class 17 Long-Term Trend\n\nPrint Booklets 51-56 Tape Booklet 84 Tape Booklet 85\n\n4,669\n\n186\n\n25.1\n\n4.2 - 8.42\n\n1,848\n\n133\n\n13.9\n\n13.9\n\n1,691\n\n122\n\n13.9\n\n13.9\n\nGrade 12\n\nPrint Mathematics\n\n10,660\n\n430\n\n24.8\n\n5.7\n\nMain\n\nPrint Science\n\n11,481\n\n401\n\n28.6\n\n4.6 - 7.72\n\nTape Mathematics Estimation\n\n1,889\n\n96\n\n19.7\n\n19.7\n\nPrint Mathematics Theme\n\n3,860\n\n196\n\n19.7\n\n9.8\n\nPrint Advanced Mathematics\n\n2,965\n\n207\n\n14.3\n\n14.3\n\nPrint Advanced Science\n\n2,431\n\n222\n\n11.0\n\n11.0\n\nThe numbers in this table reflect the full samples, consisting of schools in the SI, S2, and S3 samples.

The inclusion procedure used in sample type 1 differed somewhat from that used in sample types 2 and 3. SD/LEP students in sample type 3 were offered accommodations not available to other students or to SD/LEP students in other sample types.\nAs a measure to ensure an adequate sample size of SD/LEP students from both sample types 2 and 3, oversampling procedures were applied for SD/LEP students at all three grades, in sample types 2 and 3 for mathematics, and in sample type 3 for science. In this way, comparisons of the effect of offering accommodations to students would have enhanced power to detect effects.\nThe procedure for carrying out the oversampling was somewhat different for grade 4 than for grades 8 and 12. This was because of the presence of the advanced mathematics and advanced science samples at grades 8 and 12 only, which offered an opportunity to oversample in a way not possible at grade 4. The general intent of the oversampling was, within each school assigned sessions of regular mathematics in sample types 2 and 3, and regular science in sample type 3, to select SD/LEP students for these assessments at twice the rate at which non SD/LEP students were sampled (or to include all 'SD/LEP students if there were not sufficient numbers to permit sampling at twice the rate). There was no oversampling of schools as part of the procedure.\nAt grade 4, the procedure was as follows. In each school where oversampling was to occur, the initial desired sample of students was drawn for each session assigned, from the full list of eligible students. Among those students not selected for any sessions in this way, the SD/LEP students were identified. A sample from among these was drawn, using a sampling rate that would achieve the double sampling rate required overall. In most cases, this involved selecting all such SD/LEP students in the school. If the school was a sample type 3 school assigned to assess both mathematics and science, the extra SD/LEP students so selected were split among mathematics and science in the same proportion as the initial student sample for the school. Thus, if the school was assigned two sessions of science and one of mathematics, two-thirds of these extra SD/LEP students were assigned to.science, and one-third to mathematics.\nThe sampling of additional SD/LEP students was carried out using designated line numbers, indicated on the session assignment form used to generate the samples of students in each school. In this way, the necessary information as to the selection probability of each student was retained for use in weighting. No reliance was placed on information generated in the field. Field supervisors had only to follow the prespecified sampling instructions.\nAt grades 8 and 12, a different approach was taken. As a result of the pattern of assigning sessions to schools, it was the case that in every school in which there were students remaining who were not selected for assessment in the initial sampling phase (so that there were in fact SD/LEP students available for oversampling), a session of either advanced mathematics, or advanced science (at grade 12), was assigned. This was the result of the scheme for assigning sessions to schools efficiently; it was not a condition imposed in order to facilitate oversampling. The SD/LEP students assigned as an oversample for the regular mathematics and (in the case of sample type 3) science assessments were those SD/LEP students who were initially selected for the advanced mathematics and science samples, but who were not eligible for those assessments because they had not taken the appropriate set of courses. Thus, for grades 8 and 12, the oversampling of-SD/LEP students took place only among that subpopulation that was not eligible for the advanced assessments.\n\n9 4\n\n67\n\n\fIt was assumed that there would be relatively few SD/LEP students who would qualify for the advanced sessions, since nationally about 20 percent of all students were so eligible. To the extent to which there were SD/LEP students who qualified for the advanced mathematics and science assessments, however, the oversampling procedure for regular mathematics and science was not biased, because this was taken into account in the weighting of the regular mathematics and science assessments. This was possible because, for the students in the regular mathematics and science samples, those who were SD/LEP were identified, and those who qualified for the advanced assessments were also identified.\nAll such additional SD/LEP students were included unless this would have led to the sampling rate of SD/LEP students within the school being more than twice the rate of other students. In such cases, a random subsample of the extra SD/LEP students was selected. As for grade 4, all information needed in the field to carry out the oversampling was contained on the preprogrammed Session Assignment Form, so that the complex weighting process could be carried without the possibility of error being introduced in sampling information obtained from the field. Also, as in grade 4, in sample type 3 schools that were assigned both regular mathematics and regular science sessions, the extra SD/LEP students sampled were assigned in the appropriate proportions.\nSince the aim was to oversample by a factor of two where possible, the overall rate of oversampling of SD/LEP students was instead less than two. That is because in smaller schools there were no students remaining who had not already been assigned to a session. Again, the weighting procedures ensured that the results were not biased as a result of the relative under representation of SD/LEP students from smaller schools.\nTable 3-8 shows the results of the oversampling efforts for each grade and sample type for mathematics and science. The weighted results show the proportion of the sample that would have been SD/LEP students had no oversampling been attempted. The focus should be on sample types 2 and 3 for mathematics and sample type 3 for science, since this is where the oversampling of SD/LEP students occurred. The extent to which the unweighted percentage of SD/LEP students exceeds the weighted percentage is a measure of the effectiveness of the oversampling. As can be seen, the procedure was effective in increasing the sample of SD/LEP students considerably at grades 8 and 12 for both subjects, but was not very effective at grade 4 for either subject. To have increased the sample of SD/LEP students further at grade 4 would have required the assessment of additional schools.\n\nSubject/ Sample Type'\n\nTable 3-8 Percentage of Sampled Students Who Were Specified as SD/LEP\nin the 1996 Main Samples - Mathematics and Science\n\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 8\n\nGrade 12\n\nUnweighted Weighted Unweighted Weighted Unweighted Weighted\n\nMathematics/S1 Mathematics/52 Mathematics/S3 Total\n\n12.4% 17.9% 17.0% 15.8%\n\n13.2% 15.7% 15.4% 14.7%\n\n9.5% 19.9% 18.9% 16.1%\n\n10.2% 11.5% 12.1% 11.3%\n\n6.4% 15.3% 15.7% 12.7%\n\n6.8% 8.1% 8.5% 7.8%\n\nScience/S2\n\n16.5%\n\n15.8%\n\n13.1%\n\n11.9%\n\n9.5%\n\n9.2%\n\nScience/S3\n\n17.7%\n\n16.7%\n\n18.9%\n\n10.9%\n\n13.6%\n\n7.4%\n\nTotal\n\n16.9%\n\n16.2%\n\n15.2%\n\n11.4%\n\n10.9%\n\n8.3%\n\n1 The numbers in this table reflect the full samples, consisting of schools in the SI, S2, and S3 samples.

Some of these students were deemed unassessable by school authorities and were excluded from the assessment. For the long-term trend samples, a distinct sample of excluded students was identified at each age class. For the main samples, a distinct sample of excluded students was identified for each subject and sample type combination.\nThe inclusion criteria for the main samples differed somewhat from those used for the long-term trend samples. In addition, the inclusion criteria for the main samples differed by sample type. In sample type 1 schools, the inclusion criteria for the main samples were identical to those used in 1990 and 1992, and were intended to be somewhat more rigorously defined than those used in the long-term trend samples. In sample type 2 schools, new 1996 inclusion criteria were used. In sample type 3 schools, the new 1996 inclusion criteria were used and accommodations were offered to SD/LEP students.\nFor the long-term trend samples, the inclusion criteria were the same as in past long-term trend assessments, dating back to the early 1980s.\nFor all samples, students were selected for specific sessions, and.the school was then asked to identify those to be excluded. Thus, only age-eligible students were considered for inclusion in the longterm trend tape-administered sessions, whereas both age- and grade-eligible students were considered for inclusion in the print-administered long-term trend samples. The samples of excluded students for the long-term trend samples were weighted in such a way as to account for this procedure appropriately (see Chapter 10).\n\nTable 3-9 Student Exclusion Rates by Age Class and School Type and Sample Type, Weighted\n\nSubject/ Sample Type'\n\nAge Class 9\n\nAge Class 13\n\nAge Class 17\n\nNon-\n\nNon-\n\nNon-\n\nPublic Public Total Public Public Total Public Public Total\n\nMain Samples Mathematics/S1 Mathematics/S2 Mathematics/S3 Science/52 Science/S3 Estimation/All Theme/All Advanced Mathematics/All Advanced Science/All\n\n5.6% 9.1% 4.4% 9.2% 6.5% 6.7% 7.6%\n\n1.0% 1.3% 0.0% 0.3% 0.1% 0.0% 0.6%\n\n5.2% 8.1% 3.9% 8.2% 5.9% 5.8% 6.8%\n\n4.5% 4.7% 3.4% 4.7% 3.7% 5.1% 4.4% 0.0%\n\n0.2% 0.1% 0.0% 0.2% 0.3% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\n\n4.1% 4.3% 3.1% 4.3% 3.4% 4.7% 4.0% 0.0%\n\n3.4% 3.5% 3.1% 4.3% 2.8% 4.0% 3.6% 0.0% 0.0%\n\n0.1% 0.1% 0.2% 0.4% 0.2% 0.0% 1.4% 0.0% 0.0%\n\n3.0% 3.2% 2.8% 3.9% 2.6% 3.5% 3.4% 0.0% 0.0%\n\nLong-Term Trend Samples Reading/Writing Print\nMathematics/Science Tape\n\n6.6% 6.3%\n\n0.3% 0.6%\n\n5.9% 5.9% 5.6% 4.8%\n\n0.4% 5.4% 0.2% 4.3%\n\n5.3% 3.5%\n\n0.2% 5.0% 0.4% 3.3%\n\nThe numbers in this table reflect the full samples, consisting of schools in the SI, S2, and S3 samples.

The most marked effects are the much higher rates of exclusion in public schools than in nonpublic, and the higher rates of exclusion at lower grades. The former phenomenon is no doubt a function of the greater prevalence of special education and language minority programs in public schools. The higher exclusion rates at lower ages, which occurred also in other years, result from the greater proportion of students at these grades who are excluded for reasons of limited English proficiency. In certain areas of the United States, fourth-grade public-school students whose native language is Spanish are taught predominantly in Spanish, and in these schools a very high proportion of sampled students are excluded. Factors that may limit the comparability of these rates to those in previous years are the different inclusion criteria, oversampling of SD/LEP in some subjects, the different subjects assessed, and the inclusion of only grade eligible students in the main samples in 1996.\n\n3.9 STUDENT PARTICIPATION RATES\nTable 3-10 summarizes the rates of participation of invited students. The set of invited students consists of the selected students, after removing the excluded students and, in the case of long-term trend samples, removing those students selected for tape-administered sessions who were not age-eligible. For a given session, a makeup session was called for when, for various reasons, more than a predetermined tolerable number of invited students failed to attend the originally scheduled session to which they were invited. The participation rates given in the table express the number finally assessed as a percentage of those initially invited in the participating schools. Participation rates are shown for the main and longterm trend samples and for public and nonpublic schools separately in the case of the main samples. Overall participation rates are also shown for comparable samples from the 1994 NAEP assessment. The table shows that student participation rates in 1996 are similar to those experienced in 1994. The rates increased slightly at age class 9 for both samples, and remained fairly steady for the other samples. At all age classes, the participation rate of nonpublic-school students exceeds that of public-school students, with the difference, both relative and absolute, increasing with age class.\n\nTable 3-10 Student Participation Rates by Age Class and School Type, Unweightedl\n\nSamples\n\n1996 Public\n\n1996 Nonpublic\n\n1996 Combined\n\n1994\n\nNumber Participation Number Participation Number Participation Participation\n\nInvited\n\nRate\n\nInvited\n\nRate\n\nInvited\n\nRate2\n\nRate2\n\nAge Class 9\n\nLong-Term Trend 9,715\n\nMain\n\n24,082\n\n95.4% 95.1%\n\n1,204 5,834\n\n96.8% 96.6%\n\n10,919 29,916\n\n95.5% 95.4%\n\n94.2% 93.2%\n\nAge Class 13\n\nLong-Term Trend 10,980\n\nMain\n\n28,351\n\n91.6% 92.3%\n\n1,152 6,368\n\n95.0% 96.7%\n\n12,132 34,719\n\n91.9% 93.1%\n\n92.2% 91.0%\n\nAge Class 17\n\nLong-Term Trend 9,051\n\nMain\n\n34,199\n\n83.4% 77.3%\n\n717 7,473\n\n91.9% 91.5%\n\n9,768 41,672\n\n84.0% 79.9%\n\n84.1% 81.1%\n\niThe numbers in this table reflect the full samples, including all sample types (see Section 3.4). 2 Somewhat different inclusion criteria were used for the main samples than for the long-term trend samples in each year, and for the main samples in 1994 versus 1996. The total rates for the main samples are based on a relatively greater contribution from nonpublic-school students. Nonpublic-school students constitute about 18% of the 1996 main samples, 16% of the 1994 main samples, and 11% of the 1994 and 1996 long-term trend samples.\n\n70\n\nP'7\n\n\f3.10 OVERALL STUDENT PARTICIPATION RATES\n\nThe combined impact of school nonparticipation and student absenteeism from sessions within participating schools is summarized in Table 3-11. The table shows the percentages of students assessed, from among those who would have been assessed if all initially selected schools had participated, and if all invited students had attended either an initial or make-up session. The results show that, consistent with earlier rounds of NAEP, the overall level of participation decreases substantially with the increase in age and grade of the students.\n\nSo far in this chapter, only unweighted participation rates by age class and school type have been presented. However, analysis is typically performed separately by age class and session type, and NCES standards regarding acceptable potentials for bias are expressed in terms of weighted participation rates. Therefore, Tables 3-12 and 3-13 show weighted participation rates by age class and session type for the main and long-term trend samples, respectively. The main sample rates are for students in the reporting populations. Note that for the main samples, the student participation rates are similar for different session types at grades 4 and 8, but the student participation rates at grade 12 and the school participation rates at all grades vary by session type. The differential school participation rates reflect the fact that, more so than in previous years, different session types include different schools. This is due to the assignment of schools to sample type, the fact that all session types were not assessed in all sample types, and the specific sample types included in the reporting populations for each session type (see Chapter 10). For long-term trend, the participation rates are similar for different session types in the same age class. They are also similar, in general, to the unweighted rates.\n\nThe procedures for substituting for nonparticipating schools or imputing for them through weighting and the procedures for imputing for absent students through weighting were designed (so far as feasible) to reduce the biases resulting from school and student nonparticipation. These procedures are discussed in Chapter 10.\n\nTable 3-11 Overall Participation Rates (School and Student Combined) by Age Class, Unweightedl\n\n1996 Samples\nMain Samples School participation Student participation Overall student participation\n\nAge Class 9 Age Class 13 Age Class 17 Overall\n\n86.3% 95.4% 82.3%\n\n83.3% 91.5% 76.2%\n\n79.5% 79.9% 63.5%\n\n82.9% 88.6% 73.4%\n\nNumber of participating students\nLong-Term Trend Samples School participation Student participation Overall student participation\n\n28,527\n85.2% 95.5% 81.4%\n\n32,328\n83.9% 91.9% 77.1%\n\n33,286\n81.4% 84.0% 68.4%\n\n94,141\n83.6% 90.8% 75.9%\n\nNumber of participating students\nOverall School participation Student participation Overall student participation\n\n10,432\n86.0% 95.4% 82.0%\n\n11,151\n83.5% 92.8% 77.5%\n\n8,208\n79.9% 80.7% 64.5%\n\n29,791\n83.1% 89.1% 74.0%\n\nNumber of participating students\n\n38,959\n\n43,479\n\n41,494\n\nI The numbers in this table reflect the full samples, including all sample types (see Section 3.4).\n\n123,932\n\n9 3 71\n\n\fTable 3-12 Weighted Participation Rates by Age Class and Session Type, 1996 Main NAEP Reporting Samples\n\nParticipation (Sample Type)\nGrade 4 School participation Student participation Overall participation\nGrade 8 School participation Student participation Overall participation\nGrade 12 School participation Student participation Overall participation\n\nMathematics\n\nAdvanced\n\nMathematics Science Estimation Mathematics Mathematics\n\nPrint\n\nPrint\n\nPrint Theme Print Print\n\n82.3% 95.3% 78.4%\n\n77.8% 94.9% 73.8%\n\n93.5% 96.7% 90.4%\n\n77.9% 95.4% 74.4%\n\n81.5% 92.9% 75.7%\n\n79.7% 93.1% 74.3%\n\n85.3% 93.8% 80.0%\n\n86.8% 92.7% 80.4%\n\n77.0% 95.6% 73.6%\n\n76.2% 82.3% 62.7%\n\n77.4% 77.5% 60.0%\n\n63.9% 81.0% 51.7%\n\n78.4% 78.2% 61.3%\n\n77.6% 85.8% 66.6%\n\nAdvanced Science\nPrint\n77.7% 86.5% 67.2%\n\nTable 3-13 Weighted Participation Rates by Age Class and Session Type\n1996 Long-Term Trend Samples\n\nParticipation\n\nReading/Writing Print\n\nMathematics/Science Tape\n\nAge Class 9 School participation Student participation Overall participation\n\n83.5% 95.6% 79.9%\n\n82.6% 95.4% 78.8%\n\nAge Class 13 School participation Student participation Overall participation\n\n82.0% 92.2% 75.6%\n\n80.8% 92.6% 74.8%\n\nAge Class 17 School participation Student participation Overall participation\n\n81.7% 83.8% 68.5%\n\n75.6% 84.1% 63.6%\n\n3.11 SAMPLING TEACHERS\nThe teacher questionnaire was administered to teachers of fourth- and eighth-grade students assessed in mathematics and science and twelfth-grade students assessed in advanced mathematics. Teachers were given the questionnaire if they taught the student the subject in which the student was assessed. The purpose of drawing these samples was not to estimate the attributes of the teacher\n72\n\n\fpopulation, but to estimate the number (proportion) of.students whose teachers had various attributes and to correlate student characteristics and performance with the characteristics of their teachers.\nThe selbcted teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning themselves and their teaching practice, with specific references to each individual class period containing a student included in the main assessment.\n1 0\n73\n\n\fChapter 4\nASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS'\nStephen Lazer Educational Testing Service\n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the 1996 assessment, four types of instruments were used to collect data about students, teachers, and schools. Each assessed student received an assessment booklet containing both cognitive and background questions. An SD/LEP Student Questionnaire was completed by school officials for each sampled student identified as having a disability (SD) or classified as Limited English Proficient (LEP), whether or not the students were able to participate in the assessment. The teachers of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students participating in the assessment were asked to complete a Teacher Questionnaire. A School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire was distributed to each participating school.\nThis chapter begins with a discussion of the characteristics of the student booklets used for the 1996 main and long-term trend assessments and how the booklets were assembled. The contents of each booklet and item block is presented in detail in a set of tables. Section 4.4 describes the student, teacher, SD/LEP, and school questionnaires that were part of the 1996 assessment.\n\n4.2 STUDENT i OOKLETSMAIN ASSESSMENTS\n\n4.2.1 Mathematics\nEach student assessed in mathematics received a booklet containing a set of general background questions, content questions, subject-specific background questions, and questions about his or her motivation and familiarity with the assessment materials. The passages and content questions were assembled into sections or blocks. Students in the main assessment were given three 15-minute blocks. Those sampled for the theme assessment completed one 15-minute block and one 30-minute block. Those sampled for the advanced study at grade 8 completed three 20-minute blocks; at grade 12 advanced sample students completed three 30-minute blocks. Students in the estimation sample completed one 15minute block from the main assessment and two paced-tape sections. The overall assessment time for each student was approximately 63 minutes.\nThe assembly of blocks into booklets for the main assessment and their subsequent assignment to sampled students was determined by a balanced incomplete block (BIB) design with spiraled administration. The student booklets contained two five-minute background sections, a one-minute background section, and three 15-minute blocks of items according to a BIB design.\n\nThe BIB design for the 1996 national mathematics assessment was focused by subject area, so that students received booklets containing only blocks of mathematics questions (not science). The BIB design also balances the order of presentation of the 15-minute blocks of itemsevery 15-minute block\n\nI Stephen Lazer manages assessment development activities for the NAEP program at ETS.\n\n11\n\n75\n\n\fappears as the first cognitive block in two booklets, as the second cognitive block in two other booklets, and as the third cognitive block in another two booklets.\nThe design used in 1996 required that 13 blocks of mathematics items at each grade be assembled into 26 booklets. Theme blocks were placed in two other booklets, and estimation blocks in one other booklet. At grades 8 and 12, the advanced study was placed in one additional booklet.20nce assembled, the main assessment booklets were then spiraled and bundled. Spiraling involves interweaving the booklets in a systematic sequence so that each booklet appears an appropriate number of times in the sample. The bundles were designed so that each booklet would appear equally often in each position in a bundle.\nThe final step in the BIB-spiraling procedure was the assigning of the booklets to the assessed students. The students within an assessment session were assigned booklets in the order in which the booklets were bundled. Thus, most students in an assessment session received different booklets. In the assessment design, representative and randomly equivalent samples of students responded to each item at a given grade level.\nTables 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3 provide the composition and number of booklets administered in the 1996 mathematics assessment. Table 4-4 gives details of the item blocks used in the main assessment, including the number of cognitive items in each block and the booklets in which each block appeared; Table 4-5 gives the same information for blocks in the special components of the assessment. Table 4-6 gives pertinent information about the background sections.\n2 See Chapter 2 for descriptions of these types of assesinent, blocks.\n0.\n76\n\n\fTable 4-1 Main Sample Booklet Configuration\nGrade 4, Mathematics\n\nBooklet Number\n101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 1151 116 117 118 119 120 1212 122 123 124 125 126 1273 1284 1294 9215\n\nBackground\n\nCommon Mathematics\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nC13\n\nM2\n\nCognitive\n\nBlocks\n\nM3\n\nM4\n\nM7\n\nM4\n\nM5\n\nM8\n\nM5\n\nM6\n\nM9\n\nM6\n\nM7\n\nM10\n\nM7\n\nM8 Mll\n\nM8\n\nM9\n\nM12\n\nM9\n\nM10\n\nM13\n\nM10\n\nMll\n\nM14\n\nM 1 1\n\nM12\n\nM15\n\nM12\n\nM13\n\nM3\n\nM13\n\nM14\n\nM4\n\nM14\n\nM15\n\nM5\n\nM15\n\nM3\n\nM6\n\nM3\n\nM5\n\nM10\n\nM4\n\nM6\n\nM1 1\n\nM5\n\nM7\n\nM12\n\nM6\n\nM8\n\nM13\n\nM7\n\nM9\n\nM14\n\nM8\n\nM10\n\nM15\n\nM9\n\nMll\n\nM3\n\nM10\n\nM12\n\nM4\n\nMll\n\nM13\n\nM5\n\nM12\n\nM14\n\nM6\n\nM13\n\nM15\n\nM7\n\nM14\n\nM3\n\nM8\n\nM15\n\nM4\n\nM9\n\nM4\n\nM16\n\nM17\n\nM4\n\nM21\n\nM4\n\nM22\n\nM10\n\nM12\n\nM4\n\nMotivation Background Block\nMX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX MX\n\nI This booklet was a large print version. 2 This booklet was also used for SD/LEP students who took a regular-print version. 3 This was an estimation booklet (involved paced audiotapes). 4 This was a theme booklet. 5 This was a bilingual booklet presented to some SD/LEP students.

her motivation and familiarity with the assessment materials. The passages and content questions were assembled into sections or blocks. Students in the main assessment were given three 20-minute blocks at grade 4, and three 30-minute blocks at grades 8 and 12. The last block in every book was a hands-on block. Those sampled for the advanced study at grade 12 completed four 30-minute blocks. The overall assessment time for each student was, on average, 120 minutes.\nThe assembly of blocks into booklets for the main assessment and their subsequent assignment to sampled students was determined by a complex design with spiraled administration. The student booklets contained two five-minute background sections, a one-minute background section, and three blocks of items.\nThe design for the 1996 national assessment was focused by subject area, so that students received booklets containing only blocks of science questions (not mathematics). The design also balances the order of presentation of the blocks of items, except for the hands-on blocks, which always appear in position three of a booklet. All other blocks appear an equal number of times in position one and position two. Further, the design was set up to ensure that no student answered more than one.themebased block (though some students did not receive any). This design allows for some balancing of the impact of context and fatigue effects to be measured and reported, but makes allowance for the difficulties and disruption of administering hands-on blocks. It also takes into account the limited breadth of content coverage included in the theme blocks.\nThe design used in 1996 required that 15 blocks of science items at each grade be assembled into 37 booklets. At grade 12, the advanced study was composed of three additional booklets. Once assembled, the main assessment booklets were then spiraled and bundled. Spiraling involves interweaving the booklets in a systematic sequence so that each booklet appears an appropriate number of times in the sample. The bundles were designed so that each booklet would appear equally often in each position in a bundle.\nThe final step in the spiraling procedure was the assigning of the booklets to the assessed students. The students within an assessment session were assigned booklets in the order in which the booklets were bundled. Thus, most students in an assessment session received different booklets. In the assessment design, representative and randomly equivalent samples of about 1,200 students responded to each item at a given grade level.\nTables 4-7, 4-8, and 4-9 provide the composition and number of booklets administered in the main 1996 science assessment. Table 4-10 provides the composition of booklets in the advanced science study. Table 4-11 gives details of the item blocks used in the main assessment, including the number of cognitive items in each block and the booklets in which each block appeared; Table 4-12 gives the same information for blocks in the special components of the assessment. Table 4-13 gives pertinent information about the background sections.\n82\n,cl\n\n\fTable 4-7 Main Sample Booklet Configuration\nGrade 4, Science\n\nBooklet Number\n201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209\n210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219\n2202 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237\n\nCognitive\n\nBlocks\n\nS7\n\nS10\n\nS7\n\nSll\n\nS7\n\nS12\n\nS7\n\nS13\n\nS10\n\nSll\n\nS12\n\nS8\n\nS10\n\nS13\n\nS10\n\nS8\n\nS I I\n\nS12\n\nS13\n\nS14\n\nSll\n\nS8\n\nSll\n\nS14\n\nS13\n\nS8\n\nS8\n\nS15\n\nS12\n\nS14\n\nS12\n\nS15\n\nS8\n\nS14\n\nS14\n\nS20\n\nS8\n\nS20\n\nS13\n\nS20\n\nS14\n\nS15\n\nS15\n\nS21\n\nS15\n\nS9\n\nS8\n\nS21\n\nS20\n\nS21\n\nS20\n\nS9\n\nS20\n\nS7\n\nS14\n\nS9\n\nS21\n\nS9\n\nS21\n\nS7\n\nS21\n\nS10\n\nS15\n\nS7\n\nS9\n\nS13\n\nS9\n\nS10\n\nS9\n\nSll\n\nS9\n\nS12\n\nS14\n\nS7\n\nHands-On Task'\nS3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3 S4 S5 S6 S3\n\nBackground\n\nCommon Science\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nC19\n\nS2\n\nMotivation Background Block\nSX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX SX\n\nHands-on task blocks: Block S3 uses \"A\" kit - seeds;

Tables 4-14, 4-15, and 4-16 summarize the contents of each trend assessment booklet and show how many of each booklet were administered. Tables 4-20, 4-21, and 4-22 give details of the item blocks used in the long-term trend assessments, including the number of cognitive and constructed-response items in each block and the booklets in which each block appeared.\nReading and Writing Long-Term Trend. Six booklets (numbered 51 to 56) containing reading and writing items were administered to each age class. These booklets were identical to booklets used in previous assessments of reading and writing and were spiraled for administration. Each booklet consisted of a common background block (BZ) and three cognitive blocks (at least one reading block and at least one writing block). In addition to cognitive items, the cognitive blocks also contained subject-related background questions.\nMathematics and Science Long-Term Trend. Three booklets (91, 92, and 93) at ages 9 and 13 and two booklets (84 and 85) at age 17, containing mathematics and science items, were identical to those used in previous assessments to measure trends. Each booklet contained a common background block (C1 or BZ) and three cognitive blocks. At ages 9 and 13, these booklets contained one reading block (R1,\n88\n114 -1/4-\n\n\fR2, or R3), one mathematics block (M1, M2, or M3) and one science block (S1, S2, or S3). At age 17, each booklet contained at least one mathematics block (M1 to M3) and at least one science block (S1 S3). Mathematics block M3 contained items that required the use of a calculator. All cognitive blocks also contained subject-related background questions.\n\nTable 4-14 Long-Term Trend Sample Booklet Contents and Number of Booklets Administered\nAge Class 9\n\nSubject Area\n\nBooklet Number\n\nCommon Background\nBlock\n\nSubject Area\nBackground Block'\n\nCognitive Blocks\n\nReading and\n\n51\n\nBZ\n\nWriting\n\n52\n\nBZ\n\n53\n\nBZ\n\n54\n\nBZ\n\n55\n\nBZ\n\n56\n\nBZ\n\nBC BL BQ BH BE BR BC BK BJ BG BO BE BM BG BN BV BR\n\nMathematics\n\n91\n\nCl\n\nand Science\n\n92\n\nCl\n\n93\n\nCl\n\nR1\n\nM1 S1\n\nS2\n\nR2 M32\n\nM2\n\nS3\n\nR3\n\nSubject area background questions are included in cognitive blocks for this booklet. 2 Calculator needed for this block.\n\nNumber of Booklets\nAdministered\n1,186 1,165 1,178 1,180 1,169 1,184\n2,388 2,512 2,435\n\n115 89\n\n\fTable 4-15 Long-Term Trend Sample Booklet Contents and Number of Booklets Administered\nAge Class 13\n\nSubject Area\n\nBooklet Number\n\nCommon Background\nBlock\n\nSubject Area\nBackground Block'\n\nCognitive Blocks\n\nReading and\n\n51\n\nBZ\n\nWriting\n\n52\n\nBZ\n\n53\n\nBZ\n\n54\n\nBZ\n\n55\n\nBZ\n\n56\n\nBZ\n\nBM BK BD BC BL BQ BH BE BR BN BC BD BG BO BE BG BJ BP\n\nMathematics\n\n91\n\nCl\n\nand Science\n\n92\n\nCl\n\n93\n\nCl\n\nR1\n\nM1 S1\n\nS2\n\nR2 M32\n\nM2\n\nS3\n\nR3\n\nSubject area background questions are included in cognitive blocks for this booklet. 2 Calculator needed for this block.\n\nNumber of Booklets Administered\n919 906 923 905 928 933\n1,928 1,976 2,005\n\nTable 4-16 Long-Term Trend Sample Booklet Contents and Number of Booklets Administered\nAge Class 17\n\nSubject Area\n\nBooklet Number\n\nCommon Background\nBlock\n\nSubject Area Background Block'\n\nCognitive Blocks\n\nReading and\n\n51\n\nBZ\n\nWriting\n\n52\n\nBZ\n\n53\n\nBZ\n\n54\n\nBZ\n\n55\n\nBZ\n\n56\n\nBZ\n\nBM BK BD BC BL BQ BH BE BR BN BC BD BG BO BE BG BJ BP\n\nMathematics\n\n84 .\n\nCl\n\nand Science\n\n85\n\nCl\n\nM1 M2 S3\n\nS1\n\nS2\n\n1,432\n\nSubject area background questions are included in cognitive blocks for this booklet. 2 Calculator needed for this block.\n\nNumber of Booklets Administered\n927 924 917 951 939 911\n2,207 2,152\n\n90\n\n- 116\n\n\fTable 4-17 Long-Term Trend Sample Block Information, Age Class 9\n\nBlock\n\nType\n\nNumber\n\nTotal\n\nof\n\nNumber Cognitive\n\nof Items Items\n\nBZ Common Background Cl Common Background\n\n37\n\n0\n\n28\n\n0\n\nBC Writing Background/Cognitive\n\n23\n\nBE Writing Background/Cognitive\n\n11\n\nBG Writing Background/Cognitive\n\n8\n\nBH Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n15\n\nBJ Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n24\n\nBK Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n19\n\nBL Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n26\n\nBM Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n16\n\nBN Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n25\n\nBO Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n22\n\nBQ Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n21\n\nBR Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n16\n\nBV Reading and Writing\n\n36\n\nBackground/Cognitive\n\nR1 Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n20\n\nR2 Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n20\n\nR3 Reading Background/Cognitive\n\n17\n\nM1 Mathematics\n\n26\n\nM2 Background/Cognitive\n\n26\n\nM3 Mathematics\n\n19\n\nBackground/Cognitive\n\nMathematics\n\nBackground/Cognitive (Ca lc.)\n\nS1 Science Background/Cognitive\n\n23\n\nS2 Science Background/Cognitive\n\n25\n\nS3 Science Background/Cognitive\n\n31\n\n1\n2 2\n11 13 11\n7 12 14\n11 12 12\n7 Rd. 1 Wr.\n9\n11\n10\n26 26 16\n18\n25 20\n\nNumber of Open-Ended Items\nCognitive Noncognitive\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 Rd.\n\n0\n\n1 Wr.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n9\n\n0\n\n9\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nBooklets Containing\nBlock\n51 56\n91 93\n51, 53 52, 54 54, 55\n52 53 53 51 55 55 54 51 52, 56 56\n91\n92 93\n91\n93 92\n91 92 93\n\n117 91\n\n\fTable 4-18 Long-Term Trend Sample Block Information, Age Class 13\n\nBlock\n\nType\n\nBZ Common Background\nCl Common Background\nBC.

The first, consisting of general background questions, included questions about race/ethnicity, mother's and father's level of education, reading materials in the home, homework, attendance, academic expectations, and which parents lived at home. The second, consisting of subject-area background questions, included questions about instructional activities, courses taken, use of specialized resources such as calculators in mathematics class, and views on the utility and value of the subject matter. Students were given five minutes to complete each of these questionnaires, with the exception of the fourth graders, who were given more time because the items in the general questionnaire were read aloud for them. The third\n\n119\n\n93\n\n\fquestionnaire followed the three cognitive blocks and contained five questions about students' motivation to do well on the assessment, their perceptions concerning the difficulty of the assessment, and their familiarity with types of questions included.\nThe student questionnaires are described in detail in Chapter 2.\n4.4.2 Teacher Questionnaires\nTo supplement the information on instruction reported by students, the mathematics teachers of the students participating in the mathematics assessment were asked to complete a questionnaire about their instructional practices, teaching backgrounds, and characteristics. The teacher questionnaire contained two parts. The first part pertained to the teachers' background and general training. The second part pertained to specific training in teaching mathematics and the procedures the teacher uses for each class containing an assessed student, as well as collecting information on teachers' awareness and knowledge of the NCTM Standards.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire, Part I: Background and General Training included questions pertaining to gender, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience, certification, degrees, major and minor fields of study, course work in education, course work in specific subject areas, amount of in-service training, extent of control over instructional issues, and availability of resources for their classroom.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire, Part II: Training in Mathematics and Classroom Instructional Information included questions on the teacher's exposure to various issues related to mathematics and teaching mathematics through pre- and in-service training, ability level of students in the class, whether students were assigned to the class by ability level, time on task, homework assignments, frequency of instructional activities used in class, methods of assessing student progress in mathematics, instructional emphasis given to the mathematics abilities covered in the assessment, and use of particular resources.\nBecause the sampling for the teacher questionnaires was based on participating students, the responses to a particular teacher questionnaire do not necessarily represent all teachers of that subject area at that grade level in the nation. Rather, they are teachers of the representative sample of students assessed. It is important to note that in all NAEP reports, the student is always the unit of analysis, even when information from the teacher or school questionnaire is being reported. Using the student as the unit of analysis makes it possible to describe the instruction received by representative samples of students. Although this approach may provide a different perspective from other studies simply reporting information about teachers or schools, it is consistent with NAEP's goal of providing information about the educational context and performance of students.\nThe teacher questionnaires are described in detail in Chapter 2.\n4.4.3 School Questionnaires\nA School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire was given to the principal or other administrator of each school that participated in the assessment. This information provided an even broader picture of the instructional context for students' mathematics achievement. This questionnaire included questions about background and characteristics of school principals, length of school day and year, school enrollment, absenteeism, dropout rates, size and composition of teaching staff, policies about grouping students, curriculum, testing practices and uses, special priorities and school-wide\n94\nLL 1\n\n\fprograms, availability of resources, special services, community services, policies for parental involvement, and school-wide problems.\nSchool Characteristics and Policies questionnaires are described in detail in Chapter 2.\n4.4.4 SD/LEP Student Questionnaires\nThe SD/LEP Student Questionnaire was completed by the teachers of those students who were selected to participate in the assessment sample who were classified as Students with Disabilities (SD) or were classified as Limited English Proficient (LEP). The questionnaire was completed for all SD or LEP students, whether or not they actually participated in the assessment. This questionnaire asked about the nature of the student's disability and the special programs in which the student participated.\nSchools were permitted to exclude certain students from the assessment. The same exclusion criteria and rules used in the national assessment were also applied to the Trial State Assessment. Although the intent was to assess all sampled students, students who were identified by school staff as not capable of participating meaningfully were excluded. The NAEP guidelines for exclusion were intended to assure uniformity of exclusion criteria from school to school as well as from state to state.\nMore information about the SD/LEP questionnaire and exclusion criteria are provided in Chapters 2 and 5.\n\n121\n\n95\n\n\fChapter 5\nFIELD OPERATIONS AND DATA COLLECTION'\nLucy M. Gray, Mark M. Waksberg, and Nancy W. Caldwell Westat, Inc.\n5.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes the field operations and data collection activities for the national assessment component of the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The national assessment is comprised of main samples and long-term trend samples. Main NAEP samples typically involve new assessment items, and may include new subject areas and innovative features; in long-term trend, the procedures and items from previous years are carried forward so that trends in student achievement can be measured over time. Both the main and long-term trend assessments are based on probability samples of schools and students that allow for regional and national reporting only. The State Assessment, the second major component of NAEP, comprises the state program that uses main assessment materials and involves much larger sample sizes per state (or jurisdiction), so that results can be reported for each participating state (for further technical information on the State Assessment, see the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Mathematics, Allen, Jenkins, Kulick, and Zelenak, 1997, and the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Science, Allen, Swinton, Isham, and Zelenak, 1997).\nThe design of the national assessment component of NAEP is described in the remaining sections of this chapter. For all components, NAEP guarantees the anonymity of participants, and student or teacher names are never recorded on assessment booklets nor removed from the schools. NAEP results are reported on the national level and by region of the country, not by school district, school, or individual student. Only group statistics are reported, broken down by gender, race/ethnicity, and a host of variables that illuminate teachers' instructional practices.\n5.1.1 Field Organization\nThe 1996 main assessment involved some new items and components including many innovative features. For example, the science assessment differed from previous NAEP science assessments in that every student performed an experiment. The mathematics assessment involved the use of mathematical tools and a larger number of constructed-response items than in the past. Much of the mathematics assessment has been used since 1990, thus providing \"short-term trend\" data. All students in a particular assessment session received a booklet in the same subject (i.e., mathematics or science). Even though many different booklets were used in a particular session, they were all for the same subject.\nIn most schools sampled for the main assessment, more than one session type was conducted. In about one-third of the schools at each grade, only two session types, mathematics and mathematics estimation, were possible. In the remaining two-thirds of schools, up to a maximum of four session types\n\nI Lucy M. Gray and Mark M. Waksberg assist in survey operations and field activities for the NAEP assessments, under the direction of Nancy W. Caldwell.\n\n''2\n\n97\n\n\ffor grade 4 or five session types at grades 8 or 12 could have been conducted. At grade 12, only one advanced sessioneither mathematics or sciencewas conducted.\nHistorically, a small proportion (less than 10%) of the sampled students have been \"excluded\" from NAEP assessment sessions because, according to school records, they are students with either disabilities or limited English language proficiency who have been determined to be incapable of participating meaningfully in the assessment. More recently, especially with the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, increased attention has been given to these students and to including as many of them as possible in NAEP sessions (and in other testing situations as well). NAEP has addressed these concerns; first in the 1995 field test and continuing with the 1996 operational assessment, through a Special Study that uses both old and new \"inclusion\" criteria and (in some schools) offers accommodations for testing students with disabilities and/or limited English proficiency (SD/LEP). For the 1996 main assessment, a split-sample design was used, placing the sampled schools into three subsamples, so that the impact of both the new SD/LEP criteria and the provision of accommodations could be evaluated, while also collecting data with the old criteria to maintain comparability with previous NAEP data bases. This Special Study was incorporated in the main assessment but was not a part of the 1996 long-term trend assessment. The information in this chapter and in Chapter 3 applies to all three sample types or subsamples.\nFor administrative purposes, the main and long-term trend assessments were conducted in different schools. Responsibility for the assessments in long-term trend schools was given to one group of assessment supervisors, while responsibility for the main assessment was assigned to another group of supervisors. Since these supervisors worked in some of the same areas and sometimes in the same school districts, careful coordination was required.\nIn order to reduce the burden on the participating schools, national assessment field staff performed most of the work associated with the assessments. Introductory contacts and meetings were held in the fall (1995) to enlist cooperation and explain the assessment procedures to district and school representatives and to set a mutually agreed-upon assessment date for each school. The assessment supervisor visited the school to select the sample of students a week or two before the assessment. The assessment sessions were conducted by national assessment field staff, called exercise administrators, under the direction of the assessment supervisor. At the conclusion of the assessment in a school, field staff coded demographic information on the booklet covers and shipped the completed materials to National Computer Systems (NCS), the processing subcontractor for NAEP (see Chapter 6 for more detailed information on processing assessment materials).\n5.2 PREPARING FOR THE ASSESSMENTS\n5.2.1 Gaining the Cooperation of Sampled Schools\nThe process of gaining cooperation of the schools selected for the national assessment began in late August 1995 with a series of letters and contacts with state and district-level officials. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) first sent each jurisdiction a letter announcing NAEP plans for 1996. Westat then contacted the State Test Directors or NAEP State Coordinators in each sampled state to notify them of the districts and schools selected in their states. In the 40 jurisdictions participating in the State Assessment that also had schools sampled for the national assessment, the state received the list of districts and schools sampled for both the national and state assessments.\n\n98\n\n123\n\n\fFrom September through early December 1995, Westat sent lists of schools sampled for the national assessment component and other NAEP materials to district superintendents, diocesan superintendents of Catholic schools, and principals or heads of schools in other nonpublic schools, inviting their participation. These initial mailings paved the way for telephone contacts by NAEP field supervisors who were assigned the task of. gaining cooperation and scheduling assessment dates.\n\nThe schedule for project activities for the 1996 main and long-term trend assessments was as follows:\n\nDate Mid-August 1995 August 27 31, 1995 September 7 9, 1995 Mid-September 1995 Mid-to-Late September 1995 Mid-September December 1, 1995\nOctober 9 December 22, 1995 Early December 1995\nDecember 9 13, 1995 January 3 March 29, 1996 January 3 March 8, 1996 March 11 May 10, 1996\n\nActivity\nDepartment of Education sent first letter to Chief State School Officers about the 1996 assessment.\nTraining sessions were held for long-term trend assessment supervisors.\nTraining sessions were held for main assessment schedulers.\nWestat sent state coordinators a list of their schools initially selected for either or both major components.\nWestat sent samples and informational materials to districts if not already sent by state coordinators.\nSupervisors contacted districts and schools to secure cooperation and to schedule assessments.\nSupervisors conducted introductory meetings for the national assessment, by telephone (or in person if requested by districts/schools). Westat selected substitutes for refusals.\nSupervisors recruited, hired, and trained exercise administrators.\nFall long-term trend assessments were administered.\nSupervisors sent informational materials to principals and school coordinators. Letter confirming assessment schedule sent to each school from Westat.\nMain assessment supervisor training session was held.\nMain assessments were administered.2\nWinter long-term trend assessments were administered.\nSpring long-term trend assessments were administered.\n\n5.2.2 Supervisor Training\nTraining for assessment supervisors was multi-phased and involved separate sessions conducted in August, September, and December 1995. All training was conducted by the Westat project director,\n\n2\nFinal makeup sessions were held April 1-5, 1996. 99\n\n\ffield director, and home office staff. Also in attendance were representatives from Educational Testing .\nService (ETS), NCS, and NCES.\nThe first of these training sessions was held August 27-31, 1995 in Baltimore, Maryland for field staff assigned to the long-term trend program for 1996. Attending the session were the long-term trend field manager, the 11 field supervisors responsible for conducting the long-term trend assessments, and 4 troubleshooters.\nAfter an introduction to the study, which included the background and history of NAEP, an overview of the long-term trend assessments, and the 1995-1996 assessment schedule, the training continued with a thorough (2 half-day sessions) presentation of NAEP contact/gaining cooperation activities. This is a lengthy process of contacting states, districts, and schools regarding their participation in and scheduling for NAEP; several demonstration phone calls, role plays, and exercises were used to provide some practical experience during this part of the training. The long-term trend staff was also trained on setting assessment schedules, recruiting/hiring/training exercise administrators, and sample selection and preparation of Administration Schedules and other assessment materials. Several practice exercises were used to demonstrate these topics. The training concluded with: discussions of conducting the session and using the session script; preparing school worksheets and holding makeup sessions; post-assessment activities; and Westat administrative procedures.\nAfter an overview of NAEP and introductory remarks on the study schedule, the main assessment group of about 25 supervisors received extensive training (similar to the August training for long-term trend) in contacting the schools, gaining cooperation and scheduling the assessments; numerous demonstrations, role plays and exercises were used. Other training topics included: supervisory responsibilities; setting the assessment schedule; recruiting and training exercise administrators; and administrative forms and procedures. The scheduling supervisors also received a full day of training on using the reporting system installed on the laptop computers assigned to each of them for the gaining cooperation/scheduling phase.\nThe 75 NAEP supervisors who were responsible for main assessment activities were trained during a third session, held December 9-13, 1995. Training focused on a review of the preliminary activities during the fall including results of initial contacts with districts and schools, scheduling of assessments, the status of exercise administrators' recruitment, and a thorough discussion of assessment activities: sampling procedures; inclusion of SD/LEP students; teacher surveys; providing testing accommodations; conducting science sessions; and administrative forms and procedures. Westat's classroom management videotape was also shown at this training session.\nThe main and state assessment field managers were present at the December session to support training activities and answer questions concerning districts and schools that fell into the samples for more than one component of the assessment. Each supervisor also met with the person who completed the scheduling in their area, as a first step in preparing for the new supervisors' contacts with each school (and district, if needed).\n5.2.3 Contacting Districts and Nonpublic Schools\nOnce the supervisors were trained in August and September, they began working on obtaining cooperation. In states participating in the State Assessment, the assessment supervisor first spoke with the State field manager to determine what contacts, if any, had already been made with districts about the national assessment. The approach the supervisors took when calling superintendents depended on whether the district had been notified about NAEP by the State Coordinator and whether the district also\n100\nL 125\n\n\fhad schools selected for the State Assessment. For districts that had been contacted by the State Coordinator, the supervisor began by referring to that contact.\nIn previous NAEP assessments, the supervisors offered and usually held \"introductory meetings\" with representatives from the superintendents' offices and the selected schools, typically the superintendent and the principals. These served as both an introduction to NAEP and a presentation on what would be asked of the school. The meetings were also used to establish a schedule for the sampling visits and the assessments in the schools.\nHowever, over the years, these meetings have become somewhat redundant since many districts have fallen into the NAEP sample more than one time. It has also become more and more difficult to schedule these meetings, as district and school officials find it harder to allot time away from their offices. Thus, beginning with the fall 1995 preparation for the 1996 study, the material was almost always presented to the superintendents and principals during telephone calls rather than in formal meetings. Generally, only if an in-person meeting was specifically requested by the district or school officials, or if the supervisor felt that there was a better chance of convincing a district to participate in person, was such a meeting held.\nAs the supervisors contacted superintendents, principals, and nonpublic school officials to introduce NAEP and determine the schools' cooperation status, they completed two forms and entered the school status in the receipt control system installed on their laptop computers. The Results of Contact Form was completed to document the discussion the supervisor had with each administrator concerning the district's willingness to participate and any special circumstances regarding the schools' cooperation or assessments.\nThe supervisor also completed portions of a School Control Form. This form was preprinted with the number and types of assessment sessions assigned to the school, so that this information could then be shared with the district/school official. Information gathered during the phone call, including the name of the person designated to be the school coordinator, the number of students in the designated grade, tentative dates for the sampling visit and assessment, and other information that could have some bearing on the assessment, was recorded on the form. This information was used to update records in the home office. In December, the forms were provided to the supervisors who would be conducting the assessments.\nA small number of in-person introductory meetings were held. The New York City and Los Angeles City school districts have previously used these meetings to present information about the NAEP assessments to the officials of all the selected schools and to encourage their participation, and wished to continue that practice for the current assessment. A small number of other school districts also requested such a meeting, involving representatives from their selected schools so that they would have a full understanding of what the assessments entailed.\nDuring the telephone presentation or the introductory meeting, the supervisor discussed arrangements for the assessments with representatives from each school. Within the weeks scheduled for the PSU, the supervisor had the flexibility to set each school's assessment date in coordination with school staff. The staff sometimes expressed preferences for a particular day or dates or had particular, times when the assessment could not be scheduled. Their preferences or restrictions depended on the events that had already been scheduled on their school calendar. Using this information from the schools, the supervisors set up the assessment schedule for each PSU.\nThe supervisor usually learned during the introductory contact whether a school required some form of parental notification or permission. Three versions of standard NAEP letters were offered for the\n101\n16\n\n\fschool's use, and each letter could be produced for selected students only or for all eligible students. The first version informs parents about the assessment. The second assumes parental consent unless parents send the form back stating that they do not want their child to participate in the assessment. The third version requires that parents sign and return the form before students can be assessed. All versions of the letter were available to the schools, although when the issue of parental permission came up in discussion, supervisors offered the least restrictive version that met the requirements of the school or district. In addition, Spanish language versions of the parent information letter were made available to the schools. Schools could also send out their own letters and notices if they preferred not to use those offered through NAEP. Information on whether the school required parent letters and the type of letter used was recorded on the School Control Form.\n5.2.4 Recruiting, Hiring, and Training Exercise Administrators\nDuring the fall, while the supervisors were contacting their schools and scheduling assessments, their other major responsibility was to recruit and hire exercise administrators, who would administer the assessment sessions. Exercise administrators were recruited from many sources. Each supervisor was given a PSU-by-PSU computerized list of exercise administrators and other field staff who had worked previously on education studies for Westat. People who had served as exercise administrators before, with good evaluations from their previous supervisors, were usually the first considered for hiring. Subsequently, during contacts with the schools, the supervisors asked the school principals and other staff to recommend potential exercise administrators. These referrals were frequently retired teachers or substitutes. Finally, where necessary, ads were placed in local newspapers and the employment service was notified.\nSupervisors were told that, in general, four to five exercise administrators should be hired for each PSU, although a variety of factors might influence the actual number. The number of schools in a PSU, the size of the student sample in each school, distances to be traveled, the geography of the area, and weather conditions during the assessment period were all factors taken into consideration by supervisors in developing their plan for hiring exercise administrators.\nA few supervisors, whose NAEP assignments contained contiguous PSUs, hired the same exercise administrators to work in all their PSUs. Other supervisors, whose assignments comprised PSUs that were not geographically connected, tended to hire teams of exercise administrators for each PSU. Supervisors were encouraged to hire locally and to hire individuals with teaching experience and the ability to handle classroom situations.\nThe scheduling supervisors, all of whom were experienced NAEP supervisors, had complete responsibility for recruiting, hiring, and training all of the exercise administrators, including ones who would report to different assessment supervisors. The training was standardized so that all supervisors used a prepared script and exercises to train the exercise administrators.\nEach exercise administrator received an exercise administrator manual, which covered the full range of their job responsibilities. After studying the manual, they attended a half-day training session. During the training, the supervisor reviewed all aspects of the exercise administrators' job including preparing materials, booklets, and Administration Schedules for assessments; the actual conduct of the session; post-assessment collection of materials; coding booklet covers; recordkeeping; and administrative matters. In January 1996, each exercise administrator attended a shorter, refresher training session, conducted by the assessment supervisor, to gain further experience with the auxiliary materials, such as mathematics manipulatives and science kits, to be used in specific assessment sessions.\n\n102\n\n1 2 7\n\n\f5.3 SELECTING THE STUDENT SAMPLE FOR MAIN NAEP\n5.3.1 Grade-Eligible Sample\nAfter securing cooperation from the school, the first scheduled visit to the school was made to select the sample of students to take part in the main assessments, and to conclude the arrangements for the actual testing. This visit was made in January by the supervisor responsible for the assessments in the school. Upon arriving at the school (rarely, sampling was done at the district office instead of in the school), the supervisor first reviewed the list of grade-eligible students and confirmed with the school coordinator that all eligible students were listed. If any eligible students were omitted, sampling could not proceed until the list was completed.\nUsing the computer-generated Session Assignment Form (SAF) for the main assessment, which was specific to the school, the supervisor selected the sample of students to be assessed. The SAF documented the types of sessions to be administered, the anticipated number of students to be assessed, the expected number of students eligible for the assessment, and a series of line numbers designating the students to be sampled. Those eligible students on the school's master list whose line numbers were shown on the SAF were selected for the assessment. After making sure that all eligible students had been listed, the supervisor numbered the students on the master list. If the total number of eligible students was within the minimum and maximum limits indicated on the SAF, the supervisor could proceed to select the sample. If the number was outside the limits, the supervisor called Westat for additional sampling instructions. With either the original instructions or revised line numbers, the supervisor proceeded to select the sample of students. The SAFs provided step-by-step instructions for sampling, indicating not just the line number of each student to be selected, but the type of assessment session for which each student was selected.\nOnce students were assigned to sessions, the supervisor and exercise administrators filled out an Administration Schedule for each session. The Administration Schedule is the primary control document for the assessment. It is used to list each sampled student and is the only link between booklets and students. The sample was designed so that about 30 students were assigned to each session. The supervisor discussed the final schedule of the sessions with the school coordinator and the date, time, and location of each session were filled in on the Administration Schedules. Because student names were recorded on the Administration Schedules, those forms remained in the schools after the sample was drawn.\nThe supervisor then asked the school coordinator to identify any students in the sample with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) (for reasons other than being gifted and talented) and/or who were designated as LEP. Any student with either (or both) of these designations was to be indicated on the Administration Schedules. The school was asked to complete an SD/LEP Student Questionnaire for each student with this designation. This was to be completed by a teacher, counselor or other school official who knew the designated student well.\nThe school coordinator was also asked to determine whether any of these students should be excluded from NAEP based on the criteria for assessing SD/LEP students (discussed in detail in Section\n3\n5.3.2). Prehmtnary results indicate that less than half of the students with SD and/or LEP designations were excluded from the assessment. If the school coordinator could not identify the excluded students while the supervisor was at the school, the instructions were left with the Coordinator along with blank copies of the SD/LEP Student Questionnaire. In those cases, the Coordinator consulted with other school\n3 The criteria differs for the main and long-term trend assessments.\n128\n103\n\n\fofficials and informed the supervisor as to who was to be excluded when he/she returned for the assessment.\nAt the end of the sampling visit, if requested by the school, the supervisor and/or exercise administrators made lists of the sampled students for the teachers and/or completed appointment cards notifying students about their assessment schedule. Teacher notification letters were also prepared in some schools, which explained the assessment and listed the students who had been selected.\n5.3.2 Sampling for Special Studies\nTwo special studies, requiring added steps in the sampling process, were included in the main assessment for 1996. (The special studies were not a part of the long-term trend component.) One of these special studies involved students eligible for advanced mathematics or science sessions. The other involved applying two versions of the SD/LEP \"inclusion\" criteria for NAEP assessments and, in some schools, offering accommodations for testing students designated as SD/LEP.\nAdvanced Sessions\nSamples of advanced mathematics oi advanced science students were designated by separate series of line numbers on the SAF as was done for the other session types scheduled for a school. However, before these students could be listed on the Administration Schedule for the advanced session, it was necessary to check each selected student's eligibility using lists of students in advanced courses prepared by the school. The definitions of advanced students were as follows:\nGrade 8 Mathematics: students enrolled in Algebra 1 or beyond at anytime during the 1995-96 school year;\nGrade 12 Mathematics: students enrolled in Algebra 3, Pre-Calculus, Calculus and Analytic Geometry, Calculus or AP Calculus; and\nGrade 12 Science: students enrolled in AP Biology, Chemistry 2 (AP), Physics 1, Physics 2 without Calculus, and Physics 2 (AP).\nThe advanced sessions were available only at grade 8 in mathematics and grade 12 in mathematics and science. Of the students designated for advanced sessions as per the line numbers on the SAF, only those who were also eligible (according to the definitions above) were actually listed on the Administration Schedules for the advanced sessions.\nOne further sampling step was applied in grade 8 and grade 12 schools regardless of whether the school was actually scheduled for an advanced session. After the samples for all sessions were selected, the supervisors compared the school's lists of advanced students against the students selected for each session to determine those students who were eligible for an advanced session. This did not mean that all eligible students would take the advanced session (only those selected and eligible for an advanced session were actually assessed at the advanced level), but the eligibility status was then recorded on the Administration Schedules for all sessions to provide a source of information on the extent to which the school offered advanced mathematics and science courses.\n104\nu 129\n\n\fc:> SD/LEP Sampling and Inclusion Criteria\n\nBecause of increased interest throughout the education community in assessing as many students as possible, NAEP has begun to evaluate the effects of using revised criteria for inclusion of SD/LEP students and providing testing accommodations that are usually offered to these students by their schools. For the 1996 study, the school sample was divided into three subsamples by the statisticians at Westat. The purpose of the subsamples was to: collect data under the same conditions as previous studies in order to maintain trend in mathematics within NAEP; evaluate the impact of a revised, more specific set of inclusion criteria; and evaluate the combined effect of the new criteria and the use of accommodations for testing students. The three subsamples of schools were defined as follows: _\n\nS1 (Sample 1)\n\nThese schools used the criteria from 1990 and 1992, and\naccommodations were not provided. Since the issue of \"trend\" applies to mathematics and not to science, only mathematics was assessed in these schools.\n\nS2 (Sample 2)\n\nThese schools used the new 1996 criteria, but accommodations were not offered. This was designed to evaluate only the impact of changing the criteria.\n\nS3 (Sample 3)\n\nThese schools applied the new 1996, criteria and the\naccommodations most commonly used for achievement testing were offered. For LEP students, the adaptations included a bilingual (English-Spanish) version of the mathematics assessment and a Spanish-language glossary for the science assessment. For IEP students, the accommodations included: small group or one-on-one assessments, untimed assessments, and reading aloud. Large-print and Braille booklets were also\noffered in some mathematics sessions.\n\nDuring the sampling visit, after the samples of students were selected for each session, the schools were asked to identify any sampled students whom the school considered.to be SD/LEP. The school was then asked to complete an SD/LEP Questionnaire regarding each of these students. These basic steps were consistent with previous studies and did not vary among the three types of schools.\n\nFurther, the schools were asked to indicate which of the SD/LEP students should be included in the assessment and which should not. Again, this step is consistent with previous studies, but in 1996, the specific criteria and availability of accommodations varied among the three types of schools. Each school based its decisions about assessing SD/LEP students on the specific criteria provided to that school.\n\nTo produce as large a sample as possible of students from which to evaluate the new criteria and procedures, SD/LEP students were oversampled in certain session types in some schools. This was the case for mathematics sessions at grades 4, 8, and 12 in S2 schools and in both mathematics and science sessions at all three grades in S3 schools. The oversampled students were added to the appropriate Administration Schedules (according to the instructions on the SAF) as part of the sampling process.\n\nThe SAF contained specific instructions on oversampling for the NAEP supervisor if it was required in a particular school. Oversampling of SD/LEP students was performed only in S2 and S3 schools, and the \"pool\" from which the oversample was selected varied according to the grade to be assessed and the types of sessions scheduled.\n\n1 0\n\n105\n\n\fThe pool was defined as:\nGrade 4 any IEP and/or LEP students from the grade-eligible list who were not selected for any session type; or\nGrade 8 or 12 with an advanced session - any IEP and/or LEP students preselected for an advanced session but not eligible for that session; or\nGrade 8 or 12 with no advanced session - any IEP and/or LEP students from the grade-eligible list who were not selected for any session type.\nFor the supervisors to select the oversample correctly, it was necessary to first complete the sampling for every session in the school and to be sure that the school had provided IEP and/or LEP status for every student on the grade-eligible list (i.e., not just for the selected students).\nOnce the oversample pool was established for a particular school, the supervisor numbered (consecutively) the students in the pool. (This was essentially a renumbering and was done separately from the original numbering of all students on the list). The oversample was then selected using the oversampling line numbers specified on the SAF. Students were added to either regular mathematics or regular science sessions according to the specifications on the SAF. The names of the oversampled students were inserted at the end of the appropriate Administration Schedule. The school was asked to complete an SD/LEP Questionnaire on each such student and to determine whether the student should be included in the assessment and, for S3 schools, what specific testing accommodation(s), if any, are called for in the students IEP and/or are normally provided for each student by the school.\nThe unweighted results of the 1996 assessments show that the sampling process generated, in total, 15,871 students to be assessed in S1 schools, 48,769 to be assessed to S2 schools, and 41,513 in S3 schools. These counts include the SD/LEP students that the schools determined should participate in the assessments. Accommodations were used in just over 200 S3 schools (about 30%) for approximately 1,050 students. The most frequently provided accommodations were small group, extended time (untimed testing), and bilingual assessment booklets. These results are very preliminary, however, because they are unweighted and cannot be used to compare results for Sl, S2, and S3 schools (without applying the weighting process). Detailed information and results of the SD/LEP special study will be provided in a separate report.\n5.4 CONDUCTING THE ASSESSMENT SESSIONS\nThe primary responsibility for conducting assessment sessions was given to the exercise administrators. Supervisors were required to observe the first session each exercise administrator conducted to ensure that they followed the procedures properly. Supervisors were also required to be present in all schools with more than one small session to be conducted. The supervisor plays an important role as the liaison between the national assessment and school staff ensuring that the assessments go smoothly.\nTo ensure that sessions were administered in a uniform way, the exercise administrator was provided with scripts for each session type. The scripts were to be read verbatim. The scripts began with a brief introduction to the study. The exercise administrator was then directed to distribute the booklets, being careful to match the student with the preassigned booklet.\n106\n\n\fAfter the booklets were distributed, some additional, scripted directions were read. Students were asked to write in the NAEP school ID (except in grade 4, where NAEP staff entered the ID) and their home ZIP code on the cover of the booklet, and given some general directions in completing the assessment. For fourth grade students, all of the background questions were then read aloud by the exercise administrator; at the upper grades, the first question, which asks the students' race/ethnicity, was read by the exercise administrator, and the students read the rest to themselves. After the background questions were completed, the students were told that any further questions they might have could not be answered by the exercise administrator, and that they were to begin the first cognitive section of the assessment. This process (along with the script) was modified somewhat for science where the background questions were at the end of the assessment booklet, and none of the items was read aloud at grades 8 or 12.\nDuring the sessions, the exercise administrators walked around the room monitoring the students to make sure they were working in the correct section of their booklet and to discourage them from looking at a neighbor's booklet.\nAt the end of each assessment session, booklets were collected and students dismissed according to the school's policy. The exercise administrator was then responsible for completing the information at the top of the Administration Schedule, totaling the number of participating students, and coding the covers of all booklets, including those booklets assigned to absent students.\n\n5.5 RESULTS OF THE MAIN NAEP ASSESSMENT\n\n5.5.1 School and Student Participation\n\nThe unweighted school response rate for the main assessments in 1996 was 82 percent. The final sample of cooperating schools included 604 schools at grade 4, 592 schools at grade 8, and 591 schools at grade 12. Table 5-1 shows comparative response rates for the last four assessment periods.\n\nUnlike the student response rates, there has been a small but steady decline in the main assessment school response rates over the last several assessment periods. This has occurred despite persistent efforts to convert schools and districts that indicate that they are not interested in participating in the assessments. Both Westat field managers and ETS staff have been employed in these conversion efforts.\n\nTable 5-1 Comparison of Student and School Response Rates for Main NAEP, 1990-1996\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\nStudent response\n\nGrade 4\n\n92.9\n\n93.4\n\n93.2\n\n95.5\n\nGrade 8\n\n89.0\n\n88.8\n\n91.0\n\n93.2\n\nGrade 12\n\n80.8\n\n80.8\n\n81.1\n\n80.1\n\nSchool response\n\nGrade 4\n\n88.3\n\n86.4\n\n86.0\n\n85.8\n\nGrade 8\n\n86.7\n\n85.3\n\n85.5\n\n81.9\n\nGrade 12\n\n81.3\n\n81.5\n\n78.6\n\n78.7\n\n107\n132\n\n\fThe most frequently stated reason for school and district refusals has been the increase in testing throughout the jurisdictions and the resulting difficulty in finding time in the school schedule to conduct the NAEP assessments. With so many states now mandating their own testing, school schedules are becoming tighter, and administrators are finding it increasingly difficult to accommodate outside testing. Despite the increased visibility and publicity surrounding NAEP, schools are reluctantly finding it necessary to decline participation as a result of the increasing demands on their students' time.\nOf the 113,846 students sampled for the 1996 assessMent, roughly five percent overall were excluded by schools. Altogether, 94,157 students were assessed across all three grades: 28,528 students were assessed at fourth grade, 32,339 were assessed at eighth grade, and 33,290 students were assessed at twelfth grade. The overall student participation rate was 88.7 percent (after eliminating any withdrawn and excluded students).\nThe response rate at which supervisors were required to conduct a makeup session was raised from the standard that had been used in previous main assessments. The previous rates of 75 percent and 85 percent (in 1994 only) were changed to 90 percent for 1996, that is, any session (or group of sessions within the same subject area) at which fewer than 90 percent of the eligible students were assessed would require a makeup session (assuming that the school was willing to schedule one). This change resulted in 129 schools conducting makeup sessions that would not have been required to do so under the 85 percent rule. In these schools, an additional 595 students were assessed. These 595 students served to increase the overall response by less than one percentage point (0.6%). The greatest increase was at the grade 12 level, where 413 students were assessed in these additional sessions, which raised the response rate for this group of students by about one percentage point.\n5.5.2 Assessment Questionnaires\nWestat provided each school with a School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire a few weeks before the assessment was scheduled to be conducted (i.e., at the time of sampling). At the same time, supervisors prepared an SD/LEP Student Questionnaire for each sampled student with either an IEP and/or LEP designation, with the request that it be completed by someone at the school knowledgeable about that student.\nSelected teachers of fourth- and eighth-grade mathematics and science were asked to fill out Teacher Questionnaires. The teachers asked to participate were the mathematics or science teachers of those students selected for the assessment so that the teacher data could be linked to student performance data. The Teacher Questionnaire for grade 4 was combined into one form since it is recognized that at this grade level, the same teacher would probably teach all of the subjects. For grade 8, there were two distinct questionnaires, one for mathematics teachers and the other for science teachers. At grade 12, a teacher questionnaire was used only for advanced mathematics sessions.\nThe supervisor requested that the Teacher Questionnaires be distributed as quickly as possible after the sampling so that they could be returned by the day of the assessment. Additional introductory materials were included with the Teacher Questionnaires in response to questions that teachers have had in the past about the importance of completing the questionnaires and about NAEP in general. Teachers received a letter explaining the purpose of the Questionnaire, along with background materials about NAEP.\nIf the Teacher Questionnaires were not complete at the time of the assessment, the supervisor left a postage-paid envelope to NCS to be used to return the questionnaires. Table 5-2 shows the number of questionnaires distributed and the number completed.\n108\n133\n\n\fTable 5-2\nBackground Questionnaires Received for Schools, Teachers, and SD/LEP Students in the 1996 Main Assessment'\n\nGrade Assessed\nGrade 4 Number expected Number received Percent received\nGrade 8 Number expected Number received Percent received\n\nSchool Characteristics\nand Policy Questionnaire\n\nTeacher Questionnaires\n\nMathematics/Science\n\n(grade 4 only)\n\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\nSD/LEP Student Questionnaire\n\n605 577\n95%\n\n1,601 1,601 100%\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n5,116 4,885 95%\n\n592\n\nNA\n\n1,400\n\n844\n\n5,048\n\n554\n\nNA\n\n1,365\n\n802\n\n4,770\n\n94%\n\nNA\n\n98%\n\n95%\n\n94%\n\nGrade 122\n\nNumber expected\n\n593\n\nNA\n\n475\n\nNA\n\n4,147\n\nNumber received\n\n546\n\nNA\n\n475\n\nNA\n\n3,806\n\nPercent received\n\n92%\n\nNA\n\n100%\n\nNA\n\n92%\n\n1The numbers in this table reflect the full samples, including SI, S2, and S3. 2 At grade 12, teacher questionnaires were used only for teachers of advanced mathematics. Thus, no data were collected from science teachers, and the data shown here represent teachers of advanced mathematics only.\n\n5.6 LONG-TERM TREND ASSESSMENTS\n5.6.1 Overview\nTo provide continuity and comparability with past NAEP studies, the long-term trend component (formerly referred to as the \"bridge\" assessments) replicates procedures and materials that have been used since the inception of NAEP. Student eligibility in long-term trend is always based on criteria used in years prior to 1988 (when the modal grade for students aged 17 changed from the grade 11 to grade 12). The 1996 schedule for long-term trend assessments was as follows: the fall assessment of age 13/grade 8 students was held in the 11-week period from October 9 through December 22, 1995; the winter assessment of age 9/grade 4 students was held during the 10-week period from January 3 through March 8, 1996; and the spring trend assessment of students who were age.17/grade 11 was conducted in the 9-week period from March 11 through May 10, 1996. Students were assessed in reading, writing, mathematics, and science.\nPaced tape sessions were conducted with samples of age-eligible students only, as was done in all previous years. Additional samples of age- and grade-eligible students were assessed with spiral (print-administered) booklets, following procedures initiated in 1984. Six different types of sessions were conducted: one print-administered and five separate tape-administered sessions. Depending on the size of the school, up to four different session types, involving a total of about 80 students, might have been conducted in a participating school.\n\n1 3 4\n\n109\n\n\f5.6.2 Selecting the Student Sample\nProcedures for sampling in long-term trend schools were very similar to those employed in the schools selected for the main assessment. One to two weeks before the assessment, the supervisor visited the school to select the sample. Lists of students were reviewed to ensure that all age- and grade-eligible students were listed. The SAF for long-term trend schools specified a range for the expected number of eligible students. If the total number of students was within this allowable range, the sampling could proceed. Otherwise, the supervisor called Westat for additional sampling instructions. The SAF directed the supervisor to assign students to long-term trend session types based on their line numbers from the student list that the school had prepared. (The SAFs for the long-term trend sample were like those used in long-term trend sampling for previous years, and were distinct from the SAFs for the main assessment that were described earlier in this report.)\nThe only major variation within the sampling for long-term trend assessments was that, for the tape sessions, only age-eligible students were selected. For these sessions, the supervisor selected from the entire list of students (age- and grade-eligible), but then deleted those who were only grade-eligible before recording the names of the students to be assessed on the Administration Schedules.\nThe criteria for excluding students were also different for the long-term trend schools (compared to the main assessment), and again followed the criteria that were established previously for long-term trend. For those students who were excluded, the school was asked to complete an Excluded Student Questionnaire. If the school coordinator could not identify the excluded students while the supervisor was at the school, a set of instructions for excluding students was left with the coordinator along with the estimated number of questionnaires that would be needed.\n5.6.3 Conduct of the Assessment\nThe conduct of the assessments in schools selected for the long-term trend program is essentially the same as in the schools selected for the main assessment. Scripts are provided for the supervisors and exercise administrators to use in administering the sessions. The major difference compared to main assessment is that most of the sessions are tape administered. In these sessions, after the distribution of the test booklets, the administrator is instructed to turn on the tape recorder. The remainder of the instructions are contained on the tape, and the timing is determined by the length of time that the tape runs.\n5.6.4 Results of Long-Term Trend Assessments\nThe unweighted school response rate for the 1996 long-term trend assessments was 83 percent. The final sample of cooperating schools included 240 schools at age 9/grade 4, and 238 schools at age 13/grade 8, and 191 schools at age 17/grade 11. Nearly 30,000 students were assessed in long-term trend, or 91 percent of those eligible to be assessed.\nOf the 36,371 students sampled for long-term trend assessments, eight percent were excluded by the schools. Overall, 29,791 students were assessed across all three age/grade groups: 10,432 students were assessed at age 9/grade 4, 11,151 students were assessed at age 13/grade 8, and 8,208 were assessed at age 17/grade 11. Table 5-3 shows comparative response rates for the last four long-term trend assessments.\n110\n135 s-)\n\n\fTable 5-3 Comparison of Student and School Response Rates for Long-Term Trend NAEP, 1990-1996\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n19961\n\nStudent response\n\nGrade 4\n\n92.4\n\n94.0\n\n94.2\n\n95.5\n\nGrade 8\n\n90.4\n\n90.8\n\n92.2\n\n91.9\n\nGrade 12\n\n81.2\n\n82.8\n\n84.1\n\n84.0\n\nSchool response\n\nGrade 4\n\n88.1\n\n87.4\n\n86.7\n\n84.8\n\nGrade 8\n\n90.5\n\n84.7\n\n81.7\n\n82.4\n\nGrade 12\n\n80.7\n\n81.3\n\n81.1\n\n81.3\n\n1The numbers in this table reflect the full samples, including SI, S2, and S3.\n\n5.6.5 Assessment Questionnaires\n\nThe School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire and the Excluded Student Questionnaire are forms that were distributed in the schools to be completed by school personnel. The School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire was provided to the school by the assessment supervisor at the time of the sampling visit. This form was to be filled out by the principal or other staff member knowledgeable about the school's administrative policies and staff characteristics. The supervisors collected the completed questionnaire when they returned to the school for the assessment.\n\nAn Excluded Student Questionnaire was to be filled out for every student who was sampled for the assessment but excluded by the school. Following exclusion criteria used in previous long-term trend assessments, schools could exclude students with limited English-speaking ability, those who were educable mentally retarded, or functionally disabled students, if in the judgment of school staff or as indicated in school records, they were unable to \"participate meaningfully\" in the assessment. After the sample of students was drawn and Administration Schedules prepared, the supervisor requested that the school coordinator identify any students who should be excluded. The supervisor then gave an Excluded Student Questionnaire to the coordinator for every excluded student, with the request that it be completed by someone in the school knowledgeable about the student. (Note that this varies somewhat from the main assessment where questionnaires are assigned for all sampled students with an IEP and/or LEP, not just for those who are excluded from the assessment.)\n\nThe supervisor attempted to collect all completed questionnaires (School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire and Excluded Student) on the assessment day. If the questionnaires were not ready, and it was convenient for the supervisor or an exercise administrator to return to the school later to\npick them up, they would do so. Otherwise, the supervisor gave the coordinator a postage-paid envelope to use to mail the forms to NCS. All (100%) of the School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires were completed and returned, and 95.9 percent of the Excluded Student Questionnaires were returned.\n\nOnce the assessments were completed in a school, the supervisor and exercise administrators completed the coding of the front covers of the assessment booklets, filled out the necessary forms, and shipped the booklets and forms to NCS. A copy of all forms was sent to Westat so that progress in the\nfield could be closely monitored.\n\nThe School Worksheet was used by the supervisor to summarize the results of the assessment sessions in each school. The number of students to be assessed, the number actually assessed, and the\n\n136\n\n111\n\n\fnumber absent were entered so that the supervisor could calculate whether a makeup session was required. Attendance of less than 90 percent required a makeup. If a makeup was required for one or more session types, the supervisor discussed the scheduling of the makeup with the school coordinator.\nIn long-term trend assessments prior to 1994, the percentage of students attending that would necessitate a makeup session was 75 percent or below. For 1994, this rate was increased to 85 percent, and it was raised again to 90 percent for 1996. By raising the rate to 90 percent, an additional 144 students were assessed in 73 schools, compared to the 85-percent-rule, increasing the overall student response rate for 1996 by less than one-half of one percentage point (0.44%).\nThe top (original) copy of the School Worksheet, any Excluded Student Questionnaires completed by the school, and the Administration Schedules (with the students' names removed and left at the school) were included with the booklets in the shipment to NCS. In addition, the supervisor included a packing list with the materials, which inventoried the assessment materials assigned to and returned from the school.\n5.7 FIELD MANAGEMENT\nTwo field managers monitored the work of 25 scheduling supervisors who worked during fall 1995 to gain cooperation of districts and schools for the main assessment. During the assessment period,, these staff were expanded to about 75 supervisors and 6 field managers (4 of whom were located in Westat's home office). An additional field manager was assigned exclusively to long-term trend NAEP throughout the gaining cooperation and assessment periods. All supervisors reported directly to their field managers who, in turn, reported to Westat's field director. All contacts were' made at least weekly.\nAn automated management system was developed and maintained in Westat's home office. The scheduling supervisors working to contact schools during the fall used this system on their portable computers. The system contained a record for each sampled school. A disposition code structure was developed to indicate the status of each school's participation (e.g., school cooperating, decision pending, school refusal, district refusal, school closed, etc.). As a school's status was determined, the scheduling supervisors entered the status of the school onto their computers, and this information was downloaded onto the home office system on a weekly basis. Disposition reports were then generated from the receipt system once a week so that home office staff could review the progress of securing cooperation from the sampled schools.\nThese reports were an invaluable tool for the sampling statisticians as well as for the field director and field management staff. They provided the statisticians with the information needed to determine whether the sample of schools was adequate to produce representative results. Based on the information contained in these reports, the sampling statisticians selected substitute schools to replace some of the non-cooperating schools.\nAfter assessments were completed, the system was used to enter data from the School Worksheets (for both Main NAEP and long-term trend) on the number of students to be assessed, the number assessed, and the nurnber absent for each school. Data on completed questionnaires received was provided by NCS. The system was also used to alter school assessment dates, particularly when bad weather required a change in schedule, and to monitor plans for and progress in conducting makeup sessions. Reports were generated weekly during the asgessment period that allowed the project staffto monitor the progress of the assessments both in terms of checking that the schools were assessed on schedule as well as assuring that a high response rate was achieved. The sampling statisticians used these reports to monitor the sample yield by school, PSU, and age/grade level.\n112\nk- 137\n\n\fProgress of the assessments was constantly monitored through telephone reports held between NAEP supervisors, field managers, and home office staff. During these phone conversations, the supervisors' schedules were reviewed and updated, and any problems that the supervisors were experiencing were discussed. Much of the attention this year was focused on maintaining the schedule in light of the many postponements due to severe winter weather.\nThe supervisors who traveled filled out a Work Schedule for a one- to two-week period, showing their whereabouts, so that they could be contacted if necessary. It also allowed field managers and project staff to review the supervisors' schedules and the distribution of work.\nProgress of the field work was also monitored during quality control visits made to the field by Westat and ETS office staff.\n\n138\n\n113\n\n\fChapter 6 PROCESSING ASSESSMENT MATERIALS'\nPatrick B. Bourgeacq, Bradley Thayer, and Timothy Robinson National Computer Systems\n6.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis portion of the report reviews the activities conducted by National Computer Systems (NCS) for the NAEP 1996 main assessments in mathematics and science, and long-term trend assessments in reading, mathematics, science, and writing. As a subcontractor to Educational Testing Service (ETS), NCS was responsible for printing all of the NAEP student booklets and control documents; distributing the assessment materials to the field; receiving, tracking, processing and editing the assessment materials as they returned from the field; scoring all of the constructed-response items (in conjunction with ETS); and delivering the assessment data files to ETS for analysis and reporting.\nFor this assessment, NCS was charged with processing and scoring the largest assessment in the history of NAEP in the shortest amount of time. Further, image scanning processes, eliminating almostall paper handling during scoring and improving monitoring and reliability scoring, increased to nearly twice that of the 1994 assessment. Materials management and distribution of over one quarter of a million science kits, receipt control processing for all receipts within 48 hours, image scanning throughput increased nearly twice that of 1995, and professional scoring of over nine million constructed responses highlight the challenges met by NCS for the 1996 NAEP national and state assessments.\nNCS processed more than 134,000 booklets for the NAEP 1996 national assessment, as shown in Tables 6-1 and 6-2. NCS also received and processed a total of over 2,300 school characteristics and policies questionnaires, over 4,700 teacher questionnaires, and over 16,274 SD/LEP questionnaires for the three grades, as shown in Table 6-3. Table 6-4 lists key events and dates in the NAEP schedule.\nThis chapter of the report reviews the activities conducted by NCS for the NAEP 1996 main and long-term trend assessments.\n1 Bradley Thayer was the NCS project manager for 1996 NAEP, Patrick Bourgeacq was the NCS project director for 1996 NAEP scoring, and Timothy Robinson was the NCS senior processing coordinator for 1996 NAEP.\n115\n139\n\n\fTable 6-1 Processing and Scoring Totals for the 1996 NAEP.Assessment\n\nNumber of ConstructedBooklets Response Processed Items'\n\nNumber of Number of Scorers and Responses Team\nScored2 Leaders3\n\nLength of Training and\nScoring\n\nFall Trend\n\nReading/Writing\n\n5,287\n\n22\n\nFall Trend\n\nMathematics\n\n5,727\n\n28\n\nWinter Trend\n\nReading/Writing\n\n4,988\n\n20\n\nWinter Trend\n\nMathematics\n\n5,442\n\n29\n\nSpring Trend\n\nReading/Writing\n\n4,669\n\n25\n\nSpring Trend\n\nMathematics\n\n3,570\n\n29\n\nLong-Term Trend\n\nWriting Holistic\n\nN/A\n\n6\n\nLong-Term Trend\n\nWriting Mechanics\n\nN/A\n\n3\n\n1990 Rescore\n\n4th Grade Mathematics\n\n749\n\n12\n\n1990 Rescore\n\n8th Grade Mathematics\n\n730\n\n18\n\n1990 Rescore\n\n12th Grade Mathematics\n\n725\n\n21\n\n1992 Rescore\n\n4th Grade Mathematics\n\n2,498\n\n36\n\n1992 Rescore\n\n8th Grade Mathematics\n\n2,498\n\n44\n\n1992 Rescore\n\n12th Grade Mathematics 2,498\n\n44\n\nNational 4th Grade\n\nMathematics Spiral\n\n10,816\n\n64\n\nNational 4th Grade\n\nMathematics Estimation 2,128\n\n3\n\nNational 4th Grade\n\nMathematics Theme\n\n4,038\n\n13\n\nNational 8th Grade\n\nMathematics Spiral\n\n11,554\n\n69\n\n42,741 88,782 34,341 86,322 43,094 86,478 63,793 2,329 8,988 13,374 15,225 27,031 33,077 32,387 170,219 7,756 29,750 195,764\n\n7 / 1 11/29/95 1/5/96\n\n11 / 0 12/18/95 1/5/96\n\n6 / 1\n\n1/30/96 4/3/96\n\n9 / 1 3/25/96 - 3/29/96\n\n6 % 1 4/10/96 5/24/96\n\n5 / 1 5/13/96 5/22/96\n\n56 / 7 6/10/96 6/16/96\n\n33 / 6 7/15/96 7/31/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 - 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n1.98 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 - 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n198 / 17 3/13/96 5/6/96\n\n1 This is the number of discrete constructed-response items in assessment booklets. 2 This is the number of student responses to the constructed-response items.

the information necessary for documentation of accurate sampling and for calculating sampling weights is collected on the Administration Schedules that, until 1993, were painstakingly filled out by hand by Westat administrative personnel. In 1994, for the first time, much of the work was computerizedbooklets were preassigned and booklet ID numbers were preprinted on the Administration Schedule. When Westat personnel received the documents, they filled in only the \"exception\" information. This new method also permitted computerized updating of information when the Administration Schedules were received at NCS, eliminating the need to sort and track 'thousands of pieces of paper through the processing stream.\nThe introduction of image processing and image scoring further enhanced the work of NAEP. Image processing and scoring were successfully piloted in a side-by-side study conducted during the 1993 NAEP field test, and so became the primary processing and scoring methods for the 1994 and 1996 assessments. Image processing allowed the automatic collection of handwritten demographic data from the administrative schedules and the student test booklet covers through intelligent character recognition (ICR). This service was a benefit to the jurisdictions participating in NAEP because they were able to write rather than grid certain informationa reduction of burdenon the schools. Image processing also made image scoring possible, eliminating much of the time spent moving paper as part of the scoring process. The images of student responses to be scored were transmitted electronically to the scoring center, located at a separate facility from where the materials were processed. This process enhanced the reliability and monitoring of scoring and allowed both NCS and ETS to focus attention on the intellectual process of scoring student responses.\n\n126\n150\n\n\f6.2 PRINTING\nFor the 1996 assessment, 255 unique documents were designed. NCS printed more than 1,900,000 booklets and forms, totaling over 58 million pages. Printing preparations began with the design of the booklet covers in June 1995. This was a collaborative effort involving staff from ETS, Westat and NCS. Since the goal was to design one format for use with all of the booklets, necessary data elements to be collected for the different assessment types had to be agreed upon. After various iterations, the cover design was finalized.\nIn a similar collaboration with ETS and Westat, NCS prepared administration schedules and questionnaire rosters. The camera-ready copies for these documents were created and edited using NCS Design ExpertTM software.\nPrinting of the NAEP documents began with the documents for the long-term trend assessments. These included the 26 long-term trend assessment booklets, the Administration Schedule, the excluded student questionnaire, three school characteristics and policies questionnaires, and the roster of questionnaires. All materials for the long-term trend assessments were printed by September 19, 1995. The printing of assessment booklets, questionnaires and tracking forms for the main and state assessments followed. Printing of these documents was complete by December 11, 1995.\nDetails of the printing procedures are given in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (National Computer Systems, 1996).\n6.3 PACKAGING AND SHIPPING\nThe distribution effort for the 1996 NAEP assessment involved packaging and mailing documents and associated forms and materials to the Westat supervisors for the main and long-term trend assessments. The NAEP Materials Distribution System (MDS), initially developed by NCS in 1990 to control shipments to the schools and supervisors, was utilized again in 1996. Files in the MDS system contained the names and addresses for shipment of materials, scheduled assessment dates, and a listing of all materials available for use by a participant in a particular subject area. Changes to any of this information were made diiectly in the MDS file either manually or via file updates provided by Westat. Details of the accountability system and on-line bundle assignment and distribution system utilized for NAEP are given in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities.\nThe bar code technology introduced by NCS in the 1990 assessments continued to be utilized in document control. To identify each document, NCS utilized a unique ten-digit numbering system that consisted of the three-digit booklet number or form type, a six-digit sequential number, and a check digit. Each form was assigned a range of ID numbers. Bar codes reflecting this ID number were applied to the front cover of each document by NCS bar code processes and high-speed ink jet printers.\nOnce all booklets from a subject area were bar coded, they were spiraled and bundled into groups of 11 documents. For main samples in mathematics and science (done concurrently with the State Assessment samples in mathematics and science), NCS spiraled the booklets according to the pattern dictated by ETS in the bundle maps. Booklets were spiraled in such a manner that each booklet appeared in the first position in a bundle approximately the same number of times and the booklets were evenly distributed across the bundles. This assured that sample sizes of individual booklet types would not be jeopardized if entire bundles were not used. Since the mathematics and science estimation and advanced\n\n151\n\n127\n\n\fbooklet bundles contained only one booklet type, these-were bundled into groups of 11. The mathematics bilingual booklets were bundled in groups of three.\nInitially 5,161 individual sessions were shipped for the 1996 NAEP assessments. Approximately 600 additional shipments of booklets and miscellaneous materials were sent. All outbound shipments were recorded in the NCS Outbound Mail Management system. This was accomplished by having a bar code containing the school number on each address label. This bar code was read into the system, which determined the routing of the shipment and the charges. Information was recorded in a file on the system which, at the end of each day, was transferred by a PC upload to the mainframe. A computer program could then access information to produce reports on all shipments sent, regardless of the carrier used. These reports helped NCS phone staff trace shipments for Westat supervisors and assessment administrators.\nA toll-free telephone line was maintained for supervisors and school administrators to request additional materials for the National assessments. To process a shipment, NCS phone staff asked the caller for information such as primary sampling unit (PSU), school ID, assessment type, city, state, and ZIP code. This information was then entered into the on-line short shipment system and the school's mailing address would be displayed on the screen to verify with the caller. The system allowed NCS staff to change the shipping address for individual requests. The clerk proceeded to the next screen that displayed the materials to be selected. After the requested items, due date and method of shipment were entered, the system produced a packing list and mailing labels. Phone staff also took phone calls concerning initial shipment delivery dates, tracing a shipment, and questions concerning NAEP. Approximately 750 calls were received regarding the 1996 NAEP assessments.\nFurther information regarding packaging and shipping is provided in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (National Computer Systems, 1996).\n6.4 PROCESSING\n6.4.1 Overview\nThe following describes the various stages of work involved in receiving and processing the documents used in the 1996 assessment. NCS staff created a set of predetermined rules and specifications for the processing departments within NCS to follow. Project staff performed a variety of procedures on materials received from the assessment administrators before releasing these materials into the NCS NAEP processing system. Control systems were used to monitor all NAEP materials returned from the field. The NAEP Process Control System (PCS) contained the status of sampled schools for all sessions and their scheduled assessment dates. As materials were returned, the PCS was updated to indicate receipt dates, to record counts of materials returned, and to document any problems discovered in the shipments. As documents were processed, the system was updated to reflect processed counts. NCS report programs were utilized to allow ETS, Westat, and NCS staff to monitor the progress in the receipt control operations.\nAn \"alert\" process was used to record, monitor, and categorize all discrepant or problematic situations. Throughout the processing cycle, alert situations were either flagged by computer programs or identified during clerical check-in procedures. Certain alerts, such as missing demographic information on the administration schedule, were resolved by opening staff retrieving the information from booklet covers. These alerts, known as \"Information Alerts,\" were recorded directly into the PCS system by opening personnel, eliminating the need for paper documentation. Since these problem situations were\n128\n152\n\n\fcategorized and tallied as they were key-entered into the PCS system, project staff were able to provide timely reporting on clerical-type errors made during test administration. Alert situations that could not be resolved by opening personnel were described on alert forms that were forwarded to project personnel for resolution. Once resolved, the problems and resolutions were recorded online in the PCS system.\nNCS's Work Flow Management System was used to track batches of student booklets through each processing step, allowing project staff to monitor the status of all work in progress. It was also used by NCS to analyze the current work load, by project, across all work stations. By routinely monitoring these data, NCS's management staff was able to assign priorities to various components of the work and to monitor all phases of the data receipt and processing.\n\n6.4.2 Document Receipt\nShipments were to be returned to NCS packaged in their original boxes. As mentioned earlier, NCS packaging staff applied a bar code label to each box indicating the NAEP school rD number. When a shipment arrived at the NCS dock area, this bar code was scanned into a personal computer file, and the shipment was forwarded to the receiving area. The file was then transferred to the mainframe and the shipment receipt date was applied to the appropriate school within the PCS system, providing the status of receipts regardless of any processing delays. Each receipt was reflected on the PCS status report provided to the NCS receiving department and supplied to Westat via electronic file transfer and in hardcopy format. ETS also received a hard copy..\nThe PCS file could be manually updated to reflect changes. Receiving personnel also checked the shipment to verify that the contents of the box matched the school and session indicated on the label. Each shipment was checked for completeness and accuracy. Any shipment not received within two days of the scheduled assessment date was flagged in the PCS system and annotated on the PCS report. The administration status of these delayed shipments was checked and in some cases a trace was initiated on the shipment.\nA new requirement for NCS was to open all shipments within forty-eight hours of their receipt and to key-enter preliminary processing information into the PCS system from the Administration Schedule. The preliminary information was written on the Administration Schedule by Westat assessment administrators and consisted,of the following:\nSchool number Session number Original test date Total number assessed\nThis preliminary information, used to provide Westat with timely student response rates, was updated with actual data when materials passed through processing error free. A completeness flag was also applied to the PCS file by NCS opening staff if any part of the shipment was missing.\nIf multiple sessions were returned in one box, the contents of the package were separated by session. The shipment was checked to verify that all booklets preprinted or handwritten on the Administration Schedule were returned with the shipment and that all administration codes matched from booklet cover to the Administration Schedule. If discrepancies were discovered at any step in this process, the receiving staff issued an alert to facilitate tracking. If the administrator indicated that a makeup session was being held the documents were placed on holding carts until the make-up session\n\n153\n\n129\n\n\fdocUments arrived. If no make-up session was indicated, Westat was contacted for the status of the missing materials. If the missing materials were to be returned, the documents already received were held until that time. If the materials were not being returned, processing continued and the appropriate administration code was applied to the Administration Schedule.\n6.4.3 Batching and Scanning Documents\nOnce all booklets listed on the Administration Schedule for a session were verified as present, the entire session (both the Administration Schedule and booklets) was batched by grade level and session type. Each batch was assigned a unique batch number. This number, created on the Image Capture Environment system for all image-scannable documents and on the Work Flow Management system for all key-entry and OMR-scannable documents2, facilitated the internal tracking of the batches and allowed departmental resource planning. All other scannable documents (School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires, Teacher Questionnaires, Students with Disabilities/Limited English Proficiency [SD/LEP] Questionnaires, and rosters) were batched by document type in the same manner.\nBecause all assessment booklets were image-scannable, batch numbers for these documents were created on the Image Capture Environment system. Sessions were sorted by grade level and automatically uploaded to the Work Flow Management system after batch creation. The Administration Schedule for these document types was used as a session header within a batch.\nWhen batching mathematics documents, NCS needed to allow for having both image-scannable and key-entry documents present in the same session, or having booklets listed on the Administration Schedule that would not be present in processing. This was due to the testing accommodations of largeprint and Braille that were key-entry documents.\nLarge-print booklets had to be processed separately from the Administration Schedule and scannable booklets in their session. A key-entry session header was created for these booklets that contained the school ID number and session code from the Administration Schedule. Long-term trend reading/writing booklets were processed through key-entry with the same type of key-entry session header. The Administration Schedules from reading/writing sessions were processed in an Administration-Schedule-only batch through the image scanning system. After the session that a largeprint booklet came with passed through image processing, session information was rejoined within the processing computer programs. The same computerized match occurred with Trend reading/writing materials once the Administration-Schedule-Only batch that contained a session's administration schedule passed through processing.\n6.4.4 Questionnaires\nThe long-term trend assessments used one roster to account for all questionnaires. The roster of questionnaires recorded the distribution and return of the School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires and the Excluded Student Questionnaires.\nThe main assessments utilized one roster to document and track the School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires and the Students with Disabilities/Limited English Proficiency (SD/LEP) Questionnaire. In addition, the main and state assessments used the roster of Teacher Questionnaires to record the distribution and return of Teacher Questionnaires.\n2 OMR is the acronym for Optical Mark Reading.\n130\n154\n\n\fSome questionnaires may not have been available for return with the shipment. These were returned to NCS at a later date in an envelope provided for that purpose. The questionnaires were submitted for scanning as sufficient quantities became available for batching.\nReceipt of the questionnaires was entered into the system using the same process as was used for the Administration Schedules described in previous sections. The rosters were grouped with other rosters of the same type from other sessions, and a batch was created on the Image Capture Environment system. The batch was then forwarded to scanning where all information on the rosters was scanned into the system.\n6.4.5 Booklet Accountability\nNCS used a sophisticated booklet accountability system to track all distributed booklets. Prior to the distribution of NAEP materials, unique booklet numbers were read by bundle into a file. Specific bundles were then assigned to particular supervisors or schools. This assignment was recorded in the NAEP Materials Distribution System.\nWhen shipments arrived at NCS from the field, all used booklets were submitted for processing and a \"processed documents\" file was maintained. Unused booklets were submitted for security scanning where booklet ID bar codes were read and recorded into a separate file. This file and the \"processed documents\" file were later compared to the original bundle security file for individual booklet matching. A list of unmatched booklet IDs was printed in a report used to confirm non-receipt of individual booklets. At the end of the assessment period, supervisors returned all unused materials. These booklet IDs were also read by the bar-code scanner and added to the bundle security file. All unused materials received were then inventoried and sent to the NCS warehouse for storage while awaiting authorization from ETS to salvage them.\n6.4.6 Data Entry\nThe data entry process was the first point at which booklet-level data were directly available to the computer system. Depending on the NAEP document, one of three methods was used to transcribe NAEP data to a computerized form. The data on scannable documents were collected using NCS opticalscanning equipment that also captured images of the constructed-response items and ICR fields. Nonscannable materials were keyed through an interactive online system. In both of these cases, the data were edited and suspect cases were resolved before further processing.\nAll student booklets, questionnaires, and control documents were scannable. Throughout all phases of processing, the student booklets were batched by grade and session type. The scannable documents were then transported to a slitting area where the folded and stapled spine was removed from the document. This process utilized an \"intelligent slitter\" to prevent slitting the wrong side of the document. The documents were jogged by machine so that the registration edges of the NAEP documents were smoothly aligned, and the stacks were then returned to the cart to be scanned.\nDuring the scanning process, each scannable NAEP document was uniquely identified using a print-after-scan number consisting of the scan batch number, the sequential number within the batch, and the bar code ID of the booklet. These numbers were printed on each sheet of each document as it exited the scanner. This permitted the data editors to quickly and accurately locate specific documents during\n131\n\n\fthe editing phase. The print-after-scan number remained with the data record, providing a method for easy identification and quick retrieval of any document.\nThe data values were captured from the booklet covers and Administration Schedules and were coded as numeric data. Unmarked fields were coded as blanks and editing staff were alerted to missing or uncoded critical data. Fields that had multiple marks were coded as asterisks (*). The data values for the item responses and scores were returned as numeric codes. The multiple-choice single response format items were assigned codes depending on the position of the response alternative; that is, the first choice was assigned the code \"1,\" the second \"2,\" and so forth. The mark-all-that-apply items were given as many data fields as response alternatives; the marked choices were coded as \"1\" while the unmarked choices were recorded as blanks. The images of constructed-response items were saved as a digitized computer file. The area of the page that needed to be clipped was defined prior to scanning through the document definition process. The fields from unreadable pages were coded \"X\" as a flag for resolution staff to correct. In addition to capturing the student responses, the bar code identification numbers used to maintain process control were decoded and transcribed to the NAEP computerized data file.\nAs the scanning program completed scanning each stack, the stack was removed from the output hopper and placed in the same order they were scanned on the output cart. The next stack was removed from the input cart and placed into the input hopper, after which the scanning resumed. When the operator had completed processing the last stack of the batch, the program was terminated. This closed the dataset that automatically became available for the data validation (edit) process. The scanned documents were then forwarded to a holding area in case they needed to be retrieved for resolution of edit errors.\nNCS again used the ICR engine to read various hand and machine printing on the front cover of the assessment and supervisor documents for the 1996 NAEP assessments. Some information from scannable student documents, such as the Administration Schedule, the roster of questionnaires, and some questions in the School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires, were read by the ICR engine and verified by an online key-entry operator. In all, the ICR engine read approximately 15 million characters. The ICR engine saved NAEP field staff and school personnel a significant amount of time because they no longer had to enter these data by gridding rows and columns of data.\nNCS also implemented new programs that allowed the scanners to read imprinted codes, known as 2-out-of-5 codes, that were printed via a Xerox 4280 printer on the Administration Schedule. These 2-out-of-5 codes were imprinted at the same time the booklet II) numbers were printed on the Administration Schedule and identified which booklet IDs were listed on that document. When the scanning programs were unable to translate the 2-out-of-5 codes (thereby identifying the booklet ID numbers on the document) image clips of the booklet ID numbers were displayed to online editing staff for verification. This eliminated a significant amount of online editing time needed to process the NAEP assessments.\nTo provide another quality check on the image scanning and scoring system, NCS staff stamped blank booklets with a rubber stamp and assigned these booklets mock scores from the valid range. Each unique item type scored via the image system had two quality control stamps per valid score. An example of the stamp used is given below.\nIMAGE SCORING QUALITY ASSURANCE SAMPLE\n132\n1 6\n\n\fThe quality control booklets were batched and processed together with student documents of the same type. Because all of a specific item were batched together for transmission to the scoring facility, the quality control-stamped responses were integrated with the student responses and transmitted simultaneously to the scoring facility. During the scoring process, both student responses and the quality control items were randomly displayed so scores could be applied.\nWhen a person who was scoring responses (reader) later saw the quality control sample on the monitor during scoring, he or she was to notify the team leader, who confirmed the score assigned by the reader was the score listed on the sample. The quality control booklets were included in the pool of all items to be drawn from for the 25 percent reliability rescore.\nAll image quality-assurance documents were created prior to the beginning of scoring and all predetermined score points were used. Because during the process of scoring, valid score points can be changed or dropped completely, NCS provided ETS with documentation explaining what quality control documents were produced and which score points on these items were no longer valid. When an image quality control stamp was displayed to a reader that contained a score point that was no longer valid, the reader gave the response a score point of zero.\nA process of key entry and verification was used to make corrections to the non-scannable long-term trend reading/writing documents and large print booklets. Teacher questionnaire and SD/LEP questionnaire information was also corrected using key-entry methods. NCS used the Falcon system to enter this data. The Falcon system is an on-line data-entry system designed to replace most methods of data input such as keypunch, key-to-disk, and many of the microcomputer data-entry systems. The terminal screens were designed to enhance operator speed and convenience. The fields to be entered were titled to reflect the actual source document. Therefore, all key-entry fields were specific to the NAEP student documents or questionnaire types being keyed.\n6.4.7 Data Validation\nEach dataset produced by the scanning system contained data for a particular batch. These data had to be validated (or edited) for type and range of response. The data-entry and resolution system used was able to simultaneously process a variety of materials from all age groups, subject areas, control documents, and questionnaires as the materials were submitted to the system from scannable and nonscannable media.\nThe data records in the scan file were organized in the same order in which the paper materials were processed by the scanner. A record for each batch header preceded all data records for that batch. The document code field on each record distinguished the header record from the data records.\nWhen a batch-header record was read, a pre-edit data file and an edit log were generated. As the program processed each record within a batch from the scan file, it wrote the edited and reformatted data records to the pre-edit file and recorded all errors on the edit log. The data fields on an edit log record identified each data problem by the batch sequence number, booklet serial number, section or block code, field name or item number, and data value. After each batch had been processed, the program generated a listing or online edit file of the data problems and resolution guidelines. An edit log listing was printed at the termination of the program for all non-image documents. Image \"clips\" requiring editing were routed to online editing stations for those documents that were image scanned.\nAs the program processed each data record, it first read the booklet number and checked it against the session code for appropriate session type. Any mismatch was recorded on the error log and processing\n133\n157\n\n\fcontinued. The booklet number was then compared against the first three digits of the student identification number. If they did not match, a message was written on the error log. The remaining booklet cover fields were read and validated for the correct range of values. The school codes had to be identical to those on the PCS record. All data values that were out of range were read \"as is\" but were flagged as suspect. All data fields that were read as asterisks (*) were recorded on the edit log or online edit file.\nDocument definition files described each document as a series of blocks that in turn were described as a series of items. The blocks in a document were transcribed in the order that they appeared in the document. Each block's fields were validated during this process. If a document contained suspect fields, the cover information was recorded on the edit log along with a description of the suspect data. The edited booklet cover was transferred to an output buffer area within the program. As the program processed each blo-ck of data from the dataset record, it appended the edited data fields to the data already in this b-uffer.\nThe program then cycled through the data area corresponding to the item blocks. The task of translating, validating, and reporting errors for each data field in each block was performed by a routine that required only the block identification code and the string of input data. This routine had access to a block definition file that had, for each block, the number of fields to be processed, and, for each field, the field type (alphabetic or numeric), the field width in the data record, and the valid range of values. The routine then processed each field in sequence order, performing the necessary translation, validation, and reporting tasks.\nThe first of these tasks checked for the presence of blanks or asterisks (*) in a critical field. These were recorded on the edit log or online edit file and processing continued with the next field. No action was taken on blank fields for multiple-choice items because the asterisk code indicated a non-response. The field was validated for range of response, and any values outside of the specified range were recorded on the edit log or online edit file. The program used the item-type code to make a further distinction among constructed-response item scores and other numeric data fields.\nMoving the translated and edited data field into the output buffer was the last task performed in this phase of processing. When the entire document was processed, the completed string of data was written to the data file. When the program encountered the end of a file, it closed the dataset and generated an edit listing for non-image and key-entered documents. Image-scanned items that required correction were displayed at an online editing terminal.\n6.4.8 Editing for Non-Image and Key-Entered Documents\nThroughout the system, quality procedures and software ensured that the NAEP data were correct. All student documents on the Administration Schedule were accounted for, as receipt control personnel checked that the materials were undamaged and assembled correctly. The machine edits performed during data capture verified that each sheet of each document was present and that each field had an appropriate value. All batches entered into the system, whether key-entered or machine-scanned, were edited for errors.\nData editing took place after these checks. This consisted of a computerized edit review of each respondent's document and the clerical edits necessary to make corrections based upon the computer edit. This data-editing step was repeated until all data were correct.\n134\nUL 158\n\n\fThe first phase of data editing was designed to validate the population and ensure that all documents were present. A computerized edit list, produced after NAEP documents were scanned or key entered, and all the supporting documentation sent from the field were used to perform the edit function. The hard-copy edit list contained all the vital statistics about the batch: number of students, school code, type of document, assessment code, suspect cases, and record serial numbers. Using these inputs, the data editor verified that the batch had been assembled correctly and that each school number was correct.\nDuring data entry, counts of processed documents were generated by type. These counts were compared against the information captured from the Administration Schedules. The number of assessed and absent students processed had to match the numbers indicated on the PCS.\nIn the second phase of data editing, experienced editing staff used a predetermined set of specifications to review the field errors and record necessary corrections to the student data file. The same computerized edit list used in phase one was used to perform this function. The editing staff reviewed the computer-generated edit log and the area of the source document that was noted as being suspect or as containing possible errors. The composition of the field was shown in the edit box. The editing staff checked this piece of information against the NAEP source document. At that point, one of the following took place:\nCorrectable error. If the error was correctable by the editing staff as per the editing specifications, the correction was noted on the edit log for later correction via key-entry.\nAlert. If an error was not correctable as per the specifications, an alert was issued to NAEP project staff for resolution. Once the correct information was obtained, the correction was noted on the edit log for key-entry correction.\nNon-correctable error. If a suspected error was found to be correct as stated and no alteration was possible according to the source document and specifications, the programs were tailored to allow this information to be accepted into the data record. No corrective action was taken.\nThe corrected edit log was then forwarded to the key-entry staff for processing. When all corrections were entered and verified for a batch, an extract program pulled the corrected records into a mainframe dataset. At this point, the mainframe edit program was initiated. The edit criteria were again applied to all records. If there were further errors, a new edit listing was printed and the cycle was repeated.\nWhen the edit process produced an error-free file, the booklet ID number was posted to the NAEP tracking file by age, assessment, and school. This permitted NCS staff to monitor the NAEP processing effort by accurately measuring the number of documents processed by form. The posting of booklet IDs also ensured that a booklet ID was not processed more than once.\n6.4.9 Data Validation and Editing of Image-Processed Documents\nThe paper edit log for key-entered documents was replaced by online viewingof suspect data for all image-processed documents. For rapid resolution, the edit criteria for each item in question appeared on the screen along with the suspect item. Corrections were made immediately. The system employed an edit/verify system that ultimately meant that two different people viewed the same suspect data and operated on it separately. The \"verifier\" made sure the two responses (one from either the entry operator or the ICR engine) were the same before the system accepted that iterh ing correct. The verifiers\n135\n169\n\n\fcould either overrule or agree with the original correction made if the two did not match. If the editor could not determine the appropriate response, he or she escalated the suspect situation to a supervisor. For errors or suspect information that could not be resolved by supervisory staff, a product-line queue was created. This allowed supervisors to escalate edits to project staff for resolution. By having this productline queue, project staff were able to quickly locate edit clips within the image system, speeding up the resolution process.\nOnce an entire batch was through the edit phase, it became eligible for the count-verification phase. The Administration Schedule data were examined systematically for booklet IDs that should have been processed (assessed administration codes). All documents under that Administration Schedule were then inspected to ensure that all of the booklets were included.\nWith the satisfactory conclusion of the count-verification phase, the edited batch file was uploaded to the mainframe, where it went through yet another edit process. A paper edit log was produced and, if errors remained, was forwarded to another editor..When this paper edit was satisfied, the PCS and Workflow Management system were updated. Because there was a possible time lag between a clean edit in the image system and a clean edit in the mainframe systems, the batch was not archived until 48 hours after the image edit phase was completed.\n6.4.10 Data Transmission\nDue to the rapid pace of scoring on an item-by-item basis, the NCS scoring specialists found it necessary to continually monitor the status of work available to the readers and plan the scoring schedule several weeks in advance. On Wednesday of each week, the NCS performance assessment specialist in charge of each subject area planned the next two weeks' schedule. That information was then provided to the person in charge of downloading data to the scoring center. By planning the scoring schedule two weeks in advance, the scoring specialists were able to ensure that readers would have sufficient work for at least one week, after which the next download would occur to supplement the volume of any unscored items and add an additional week's work to the pool of items to score. Additionally, by scheduling two weeks' data transmission, flexibility was added to the scoring schedule, making it possible to implement last-minute changes in the schedule once the items had been delivered to the scoring center. Depending on the number of items to be transmitted, the actual downloading was conducted on Friday or was divided into two smaller sessions for Thursday and Friday download. By the first week of May 1996, there was sufficient space on the scoring servers to load all remaining unscored items to the scoring center.\nDelivery of data to the scoring center was accomplished via several T1 transmission lines linking the mainframe computers and the NAEP servers at the document-scanning site in the NCS main facility with the scoring servers dedicated to distributing work to the professional readers at the scoring center. The actual task of scheduling items for downloading was accomplished using a code written by the Image Software Development team. This code enabled the person scheduling the download to choose a team of readers and select the scheduled items from a list of all items that that team would be scoring throughout the scoring project. This process was repeated for all teams of readers until all anticipated work was scheduled. Once this task was completed, the scheduled job was tested to determine if there was sufficient free disk space on the servers at the scoring center. If for any reason sufficient disk space was not available, scheduled items could be deleted from the batch individually or as a group until the scheduled batch job could accommodate all items on the available disk space at the scoring center. Once it was determined that sufficient disk space was available, transmission of student responses commenced. Data transmission was typically accomplished during off-shift hours to minimize the impact on systemload capacity.\n136\n160\n\n\f6.5 DATA DELIVERY\nThe 1996 NAEP data collection resulted in several classes of data files student, school, teacher, weights, SD/LEP student, excluded student questionnaire data for long-term trends, studentiteacher match, and student-response information. Student-response information included response data from all assessed students in 1996. Data resolution activities occurred prior to the submission of data files to ETS and Westat to resolve any irregularities that existed. This section details additional steps performed before creating the final data files to ensure capture of the most complete and accurate information.\nAn important quality-control component of the image-scoring system was the inclusion, for purposes of file identification, of an exact copy of the student edit record, including the student booklet ID number, with every image of a student's response to a constructed-response item. These edit files also remained in the main data files residing on the NCS mainframe computer. By doing this, exact matching of scores assigned to constructed-response items and all other data for each individual student was guaranteed, since the booklet ID for each image was part of every image file. This ensured scores were applied to the correct student's record on the mainframe.\nWhen all of the responses for an individual item had been scored, the system automatically submitted all item scores assigned during scoring, along with their edit records, to a queue to be transmitted to the mainframe. Project staff then initiated a system job to transmit all scoring data to be matched with the original student records on the mainframe. A custom edit program matched the edit records of the scoring files to those of the original edit records on the mainframe. As matches were confirmed, the scores were applied to those individual files. After completion of this stage, all data collected for an individual student was located in one single and complete record/file identified by the edit record.\nNCS processed the SD/LEP student questionnaires via OMR scanning. Edits performed on the questionnaires assured that responses to questions fell within the valid range for that question. SD/LEP questionnaires were then matched to a student record. SD/LEP Questionnaires that were not matched to a student document were cross-referenced with the corresponding Administration Schedule, roster of questionnaires, and student data files to correct, if necessary, the information needed to result in a match.\nIn 1996, NCS continued to use ICR technology to capture percentage figures written by school personnel directly in boxes on the school characteristics and policies questionnaires rather than requiring the school official to grid ovals in a matrix. The data were then verified by an edit operator.\nTo achieve the best possible student/teacher match rate, the same processes that were followed in previous cycles were used in 1996. The first step was to identify teacher questionnaires not returned to NCS,for processing so as to exclude from the matching process the students of these teachers. Student identification numbers that were not matched to a teacher questionnaire were cross-referenced with the corresponding Administration Schedule and roster of teacher questionnaires to verify (and change, if necessary) the teacher number, teacher period, and questionnaire number recorded on these control documents. The NAEP school numbers listed on the roster of questionnaires and teacher questionnaire were verified and corrected, if necessary. Once these changes were made, any duplicate teacher numbers existing within a school were, if possible, cross-referenced for resolution with the roster of questionnaires. Since this information was located together on a single, central control document, the ability to match and resolve discrepant or missing fields was simplified.\n\n161\n\n137\n\n\fAfter all data-processing activities were completed, data cartridges and/or diskettes were created and shipped via overnight delivery to ETS and/or Westat. A duplicate archive file is maintained at NCS for security and backup purposes.\n6.6 MISCELLANEOUS\n6.6.1 Storage of Documents\nAfter batches of image-scanned documents had successfully passed the editing process, they were sent to the NCS warehouse for storage. The long-term trend reading/writing booklets were sent to the NCS scoring center to be scored on paper and to be used for holistic and mechanics scoring. After all scoring had been completed for the long-term trend booklets, they were also sent to the warehouse for storage. Due to the large number of rescore projects done with NAEP material, the documents were unspiraled and sequenced by grade and booklet type after all of the processing/scoring was completed. This will allow for efficient document retrieval to fill requests for specific booklet types for future scoring projects. Unspiraled and sequenced booklets were then assigned a new inventory number by grade and booklet type and sent back to the warehouse for storage. The storage locations of all documents were recorded on the inventory control system. Unused materials were sent to temporary storage to await completion of the entire assessment. Once the assessment was complete, NCS received authorization from ETS to salvage unused materials after determining that a sufficient quantity of each form type was retained in permanent archive.\n6.6.2 Quality-Control Documents\nETS requires that a random sample of booklets and the corresponding scores/scoring sheets be pulled for an additional quality-control check. For image-scanned documents, a scoring sheet is not used, so ETS uses scores sent to them on a data tape to verify the accuracy of applied scores. During the scoring of mathematics, a selected number of image-processed booklets were paper scored. If any of the random sample of mathematics booklets used for paper scoring were selected as quality-control documents, the scoring sheet was also sent to ETS. For non-scannable trend reading/writing booklets and for the trend mathematics/science booklets that were scored via paper, both the booklet and its corresponding score sheet were sent. All of these documents were selected prior to sending the booklets to storage and were then sent to ETS to verify the accuracy and completeness of the data. A random sample of all the questionnaires used in the 1996 NAEP assessment was also sent to ETS.\n6.6.3 Alert Analysis\nTable 6-5 identifies the different types of alerts to problems that were encountered in the processing of NAEP data. For the 1996 main and long-term trend assessments, there was a total of 230 alerts; for the State Assessment, there was a total of 3,812 alerts.\nDiscrepancies were found in the receiving process that did not require an alert to be issued to Westat. They did require a great deal of effort by the opening staff to resolve in order to provide the most complete and accurate information. These are referred to as \"info alerts.\" These were categorized and codes were assigned to them. They are listed in the left-hand column of Table 6-5.\n138\n1.62\n\n\fEven though receipt-control staff were well trained in the resolution of many situations, there were some problems that required resolution by NCS NAEP product line staff. These are referred to as \"problem alerts.\" The various types of problem alerts were also categorized and coded. They are listed in the right-hand column of Table 6-5. For any unusual situations, Westat was contacted to help with the\nresolution of the alert.\n\nTable 6-5 Alerts for the 1996 National and State Assessments\n\nInformation Alerts\nCode 52 not written on Administration Schedules The yes/no box not gridded on Rosters Session Number not on Administration Schedules Administration Codes not on A/S; but on booklets\nAdministration Codes not on booklets; but on A/S Items returned for Westat Writing on booklet covers Other\n\nProblem Alerts\nChange of Administration Codes-A/S or Booklets Incorrect Rosters/Questionnaires Administration Notes/Writing on Covers Duplicate Student / Booklet Number/ Administration Schedule All material not returned Affected Testing - Problem Transcribed page(s) for student booklet(s) Processed as is Involves Inclusion Check List Other\n\nA/S = Administration Schedules\n\n163\n\n139\n\n\fChapter 7\nPROFESSIONAL S C ORING1\nPatrick B. Bourgeacq, Bradley Thayer, and Timothy Robinson National Computer Systems\n7.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe 1996 national assessment required the scoring of constructed responses in mathematics and science at grades 4, 8, and 12. Long-term trend assessments for 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds in reading, writing, mathematics and science continued at levels comparable to previous assessment years. In all, over nine million constructed responses for the 1996 national and state assessments were scored.\nMore than 300 professional readers split between a full-time day shift and part-time evening shift were hired for scoring. Veteran scorers were mixed with new hires screened for their ability to score constructed responses, providing the scoring center with excellent groups of qualified readers. Regular full-time staff, with the help of administrative assistants, bridged the shifts to ensure quality scoring between the two groups. For the first time in a National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessment, National Computer Systems (NCS) provided a significant number of trainers who worked with Educational Testing Service (ETS) staff to train teams of scorers on many items. Also, NCS used lead scorers for the first time in a NAEP assessment to assist the table leaders with administrative duties and monitoring quality of scoring. The help of lead scorers made it possible to score greater volumes of responses with teams as large as 14 scorers without any apparent compromises in the quality of scoring.\nAs in previous years, the image system distributed responses among teams who scored them in an efficient manner to maximize consistency and reliability. The system also provided enhanced tools to display images, gather data, and monitor the quantity and quality of work.\nThe figures and tables on the following pages summarize the scope of professional scoring for the 1996 NAEP.\n\nBradley Thayer was the NCS project manager for 1996 NAEP, Patrick BourgeaccLwas the NCS project director for 1996 NAEP scoring, and Timothy Robinson was the NCS senior processing coordinator for 1996 NAEI.).\n\n164\n\n141\n\n\fFigure 7-1 Image Scoring Flow Chart\n\n\\ Entry of Items and\nScoring Guides\n\\. into Database\n\nOrientation Receipt of Assessed Documents\nSelect Anchor, Training and\nCalibration Papers\n\n4 iScoring Guides\n\nUpdate Scoring Guides\n\nTraining Review Scoring\nGuides\nReview Sample Responses\nScore and Review Practice Responses\nReliability Satisfactory?\ncD\nScoring\n\nScoring First Scoring\nof Items Reliability Scoring\nof Items\nBack-Reading of Responses by Table Leader\nReliability Coefficient\nReports\nReliability Satisfactory?\nContinue Scoring\nUpload Files\n\nBEST copy AVAILABLE\n142\n\n\fFigure 7-2 Paper Scoring Flow Chart\n\nOrientation\nReceipt of Assessed Documents\nEntry of Items and Scoring Guides\ninto Database /\nSelect Anchor, Training and Calibration\nPapers\n\ntScoring Guides\n\nUpdate Scoring Guides\n\nTraining Review Scoring\nGuides\nReview Sample Responses\nScore and Review Practice Responses\nReliability Satisfactory?\nScoring\n\n117\nScoring\nFirst Scoring of Items\n\n-\n\nReliability Scoring of Items\n\nInput Scores for Paper-Based Scoring\nBatch Scoring Sheets\n\nBack-Reading of\nResponses by Table Leader\n\nScan Scoring Sheets\n\n[Reliability Coetf dent Reports\n\nResolve Edits\n\nReliability Satisfactory?\nContinue Scoring\n\nUpload Files\n\nWarehouse Scoring Sheets\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n166\n143\n\n\f7.2 LONG-TERM TREND ASSESSMENTS\n\n7.2.1 Mathematics\n\nItems that contributed to long-term trend in mathematics items were scored as \"right,\" \"wrong,\"\n\nor \"omitted.\" The scoring criteria identified the correct or acceptable answers for each item in each\n\nblock. The scores for these items included a \"0\" for no response, a \"1\" for a correct answer, or a \"2\" for\n\nan incorrect or \"I don't know\" response. The reading items that appeared in the mathematics/science\n\nbooklets were scored as \"attempted,\" or \"omitted.\" This scoring consisted of merely checking to see\n\nwhether the student had responded in any way to that item, in which case the item was determined to\n\nhave been reached or attempted. The scoring here was \"0\" for not attempting the item (blank) or \"1\" for\n\nany writing in the space provided. This includes one reading item in an age 9 math booklet and one\n\nreading item in an age 13 math can be found in Table 7-1.\n\nbooklet.\n\nThe\n\nnumbers\n\nof\n\ndiscrete\n\nconstructed-response\n\nmathematics\n\nitems\n\nSince scoring of the long-term trend mathematics items was identical to previous years, no new training papers were needed. Preparation for scoring included copying the scoring guides from previous assessment years and drawing samples from previous years, retrieving the booklets listed in the samples, and printing and matching scoring sheets for those booklets.\n\nBecause the mathematics items were scored as \"right,\" \"wrong,\" or \"omitted,\" lengthy training for scoring these items was unnecessary. For each component (fall, winter, and spring), a different team was trained to follow the procedures for scoring the mathematics items and became familiar with the scoring standards, which listed general guidelines and also the correct answer for the items in each of the blocks. Each season, the entire scoring was done in one or two weeks at the end of the administration period. The number of booklets processed and the number of constructed responses scored for each age level are reported in Table 6-1 in Chapter 6.\n\nA different team scored each age level at the time of year the age level was assessed..The booklets arrived in sessions, so each reader scored all items in all mathematics booklet types during the course of the project. All scorers held the same qualifications as the readers for main and state assessments. The number of readers, table leaders, and dates of scoring are reported in Table 7-2.\nTo establish the consistency of scoiing across years, the readers rescored a subset of the responses from previous assessments. Samples of 350 responses to each item from the 1990 assessment and 250 from the 1994 assessment were drawn. The Performance Assessment Scoring Center (PSC) score sheet scanning system gave real-time reports comparing the original scores to the scores assigned by this year's team. The team also second scored 33 percent of the current year sample to measure consistency of scoring.

Figures are included here only for those that were second scored.\n\n2 Figures for long-term trend writing holistic include adjacent scores.\n\n7.2.2 Reading and Writing (Primary Trait)\nAll of the writing items for the three long-term trend assessments (fall, winter, and spring) were scored using the primary trait method. This method focused on the writer's effectiveness in accomplishing specific assigned tasks. The primary trait scoring criteria defined five levels of task accomplishment:\n1. not rated, 2. unsatisfactory, 3. minimal, 4. adequate, and 5. elaborated.\nThe scoring standard for each item described these levels in detail. Some of these items were also scored for secondary traits, which involved indicating the presence or absence of elements that were of special significance to a particular item (e.g., whether notes were made before writing or whether critical information was filled out on a form).\nThe scoring guides for the constructed-response reading items focused on students' abilities to perform various reading tasks:\nidentifying the author's message or mood and substantiating their interpretation, making predictions based on given details, and comparing and contrasting.\n\n170\n\n147\n\n\fThe guides for the reading items varied somewhat, but typically included a range of scores denoting inability to address the task, unsatisfactory responses, minimal ability in accomplishing the task, satisfactory ability in addressing the task, or elaborated responses addressing the task fully. Some of the reading items received scores for secondary traits based on what reactions or information the student gave (i.e., whether the response was mostly content based, form based, a subjective reaction, or some combination of the three).\nThe scoring guides for the constructed-response writing items focused on students' abilities to write in informative, persuasive, and narrative styles. The guides for the writing items were based on a range of scores denoting unsatisfactory writing to address the task, minimal writing to address the task, satisfactory writing to address the task, and elaborated writing to address the task.\nThe item known as \"The Door\" was scored for attemptedness only. The readers coded all blanks as \"0\" and any attempt to answer as a \"1.\"\nThe numbers of discrete constructed-response reading and writing items can be found in Table 7-1.\nAs with mathematics, the scorers used the same training materials as in previous assessments for reading and writing. Thus, there was no need to select new training material from current year responses. Preparation for the three long-term trend scoring projects began with identifying samples from previous years as indicated below. Scores assigned in assessment booklets from 1984 (reading responses) and 1988 (writing responses) had been masked in previous years to ensure that scoring for training, and subsequent long-term trend reliability scoring, would be done without knowledge of the previous scores given. The 1994 booklets required no masking because scores had never been written directly in the booklets. Finally, clerical support staff members matched scoring sheets with the booklets selected for rescore after they had been pulled from the warehouse.\nThe formal training for the long-term trend assessments was divided into two parts to accommodate the reading and writing items. The reading/writing long-term trend scoring project started with one team of seven readers with one table leader for fall trend. Six of the same scorers and the same table leader continued for winter and spring trends. Dates for scoring the three seasons of trend booklets are given in Table 7-2. During training each reader received a photocopied packet of materials used in the 1984 scoring of the reading items and the 1988 scoring of the writing items.\nPrior to scoring any 1996 reading and writing trend material, a training reliability report was generated using a 25 percent sampling of the 1984 assessment materials for reading and 1988 materials for writing. Following the formal training sessions, the readers scored this material on scannable scoring sheets produced for specific booklet types with the appropriate long-term trend items pre-printed on the scoring sheets. These sheets were then routed to scanning under a special job number to ensure that this material was labeled for training scoring only. The scoring coordinator was able to generate a computer report that listed the individual and group percent agreement by item. The system automatically compared the new score with the original score assigned in the 1984 or 1988 scoring and produced a report on the training reliability. T-tests were also generated for each item to verify comparability of scoring across years. The NCS scoring specialist then conferred with the appropriate ETS staff on this training reliability agreement report before proceeding with scoring.\nAll readers for this project were experienced scorers with a minimum of a bachelor's degree. One team member had scored the same long-term trend items for the 1994 assessment. The team read materials as they arrived at the scoring center, with occasional breaks in scoring when receipts were slow. The table leader monitored consistency within the current year as well as across years on a daily\n148\n171\n\n\fbasis as indicated below. The number of booklets processed and constructed responses scored for each age level can be found in Table 6-1 in Chapter 6.\nReliability studies were conducted for the scoring of the long-term trend reading and writing items. For the 1996 booklets, 33 percent of the constructed-response items were scored by a second reader to produce interreader reliability statistics. In addition, a long-term trend reliability study was conducted to ensure that the scoring procedures were consistent with those used in 1984, 1988, and 1994. For this study, 350 of the 1984 reading responses and 350 of the 1988 writing responses were sampled. Also, 250 of both reading and writing responses from 1994 were sampled for rescore. The scoring of these long-term trend samples was intermixed with the scoring of the 1996 reading and writing trend material. The readers selected a bundle of approximately five of each booklet type each dayand gridded their scores on separate scannable scoring sheets for each item. These sheets were then scanned and cross-referenced with the original data tape to extract information for long-term trend reliability reporting. T-tests were generated daily to verify comparability of scoring across years. Note that only primary trait scores were compared in the across-year rescore. Secondary traits and items scored for attemptedness only were not second scored in the current year nor rescored in the long-term trend sample. Composite ranges of interreader reliability figures can be found in Table 7-3.\n7.2.3 Holistic Writing Scoring\nCertain writing items included in the long-term trend assessment were scored holistically. Holistic scoring is based on an overall judgment of writing fluency and structure. Because a six-point holistic scale was used, no scores fell exactly in the middle of the scale. This was done to force readers to categorize a student's response into either the top half or the bottom half of the scale. Within the upper and lower halves of the scale, the scores reflected the degree to which the student demonstrated fluency, structure, or both, in responding to the prompt.\nIn the 1996 holistic scoring session, two items were scored from each of the three grade levels. The items scored at grade 4 were\nflashlight, an imaginative task, and spaceship, a persuasive task.\nAt grades 8 and 11, the two items scored were\nfood on the frontier, an informative task, and recreation opportunities, a persuasive task.\nThe responses scored were taken from six assessment years: 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. Fifty-six readers participated in the 1996 holistic scoring session. They were organized into seven teams of eight readers, with each team led by a table leader and assisted by one clerical aide.\nThe total number of responses scored, readers, table leaders, and dates are given in Table 6-1 in Chapter 6. Detailed lists of responses broken down by prompt, grade, and year are given in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (NCS, 1996).\n\n172\n\n149\n\n\f7.2.3.1 Materials Preparation\nAll grade-eligible student booklets with on-task scores were selected from each of the six assessment years and assembled into bundles of 25 booklets each. Bundle header sheets were then generated from the existing data file of student booklet identification numbers. The system assigned the first 25 grade-eligible booklet ID numbers for each specific booklet type to a bundle. The next 25 booklets for that booklet type were assigned the next consecutive bundle number, and so on until all booklets were assigned. The bundle header was placed on top of the bundle of booklets and these were then rubber-banded together. In addition to the bundle number, the bundle header showed the name of the item to be scored, the grade level, the assessment year, and the booklet 1D numbers of the booklets in that bundle.\nFor each bundle, two sets of scoring sheets were generatedone for the first scoring and one for the second scoring. The scoring sheets indicated the bundle number, the name of the item to be scored, the grade level, the assessment year, and the booklet ID number. Second scoring sheets were generated for a random 25 percent of the booklets in each bundle. For both first and second scoring sheets, a separate sheet was generated for each booklet in the bundle.\nSince some of the booklets for grades 8 and 11 contained two items to be scored during the holistic scoring, Recreation Opportunities and Food on the Frontier, two separate bundle headers and sets of scoring sheets were created for these booklets to accommodate the two scorings of the same booklets. The appropriate header and corresponding scoring sheets for both items were placed with the booklet bundle prior to scoring. Upon completion of the holistic scoring for the Food on the Frontier item, clerical staff removed the header and scoring sheets for this item and replaced them with the sheets for the Recreation Opportunities item; then the responses for the Recreation Opportunities item were scored.\nAll bundles were separated by item on carts. A sheet identifying the item and year was attached to each cart. Thus, all bundles could be readily identified and retrieved quickly and easily.\n7.2.3.2 Training Preparation\nThree days prior to the beginning of holistic scoring, the ETS writing coordinator met with the table leaders and NCS administrative assistant to prepare training materials. They first reviewed the training materials from the 1994 scoring session and augmented them with sampleresponses from the 1995-96 assessment. The training packets included a familiarization and range finder set each containing six examples, an upper half and a lower half set each containing three examples, and three calibration sets each containing four examples. The sets, together with their scoring guides and keys, can be found in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (NCS, 1996).\nFollowing standard ETS procedures, the training of the readers was conducted immediately prior to the beginning of scoring for each individual item.\n7.2.3.3 Holistic Scoring Training\nThe training materials for the first item were distributed to each reader. Each reader read a copy of the prompt and the holistic scoring guide for that item. The scoring guide was explained by the writing long-term trend coordinator. A clerical aide was assigned to each of the seven teams to keep the materials\n150\n- 173\n\n\fflowing in an organized and efficient manner. Training began on June 10, 1996. The general sequence of training for each of the six prompts was as follows:\nScoring Guide and Prompt - The scoring guide was introduced and briefly discussed, followed by a reading of the prompt and a general discussion of the scoring expectations.\nFamiliarization Set Readers were asked to arrange the papers in the familiarization set into 'best to worst' order, assigning a score to each paper, with no score being used more than once. The writing long-term trend coordinator announced the scores given by the table leaders for each of the individual papers in the set. The table leaders discussed with their teams the rationale behind these scores, using the scoring guide.\nRange Finders The writing long-term trend coordinator read the six range finders (best to worst) and discussed the rationale behind the scores given. If there was too much discussion regarding 'why,' an alternate range finder for that score point was inserted later. It was at this point the writing long-term trend coordinator asked the readers to look only to their range finders and no longer to the scoring guide.\nUpper Half Readers first scored three papers representing the upper half. There was a sample of a four-, a five-, and a six-score point paper included. A tally was kept of the number of readers assigning each score point. After the tally, the writing long-term trend coordinator announced the scores assigned in the preparation process and compared them to the scores on the tally sheet.\nLower Half The readers were then asked to score three lower-half papers. This sample included a one-, a two-, and a three-score point paper. Again, a tally of the scores assigned by the individual readers was kept. The table leaders discussed the rationale behind the reader-assigned scores including both the upper and lower half score point papers at this time and answered any team member questions.\nCalibration Set I Prior to the beginning of scoring, the writing long-term trend coordinator assigned Calibration Set 1 consisting of four papers. After scoring\nCalibration Set 1, a tally was kept and the writing long-term trend coordinator announced the scores. The table leader and team discussed the readers' scores and questions.\nCalibration Sets 2 and 3 -. A calibration set was used after a break of longer than 15 minutes (lunch, morning break, afternoon break, or overnight). The readers reviewed the range finders and the table leaders provided a one-sentence review of each of the score points. The readers scored the set of four papers and the scores given were tallied. The tallies were kept for each of these calibration sets and can be found with the training materials in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (NCS, 1996).\n7.2.3.4 Holistic Scoring\nHolistic scoring occurred during the week of June 10, 1996. When scoring for an item began, each reader was given a bundle to score. The reader entered his or her reader 1D number in the appropriate space on each scoring sheet and scored all the responses in the bundle. The readers were directed to check the booklet number listed on the scoring sheet against the booklet ID number printed on\n\n174\n\n151\n\n\fthe front of the assessment booklet. If any discrepancies were found, they were brought to the table leader for resolution.\n\nWhen the first scoring of a bundle of booklets was completed, the reader handed the first scoring sheets to the clerical support staff who placed the bundle of booklets, with the bundle header and second scoring sheet still on top, back on the designated cart. NCS clerical staff distributed all bundles to the readers to ensure an even flow of material and a distribution of second scoring among teams.\nReliability scoring was handled in the same manner as first scoring. When the second scoring was completed, the second scoring sheets were placed on the table leader's desk. All bundles of booklets were placed on carts and removed from the scoring area. Clerical staff then sorted all scoring sheets and routed them to the scanning area to be entered onto the database.\n\nThe table leaders read through each reader's entire initial bundle of booklets and evaluated the scores assigned by the reader. This process is known as backreading. They also periodically backread the remaining bundles throughout the reading of each item. If discrepant scoring occurred, the table leader brought it to the attention of the reader. If the problem recurred, the reader was retrained by the table leader. If the problem continued, the writing long-term trend coordinator assisted with the re-training.\nTwenty-five percent of the papers were read again by a reader from a different team. A preliminary reliability measure was taken by the administrative assistant approximately two to three hours after the beginning of scoring.\n\nScoring the booklets took between four and seven hours depending on the grade level and the type of writing. The readers were trained and scored the items in the following order:\n\nInformative: Persuasive:\nNarrative:\n\nFood on the Frontier Recreation Opportunities Spaceship Flashlight\n\nGrade 11, followed by Grade 8 Grade 11, followed by Grade 8 Grade 4 Grade 4\n\nThe scoring was completed on Sunday, June 16, 1996. A more detailed log of daily activities can be found in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (NCS, 1996).\n\nGrade\n4\n8\n11\n\nTable 7-4 Holistic Writing Scoring Reliability Figures\n\nItem\n\nExact Agreement\n\nFlashlight Spaceship\n\n52.1% 58.3%\n\nFood on the Frontier Recreational Opportunities\n\n53.1% 58.2%\n\nFood on the Frontier Recreational Opportunities\n\n56.3% 57.1%\n\nTotal\n\n56.1%\n\nAdjacent Agreement\n89.6% 93.5%\n94.5% 95.3%\n94.5% 94.9%\n94.0%\n\nAfter all the score sheets were scanned, the scanner operator produced a final report showing the n-counts scored and the interreader agreement rates.

In addition, the procedures include identifying sentence structures and word choice errors. A team of 33 readers and six table leaders scored selected essays for each age/grade group from the writing long-term trend assessments conducted in years 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. Spaceship, an imaginative task, was scored at age 9/grade 4 and recreation opportunities, a persuasive task, was scored at both age 13/grade 9 and age 17/grade 11.\n7.2.4.1 Preparation\nEssays to be scored from the 1996 assessment were selected according to ETS specifications as follows. For each booklet in which each item appeared:\n1. select all grade-eligible booklets with primary trait scores greater than 0 and less than 7, in other words only on-task responses;\n2. select every third booklet; and\n3. select all Black students (based on the student's response in the background\nquestions) not picked in Step 2.\nAs a result of this selection process, 1,593 essays were scored from the 1996 assessment. In addition, 10 percent of the essays previously scored for mechanics from the 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 assessments were rescored for reliability. This sample was selected by locating specific booklets from a list generated by ETS and resulted in a rescore of 736 essays for all four years.\nIn preparation for the scoring process, copies were made of each selected essay and its corresponding booklet cover. The booklet cover, containing assessment year, age/grade, primary sampling unit (PSU) and student ID information, was stapled to the essay. Papers were then grouped by assessment year and grade into packets of 20. Packets were numbered consecutively and were identified by headers. Three identical sets of packets (A, B, and C) were assembled since each essay had to be scored independently by two readers and discrepancies had to be resolved by a table leader. Packets A and B were used by the two readers and Packet C was used by the resolver. For prior year scoring, the same sample was used as in 1994. Therefore, copies were made from the 1994 master sets rather than returning to the original booklets. The master sets were labeled as D Packets and warehoused for potential future use.\n7.2.4.2 Writing Mechanics Training\nTraining of the six table leaders and 33 readers was conducted by the writing long-term trend coordinator during the week of July 15, 1996. The training involved a detailed discussion of the scoring guide. The writing coordinator presented the main sections of the guide:\ntype of sentence construction, faulty sentence construction, punctuation, and word level categorization.\n153\n176\n\n\fCopies of pertinent resource information were distributed, briefly reviewed, and reference materials were identified. After discussion of each of the main sections of the guide, the group reviewed the scored papers from the training packet, paying special attention to scores reflecting the category under discussion.\nTo further train the readers, the trainer used a pool of responses from the1988 and 1990 assessments that has been scored for mechanics in 1990 but not used in the rescore sample in 1996. Copies were made of these training essays to be used for practice. Each reader then individually scored a selected group of essays. The scores were compared among the group, discussions were held when discrepancies occurred, and again references were made to resource materials or to the scored sample papers. When the group was comfortable with the decisions being made, the actual scoring began. Copies of these sets and the scoring guidelines can be found in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (NCS, 1996).\n7.2.4.3 Scoring\nThe actual scoring, resolution, data entry work and proofreading of writing mechanics began on July 18 and was completed on July 31, 1996. In selecting packets for scoring, readers alternated among the different grade levels and assessment years. The mechanics readers marked each paper with a series of symbols, addressing the elements of sentence type, sentence construction, word choice, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. These symbols, written in red ink, designated each word or punctuation mark in error and indicated sentence type or faulty sentence construction. Each essay was scored independently by two different readers selecting either Packet A or B.\nTo track the movement of the packets, the NAEP internal tracking log was used. As readers and resolvers worked on particular packets, the appropriate columns were initialed and dated. This enabled NCS staff to see at a glance the status of each packet. The completed tracking logs have been warehoused with the training materials. A sample of a blank tracking log can be found in the Report of Processing and Professional Scoring Activities (NCS, 1996).\nResolution and quality control were conducted by table leaders who compared the scores marked on copies A and B of each unique packet and resolved any discrepancies. After determining the appropriate marks, the resolver used the unmarked copy C to record the final version. The copy with the resolved marks was sent to the word processing area in NCS's Creative Services department for transcription as described below. To avoid confusion, unused copies were discarded or returned to original readers with feedback information and with follow-up training, if deemed necessary.\nTo maintain a consistent scoring standard, the six table leaders, along with the NCS performance assessment specialist, met twice daily to resolve any questions that arose during the scoring. Resolution scoring allowed the table leaders to determine the accuracy of individual readers. If a reader was confused by a facet of the coding, the table leader would approach the reader individually. If the table leaders identified a trend in the coding, the issue would be broached at the re-calibration sessions. Twice a week, for approximately 30 minutes on Wednesday mornings and Friday afternoons, the six tables stopped scoring and re-calibrated; table leaders brought up pertinent scoring issues and readers asked for clarification on coding decisions.\nResolved packets were sent to the NCS Creative Services department where the text of the essays, along with the assigned marks and identification information, were entered into a data file. Essays were typed exactly as they were written. Each essay was typed on a separate page and double-spaced pages were printed for proofreading. The scoring team proofread the data entry work against the scored\n154\nLit- 177\n\n\fpapers. Student identification and PSU numbers were checked and discrepancies were resolved. Corrections were indicated in red on the typed copy. If corrections were needed, all pages belonging to a packet were returned to the Creative Services department for additional corrections. Complete and correct packets were uploaded to the NCS mainframe. The data were reformatted according to ETS specifications and a data file containing the scored information was sent to ETS on August 7, 1996.\n7.3 MAIN NAEP ASSESSMENT\n7.3.1 Selection of Training Papers\nA pool of papers to be used for training for the NAEP main assessments was selected by NCS in February and March of 1996. Persons identified as potential mathematics and science table leaders were selected to copy student responses. Team leaders, with assistance of the potential table leaders, gave tentative scores to the responses and selected 50 student responses from each dichotomous item, 75 responses from each 3-point item, 100 responses from each 4-point item and 125 from each 5-point item. Because NCS staff screened the responses, the pool sent to the ETS test development specialists contained a full range of point values.\nNCS staff numbered the papers sequentially and copied the sets. NCS retained and filed the originals and sent the copies to the appropriate subject area coordinators at ETS. ETS returned a list of the anchor and practice sets with scores to NCS staff, who used the master file copies to create training sets. NCS staff then masked the sequential reference numbers and wrote the actual scores on the anchor papers and a new sequential reference number for the training sets.\nThe NCS copy center and PSC clerical staff shared responsibility for making multiple copies of the sets for scorers. The master sets, team leader/trainer copy and table leader copies also had keys to the training sets. When copying was complete, the master copy was placed in the appropriate file.\n7.3.2 Calibration Policies\nDuring scoring, the teams used calibration sets to calibrate on a daily basis and to calibrate across longer periods of time. The table leader built pools of items for calibration, which were then distributed to the scorers in sets of five or ten, depending upon the complexity of the item, whenever a break of longer than 15 minutes occurred, such as after lunch or at the beginning of a new scoring day. All readers on the team scored the same calibration sets, and the system compared the scores of each reader to the scores assigned by the trainer and table leader. The table leader reviewed the interreader agreement report with the trainer and the ETS subject area coordinator, discussed any discrepancies that arose, and then proceeded with scoring.\nWhenever a team returned to scoring an item after having worked on a different item in the meantime, the team scored a calibration set of 75 responses and analyzed the results before proceeding. This occurred in mathematics because many mathematics items were scored in two sessions since the first sweep through the items was done while booklets were still arriving from the field. If the item had fewer than 500 responses left out of a pool that contained both main and state samples, an extended calibration was waived. In science, the teams did not begin scoring most items until all responses to the item were available for scoring, so this type of calibration was not necessary.\n\n17S\n\n155\n\n\fTable leaders printed and archived hard copies of all calibration sets used for scoring. For more information on the functionality of the calibration tool, see Section 7.3.3.3.\n7.3.3 Table Leader Utilities\nTwo of the significant advantages of the image-scoring system were the ease of regulating the flow of work to readers and the ease of monitoring scoring. The image system provided table leaders with tools to determine reader qualification, to backread scores, to determine reader calibration, to monitor interreader reliability, and to gauge the rate at which scoring was being completed. These various tools are described below.\n7.3.3.1 Reader-Qualification Tool\nOne of the utilities at a table leader's disposal was a qualification algorithm used after training on extended constructed-response items. The table leader would give identical qualification packets to each reader. These packets contained 10 student responses to be independently scored by the readers. After the readers finished, the table leader would enter each reader's scores into the computer for tabulation. The computer would calculate each reader's percentage of exact, adjacent, and non-adjacent agreement with the master key. If a reader attained a percentage of exact agreement above a predetermined threshold of 80%, the reader would be allowed to score. Readers not attaining the predetermined threshold were handled on a case-by-case basistypically receiving individual training by the trainer or the NCS table leader before being allowed to score. A table leader could cancel a reader's qualification to score an item if review of a reader's work indicated inaccurate scoring and that supplemental training was necessary. Note that reader qualification was required only on extended constructed-response items involving 4 or more score point levels.\n7.3.3.2 Backreading Tool\nAfter scoring began, NCS table leaders reviewed each reader's progress using a backreading utility that allowed the table leader to review papers scored by each reader on the team. Typically, a table leader reviewed responses scored by each reader in quantities similar to the amount second scored (i.e., 6% for items with both state and national samples and more for items with only a national sample). Table leaders noted the score the reader awarded each response as well as the score a second reader gave that same response. This was done as an interreader reliability check. Alternatively, a table leader could choose to review all student responses given a particular score to determine if the team as a whole was scoring consistently. Both of these review methods used the same display screen and showed the ID number of the reader and the scores awarded. If the table leader disagreed with the score given an item, he or she discussed it with the reader for possible correction. Replacement of scores by the table leader was done only with the knowledge and approval of the reader, thereby serving as a learning experience for the reader. Additionally, neither score was changed in the case where the response was second scored.\n7.3.3.3 Calibration Tool\nWhile backreading, a table leader could identify individual responses for inclusion in a pool of calibration papers. These papers could be selected because they exemplified criteria set down in the\n156\n173\n\n\fscoring rubrics or because they were unusual and pointed out less obvious aspects of the scoring guidelines. After selecting a number of papers for inclusion in the calibration set, the table leader could decide to route any number of these calibration papers to the scorers. A typical number of papers routed to scorers during a mid-scoring calibration was 10, although the image system could accommodate as many or as few as the table leader and trainer determine necessary to check the accuracy of scoring. When all scorers had completed the calibration set, the table leader could then produce an interreader reliability report on the scoring of the calibration set.\n7.3.3.4 Tool for Monitoring Interreader Reliability\nDuring the scoring of an item or the scoring of a calibration set, the table leader could monitor progress using an interreader reliability tool. This display tool could be used in either of two modes:\n1. to display information of all first readings versus all second readings, or 2. to display all readings of an individual that were also scored by another reader versus\nthe scores assigned by the other readers.\nThe information was displayed as a matrix with scores awarded during first readings displayed in rows and scores awarded during second readings displayed in columns for Mode 1 and the individual's scores in rows and all other readers in columns for Mode 2. In this format, instances of exact agreement fell along the diagonal of the matrix. For completeness, data in each cell of the matrix contained the number and percentage of cases of agreement (or disagreement). The display also contained information on the total number of second readings and the overall percentage of exact agreement on the item. Since the interreader reliability reports were cumulative, a printed copy of the exact agreement of each item was made every day and compared to previously generated reports.\n7.3.3.5 Tool for Monitoring the Rate of Scoring\nThe table leaders were able to monitor work flow using a status tool that displayed the number of items scored, the number of items first-scored that still needed to be second-scored, the number of items remaining to be second-scored, and the total number of items remaining to be scored. This allowed the team leaders and performance assessment specialists to accurately monitor the rate of scoring and to estimate the time needed for completion of the various phases of scoring.\n7.3.3.6 Scoring Buttons\nTo assign a score, readers clicked the mouse over a button contained in the scoring window. Since buttons were included only for valid scores, there is no need to edit for out-of-range scores. Another recent development was the implementation of a tool that allowed the performance assessment specialist to label scoring buttons with key phrases, correct responses or certain incorrect responses that were to be tracked. This enhanced scoring as readers no longer had to mentally translate a student's response into a numerical value before choosing a scoring button on the image screen.\n\n180\n\n157\n\n\f7.3.4 Main Mathematics Assessment\nThe mathematics portion of the 1996 main assessment included a total of 226 discrete constructed-response items. Table 7-1 shows the types and number of constructed responses for the mathematics assessment. A variety of constructed-response items were used to measure different elements of students' mathematical sophistication and understanding. These items were administered in scannable assessment booklets. The bilingual booklets were key-entry documents. The items scored included traditional computational items, short-answer constructed responses, extended constructed responses, diagrams, geometric figures, and graphs. Each constructed-response item had a unique scoring guide that identified the range of possible scores for the item and defined the criteria to be used in evaluating student responses. Long-term trend items that focused on the students' computational ability were typically scored on a right/wrong basis. The scoring guides for the more complex items were developed to be of diagnostic value, by including categories that reflected partial credit and/or different kinds of incorrect answers that indicated particular misunderstandings. New items developed for the 1993 and 1995 NAEP field tests were scored on a partial-credit scale (3-point or 4-point) or on an extended scale (5-point).\nThe operational assessment included, for the first time other than the field test, blocks that were based on a theme. There were two different theme blocks administered at each grade. General information on the number of constructed responses scored can be found in Table 6-1 in Chapter 6. Table 7-5 gives more detailed information by grade and booklet type (spiral, estimation, theme, and advanced).\n7.3.4.1 Training\nThe training for each mathematics item was conducted by mathematics specialists from ETS and NCS just prior to the scoring of that item. Training and scoring began on Wednesday, March 13, and ended on Monday, May 6, 1996. The NCS mathematics performance assessment specialist and selected NCS team leaders conducted all the training of the short-term trend items scored in March. The ETS mathematics coordinator met with each trainer individually before the beginning of training to discuss any questions and/or discrepancies. He returned to NCS at the beginning of April to review individually the items assigned in April. The NCS training staff added another team leader to assist in training for the evening shift in April.\nTraining involved explaining the item and its scoring guide and discussing responses that represented the various score points in the guide. When this was completed, the readers scored and discussed from 5 to 35 selected \"practice papers\" for each item. Next, readers practiced scoring by gathering around a single image terminal and scoring several responses to the item. Once the trainer and the table leader determined the individuals on the team understood the scoring guide, the table leader qualified the scorers to enter the system using the reader-qualification tool, discussed in Section 7.3.3.1.\n158\n181\n\n\fTable 7-5 Mathematics Constructed Responses Scored\n\nType\n\nData\n\nRegular Estimation Theme Total\n\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement Average % exact agreement\n\nRegular Estimation Theme\n\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\n\n1990\n12 0\n8,988 8,988 95.9\n0 0 0 0 N/A 0 0 0 0 N/A\n12\n0 8,988 8,988 95.9 95.9\n18\n0 13,374 13,374\n95.3 0 0 0 0\nN/A 0 0 0 0\nN/A\n\n1992\nGrade 4\n36 0 27,031 27,031 93.8 ,0 0 0 0 N/A 0 0 0 0 N/A 36 0 27,031 27,031 93.8 93.8\nGrade 8 44\n0 33,077 33,077\n94.4 0 0 0 0\nN/A 0 0 0 0\nN/A\n\nGrand\n\n1996\n\nTotal\n\n64\n\n2,037,866\n\n122,272\n\n2,160,138\n\n96.8\n\n3\n\n7,317\n\n439\n\n7,756\n\n93.3\n\n13\n\n23,800\n\n5,950\n\n29,750\n\n95.8\n\n80\n\n2,068,983\n\n128,661\n\n2,197,644\n\n.\n\n96.5\n\n96.5\n\n112\n2,037,866 158,291\n2,196,157 95.7\n3\n7,317 439\n7,756 93.3\n13\n23,800 5,950\n29,750 95.8\n128 2,068,983\n164,680 2,233,663\n95.7 95.7\n\n69 1,991,682\n119,501 2,111,183\n96.6\n6 13,622\n3,405 17,027\n97.3\n13\n27,690 6,923\n34,613 93.9\n\n131\n1,991,682 165,952\n2,157,634 95.7 6\n13,622 3,405 17,027 97.3\n13\n27,690 6,923 34,613 93.9\n\nAssessment\n\nProportions\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\nNational State\n\n7.9% 160,584\n9,635 170,219\n\n92.1% 1,877,282\n112,637 1,989,919\n\n9.3% 184,683 11,081 195,764\n\n90.7% 1,806,999\n108.420 1,915,419\n\n(continued)\n\n1 82\n\n159\n\n\fTable 7-5 (continued) Mathematics Constructed Responses Scored\n\nType\n\nData\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\nAdvanced\n\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\n\nGrade 8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n.Total Regular Theme Advanced Total\n\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\n\n18\n\n44\n\n0\n\n0\n\n13,374 33,077\n\n13,374 33,077\n\n95.3\n\n94.4\n\nGrade 122\n\n21\n\n44\n\n0\n\n0\n\n15,225 32,387\n\n15,225 32,387\n\n94.8\n\n92.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n21\n\n44\n\n0\n\n0\n\n15,225 32,387\n\n15,225 32,387\n\n94.8\n\n92.1\n\nGrand Total Unique items\n\n51\n\n124\n\n14th grade mathematics had no advanced booklets. 2 12th grade estimation block had no constructed-response items.\n\nAssessment Proportions 1996 Grand Total 1996 1996 National State\n\n14\n33,354 8,339\n41,693 95.1\n102 2,066,348\n138,168 2,204,516\n96.1\n\n14\n33,354 8,339\n41,693 95.1\n164 2,066,348\n184,619 2,250,967\n95.5\n\n73\n\n138 N/A\n\nN/A\n\n212,774\n\n212,774 N/A\n\nN/A\n\n12,766\n\n60,378 N/A\n\nN/A\n\n225,540\n\n273,152 N/A\n\nN/A\n\n95.6\n\n94.4\n\n12\n\n12\n\n23,368\n\n23,368\n\n5,842\n\n5;842\n\n29,210\n\n29,210\n\n94.5\n\n94.5\n\n15\n\n15\n\n44,881\n\n44,881\n\n11,220\n\n11,220\n\n56,101\n\n56,101\n\n95.1\n\n95.1\n\n100\n\n165\n\n281,022\n\n281,022\n\n29,829\n\n77,441\n\n310,851\n\n358,463\n\n95.4\n\n94.5\n\n282\n\n457\n\n160\nut- '183\n\n\f7.3.4.2 Scoring\nMathematics scoring took place in two segments over two shifts as outlined in Table 7-2. Most dichotomously scored short-term trend items were scored in Segment 1, with the remainder of the items scored in Segment 2.\nDuring scoring, the team leaders continued to compile notes on scoring decisions for the readers' reference and guidance. Additionally, table leaders closely monitored interreader reliability using both team and individual statistics as a reference. Consistently throughout the scoring of each item, the table leaders also performed backreading duties in which they reviewed a sample of the responses scored by each reader on the team. Lead scorers selected for their experience and accuracy in scoring assisted the table leaders in backreading. The team leaders and performance assessment specialist continuously monitored the progress of each team and noted all scoring-related decisions to ensure that training and scoring progressed smoothly and in a timely manner.\nThe codes that were used for unscorable mathematics items were:\n0 = Blank or random marks 8 = Completely crossed-out or erased 9 = \"I don't know,\" refusal, off-task, illegible or language other than English\n\n7.3.4.3 Reliability\nA minimum of 25 percent of the mathematics responses for items involved only in the national sample and 6 percent of the responses for items involved in the state and national samples were scored by a second reader to obtain statistics on interreader reliability. Responses were automatically routed for second scoring so that the reader could not discern any difference between a response being presented for first or second scoring. The reliability figures were available to the table leader as soon as scoring began and could be viewed on demand. These figures included a frequency distribution of all second scores for the team and a frequency distribution for all second scores for individual members of the team who scored the item. Ranges for interreader reliability figures for mathematics are reported in Table 7-3. Average reliabilities, given in terms of percentage exact agreement, for each booklet type (spiral, estimation, theme, and advanced) are reported in Table 7-5. This reliability information was also used by the table leader in monitoring the capabilities of all readers and the uniformity of scoring across readers. When scoring was completed for an item, a hard copy of the report was printed for analysis by ETS project staff.\n\n7.3.4.4 Short-Term Trend\nThe 1996 main assessment of mathematics included a number of items that had previously been used in the 1990 and 1992 assessments. A list of these items is included in the tables in Appendix J. For these items, the trainers used the same scoring guides and training sets as in 1992. Also, for those items that originated in the 1992 assessment, 750 responses from 1992 were scanned into the scoring system and rescored. For those items that originated in the 1990 assessment, the sample included 750 responses each from 1990 and 1992. Table leaders used the management tools to distribute the rescore responses out among the current-year material. Because the rescore responses could not be seeded into the current materials, the table leaders divided the rescore material into thirds, inserting about 25 responses per scorer at various intervals during scoring. Since the development group had loaded the original scores\n\n,.184\n\n161\n\n\ffrom the previous years, the system was able to give real-time comparisons of scores. Table leaders, trainers, and the NCS and ETS subject area specialists monitored the interreader agreement rates and ttests across years for all items used in the short-term trend.\n7.3.4.5 Paper Scoring\nSome mathematics items could not be scored on the image system because,of printing problems or difficulties with overlay templates. When scoring these items, professional readers coded any response that.could not be scored by viewing the image with a designated code such as \"8\" or \"pull.\" The development group created a list of all responses coded for pulling, and the project coordinator led the effort to pull these booklets from the warehouse. The booklets were then transported to the PSC, where professional readers scored them using the same scoring guides, but marking their scores on scannable scoring sheets. Clerical support staff then scanned the sheets and uploaded the file to the mainframe, where the development team merged the data with the image scoring data.\nAs soon as the last item on any score sheet was completed, the score sheets were collected and taken to a central clerical support area to be scanned on the NCS paper-based scoring system using Op Scan 5 scanners. As each sheet was processed, the scanning system compared the incoming data with tables to ensure that all responses were scored with one and only one valid score, and that only raters who were qualified to score an item were allowed to score it. Any discrepancies (e.g., no score assigned, double gridding, out-of-range scores, or invalid scorer ID numbers) were flagged and resolved before the data from that sheet were accepted into the scoring system. Interreader agreement reports were generated twice a day.\nAll the scoring data were stored on personal computers at NCS after all the responses for a subject area had been scanned. Upon completion of scoring, the scanner operator ran a query which compared the sheets scanned with a table of records in the system to make sure that all score sheets were accounted for. Once all edits were corrected, the personal computer file was renamed and put into an export file, which automatically created the mainframe file. This file was then uploaded to the mainframe to be merged with the mainframe student files.\n7.3.4.6 Large Print\nTo accommodate students with visual impairment, field administrators had Braille and large print versions of designated booklets available to sampled students who qualified for them. The scoring center received no Braille material for scoring. Two large print booklets were received back for scoring. One of the large print booklets was completely blank. The NCS performance assessment specialist in charge of mathematics scored all the items in the other booklet and gave the scores to the development team to enter into the database.\n7.3.4.7 Bilingual Scoring\nSome students who participated in the main fourth- and eighth-grade mathematics assessments received bilingual booklets. All students who used bilingual booklets received the equivalent of Booklet 121 for their grade. The same blocks with the same items appeared in the bilingual booklets as in the regular Booklet 121, with the exception that the bilingual booklets contained both Spanish and English versions of each item. The items appeared in Spanish on the left-hand pages and in English on the right-\n162\nJ, 185\n\n\fhand pages. The instructions told students to answer according to their preference. Altogether, the PSC scored 91 bilingual booklets at grade 4 and 36 at grade 8.\nBecause of the small number of booklets involved, the PSC selected a team of four readers to score all of the booklets on paper. The team consisted of two males and two females. Two of the scorers were born in Chile, South America, and raised partly in Chile and partly in the United States. Both of them have traveled and recently lived extended periods of time in South America, while making the United States their permanent home. The third scorer comes from a Panamanian-American background. Born and raised in a bilingual family, he holds a bachelor's degree in Spanish, has lived extended periods of time in Panama and Mexico, and has experience teaching university-level Spanish as well as working several years in a business position that required daily telephone and correspondence contact with Spanish-speaking clientele, mainly from Puerto Rico. The fourth scorer, while not a native speaker of Spanish, holds a master's degree in Spanish, has traveled and studied extensively in Mexico, the Caribbean and South America, coordinated an adult education program for Spanish-speaking immigrants from Mexican and Central American backgrounds for three years, taught university-level Spanish for eight years, and worked in customer relations positions for four years dealing with Spanish-speaking clientele, mainly from Puerto Rico.\nThe NCS mathematics specialist trained.all four readers on the fourth-grade items on Thursday, May 2, 1996, and the team scored all of the fourth-grade booklets the same day. On Friday, May 3, the team learned the eighth-grade items, many.of which overlapped with the fourth-grade items, and scored all of the eighth-grade booklets on that day. Twenty-five percent of the booklets were scored by a second reader to measure interreader agreement.\nThe team applied the same scoring guides that were used for regular scoring. However, two scores were assigned for each item, one for the Spanish side and one for the English side. Since most students answered relatively consistently on either one side or the other, most booklets received on-task scores for one language and blanks for the other language. This procedure will allow analysts to separate the data of those students who answered in English from those who answered in Spanish. Several students wrote their answers in English on the side of the page where the item was written in Spanish. In these cases, the scorers coded the score as a Spanish answer since that is where the student read the item and wrote the answer. During the course of scoring, the team noted that over half of the fourth-grade booklets came from the same school, and not a single student from that school answered any questions in Section 3 of the booklet.\nThe same scanning procedures, were performed as outlined in Section 7.3.4.5.\n7.3.5 Main NAEP Science\nThe science portion of the 1996 NAEP included a total of 374 discrete constructed-response items (see Table 7-1). It was scored over three segments and two shifts (see Table 7-2). Many kinds of constructed-response items were utilized in the assessment to measure different elements of students' conceptual understanding of scientific material as well as their practical reasoning ability. The items scored included short-answer constructed responses and extended constructed responses. Each constructed-response item had a unique scoring guide that identified the range of possible scores for the item and defined the criteria to be used in evaluating student responses.\n\n186\n\n163\n\n\fDuring the course of the project, each team scored short constructed-response items using a scale that allowed for partial credit as follows:\n\n1 = incorrect response 2 = partial understanding 3 = correct response\n\nThe readers scored extended constructed-response items on a scale of \"1\" to \"4\" as follows:\n\n1\n\nincorrect response\n\n2 = minimal understanding\n\n3 = satisfactory level of comprehension\n\n4 = correct response\n\n7.3.5.1 Training\nThe training on each item was conducted by science specialists from ETS and NCS. The first teams began training on March 18, 1996. Other teams were phased in throughout the project. Hands-on items were scored a block at a time with a unique scoring guide for each item because of the related nature of the items. The rest of the assessment was scored item-by-item so that each reader worked on only one set of rubrics at a time. After scoring all available responses, a team would then proceed with training and scoring the next item. Scoring was completed on June 7, 1996. Table 7-2 gives detailed information on the dates of scoring and the number of readers and table leaders.\nTraining involved explaining the item and its scoring guide to the team and discussing responses that represented the various score points in the guide. Typically, two or three anchor responses were chosen for each score point. During this stage, readers and the table leader kept notes of scoring decisions. The table leader was then responsible for compiling those notes and ensuring that all readers were in alignment. When review of the anchor packet was completed, the readers scored and discussed 10 to 20 pre-scored \"practice papers\" that represented the entire range of score points the item could receive:After the trainer and table leader determined that the team had reached consensus, the table leader then released work on the image-scoring system to the readers. The readers would initially take turns reading their first \"live\" responses to the team or work in pairs as a final check before beginning work individually. Once the practice session was completed, the formal scoring process began.\n7.3.5.2 Scoring\nAll scoring for science was conducted via the image-based scoring system. During scoring, the team leaders continued to compile notes on scoring decisions for the readers' reference and guidance. Additionally, table leaders closely monitored interreader reliability using both team and individual statistics as a reference. Consistently throughout the scoring of each item, the table leaders also performed backreading duties in which they reviewed a sample of the responses scored by each reader on the team. Lead scorers selected for their experience and accuracy in scoring assisted the table leaders in backreading. The table leaders and performance assessment specialist continuously monitored the progress of each team and noted all scoring-related decisions to ensure that training and scoring progressed smoothly and in a timely manner.\n\n164\n\n187\n\n\fTable 7-6 Science Constructed Responses Scored\n\nGrade\n\nData\n\n4 Unique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored\nAverage % exact agreement\n\n8 Unique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored\nAverage % exact agreement\n\nRegular\n70 200,319\n50,080 250,399\n93.9\n\nType' Hands-On Advanced\n\n24\n\n0\n\n94,004\n\n0\n\n23,501\n\n0\n\n117,505\n\n0\n\n93.8\n\nN/A\n\n94\n\n31\n\n0\n\n2,157,377 976,844\n\n0\n\n129,443\n\n58,611\n\n0\n\n2,286,820 1,035,455\n\n0\n\n93.4\n\n95.0\n\nN/A\n\nGrand Total\n94 294,323\n73,581 367,904\n93.9\n125\n3,134,222 188,053\n3,322,275 93.8\n\nAssessment Proportions 1996 National 1996 State\n\n74.8% 220,271\n55,068 275,339\n\n25.2% 74,052 18,513 92,565\n\n9.7% 304,020\n18,241 322,261\n\n90.3% 2,830,202\n169,812 3,000,014\n\n12 Unique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored Average % exact agreement\n\n94\n198,563 49,641 248,204\n93.0\n\n26\n75,120 18,780 93,900\n94.4\n\n36\n88,166 22,041 110,207\n94.5\n\n156\n361,849 90,462 452,311\n93.6\n\nTotal\n\nUnique items Responses first scored Responses second scored First and second scored\nAverage % exact agreement\n\n258\n2,556,260 229,163\n2,785,423 93.4\n\n81\n1,145,968 100,892\n1,246,860 94.4\n\nI Regular and hands-on tasks include state and national constructed responses.\n\n36\n88,166 22,041 110,207\n94.5\n\n375\n3,790,394 352,096\n4,142,490 93.7\n\n189 183\n\n\fOne advantage of utilizing an image-based scoring system is the ability to construct reader aids to simplify scoring, thus increasing reader reliability. Prior to the start of the project, the ETS subject area specialist and the NCS performance assessment specialist identified several items for the construction of overlays. Overlays serve as templates to define boundaries in which correct responses must be located or allow the placement of correct answers directly on the displayed image, and are displayed along with the student response. A schematic representation of each overlay was included with the scoring guide and sample papers for these items to familiarize readers with the use of the scoring aids during training.\nGeneral information on the number of constructed responses scored can be found in Table 6-1 in Chapter 6. Table 7-6 gives more detailed information by grade and booklet type (spiral and advanced). The codes that were used for unscorable science items were:\n0 = Blank or random marks 8 = Completely cross-out or erased 9 = \"I don't know,\" refusal, off-task, illegible or language other than English that could not\nbe translated\n7.3.5.3 Reliability\nA minimum of 25 percent of the science responses for items involved only in the national sample and 6 percent of the responses for items involved in the state samples were scored by a second reader to obtain statistics on interreader reliability. Ranges for interreader reliability for science are reported in Table 7-3. Average reliabilities, given in terms of percentage exact agreement, for each booklet type (spiral and advanced) are reported in Table 7-6. This reliability information was also used by the team leaders to monitor the capabilities of all readers and maintain uniformity of scoring across readers. Reliability reports could be generated on demand by the table leader, scoring specialist, or performance assessment specialist when needed, and they were displayed at a computer workstation. In addition to the immediate feedback provided by the on-line reliability reports, each table leader could also review the actual responses scored by a reader by using the backreading tool. In this way, the table leader monitored each reader carefully and corrected difficulties in scoring almost immediately with a high degree of efficiency.\n166\n\n\fChapter 8\nCREATION OF THE DATABASE, QUALITY CONTROL OF DATA ENTRY, AND CREATION OF THE DATABASE PRODUCTS'\nJohn J. Ferris, Katharine E. Pashley, David S. Freund, and Alfred M. Rogers\nEducational Testing Service\n8.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe data processing, scoring and editing procedures described in Chapter 6 resulted in the generation of disk and tape files containing various data for students (assessed and excluded), teachers, schools, and SD/LEP (students with disabilities/students with limited English proficiency) information. The weighting procedures described in Chapter 10 resulted in the generation of data files that included the sampling weights required to make valid statistical inferences about the population from which the 1996 fourth-, eighth- and twelfth-grade NAEP samples were drawn. These files were merged into a comprehensive, integrated database. The creation of the database is described in Section 8.2.1.\nSection 8.2.2 describes a central repository or master catalog of this information. The master catalog is accessible by all analysis and reporting programs and provides correct parameters for processing the data fields and consistent labeling for identifying the results of the analyses.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the quality control of the data entry process, the corresponding portion of the final integrated database was verified in detail against a sample of the original instruments received from the field. The results of this procedure are given in Section 8.3.\nThe integrated database was the source for the creation of the NAEP item information database and the NAEP secondary-use data files. These are described in Section 8.4.\n8.2 CREATION OF THE DATABASE\n8.2.1 Merging Files\nThe data processing conducted by National Computer Systems (NCS) resulted in the transmittal to ETS of four data files for each of fourth, eighth and twelfth grade: one for the student background and item response data and one file for each of the three questionnaires (Teacher Questionnaire, School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire, and SD/LEP Questionnaire). The sampling weights, derived by Westat, Inc., comprised additional files for each gradetwo sets for assessed students, two sets for excluded students and for schools four sets at grade 4, five at grade 8, and six at grade 12. (See Chapter 10 for a discussion of the sampling weights.) These files at each grade were the foundation for the\nJohn J. Ferris was responsible for the evaluation of the quality of the database and the data entry process; Katharine E. Pashley was responsible for database generation under the supervision of David S. Freund; Alfred M. Rogers created the secondary-use data files.\n167\n191\n\n\fanalysis of the 1996 NAEP data. Before data analyses could be performed, these data files had to be integrated into a coherent and comprehensive database.\nThe database ultimately comprised four files per.cohort: three student files (mathematics, science, and long-term trend) and a single school file. The student files were separated by subject area to improve maintenance and efficiency of the databases and data analyses. Each record on the student file contained a student's responses to the particular assessment booklet the student was administered (in the case of excluded students, a booklet was assigned but the student response fields contain a special code indicating no response), and the information from the questionnaire that the student's teacher completed. Additionally, for a student (assessed or excluded) who was identified as a student with a disability (SD) or of limited English proficiency (LEP), the data, from the SD/LEP Questionnaire are included. This questionnaire is filled out for all students identified as SD and/or LEP, both assessed and excluded. (See Chapter 2 for information regarding assessment instruments.) Also added to the student files were variables with school-level information supplied by Quality Education Department, Inc. (QED) including demographic information about schools such as race/ethnicity percentages. Since the teacher data are not from a representative sample of teachers and since the focus of NAEP is to report student level results, the teacher response data were added to the student records. The school data were on separate files that could be analyzed on their own and could also be linked to the student files through the unique school ID code.\nThe creation of the student data files for fourth, eighth, and twelfth grade began with the reorganization of the data files received from NCS. This involved two major tasks:\n1. the files were restructured, eliminating unused (blank) areas to reduce the size of the files; and\n2. in cases where students had chosen not to respond to an item, the missing responses were recoded as either \"omit\" or \"not reached,\" as discussed in Part II of this report.\nNext, the student response data were merged with the student weights files. The resulting file was then merged with the SD/LEP and teacher data. In all merging steps, the 10-digit booklet ID (the three-digit booklet number common to every booklet with the same block of items, a six-digit serial number unique to the booklet a student was given and a single check digit, distinguishing bilingual booklets) was used as the matching criterion.\nThe school file for each grade was created by merging the School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire file with the file of school weights and school variables, supplied by Westat. The primary sampling unit (PSU) and school codes were used as the matching criteria. Since some schools did not return a questionnaire, some of the records in the school file contained only school-identifying information and sampling weight information.\nWhen the student and school files for each grade had been created, the database was ready for analysis. In addition, whenever new data values, such as composite background variables or plausible values, were derived, they were added to the appropriate database files using the same matching procedures described above.\nFor archival purposes and to provide data for outside users, restricted-use data files and codebooks for each jurisdiction were generated from this database. The restricted-use data files contain all responses and response-related data from the assessment, including responses from the student booklets, Teacher Questionnaires, and School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires, scale scores, sampling weights, and variables used to compute standard errors.\n168\n192\n\n\f8.2.2 Creating the Master Catalog\nA critical part of any database is its processing control and descriptive information. Having a central repository for this information, which may be accessed by all analysis and reporting programs, will provide correct parameters for processing the data fields and consistent labeling for identifying the results of the analyses. The NAEP master catalog file was designed and constructed to serve these purposes for the NAEP database.\nEach record of the master catalog contains the processing, labeling, classification, and location information for each data field in the NAEP database. The control parameters are used by the access routines in the analysis programs to define the manner in which the data values are to be transformed and processed.\nEach data field has a 50-character label in the master catalog describing the contents of the field and, where applicable, the source of the field. The data fields with discrete or categorical response values (e.g.', multiple-choice items and professionally scored items, but not weight fields) have additional label fields in the catalog containing 8- and 20-character labels for those response values. These short labels can be used for reporting purposes as a concise description of the responses for the cognitive items.\nThe classification area of the master catalog record contains distinct fields corresponding to predefined classification categories (e.g., mathematics content and process areas) for the data fields. For a particular classification field, a nonblank value indicates the code of the subcategory within the classification category for the data field. This classification area permits the grouping of identically classified items or data fields by performing a selection process on one or more classification fields in the master catalog.\nAccording to NAEP design, it is possible for item data fields to appear in more than one student sample and in more than one block within each sample. The location fields of the catalog record contain age, block and, where applicable, the sequence within the block for each appearance of the data field.\nThe master catalog file was constructed concurrently with the collection and transcription of the State Assessment data so that it would be ready for use by analysis programs when the database was created. As new data fields were derived and added to the database, their corresponding descriptive and control information were entered into the master catalog. The machine-readable catalog files are available as part of the secondary-use data files package for use in analyzing the data with programming languages such as SAS and SPSS-X (see the NAEP 1996 Secondary-Use Data Files User Guide, Rogers, Kline,'& Schoeps, 1999).\n8.3 QUALITY CONTROL OF NAEP DATA ENTRY FOR 1996\nThis section describes the evaluation of the data entry'process for the 1996 national assessment. As in past years, the NAEP database was found to be more than accurate enough to support the analyses that were done. Overall, the observed error rates were comparable to those of past assessments, with the possible exception of the Teacher Questionnaire data (see discussion below); they ranged from three errors per 10,000 responses for the SD/LEP Student Questionnaire data to 33 erfors per 10,000 responses for the Teacher Questionnaire data.\n\n193\n\n169\n\n\fThe purpose of the analysis reported in this sction is to assess the quality of the data resulting from the complete data entry system, beginning with the actual instruments collected in the field and ending with the final machine-readable database used in the analyses. The process involved the selection of instruments at random from among those returned from the field and the comparison of these instruments, character by character, with their representations in the final database. In this way, we were able to measure the error rates in the data as well as the success of the data entry system.\nOf course the observed error rate cannot be taken at face value. For example, the sample of teacher questionnaires that happened to be selected for close inspection contained 22 errors out of a total of 6,741 characters. To conclude that the entire teacher questionnaire database has an error rate of 22/6741, or .0033, would be too optimistic; we may simply have been lucky (or unlucky) with this particular random sample. What is needed is an indication of how bad the true error rate might be, given what we observed. Such an indication is provided by confidence limits. Confidence limits indicate how likely it is that a value falls inside a specified range in a specified context or distribution. In our analysis, the specified range is an error rate between zero and some maximum value beyond which we are confident at a specified level (traditionally 99.8%) that the true error rate does not lie; the specified context or distribution turns out to be the cumulative binomial probability distribution. An example should demonstrate this technique:\nLet us say that 1,000 booklets were processed, each with 100 characters of data transcribed for a total of 100,000 characters. Let us say further that five of these characters were discovered to be in error in a random sample of 50 booklets that were completely checked; in other words, five errors were found in a sample of 5,000 characters. The following expression may be used to establish the probability that the\ntrue error rate is .0025 or less, rather than the single-value estimate of the observed rate of one in a thousand (.001):\n(57\u00b0) x .0025j .(1.0025)(5\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0-j)= .0147\nJ.\u00b0\nThis is the sum of the probability of finding five errors plus the probability of finding four errors plus. . . etc. . . plus the probability of finding zero errors in a sample of 5,000 with a true error rate of .0025; that is, the probability of finding five or fewer errors by chance when the true error rate is .0025. Notice that we did not use the size of the database in this expression. Actually, the assumption here is that our sample of 5,000 was drawn from a database that is infinite. The smaller the actual database is, the more confidence we can have in the observed error rate; for example, had there been only 5,000 in the total database, our sample would have included all the data, and the observed error rate would have been the true error rate. The result of the above computation allows us to say, conservatively, that .0025 is an upper limit on the true error rate with 98.53 percent (i.e., 1 - .0147) confidence; that is, we can be quite sure that our true error rate is no larger than .0025.\nVirtually all of the data collected for this assessment were machine-scanned. The only exception was a set of six booklets used for the long-term trend reading and writing assessments; the format these booklets was kept the same for comparability with earlier assessments, so these booklets had to be key-entered. As it happened, no errors at all were found in the sample of key-entered booklets selected for quality control.\n170\nQL. 194\n\n\fIn the 1994 and 1996 assessments, the selection of booklets for this comparison took place at the point of first entry into the recording process for data from the field. In earlier assessments, this selection took place only after data had reached the final database, in order to assure that only relevant booklets were involved in the quality control evaluation. The new selection process involves the risk that booklets will be selected that ultimately will not appear in the final database, however, as in 1994, sufficient\nnumbers of booklets were in fact selected.\n\nThe individual instruments are briefly discussed in the following sections and a summary table (Table 8-1) gives the upper 99.8 percent confidence limit for the error rate for each of the instruments as well as the sampling information.. The 99.8 percent confidence limit, and the selection rates noted, were chosen to make these results comparable to those of previous administrations when the same parameters were used.\n\nSelection Rate\nDifferent Booklets\nNumber of\nBooklets Sampled Number of Characters Sampled Number of Errors\nObserved Error Rate\nUpper 99.8% Confidence Limit\n\nTable 8-1 Summary of Quality Control Error Analysis for NAEP 1996 Data Entry\n\nMain Assessment\nStudent Booklets\n1/392\n203\n240\n\nLong-Term Trend\nAssessment Student Booklets\n1/372\n26\n101\n\nSD/LEP Student Questionnaires\n1/112\n2\n103\n\nTeacher Questionnaires\n1/120\n4\n38\n\n30,134\n\n12,082\n\n13,098\n\n6,741\n\n16 .0005\n.0011\n\n6 .0005\n.0015\n\n4 .0003\n.0011\n\n22 .0033\n.0058\n\nSchool Characteristics\nand Policies Questionnaires\n1/57\n3\n42\n6,633\n15\n.0023\n.0045\n\n8.3.1 Student Data\nData from about 94,000 students were processed across all samples in this assessment. Across all the student data, roughly one booklet in 392 was selected for close examination, which is comparable to the one in 400 target selection rate used in past assessments. The student data error rates were consistently low in all subject areas and across all three grades. The overall quality of the data was very high.\nData from some 30,000 additional students were also used in the study of long-term trends. These data showed the same consistently low error rates, as indicated in the accompanying table.\n\n195\n\n171\n\n\f8.3.2 SD/LEP Student Questionnaire Data\nIn this assessment, 13,098 SD/LEP questionnaires were scanned. The quality control sampling rate was one in 112, a somewhat higher rate than that used in previous assessments. The data showed a somewhat lower error rate than in previous assessmentscomparable to that for the student data. The few problems encountered involved the scanner's mistaking an erasure for a genuine response or failing to identify a multiple response as such.\n8.3.3 Teacher Questionnaire Data\nIn this assessment, 4,585 teacher questionnaires were collected and scanned. About one percent of these questionnaires was sampled for the quality control procedure. The error rates for these questionnaires were higher than those of any other category of data, and also higher than those found for teachers in past assessments. There was some evidence that the questionnaire layout was confusing to at least some of the teachers in the part of the questionnaire that was intended to collect class period information. While the majority of teachers did not have difficulty with this, consideration is being given to a possible revision of the questionnaire, since a number of teachers also had similar problems in the NAEP State Assessment.\n8.3.4 School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaire Data\nIn this assessment, 2,404 School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires were collected. They were sampled at a rate of about 1 in 57. Fifteen scanning errors were found in these questionnaires, which included both regular and long-term trend schools. Most of these errors came from a single booklet that had been filled out in pensomething that frequently gives a scanner trouble.\n8.4 NAEP DATABASE PRODUCTS\nThe NAEP database described to this point serves primarily to support analysis and reporting activities that are directly related to the NAEP contract. This database has a singular structure and access methodology that is integrated with the NAEP analysis and reporting programs. One of the directives of the NAEP contract is to provide secondary researchers with a nonproprietary version of the database that is portable to any computer system. In the event of transfer of NAEP to another client, the contract further requires ETS to provide a full copy of the internal database in a format that may be installed on a different computer system.\nIn fulfillment of these requirements, ETS provides two sets of database products: the item information database and the secondary-use data files. The contents, format and usage of these products are documented in the publications listed under the appropriate sections below.\n8.4.1 The Item Information Database\nThe NAEP item information database contains all of the descriptive, processing, and usage information for every assessment item developed and used for NAEP since 1970. The primary unit of this database is the item. Each NAEP item is associated with different levels of information, including usage\n172\n196\n\n\facross years and age cohorts, subject area classifications, response category descriptors, and locations of response data on secondary-use data files.\nThe item information database is used for a variety of essential NAEP tasks: providing statistical information to aid in test construction, determining the usage of items across assessment years and ages for trend and \"main\" analyses, labeling summary analyses and reports, and organizing items by subject area classifications for scaling analysis.\nThe creation, structure, and use of the NAEP item information database for all items used up to and including the 1996 assessment are fully documented in the NAEP publications A Guide to the NAEP Item Information Database (Rogers, Barone, & Kline, 1996) and A Primer for the NAEP Item Information Database (Rogers, Kline, Barone, Mychajlowycz, & Forer, 1989).\nThe procedures used to create the 1996 version of the item information database are the same as those documented in the guide. The version of the guide contains the subject area classification categories for the cognitive items.\n8.4.2 The Secondary-Use Data Files\nThe secondary-use data files are designed to enable any researcher with an interest in the NAEP database to perform secondary analysis on the same data as those used at ETS. The data, documentation and supporting files are distributed on CD-ROM media. For each sample in the assessment, the following files are provided: the response data file; a printable codebook file; a file of control statements that will generate an SPSS system file; a file of control statements that will generate a SAS system file; and a machine-readable catalog file. Each codebook file is in portable document file (PDF) format, which may be browsed, excerpted and printed using the Adobe Acrobat Reader program on a variety of platforms. Each machine-readable catalog file contains sufficient control and descriptive information to permit the user who does not have either SAS or SPSS to set up and perform data analysis.\nThe remainder of this section summarizes the procedures used in generating the data files and related materials.\n8.4.2.1 File Definition\nThe design of the 1996 assessment perpetuates two features of the 1990, 1992, and 1994 assessment design: the focused-BIB booklet design and the direct matching of teacher questionnaires to student assessment instruments. In addition, the sample of students who were excluded from the assessment is now incorporated into the appropriate assessed student subject area sample.\nThe focused-BIB design within the main assessment isolates the primary subject areas to separate groups of booklets. This permits the division of the main sample into subject-specific subsamples. The data files generated from these subsamples need only contain the data that are relevant to their corresponding subject areas and are therefore smaller and more manageable than their counterparts in previous assessments.\nAccording to the design of the 1984, 1986, and 1988 assessments, only a sample of the teachers of the assessed students were asked to fill out the teacher questionnaires. The large size of the secondary-use main student files and the relatively low matching rate between students and teachers\n173\n197\n\n\fmade it impractical if not physically prohibitive to produce a complete file with student and teacher information. Both the 1984 and 1986 secondary-use data packages had separate teacher data files which could be linked to the student data files for analysis. The teacher file in the 1988 secondary-use data package contained not only the teacher response data, but also the data from the students who could be matched to teacher questionnaires. This type of file was more appropriate for the analysis of teacher data because it defined the student as the unit of observation.\nThe intent of the 1996 assessment design was to collect data from mathematics or science teachers of the main assessment students at specified grade levels who were administered mathematics or science booklets. A portion of the teacher questionnaire contained questions that were directly related to each matched student. This change in the design afforded a very high matching rate between student and teacher data. Therefore, for those subject areas in each grade cohort for which teacher data were collected, the teacher responses were appended to each student record in the secondary-use data files.\n8.4.2.2 Definition of the Variables\nThe initial step in the variable definition process was the generation of a LABELS file of descriptors of the variables for each data file to be created. Each record in a LABELS file contains, for a single data field, the variable name, a short description of the variable, and processing control information to be used by later steps in the data generation process. This file could be edited for deletion of variables, modification of control parameters, or reordering of the variables within the file. The LABELS file is an intermediate file only; it is not included on the released data files.\nThe variables on all data files are grouped and arranged in the following order: identification information, weights, derived variables, proficiency scores (where applicable), and response data. On the student data files, these fields are followed by the teacher response data and the SD/LEP student questionnaire data, where applicable. The identification information is taken from the front covers of the instruments. The weight data include sample descriptors, selection probabilities, and replicate weights for the estimation of sampling error. The derived data include sample descriptions from other sources and variables that are derived from the response data for use in analysis or reporting.\nFor each subject area of the main assessment, the item response data within each block were left in their order of presentation. The blocks, however, were arranged according to the following scheme: common background, subject-related background, the cognitive blocks in ascending numerical order, and student motivation. The responses to cognitive blocks that were not present in a given booklet were left blank, signifying a condition of \"missing by design.\"\nIn order to process and analyze the spiral sample data effectively, the user must also be able to determine, from a given booklet record, which blocks of item response data were present and their relative order in the instrument. This problem was remedied by the creation of a set of control variables, one for each block, which indicated not only the presence or absence of the block but its order in the instrument. These control variables are included with the derived variables.\n8.4.2.3 Data Definition\nTo enable the data files to be processed on any computer system using any procedural or programming language, it was desirable that the data be expressed in numeric format. This was possible, but not without the adoption of certain conventions for reexpressing the data values.\n174\n193\n\n\fDuring creation of the NAEP database, the responses to all multiple-choice items were transcribed and stored in the database using the letter codes printed in the instruments. This scheme afforded the advantage of saving storage space for items with 10 or more response options, but at the expense of translating these codes into their numeric equivalents for analysis purposes. The response data fields for most of these items would require a simple alphabetic-to-numeric conversion. However, the data fields for items with 10 or more response choices would require \"expansion\" before the conversion, since the numeric value would require two column positions. One of the processing control parameters on the LABELS file indicates whether or not the data field is to be expanded before conversion and\noutput.\nThe ETS database contained special codes to indicate certain response conditions: \"I don't know\" responses, multiple responses, omitted responses, not-reached responses, and unresolvable responses, which include out-of-range responses and responses that were missing due to errors in printing or processing. The scoring guides for the mathematics and science constructed-response items included additional special codes for ratings of \"illegible,\" \"I don't know,\" \"off task,\" or non-rateable by the scorers. All of these codes had to be reexpressed in a consistent numeric format.\nThe following convention was adopted and used in the designation of these codes: The \"illegible\" response codes were converted to 5; the \"off task\" response codes were converted to 6; the \"I don't know\" and non-rateable response codes were converted to 7; the \"omitted\" response codes were converted to 8; the \"not reached\" response codes were converted to 9; and the multiple response codes were converted to 0; and. The out-of-range and missing responses were coded as blank fields, corresponding to the \"missing by design\" designation.\nThis coding scheme created conflicts for those multiple-choice items that had seven or more valid response options as well as the \"I don't know\" response and for those constructed-response items whose scoring guide had five or more categories. These data fields were also expanded to accommodate the valid response values and the special codes. In these cases, the special codes were \"extended\" to fill the output data field: the \"I don't know\" and non-rateable codes were extended from 7 to 77, omitted response codes from 8 to 88, etc.\nEach numeric variable on the secondary-use files was classified as either continuous or discrete. The continuous variables include the weights, proficiency scores, identification codes, and item responses where counts or percentages were requested. The discrete variables include those items for which each numeric value corresponds to a response category. The designation of \"discrete\" also includes those derived variables to which numeric classification categories have been assigned. The constructed-response items were treated as a special subset of the discrete variables and were assigned to a separate category to facilitate their identification in the documentation.\n\n8.4.2.4 Data File Catalogs\nThe CATALOG file is created by the GENCAT program from the LABELS file and the 1996 master catalog file. Each record on the LABELS file generates a CATALOG record by first retrieving the master catalog record corresponding to the field name. The master catalog record contains usage, classification, and response code information, along with positional information from the LABELS file: field sequence number, output column position, and field width. Like the LABELS file, the CATALOG file is an intermediate file and is not included on the released data files.\n\n199\n\n175\n\n\fThe information for the response codes, also referred to as \"foils,\" consists of the valid data values for the discrete numeric fields, and a 20-character description of each. The GENCAT program uses additional control information from the LABELS file to determine if extra foils should be generated and saved with each CATALOG record. The first flag controls generation of the \"I don't know\" or nonrateable foil; the second flag regulates omitted or not-reached foil generation; and the third flag denotes the possibility of multiple responses for that field and sets up an appropriate foil. All of these control parameters, including the expansion flag, may be altered in the LABELS file by use of a text editor, in order to control the generation of data or descriptive information for any given field.\nThe LABELS file supplies control information for many of the subsequent secondary-use data processing steps. The CATALOG file provides detailed information for those and other steps.\n8.4.2.5 Data File Layouts\nThe data file layouts were the first user product to be generated in the secondary-use data files process. The generation program, GENLYT, used a CATALOG file as input and produced a printable file. The LAYOUT file is little more than a formatted listing of the CATALOG file.\nEach line of the LAYOUT file contains the following information for a single data field: sequence number, field name, output column position, field width, number of decimal places, data type, value range, key or correct response value, and a short description of the field. The sequence number of each field is implied from its order on the LABELS file. The field name is an 8-character label for the field that is to be used consistently by all secondary-use data files materials to refer to that field on that file. The output column position is the relative location of the beginning of that field on each record for that file, using bytes or characters as the unit of measure. The field width indicates the number of columns used in representing the data values for a field. If the field contains continuous numeric data, the value under the number of decimal places entry indicates how many places to shift the decimal point before processing data values.\nThe data type category uses five codes to designate the nature of the data in the field: Continuous numeric data are coded \"C;\" discrete numeric data are coded \"D;\" constructed-response item data are coded \"OS;\" if the item was dichotomized for scaling and \"OE;\" if it was scaled under a polytomous response model. Additionally, the discrete numeric fields that include \"I don't know\" response codes are coded \"DI.\" If the field type is discrete numeric, the value range is listed as the minimum and maximum permitted values separated by a hyphen to indicate range. If the field is a response to a scorable item, the correct option value, or key, is printed; if the field is an assigned score that was scaled as a dichotomous item using cut point scoring, the range of correct scores is printed. Each variable is further identified by a 50-character descriptor.\n8.4.2.6 Data Codebooks\nThe data codebook is a printed document containing complete descriptive information for each data field. Most of this information originates from the CATALOG file; the remaining data comes from the COUNTS file and the IRT parameters file.\nEach data field receives at least one line of descriptive information in the codebook. If the data type is continuous numeric, no more information is given. If the variable is discrete numeric, the codebook lists the foil codes, foil labels, and frequencies of each value in the data file. Additionally, if\n176\n200\n\n\fthe field represents an item used in IRT scaling, the codebook lists the parameters used by the scaling\nprogram.\nCertain blocks of cognitive items in the 1996 assessment that are to be used again in later assessments for trend comparisons have been designated as nonreleased. In order to maintain their confidentiality, generic labels have been substituted for the response category descriptions of these items in the data codebooks and the secondary-use files.\nThe frequency counts are not available on the catalog file, but must be generated from the data. The GENFREQ program creates the COUNTS file using the field name to locate the variable in the database, and the foil values to validate the range of data values for each field. This program also serves as a check on the completeness of the foils in the CATALOG file, as it flags any data values not represented by a foil value and label.\nThe IRT parameter file is linked to the CATALOG file through the field name. Printing of the IRT parameters is governed by a control flag in the classification section of the CATALOG record. If an item has been.scaled for use in deriving the proficiency estimates, the IRT parameters are listed to the right of the foil values and labels, and the score value for each response code is printed to the immediate right of the corresponding frequency.\nThe LAYOUT and CODEBOOK files are written by their respective generation programs to print-image disk data files. Draft copies are printed and distributed for review before the production copy is generated. The production copy combines the LAYOUT and CODEBOOK files for each sample in a portable document file (PDF) format. This file may be browsed, excerpted and printed using the Adobe Acrobat Reader program on a variety of platforms and operating systems.\n\n8.4.2.7 Control Statement Files for Statistical Packages\nAn additional requirement of the NAEP cooperative agreement is to provide, for each secondary-use data file, a file of control statements each for the SAS and SPSS statistical systems that will convert the raw data file into the system data file for that package. Two separate programs, GENSAS and GENSPX, generate these control files using the CATALOG file as input.\nEach of the control files contains separate sections for variable definition, variable labeling, missing value declaration, value labeling, and creation of scored variables from the cognitive items. The variable definition section describes the locations of the fields, by name, in the file, and, if applicable, the number of decimal places or type of data. The variable label identifies each field with a 50-character description. The missing value section identifies values of those variables that are to be treated as missing and excluded from analyses. The value labels correspond to the foils in the CATALOG file. The code values and their descriptors are listed for each discrete numeric variable. The scoring section is provided to permit the user to generate item score variables in addition to the item response variables.\nEach of the code generation programs combines three steps into one complex procedure. As each CATALOG file record is read, it is broken into several component records according to the information to be used in each of the resultant sections. These record fragments are tagged with the field sequence number and a section sequence code. They are then organized by section code and sequence number. Finally, the reorganized information is output in a structured formatdictated by the syntax of the\nprocessing language.\n\n201\n\n177\n\n\fThe generation of the system files accomplishes the testing of these control statement files. The system files are saved for use in special analyses by NAEP staff. These control statement files are included on the distributed data files to permit users with access to SAS and/or SPSS to create their own system files.\n8.4.2.8 Machine-Readable Catalog Files\nFor those NAEP data users who have neither SAS nor SPSS capabilities, yet require processing control information in a computer-readable format, the distribution files also contain machine-readable catalog files. Each machine-readable catalog record contains processing control information, IRT parameters, and foil codes and labels.\n8.4.2.9 NAEP Data on Disk\nThe complete set of secondary-use data files described above are available on CD-ROM as part of the NAEP Data on Disk product suite. This medium can be ideal for researchers and policy makers operating in a personal computing environment.\nThe NAEP Data on Disk product suite includes two other components which facilitate the analysis of NAEP secondary-use data. The PC-based NAEPdata extraction software, NAEPEX, enables users to create customized extracts of NAEP data and to generate SAS or SPSS control statements for preparing analyses or generating customized system files. The NAEP analysis modules, which currently run under SPSS\u00b0 for Windows TM, use output files from the extraction software to perform analyses that incorporate statistical procedures appropriate for the NAEP design.\n\n178\n\n202\n\n\fChapter 9\nOVERVIEW OF PART II: THE ANALYSIS OF 1996 NAEP DATA'\nNancy L.

One component encompassed major assessments in mathematics and science, providing detailed information about student proficiency at the fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade levels of nonpublic and public schools. Long-term trend assessments of science, mathematics, and reading at ages 9, 13, and 17, and the longterm trend writing assessment for grades 4, 8, and 11, constituted the second component. The third major component was the State Assessment at the fourth- and eighth-grade levels in mathematics and at the eighth-grade level in science. Technical details of the State Assessments are not included in this report but are presented in the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Mathematics (Allen, Jenkins, Kulick, & Zelenak, 1997) and the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Science (Allen, Swinton, Isham, & Zelenak, 1997).\nIn addition to the three major components, special studies of advanced mathematics students at the eighth- and twelfth-grade levels and advanced science students at the twelfth-grade level were conducted. The results from and procedures used in these special studies are reported in separate documents. Likewise, results from a study of holistic scores for the long-term trend writing task responses are reported in.a separate document. Results based on primary trait scores for the same writing tasks are reported in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997), and the analyses contributing to those results are described in Chapters 14-17 of this document. Finally, results for the items associated with specific mathematics themes are reported elsewhere.\nResults from the analyses described in the following chapters were reported in the following reports:\nThe NAEP 1996 Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States, which provides both public- and nonpublic-school data for major NAEP reporting\n180\n4\n\n\fsubgroups for all of the jurisdictions that participated in the State Assessment\nprogram, as well as selected results from the 1996 national mathematics assessment.\nThe NAEP 1996 Science Report Card for the Nation and the States, which provides both public- and nonpublic-school data for major NAEP reporting subgroups for all of the jurisdictions that participated in the State Assessment program, as well as selected results from the 1996 national science assessment.\nThe Cross-State Data Compendium for the NAEP 1996 Mathematics Assessment, which includes jurisdiction-level results for all the demographic, instructional, and experiential background variables included in the Mathematics Report Card and State Reports.\nThe Cross-State Data Compendium for the NAEP 1996 Science Assessment, which includes jurisdiction-level results for all the demographic, instructional, and experiential background variables included in the Science Report Card and State Reports.\nThe NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress, which looks at trends in average performance over time in the areas of mathematics, science, reading, and writing.\nBecause the samples of students included in the 1996 NAEP assessment arelisted and described in detail in Chapter 1, only a brief description of these samples is given here. The 1996 national samples were of three general types: main NAEP samples, which were based on a common set of assessment procedures, including grade-level samples; long-term trend samples, the purpose of which was to provide links to earlier assessments; and special study samples, used to examine results for advanced mathematics and science students.\nTo shorten the timetable for reporting results, the period for national main assessment data collection was shortened in 1992, 1994, and 1996 from the five-month period (January through May) used in 1990 and earlier assessments to a three-month period in the winter (January through March, corresponding to the period used for the winter half-sample of the 1990 National Assessment).\nThe 1996 analyses of long-term trend data extended the trend lines commencing in 1971 in reading, 1973 in mathematics, 1969 in science, and 1984 in writing.\nAs described in Chapters 1 and 4, for each subject area in the main assessment, blocks of items were used to create a large number of different assessment booklets according to a focused design. The 1996 mathematics assessment used a focused balanced incomplete block (focused-BIB) design while the 1996 science assessment used a more complex design due to the inclusion of blocks of items associated with a specific theme or hands-on performance task. The focused-BIB design provided for booklets that typically included three blocks of cognitive items in a single subject area, as well as background items. The blocks of cognitive items for mathematics and science included both multiple-choice and constructed-response items. In a focused-BIB design, each block of cognitive items appears in the same number of booklets. To balance possible block position main effects, each block appears an equal number of times in each position. In addition, the BIB design requires that each block of items be paired in a booklet with every other block of items exactly once.\nr\nLI J\n181\n\n\f9.3 ANALYSIS STEPS\n\nBecause the analysis methods are not identical across subject areas or across major national and\n\nlong-term trend samples, a separate analysis chapter has been included for each major assessment and for\n\neach long-term trend assessment. The procedures used depended on whether assessment items were\n\nscored dichotomously (right versus wrong) or polytomously (more than two categories of whether links across grade levels were required. Basic procedures common to most or all\n\nresponse) and of the subject\n\narea analyses are summarized here. The order is essentially that in which the procedures were carried out.\n\n9.3.1 Preparation of Final Sampling Weights\n\nBecause NAEP uses a complex sampling design (Chapter 3) in which students in certain\n\nsubpopulations have different probabilities of inclusion in the sample, the data collected from each\n\nstudent must be assigned a weight to be used in analyses. The 1996 NAEP weights were provided by\n\nWestat, Inc., the NAEP contractor in charge of sampling. Detailed information about the weighting\n\nprocedures is Rust, 1999).\n\navailable\n\nin\n\nChapter\n\n10\n\nand\n\nin\n\nThe\n\n1996\n\nNAEP\n\nSampling\n\nand\n\nWeighting\n\nReport\n\n(Wallace\n\n&\n\n9.3.2 Reliability of Scoring Constructed-Response Items\n\nA minimum of 25 percent of the responses for science items involved only in the national\n\nassessment and six percent of the responses for mathematics and science items involved in both the\n\nnational and state assessments were scored by a second reader to obtain statistics on interreader\n\n(interrater) reliability.

They appear in Appendix I. These include a final percentage exact agreement, the intraclass correlation, Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1968), and the product-moment correlation between the scores for the first and second readers. These measures are summarized in Zwick (1988), Kaplan and Johnson (1992), and Abedi (1996). Each measure has advantages and disadvantages for use in different situations. In this report, the percentage exact agreement is reported for all constructed-response items, Cohen's Kappa is reported for dichotomously scored constructed-response\nitems, and the intraclass correlation is reported for polytomously scored constructed-response items.\n\n9.3.3 Teacher Questionnaires\nTeachers of students who were in the fourth- and eighth-grade mathematics and science main assessment samples and twelfth-grade advanced mathematics samples were asked to complete a two-part questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire pertained to the teacher's background and training (Parts I and IIA in Chapter 2). The second part pertained to the procedures used by the teacher for specific classes containing assessed students (Parts IIB I Chapter 2). See Chapter 2 for a description of\nthe teacher questionnaires.\nTo analyze the data from the teacher questionnaires with respect to the students' data, each teacher's questionnaire had to be matched to all of the sampled students who were taught by that teacher. In the subsequent chapters two separate match rates for each grade are given. The first is the percentage of students that could be matched to both the first and second parts of the teacher questionnaire. For these students, information is available not only about the background and training of their teachers, but also about the methods used in the particular class they attended. The second match rate is the percentage of students that could be matched to the first part of the teacher questionnaire. This match rate is larger because more students could be matched with information about a teacher than with information about the particular class they attended. Note that these match rates only reflect the student-level missing data. They do not reflect the additional missing data due to item-level nonresponse on the part of teachers. Variables derived from the teacher questionnaires were used as reporting variables at the student level and as variables that contributed to conditioning for the appropriate samples.\nTeachers of students who were in the grade 4 mathematics main assessment sample were asked to complete a two-part questionnaire. As with the grade 8 teacher questionnaire, the first part pertained to the teacher's background and training. Unlike the grade 8 teacher questionnaire, the second part pertained to only a single class that the teacher taught. In development of the questionnaires, it was thought that fourth-grade teachers would teach one class in each subject. In practice, that was found to be untrue for a number of teachers. A single student-teacher match rate matching students to the.first part of the questionnaire is reported for grade 4 in the following chapters.\n\n9.3.4 Analysis of Item Properties: Background and Cognitive Items\nThe first step in the analysis of the 1996 data was item-level analysis of all instruments. Item analyses were performed separately for each grade or age level on each item in each subject area. Each block of items was analyzed separately, by age or grade, with the total score on the block (including the analyzed item) used as the criterion score for statistics requiring such a score. In the cases where final weights were not available, preliminary weights were used in these preliminary analyses. The item\n\n207\n\n183\n\n\fanalysis of cognitive items was repeated after scaling of the items was completed. The results for only scaled items using final weights are reported in Chapters 12 through 17.\n\n<> Background Items\nFor each NAEP background item, the unweighted and weighted percent of students who gave each response were examined, as well as the percent of students who omitted the item and the percent who did not reach the item. The number of respondents was also tabulated. These preliminary analyses were conducted within age/grade cohorts and within major reporting categories. If unexpected results were found, the item data and the encoding of responses were rechecked.\n\ncD, Cognitive Items\n\nAll NAEP cognitive items were subjected to analyses of item properties. These analyses included conventional item analyses and incorporated examinee sampling weights. Item analysis was conducted at the block level so that the \"number-correct\" scores for students responding to an item, selecting each option of an item, omitting an item, or not reaching an item, is the average number of correct responses for the block containing that item. Because of the inclusion of polytomously scored items in the cognitive instruments, it was necessary to use special procedures for these items. The resulting statistics are analogous to those for the dichotomously scored items, as listed below.\nDichotomously Scored Items. These items were analyzed using standard procedures that result in a report for each item that includes:\nfor each option of the item, for examinees omitting'and not reaching the item, and for the total sample of examinees:\n\nthe number of examinees,\n\nthe percentage of examinees,\n\nthe mean of number-correct scores for the block in which the item appears, and\nthe standard deviation of number-correct scores for the block in which the item appears;\n\nthe percentage of examinees providing a response that was \"off-task;\"\np+, the proportion of examinees that received a correct score on the item (ratio of number correct to number correct plus wrong plus omitted);\n\nA, the inverse-normally transformed p+ scaled to mean 13 and standard deviation 4;\nthe biserial correlation coefficient between the item and the number-correct scores for the block in which the item appears; and\n\nthe point-biserial correlation coefficient between the item and the number-correct scores for the block in which the item appears.\n\n184\n\n208\n\n\fPolytomously Scored Items. Enhanced procedures were employed for polytomously scored items. Methods parallel to those used for dichotomously scored items resulted in values reported for each distinct response category for the item. Response categories for each item were defined in two ways, one based on the original codes for responses as specified in the scoring rubrics used by the scorers (and the position of the item for which no response was given) and one based on a scoring guide developed by subject area and measurement experts. For example, a constructed-response item with four response categories would initially have seven categories (not-reached, omitted, \"off-task,\" and the four valid response categories). Another set of statistics resulted from mapping the response categories (excluding not-reached) into a new set of categories reflecting the scoring guide for the item. A constructed-response item with ordered categories, for example, would be mapped into a set of integers in a corresponding order. The scoring guide could result in the collapsing of (combining of) some response categories. The response categories, based on the final scoring guide developed by subject area and measurement experts, were used to calculate the polytomously scored item statistics.\nThe following statistics, analogous to those for dichotomously scored items, were computed;\nthe percentage of examinees providing a response that was \"off-task;\"\nin place of p+, the ratio of the mean item score to the maximum-possible item score was used;\nin place of A, the ratio of the mean item score to the maximum-possible item score underwent the same transformation as that used on p+ to get A for dichotomously scored items;\nthe polyserial correlation coefficient was used in place of the biserial; and\nthe Pearson correlation coefficient was used in place of the point-biserial.\n\ng* Tables of Item-Level Results\nTables were created of the percentages of students choosing each of the possible responses to each item within each of the samples administered in 1996. The results for each item were crosstabulated against the basic reporting variables such as region, gender, race/ethnicity, public/nonpublic school, and parental education. All percentages were computed using the sampling weights. These tables are referred to as the Test Question section of the electronically delivered summary data tables for each sample (see Chapter 18 for a brief description of summary data tables). In the summary data tables, the sampling variability of all population estimates was obtained by the jackknife procedure used by ETS in previous assessments. Details of these procedures are presented in Chapter 10.\n\nDifferential Item Functioning Analysis of Cognitive Items\nDifferential item functioning (DIF) analysis refers to procedures to assess whether items are differentially difficult for different groups of examinees. D1F procedures typically control for overall between-group differences on a criterion, usually by matching examinees from the two groups on overall test scores. Between-group performance on each item is then compared within sets of examinees having the same total test scores.\n\n209\n\n185\n\n\fDIF analyses were conducted for items in the main assessments in mathematics and science that had not previously been studied for differential item functioning. Each set of analyses involved three reference group/focal group comparisons: male/female, White/Black, and White/Hispanic.\nThe DIF analyses of the dichotomous items were based on the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square procedure, as adapted by Holland and Thayer (1988). The procedure tests the statistical hypothesis that the odds of correctly answering an item are the same for two groups of examinees that have been matched on some measure of proficiency (usually referred to as the matching criterion). The DIF analyses of the polytomous items were based on the Mantel procedure (Mantel, 1963). These procedures compare proportions of matched examinees from each group in each polytomous item response category. The groups being compared are often referred to as the focal group (usually a minority or other group of interest, such as Black examinees or female examinees) and the reference group (usually White examinees or male examinees).\nFor both types of analyses, the measure of proficiency used is typically the total item score on some collection of items. Since, by the nature of the BIB design, booklets comprise different combinations of blocks, there is no single set of items common to all examinees. Therefore, for each student, the measure of proficiency used was the total item score on the entire booklet. These scores were then pooled across booklets for each analysis. This procedure is described by Allen and Donoghue (1994, 1996). In addition, because research results (Zwick & Grima, 1991) strongly suggest that sampling weights should be used in conducting DIF analyses, the weights were used.\nFor each dichotomous item in the assessment, an estimate of the Mantel-Haenszel common oddsratio, expressed on the ETS delta scale for item difficulty, was produced. The estimates indicate the difference between reference group and focal group item difficulties (measured in ETS delta scale units), and typically run between about +3 and -3. Positive values indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group than the reference group after making an adjustment for the overall level of proficiency in the two groups. Similarly, negative values indicate items that are differentially harder for the focal group than the reference group. It is common practice at ETS to categorize each item into one of three categories (Petersen, 1988): \"A\" (items exhibiting no DIF), \"B\" (items exhibiting a weak indication of DIF), or \"C\" (items exhibiting a strong indication of DIF). Items in category \"A\" have Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratios on the delta scale that do not differ significantly from 0 at the alpha = .05 level or are less than 1.0 in absolute value. Category \"C\" items are those with Mantel-Haenszel values that are significantly greater than 1 and larger than 1.5 in absolute rragnitude. Other items are categorized as \"B\" items. A plus sign (+) indicates that items are differentially easier for the focal group; a minus sign (-) indicates that items are differentially more difficult for the focal group.\nThe ETS/NAEP DIF procedure for polytomous items uses the Mantel-Haenszel ordinal procedure. The summary tables of identified polytomous items contain generalizations of the dichotomous \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" categories: \"AA,\" \"BB,\" or \"CC.\"\nAll analyses used rescaled sampling weights. A separate rescaled weight was defined for each comparison as\nRescaled Weight = Original Weight x Total Sample Size Sum of the Weights\nwhere the total sample size is the total number of students for the two groups being analyzed (e.g., for the White/Hispanic comparison, the total number of White and Hispanic examinees in the sample at that grade), and the sum of the weights is the sum of the sampling weights of all the students in the sample for\n186\nc()- J4. 0\n\n\fthe two groups being analyzed. Three rescaled weights were computed for White examineesone for the gender comparison and two for the race/ethnicity comparisons. Two rescaled overall weights were computed for the Black and Hispanic examineesone for the gender comparison and another for the appropriate race/ethnicity comparison. The resealed weights were used to ensure that the sum of the weights for each analysis equaled the number of students in that comparison, thus providing an accurate\nbasis for significance testing.\nIn the calculation of total item scores for the matching criterion, both not-reached and omitted items were considered to be wrong responses. Polytomous items were weighted more heavily in the formation of the matching criterion, proportional to the number of score categories. For each item, calculation of the Mantel-Haenszel statistic did not include data from examinees who did not reach the\nitem in question. Each DIF analysis was a two-step process. In the initial phase, total item scores were formed, and\nthe calculation of DIF indices was completed. Before the second phase, the matching criterion was refined by removing all \"C\" or \"CC\" items, if any, from the total item score. The revised score was used in the final calculation of all DlF indices. Note that when analyzing an item classified as \"C\" or \"CC\" in the initial phase, that item score is added back into the total score for the analysis of that item only.\nFollowing standard practice at ETS for DIF analyses conducted on final forms, all \"C\" or \"CC\" items were reviewed by a committee of trained test developers and subject-matter specialists. Such committees are charged with making judgments about whether or not the differential difficulty of an item is unfairly related to group membership. The committee assembled to review NAEP items included both ETS staff and outside members with expertise in the field. The committee carefully examined each identified item to determine if either the language or contents would tend to make the item more difficult for an identified group of examinees. It was the committee's judgment that none of the \"C\" or \"CC\" items in the national assessment were functioning differentially due to factors irrelevant to test objectives. Hence, none of the items were removed from scaling due to differential item functioning. As\npointed out by Zieky (1993):\nIt is important to realize that DIF is not a synonym for bias. The item response theory based\nmethods, as well as the Mantel-Haenszel and standardization methods of DIF detection, will identify questions that are not measuring the same dimension(s) as the bulk of the items in the matching criterion....Therefore, judgment is required to determine whether or not the difference in difficulty shown by a DIF index is unfairly related to group membership. The judgment of fairness is based on\nwhether or not the difference in difficulty is believed to be related to the construct being measured....The fairness of an item depends directly on the purpose for which a test is being used. For example, a science item that is differentially difficult for women may be judged to be fair in a\ntest designed for certification of science teachers because the item measures a topic that every entrylevel science teacher should know. However, that same item, with the same DIF value, may be judged to be unfair in a test of general knowledge designed for all entry-level teachers. (p. 340)\n\n9.3.5 Scaling\nScales based on item response theory (IRT) were derived for each subject area. A single scale was used for summarizing long-term trends at each age or grade level in each of the subject areas. Five scales were created for mathematics main assessment data, one for each mathematics content strand, and three scales were created for science data, one for each field of science. NAEP uses the methodology of multiple imputations (plausible values) to estimate characteristics of the proficiency distributions.\n\n211\n\n187\n\n\fChapter 11 describes in detail the theoretical underpinnings of NAEP's scaling methods and the required estimation procedures. The basic analysis steps are outlined here.\n1. Use the NAEP-BILOG/PARSCALE computer program (described in Chapter 11) to estimate the parameters of the item response functions on an arbitrary provisional scale. This program uses an IRT model incorporating the two- and three-parameter logistic forms used in previous assessments for dichotomously scored items and the generalized partial credit form for polytomously scored items. In order to select starting values for the iterative parameter-estimation procedure for each dataset, the program is first run to convergence, imposing the condition of a fixed normal prior distribution of the proficiency variable. Once these starting values are computed, the main estimation runs model ability as a multinomial distribution. That is, no prior assumption about the shape of the proficiency distribution is made. In analyses involving more than one population, estimates of parameters are made with the overall mean and standard deviation of all subjects' proficiencies specified to be 0 and 1, respectively.\n2. Use a version of the MGROUP program (described in Chapter 11), which\nimplements the method of Mislevy (see Chapter 11 or Mislevy, 1991) to estimate predictive proficiency distributions for each student on an arbitrary scale, based on the item parameter estimates and the student's responses to cognitive items and background questions.\n3. Use random draws from these predictive proficiency distributions (plausible values,\nin NAEP terminology) for computing the statistics of interest, such as mean\nproficiencies for demographic groups.\n4. Determine the appropriate metric for reporting the results and transform the results as needed. This includes the linking of current scales to scales from the past or the selection of the mean and variance of new scales. After proficiency distributions for the scaling are transformed, composite proficiency distributions are created for the mathematics and science assessments.\n5. Use the jackknife procedure to estimate the standard errors of the mean proficiencies for the various demographic groups.\nAs explained in Chapter 11, the plausible values obtained through the IRT approach are not optimal estimates of individual proficiency; instead, they serve as intermediate values to be used in estimating subpopulation characteristics. Under the assumptions of the scaling models, these subpopulation estimates are statistically consistent, which would not be true of subpopulation estimates obtained by aggregating optimal estimates of individual proficiency.\nc:> Scaling the Cognitive Items\nThe data from both the trend and the main assessment samples were scaled using IRT models. For dichotomously scored items two- and three-parameter logistic forms of the model were used, while for polytomously scored items the generalized partial credit model form was used. These two types of items and models were combined in the NAEP scales. Item parameter estimates on a provisional scale were obtained using the NAEP BILOG/PARSCALE program. The fit of the IRT model to the observed\n188\n2 1 2\n\n\fdata was examined within each scale by comparing the empirical item response functions with the theoretical curves, as described in Chapter 11. Plots of the empirical item response functions and theoretical curves were compared across assessments for long-term trend assessments. The DIF analyses previously described provide information related to the model fit across subpopulations.\nLong-Term Trend Scaling. Item parameters for science, mathematics, reading, and writing trends were reestimated, separately for each age or age/grade group using the data from the 1994 assessment as well as data from the 1996 assessment. The resulting scales, based on these reestimated item parameters, were then linked to the existing long-term trend scales.\nMain Assessment Scaling. The main assessments of mathematics and science both have special characteristics that determine the procedures that were followed for the scaling and of each subject. For mathematics, a key consideration was the degree of similarity between the 1996 assessment and earlier assessments in terms of the populations assessed and the characteristics of the assessment instrument used. This was due to the fact that the mathematics scales were linked to existing mathematics scales. For science, characteristics of items associated with particular themes and hands-on performance tasks were of concern. The science scales were not linked to any previously defined scales.\nThe frameworks for the different subject areas dictate differences in the numbers of scales. For mathematics and science, item parameter estimation was performed separately for each of several scales defined in their frameworks, using data from each age/grade sample separately.\nGeneration of Plausible Values for Each Scale\nAfter the scales were developed, plausible values were drawn from the predictive distribution of proficiency values for each student (this process is called conditioning). For the long-term trend scales, the plausible values were computed separately for each age or age/grade group and year, and were based on the student's responses to the items going into the scale as well as on the values of a set of background variables that were important for the reporting of proficiency scores. For the mathematics and science main scales, vectors of multivariate plausible values were drawn from the joint distribution of proficiency values for the assessed student. These multivariate plausible values were computed separately for each grade and reflected the dependency between scale proficiencies by utilizing shared variation among the scales. All plausible values were later rescaled to the final scale metric using appropriate linear transformations.\nThe variables used to calculate plausible values for a given main assessment scale or group of scales included a broad spectrum of background, attitude, and experiential variables and composites of such variables. All standard reporting variables were included. To enhance numerical stability for the main assessment scales, the original background variables were standardized and transformed into a set of linearly independent variables by extracting principal components from the correlation matrix of the original contrast variables. The principal components, rather than the original variables, were used as independent variables to calculate plausible values for those scales. Trend scales used the same or similar sets of conditioning variables that were used when the scales were originally constructed. Details of the conditioning process and of the NAEP-BGROUP and NAEP-CGROUP computer programs that implement the process are presented in Chapter 11.\n213\n189\n\n\fc:> Transformation to the Reporting Metric\n\nMathematics short-term trend and science, mathematics, reading, and writing long-term trend scales were linked to previous assessment scales via common population linking procedures described in the subject-specific data analysis chapters. Essentially, the 1994 and 1996 data were calibrated together. Data from the two assessments were scaled together in the same BILOG/PARSCALE run, specifying the samples for each assessment as coming from different populations. For each scale, the mean and standard deviation of the 1994 data from this joint calibration were matched to the mean and standard deviation of the 1994 data as previously reported. This then linked the 1996 data to the previously established scale. New scales were established for the science main assessment. Then the metrics for the newly established science scales were set to have a mean of 150 and a standard deviation of 35.\nThe transformations were of the form\n\nwhere\n\n()target = A Ocalibrated B\n\ntarget = scale level in terms of the system of units of the final scale used for reporting;\n\nOcalibrated = scale level in terms of the system of units of the provisional NAEP-BILOG/PARSCALE scale;\n\nA\n\n= SDtarget SDcalibrated ;\n\nSDtarget\n\n= Mtarget A Mcaribrated ;\n= the estimated or selected standard deviation of the proficiency distribution to be matched;\n\nSpcalibrated = the estimated standard deviation of the sample proficiency distribution on the provisional NAEP-BILOG/PARSCALE scale;\n\nMtarget\n\n= the estimated or selected mean of the proficiency distribution to be matched; and\n\nMcalibrated = the estimated mean of the sample proficiency distribution on the provisional NAEP-BILOG/PARSCALE scale.\n\nAfter the plausible values were linearly transformed to the new scale, any plausible value less than 0 was censored to 0. For all 1996 assessments other than the science main assessment, any value greater than 500 was censored to 500; for the science main assessment, any value greater than 300 was censored to 300. Fewer than 1 percent of the students in any sample were censored in this way. The final transformation coefficients for transforming each provisional scale to the final reporting scale are given in subsequent chapters.\n\n214\n190\n\n\f* Definition of Composites for the Multivariate Scales\nIn addition to the plausible values for each scale, composites of the individual mathematics and science main assessment scales were created as measures of overall proficiency within these subject areas. These composites were weighted averages of the plausible values of the individual scales. The weights reflected the relative importance of the scales and were provided in the frameworks developed by the subject area committees. The weights are approximately proportional.to the number of items in each scale at a given grade level.\n* Tables of Proficiency Means and Other Reported Statistics\nProficiencies and trends in proficiencies were reported by age or grade for a variety of reporting categories. Additionally, for the main assessments, the percentages of the students within each of the reporting groups who were at or above achievement levels were reported to provide information about the distribution of achievement within each subject area. For the long-term trend assessments, the percentages of the students within each of the reporting groups who were at or above anchor points were reported for the same reason. All estimates based on proficiency values have reported variances or standard errors based on proficiency values including the error component due to the latency of proficiency values of individual students as well as the error component due to sampling variability. These tables are part of the electronically delivered summary data tables.\n9.3.6 Dimensionality Analysis\nOver the years a number of studies have been conducted in order to seek answers to the question of how many dimensions underlie the various NAEP assessment instruments, and whether there is a sufficiently strong first dimension to support inferences about a composite scale in subjects such as mathematics, science, and reading. In addition, for the 1992 mathematics and reading assessments, a study was conducted (Carlson, 1993) to determine whether the increasing emphasis on extended constructed-response items that are scored polytomously has any effect on the dimensionality. It was determined that for the 1992 NAEP data, item type was not related to any of the dimensions identified.\n* Previous Dimensionality Analyses of NAEP Data\nIn an early study, NAEP reading assessment data collected during the 1983-84 academic year was examined for dimensionality by Zwick (1986, 1987). Zwick also studied simulated data designed to mirror the NAEP reading item-response data but having known dimensionality. Analysis of the simulated datasets allowed her to determine whether the BIB spiraling design artificially increases dimensionality. Zwick found substantial agreement among various statistical procedures, and that the results using BIB spiraling were similar to results for complete datasets. Overall she concluded that \"it is not unreasonable to treat the data as unidimensional (1987, p. 306).\"\nRock (1991) studied the dimensionality of the NAEP mathematics and science tests from the 1990 assessment using confirmatory factor analysis. His conclusion was that there was little evidence for discriminant validity except for the geometry scale at the eighth-grade level, and that \"we are doing little damage in using a composite score in mathematics and science (p. 2).\"\n\n215\n\n191\n\n\fA second-order factor model was used by Muth\u00e9n (1991) in a further analysis of Rock's mathematics data, to examine subgroup differences in dimensionality. Evidence of content-specific variation within subgroups was found, but the average (across seven booklets) percentages of such variation was very small, ranging from essentially 0 to 22, and two-thirds of these percentages were smaller than 10.\nCarlson and Jirele (1992) examined 1990 NAEP mathematics data. Analyses of simulated onedimensional data were also conducted, and the fit to these data was slightly better than that to the real NAEP data. Although there was some evidence suggesting more than one dimension in the NAEP data, the strength of the first dimension led the authors to conclude that the data \"are sufficiently unidimensional to support the use of a composite scale for describing the NAEP mathematics data, but that there is evidence that two dimensions would better fit the data than one (p. 31).\"\nCarlson (1993) studied the dimensionality of the 1992 mathematics and reading assessments. The relative sizes of fit statistics for simulated as compared to actual data suggested that lack of fit may be more due to the BIB spiraling design of NAEP than the number of dimensions fitted. Kaplan (1995) similarly found that the chi-squared goodness of fit statistic in the maximum likelihood factor analysis model was inflated when data were generated using a BIB design. The sizes of the fit statistics for incomplete simulation conditions (a BIB design as in the actual NAEP assessment) were more like those of the real data than were those of the case of simulation of a complete data matrix. Consistent with findings of Zwick (1986, 1987), however, the incomplete design for data collection used in NAEP does not appear to be artificially inflating the number of dimensions identified using these procedures.\n9.3.7 Drawing Inferences from the Results\nDrawing correct inferences from the results of the assessments depends on several components. First, the hypothesis of no difference between groups must be tested statistically. For the 1996 assessment, the use of t-tests was introduced for most comparisons. These tests are more appropriate than z-tests based on normal distribution approximations when the statistics that are being compared are from distributions with thicker tails than those from the normal distribution. The statistical significance tests used in NAEP are described in detail in Chapter 18.\nA second component contributing to drawing correct inferences is the way in which error rates are controlled when multiple comparisons are made. If we wish to make a number of comparisons in the same analysis, say White students versus Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Island, and American Indian students, the probability of finding \"significance\" by chance for at least one comparison increases with the family size or number of comparisons. By the Bonferroni inequality, for a family size of 4, for example, the probability of a false positive (Type I error) using a = .05 is less than or equal to 4 x .05 =.20, larger than most decision-makers would accept.\nOne general method for controlling error rates in multiple comparisons is based on the Bonferroni inequality. In this method, the Bonferroni inequality is applied and a is divided by the family size, n. Now a = .05/4 = .0125, and using a, the combined probability of one or more errors in the four comparisons remains controlled at less than or equal to .05. Note that dividing the probability by n is not the same as multiplying the critical value or the confidence band by n. Indeed, in moving from a family size of 1 to 4, we increase the critical value only from 1.960 to 2.498, a 27.4 percent increase. Doubling the family size again, to 8, increases the critical value to 2.735, an additional 9.5 percent increase. To double the initial critical value to 3.92, the family size would have to be increased to 564.\n192\n216\n\n\fThe power of the tests thus depends on the number of comparisons planned. There may be cases for which, before the data are seen, it is determined that only certain comparisons will be conducted. As an example, with the five groups above, interest might lie only in comparing the first group with each of the others (family size 4), rather than comparing all possible pairs of groups (family size 10). This means that some possibly significant differences will not be found or discussed, but the planned comparisons will have greater power to identify real differences when they occur.\nIn 1996, several other methods were used to increase the power of statistical tests. For cases where comparisons of statistics in 2 x 2 tables were made, an adapted Bonferroni procedure varying the family size for each consecutive test was used (Hochberg, 1988). For a very large number of comparisons, as when comparing results for every state to the nation, a different criterion was used to control the error rates due to the large number of comparisons. This criterion, the False Discovery Rate (FDR), as described by Benjamini and Hochberg (1994), contrasts with the Familywise Error Rate (FWE) criterion used in the Bonferroni method. For trends extending over several administrations, power is gained by testing least-squares fitted linear and quadratic trends, rather than individual pairs of data points. For example, if the linear regression coefficient is significantly greater than 0, and the quadratic coefficient is not different from 0, the trend over time is positive, even though the Bonferroni test might declare no individual pair of points significantly different. These ways to control error rates in multiple comparisons are described in Chapter 18.\nA third component contributing to drawing correct inferences is the limitation of comparisons to those for which there are adequate data. In NAEP reports and data summaries, estimates of quantities such as composite and content area proficiency means, percentages of students at or above the achievement levels, and percentages of students indicating particular levels of background variables (as measured in the student, teacher, and school questionnaires) are reported for the total population as well as for key subgroups determined by the background variables. In some cases, sample sizes were not large enough to permit accurate estimation of proficiency and/or background variable results for one or more of the categories of these variables.\nFor results to be reported for any subgroup, a minimum sample size of 62 was required. This number was arrived at by determining the sample size required to detect an effect size of 0.5 with a probability of .8 or greater.2 The effect size of 0.5 pertains to the \"true\" difference in mean proficiency between the subgroup in question and the total population, divided by the standard deviation of proficiency in the total population. In addition, subgroup members must represent at least five primary sampling units (PSUs).\nA fourth component contributing to drawing correct inferences is the limitation of comparisons to those comparing statistics with standard errors that are estimated well. Standard errors of mean proficiencies, proportions, and percentiles play an important role in interpreting subgroup results and comparing the performances of two or more subgroups. The jackknife standard errors reported by NAEP are statistics whose quality depends on certain features of the sample from which the estimate is obtained. In certain cases, typically when the number of students upon which the standard error is based is small or when this group of students all come from a small number of participating schools, the mean squared error associated with the estimated standard errors may be quite large. In the summary reports, estimated standard errors subject to large mean squared errors are followed by the symbol \"!\".\n2 A design effect of 2 was assumed for this purpose, implying a sample design-based variance twice that of simple random sampling. This is consistent with previous NAEP experience (Johnson & Rust, 1992).\n217 193\n\n\fThe magnitude of the mean squared error associated with an estimated standard error for the mean or proportion of a group depends on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated size of the population group, denoted as N. This coefficient of variation is estimated by:\nA cv(X) = SE\nwhere AI is a point estimate of N and SE(11) is the jackknife standard error of N.\nExperience with previous NAEP assessments suggests that when this coefficient exceeds 0.2, the mean squared error of the estimated standard errors of means and proportions based on samples for this group may be quite large. Therefore, the standard errors of means and proportions for all subgroups for which the coefficient of variation of the population size exceeds 0.2 are followed by \"!\" in the tables of all summary reports. These standard errors, and any confidence intervals or significance tests involving these standard errors, should be interpreted with caution. (Further discussion of this issue can be found in Johnson & Rust, 1992.)\nA final component contributing to drawing correct inferences pertains to comparisons involving extreme proportions. When proportions are close to zero or one, their distributions differ greatly from t- or z-distributions. For this reason, hypothesis tests of the sort used by NAEP are not appropriate in these cases. Under these conditions, no test is made. Chapter 18 includes the specific definition of extreme proportion used in the analysis of 1996 data.\n\n9.4 OVERVIEW OF CHAPTERS 10 THROUGH 19\nThe remaining chapters in Part II of this report are as follows:\nChapter 10: The 1996 National Assessment used a stratified multistage probability sampling design that provided for sampling certain subpopulations at higher rates (see Chapter 3). Because probabilities of selection are not the same for all assessed students, sampling weights must be used in the analysis of NAEP data. Also, in NAEP's complex sample, observations are not independent. As a result, conventional formulas for estimating the sampling variance of statistics are inappropriate. Chapter 10 describes the weighting procedures and methods for estimating sampling variance that are necessitated by NAEP's sample design. Further detail on sampling and weighting procedures is provided in The 1996 NAEP Sampling and Weighting Report, published in 1999 by Westat, Inc., the NAEP contractor in charge of sampling.\nChapter 11: A Major NAEP innovation introduced by ETS is the reporting of subject-area results in terms of IRT-based scales. Scaling methods can be used to summarize results even when students answer different subsets of items. For purposes of summarizing item responses, NAEP developed a scaling technique that has its roots in IRT and in the theories of imputation of missing data. Chapter 11 describes this scaling technique, the underlying theory, and the application of these methods to 1996 NAEP data. The final section of Chapter 11 gives an overview of the NAEP scales that were developed for the 1996 assessment.\nChapter 12: The main short-term trend component of the 1996 mathematics analysis is described in this chapter. A detailed analysis of the main assessment of mathematics was conducted for grades 4, 8, and 12, including a study of the association between mathematics proficiency and student background\n\n194\n\n21.8\n\n\fvariables. The results from this component of the analysis can be compared with results from the 1992 mathematics analysis to examine short-term trends. At grades 8 and 12, background information and data on instructional methods were collected from teachers and the relation of these variables to mathematics proficiency was examined. The main assessment analyses are reported in NAEP 1996.Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States (Reese, Miller, Mazzeo, & Dossey, 1997). A special study of advanced eighth- and twelfth-grade mathematics students was conducted, and cognitive item responses associated with specific mathematics themes for the main mathematics samples was studied.\nChapter 13: The main assessment analysis of the science data is detailed in Chapter 13. This analysis included a study of the association of science knowledge with instructional techniques and student background variables. At grade 8, background information and data on instructional methods were collected from teachers and the relation of these variables to science proficiency was examined. The science results appear in NAEP 1996 Science Report Card for the Nation and the States (O'Sullivan, Reese, & Mazzeo, 1997). A special study of advanced twelfth-grade science students was also conducted.\nChapter 14: The reading trend results for the years 1971 through 1994 were extended to include 1996 at ages 9, 13, and 17. The results of the reading trend analysis, which include the percentages of students at or above the reading scale anchor points established in 1984, are reported in NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997).\nChapter 15: The long-term trend assessment analysis of the mathematics data is detailed in Chapter 15. The results of the trend analysis, which provided links from 1973 through 1996 for ages 9, 13, and 17, are reported in NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997).\nChapter 16: The long-term trend assessment analysis of the science data is described in Chapter 16. The science trend results, which provide a link to 1970, 1973, 1977, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994 are reported in NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997).\nChapter 17: Like the 1996 reading assessment, the writing assessment in 1996 consisted of only one component, a long-term trend. The writing trend results, which provide a link to 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 for grades 4, 8, and 12, are reported in NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997).\nChapter 18: The 1996 assessment analyses included changes in the methods, procedures, and conventions used in making group comparisons. Chapter 18 highlights these changes and provides details about which results were reported.\nChapter 19: This chapter presents basic data from the 1996 assessment, including the properties of the measuring instruments and characteristics of the sample.\n219\n195\n\n\fChapter 10\nWEIGHTING PROCEDURES AND ESTIMATION OF SAMPLING VARIANCE1\nEugene G. Johnson and Jiahe Qian Educational Testing Service\nLeslie Wallace and Keith F. Rust Westat, Inc.\n10.1 INTRODUCTION\nAs was the case in previous assessments, the 1996 national assessment used a complex sample design with the goal of securing a sample from which estimates of population and subpopulation characteristics could be obtained with reasonably high precision (as measured by low sampling variability). At the same time, it was necessary that the sample be economically and operationally feasible to obtain. The resulting sample had certain properties that had to be taken into account to ensure valid analyses of the data from the assessment.\nThe 1996 NAEP sample was obtained through a stratified multistage probability sampling design that included provisions for sampling certain subpopulations at higher rates (see Chapter 3). To account for the differential probabilities of selection, and to allow for adjustments for nonresponse, each student was assigned a sampling weight. Section 10.2 discusses the procedures used to derive these sampling weights.\nAnother consequence of the NAEP sample design is its effect on the estimation of sampling variability. Because of the effects of cluster selection (students within schools, schools within primary sampling units) and because of the effects of certain adjustments to the sampling weights (nonresponse adjustment and poststratification), observations made on different students cannot be assumed to be independent of one another. In particular, as a result of clustering, ordinary formulas for the estimation of the variance of sample statistics, based on assumptions of independence, will tend to underestimate the true sampling variability. Section 10.3 discusses the jackknife technique used by NAEP to estimate sampling variability. (The estimation of variability due to imperfect measurement of individual proficiency is discussed in Chapter 11.)\nThe jackknife technique provides good quality estimates of sampling variability but requires considerable computations. Section 10.4 suggests the use of design effects, combined with conventional variance estimation formulas, as a simple approximation to sampling variability estimation.\nSince the sample design determines the derivation of the sampling weights and the estimation of sampling variability, it will be helpful to note the key features of the 1996 NAEP sample design. A description of the design appears in Chapter 3, and the various assessment instruments are detailed in Chapter 4.\nI Keith F. Rust, and Leslie Wallace were responsible for the design and implementation of the weighting process for the 1996 NAEP assessments. Previous versions of this chapter were created with the significant contributions of Eugene Johnson, Educational Testing Service. Jiahe Qian of Educational Testing Service made significant contributions to the sampling variability sections of this chapter. The statistical programming for this chapter was overseen by Bruce Kaplan and provided by Phillip Leung.\n197\n2 2\n\n\fThe 1996 sample was a multistage probability sample consisting of four stages of selection for the long-term trend samples and five stages of selection for the main samples. The first stage of selection, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisted of counties or groups of counties. The second stage of selection consisted of elementary and secondary schools. For the long-term trend assessment, the assignment of sessions to sampled schools comprised the third stage of sampling, and the fourth stage involved the selection of students within schools and their assignment to sessions. For the main assessment, the assignment of schools to sample type (see Chapter 3) comprised the third stage of sampling, the assignment of sessions to sampled schools comprised the fourth stage of sampling, and the fifth stage involved the selection of students within schools and their assignment to sessions.\nThe probabilities of selection of the first-stage sampling units were proportional to measures of their size, While the probabilities for subsequent stages of selection were such that the overall probabilities of selection of students were approximately uniform, with exceptions for certain subpopulations that were oversampled by design. For the main assessment, schools with relatively high concentrations of Black students and/or Hispanic students were deliberately sampled at twice the normal rate to obtain larger samples of respondents from those subpopulations, in order to increase the precision in the estimation of the characteristics of these subpopulations. Also for the main assessment, nonpublic school students were sampled at three times the normal rate, again to increase the precision of estimates for this population subgroup. For all assessment components, students from schools with smaller numbers of eligibles received lower probabilities of selection, as a means of enhancing the cost efficiency of the sample.\nThe 1996 main assessment includes three student cohorts: students in grades 4, 8, and 12. The main assessment of all grades was conducted in the spring of 1996 to provide a cross-sectional view of students' abilities in mathematics and science.\nThe 1996 assessment also included a number of additional samples that used the age definitions, times of testing, and modes of administration used in previous assessments. These are referred to as longterm trend samples. The purpose of these samples was to provide the statistical linkage between the 1996 data and data from previous assessments. The long-term trend assessment represents two overlapping samples of students, the first of specified grades (of any age) and the second of specified ages (in any grade). Students were age-eligible if they were born in the appropriate year (1986, 1982, or October 1978 to September 1979). The corresponding grades for the long-term trend assessment were 4, 8, and 11. Each student cohort is called an \"age class.\"\nThe full 1996 NAEP assessment thus includes a number of different samples from several populations. Each of these samples has its own set of weights that are to be used to produce estimates of the characteristics of the population addressed by the sample (the target population). Each main sample has an additional set of weights to accommodate the reporting requirements. The various samples and their target populations are as follows:\nThe Main Samples of Students. The target population for each of these samples (one for each grade) consisted of all students who were in the specified grade and were deemed assessable by their school. There were four distinct session types at grade 4 (mathematics, science, mathematics estimation, and mathematics theme), five at grade 8 (mathematics, science, mathematics estimation, mathematics theme, advanced mathematics), and six at grade 12 (mathematics, science, mathematics estimation, mathematics theme, advanced mathematics, and advanced science). Each session type was conducted as one or more distinct sessions within a school. Administration of each session type was always conducted separately from other session types.\nTo facilitate analyses, two kinds of weights were produced. \"Reporting weights\" were produced separately by grade and assessment type for analyses of the reporting samples that were defined for each\n198\n1\n\n\fassessment. Several of the reporting samples included students from multiple sample types. \"Modular weights\" were produced separately by grade, assessment type, and sample type, for analyses involving any one sample type, or for comparing one sample type with another. Thus in total, across grades, session types, and sample types, there were 15 sets of reporting weights and 32 sets of modular weights for students in the main assessment.\nLong-Term Trend Samples for Reading and Writing. These consist of samples comparable to the 1984 main assessment and address the subject areas of reading and writing. The samples were collected by grade and age for age 9/grade 4, age 13/grade 8, and age 17/grade 11, using the age definitions and time of testing from 1984. As in that assessment, print administration was used. Six assessment booklets were administered at each age class. The respondents to the combined set of assigned booklets at a given age class constitute a representative sample of the population of students who were in the specified grade or of the specified age. The respondents to any one of the booklets also constitute a representative sample.\nLong-Term Trend Samples for Mathematics and Science. These consist of samples comparable to those used for the measurement of trends in 1986. The samples were collected by age only and using the same age definitions and time of testing as in the long-term trend assessment in 1986. As in that assessment, the administration of mathematics and science questions was paced with an audiotape. For ages 9 and 13, three assessment booklets were administered to each age group while two booklets were administered at age 17. The respondents to any one of the booklets assigned to a given age constitute a representative sample of the population of all students of that age. Each booklet was administered in a separate assessment session, but the booklets were combined for weighting and reporting.\nFor purposes of sampling and weighting, the assessment samples are categorized as \"tapeadministered\" or \"print-administered\" according to if paced audiotapes were used in the administration:\n1. Tape-administered samples are samples that required audiotape pacing in the assessment (the long-term trend assessments in mathematics and science). For these\nsamples, all students within a particular assessment session received the same booklet and were paced through at least part of the booklet with an audiotape.\n2. Print-administered samples are all main assessment samples and the long-term trend assessments of reading and writing. For these samples, no audiotape pacing was employed and the assessment booklets were spiraled through each assessment session\n(that is, the different booklets that were part of a given session type were\nsystematically interspersed and assigned for testing in that order).\n\n10.2 DERIVATION OF THE SAMPLE WEIGHTS\nAs indicated previously, NAEP uses differential sampling rates, deliberately oversampling certain subpopulations to obtain larger samples of respondents from those subgroups, thereby enhancing the precision of estimates of characteristics of these oversampled subgroups. As a result of the oversampling, these subpopulations, corresponding to students from schools with high concentrations of Black and/or Hispanic students, and from nonpublic schools, are overrepresented in the sample. Lower sampling rates were introduced also for very small schools (those schools with only 1 to 19 eligible students). This reduced level of sampling from small schools was undertaken in an approximately optimum manner as a means of reducing variances per unit of cost (since it is relatively costly to administer assessments in these small schools). Appropriate estimation of population characteristics must take disproportionate representation into account. This is accomplished by assigning a weight to each respondent, where the\n\n222\n\n199\n\n\fweights approximately account for the sample design and reflect the appropriate proportional representation of the various types of individuals in the population.\n\nTwo sets of weights were computed for the 1996 main samples for each session type. \"Modular weights\" were computed for analyses involving students in one sample type, or for comparing results between sample types. Each assessment type by grade and sample type weights up separately to the target population. \"Reporting weights\" were computed for analyses of the reporting samples defined in Table 101. Many of the reporting samples include students from more than one sample type. For reporting samples that include only one sample type (i.e., science), the reporting weights are identical to the modular weights. The steps for computing these two sets of weights are identical, up to and including the step of \"trimming\" the weights. The trimmed weights were poststratified separately by sample type to create the modular weights. In a parallel procedure, the trimmed weights were scaled back using a \"reporting factor\" so that the sample types included in each reporting sample, when combined, would weight up to the target population. The resulting weights were poststratified (but not separately by sample type) to create the reporting weights.\n\nTable 10-1 Reporting Samples for the 1996 Main NAEP Samples\n\nAssessment Type\n\nGrade\n\nReporting Sample`\n\nMathematics\n\nAll\n\nAl + A2 + B1\n\nScience Mathematics Estimation Mathematics Theme Advanced Mathematics Advanced Science\n\nAll 4 or 8\n12\nAll\n8 12 12\n\nA2 + B2\nA1 + B12 Al + A2 + B12\nA2 + B23\nA2 +A3 +B2 A3 +B3\nA2 + B2\n\nA indicates assessed non SD/LEP students, B indicates assessed SD/LEP students; and I, 2, or 3 indicates the sample type (see Chapter 3). 2 In the actual data analysis, the 1996 Mathematics Estimation used the reporting samples of Al + A3 + B1 for 4th and 8th grades, and the reporting samples of Al + A2 + A3 + B1 + B2 for 12th grade. The weights used in the data analysis were adjusted based on the information of the target population of the non-SD/LEP and SD/LEP students separately. 3 In the actual data analysis, the 1996 Mathematics Theme used reporting samples of A2 + A3 + B2. The weights used in the data analysis were adjusted based on the information of the target population of the non-SD/LEP and SD/LEP students separately.\n\nThe weighting procedures for 1996 included computing the student's base weight, the reciprocal of the probability that the student was selected for a particular session type. Such weights are those appropriate for deriving estimates from probability samples via the standard Horvitz-Thompson estimator (see Cochran, 1977). These base weights were adjusted for nonresponse and then subjected to a trimming algorithm to reduce a few excessively large weights. The weights were further adjusted by a student-level poststratification procedure to reduce the sampling error. This poststratification was performed by adjusting the weights of the sampled students so that the resulting estimates of the total number of students in a set of specified subgroups of the population corresponded to population totals based on information from the Current Population Survey and U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the population. The subpopulations were defined in terms of race, ethnicity, geographic region, grade, and age relative to grade.\n\n200\n- 223\n\n\fIn addition, the weights at grade 8 were poststratified at the school level in an effort to correct an imbalance in the school sample that was observed after the assessments were complete. This procedure has not been used in prior NAEP assessments, and was introduced because at grade 8, the three sample types contained relatively different proportions of schools with large numbers of Black and Hispanic students (termed \"high minority\" schools). The different school distributions became apparent by reviewing student distributions by sample type and race/ethnicity for the mathematics assessment. In mathematics at grade 8, sample type 2 contained a larger proportion of Black students than sample type 1. Investigation revealed that the differences in student distributions were due to different school distributions by percent minority enrollment. Although the different proportions were within sampling error, a decision was made to adjust the weights at grade 8 for each of the sample types separately so that in each case the resulting estimates of number of schools by percent minority enrollment corresponded to totals based on information from the sampling frame of schools.\nThe following sections provide an overview of the procedures used to derive the sampling weights. Further details in the derivation of these weights can be found in The 1996 NAEP Sampling and Weighting Report (Wallace & Rust, 1999).\n10.2.1 Derivation of Reporting Weights for the Main Samples\nSeparate weights were computed for each assessment in the main samples (mathematics, science, mathematics theme, mathematics estimation, advanced mathematics, and advanced science). In earlier NAEP assessments, excluded students from all subjects were weighted together, separately from assessed students. In 1996, excluded students were weighted with assessed students for each assessment. This change in procedures was adopted because evidence indicated that exclusion rates may not be independent of session type, and because this change simplified the weighting procedures, when accounting for sample type. Reporting weights for the main samples were derived according to the steps outlined below.\n10.2.1.1 Student Base Weight\nThe base weight assigned to a student is the reciprocal of the probability that the student was selected for a particular assessment. That probability is the product of five factors:\n1. the probability that the PSU was selected;\n2. the conditional probability, given the PSU, that the school was selected;\n3. the conditional probability, given the sample of schools in a PSU, that the school was assigned the specified sample type;\n4. the conditional probability, given the sample of schools in a PSU, that the school was allocated the specified session type; and\n5. the conditional probability, given the school, that the student was selected for the specified session type.\n\n224\n\n201\n\n\fThus, the base weight for a student may be expressed as the product\nWB = PSUWT SCHWT SMPTYPWT SESSWT STUSCHW\nwhere PSUWT, SCHWT, SMPTYPWT, SESSWT, and STUSCHW are, respectively, the reciprocals of the preceding probabilities.\nVariations across the various 1996 assessments in probabilities of selection, and consequently of weights, were introduced by design, either to increase the effectiveness of the sample in achieving its goals of reporting for various subpopulations, or to achieve increased efficiency per unit of cost.\n\n10.2.1.2 Session Nonresponse Adjustment (SESNRF)\nSessions were assigned to schools before cooperation status was final. The session nonresponse adjustment was intended to compensate for session type nonresponse due to refusing schools or individual session types not conducted. The first three digits of PSU stratum, called subuniverse (formed by crossing the PSU major stratum and the first socioeconomic characteristic used to define the final PSU stratum; see Section 3.2 for more detail) were used in calculating nonresponse adjustments. The adjustment factors were computed separately within classes formed by subuniverse within sample type for mathematics and science, and by subuniverse for the other assessment types. Occasionally, additional collapsing of classes was necessary to improve the stability of the adjustment factors, especially for the smaller assessment components. Most classes needing collapsing contained small numbers of cooperating schools. Occasionally, classes with low response rates were collapsed.\nIn subuniverse s in session type h, the session nonresponse adjustment factor SESNRFI was given by\n\nwhere\n\nPSUWTI SCHWTi SMPTYPWTi SESSWThi Gi\nL SESNRF,,,, = iEBl PSUIVZ SCHWTi SMPTYPWTi SESSWThi G. iECh,\n\nPSUWTi\n\n=\n\nthe PSU weight for the PSU containing school i;\n\nSCHWT,\n\n=\n\nSMPTYPWT; =\n\nthe school weight for school i; the sample type weight for school i;\n\nSESSWTh\n\n=\n\nthe session allocation weight for session type h in school i;\n\nG,\n\n=\n\nthe estimated number of grade-eligible students in school i (the values of\n\nG, were based on QED data);\n\nset Bk, set Chs\n\nconsists of all in-scope originally sampled schools allocated to session type h in subuniverse s (excluding substitutes); and\n\n=\n\nconsists of all schools allocated to session type h in subuniverse s that\n\nultimately participated (including substitutes).\n\n202\n4() a\n\n\fIt should be noted that the nonresponse adjustments assume that nonresponse occurs at random within the categories within which adjustments are made (see Little & Rubin, 1987). Some degree of bias could result to the extent that this assumption is false.\n\n10.2.1.3 School-Level Poststratification Adjustment at Grade 8 (SCHPSF)\n\nAs discussed earlier, the weights at grade 8 were poststratified so that the resulting estimates of number of public schools by percent minority enrollment corresponded to totals based on information from the sampling frame of schools.\nPoststratification adjustments were calculated separately by sample type within assessment type. For the descriptions of the information for stratification, see Section 3.3. Control totals were calculated as the total estimated number of grade-eligible students (based on QED data) in public schools, by percent minority enrollment category. The percent minority enrollment categories used to form adjustment cells were 0-4, 5-14, 15-29, 30-36, 37-44, 45-54, 55-79, 80-94, and 95-100 for mathematics and science sample type 2, and 0-4, 5-14, 15-29, 30-44, 45-79, and 80-100 for all other assessment type/sample type combinations. The smaller sample sizes in the latter group did not support using more categories. The poststratification factor for each class c and session type h is computed by\n\nTOTALC\nSCHPSFhc =\nP SUWTi SCHWTi SMPTYPWTi SESSWThi SESNRFk, Gi\nieph,\n\nwhere\nTOTALC\nPSUWT, SCHWT,\n\n=\n\nthe total number of grade-eligible students in class c, from the sampling\n\nframe;\n\n=\n\nthe PSU weight for the PSU containing school i;\n\n=\n\nthe school weight for school i;\n\nSMPTYPWT, =\n\nSESSWTh,\n\n=\n\nSESNRFh.,\n\n=\n\nG,\n\n=\n\nthe sample type weight for school i;\nthe session allocation weight for session type h in school i;\nthe session nonresponse adjustment factor for subuniverse s in session type h;\nthe estimated number of grade-eligible students in school i (the values of Gi were based on QED data); and\n\nSet Dhc\n\n=\n\nconsists of the public schools in class c that participated in session type h.\n\nFor some sample types in advanced mathematics and mathematics estimation, two or more poststratification classes were collapsed into one to improve the stability of the adjustment factors. Private schools and new schools (those schools added to the sample through the new school sampling procedure, and so not included on the sampling frame) received school-level poststratification factors of 1.0.\n\n203\n\n\f10.2.1.4 Student Nonresponse Adjustment (STUNRF)\n\nStudent nonresponse adjustment factors were computed separately for each session type. For\n\nstudents in the main samples, the adjustment classes were based on sample type (for mathematics and\n\nscience), subuniverse, modal age status, and race class (White or Asian/Pacific Islander, other). In some\n\ncases, two or more nonresponse classes were collapsed into one to improve the stability of the adjustment\n\nfactors. For each class c in session type h, the student nonresponse adjustment factor\n\nSTUNRFI,C is\n\ncomputed by\n\nEPSUWTJ SCHWT, SCHPSFj SMPTYPWTJ SESSWThj SESNRFhj STUSCHWhj\nSTUNRFhc =\nLPSUWTJ SCHWTi SCHPSFj SMPTYPWT SESSWThj SESNRFhj STUSCHWhj\njE\nwhere\n\nPSUWTi\n\nthe PSU weight for the PSU containing student j;\n\nSCHWT;\n\n=\n\nthe school weight for the school containing student j;\n\n= SMPTYPWT =\n\nfor grade 8, the school poststratification factor for the school containing student j (set to 1.0 for grades 4 and 12);\nthe sample type weight for the school containing student j;\n\nSESSWThj\n\nSESNkFhi\n\n=\n\nSTUSCHWhj =\n\nthe session allocation weight for the school containing student j in session type h;\nthe session nonresponse adjustment factor for the school containing student j in session type h;\nthe within-school student weight for student j in session type h;\n\nSet Ahc Set Bhc\n\nconsists of the students in class c who were sampled for session type h and not excluded; and\n\n=\n\nconsists of the students in class c who were assessed in session type h.\n\nExcluded students received nonresponse adjustments of 1.0.\n\n10.2.1.5 Trimming of Weights\nIn a number of cases, students were assigned relatively large weights. One cause of large weights was underestimation of the number of eligible students in some schools leading to inappropriately low probabilities of selection for those schools. A second major cause is the presence of large schools (high schools in particular) in PSUs with small selection probabilities. In such cases, the maximum permissible\nwithin-school sampling rate (determined by the maximum sample size allowed per schoolsee\nChapter 3) could well be smaller than the desired overall within-PSU sampling rate for students. Large\n\n204\n\n\fweights arose also because very small schools were, by design, sampled with low probabilities. Other large weights arose as the result of high levels of nonresponse coupled with low to moderateprobabilities of selection, and the compounding of nonresponse adjustments at various levels.\nStudents with notably large weights have an unusually large impact on estimates such as weighted means. Since, under some simplifying assumptions, the variability in weights contributes.to the variance of an overall estimate by an approximate factor. 1 + V2, where V2 is the relative variance of the weights, an occasional unusually large weight is likely to produce large sampling variances of the statistics of interest, especially when the large weights are associated with students with atypical performance characteristics.\nTo reduce this problem, a procedure of trimming a few of the more extreme weights to values somewhat closer to the mean weight was applied. This trimming can increase the accuracy of the resulting survey estimates, substantially reducing V2 and hence the sampling variance, while introducing a small bias. The trimming algorithm was identical to that used since 1984, and had the effect of trimming the weights of students from any school that contributed more than' a specified proportion, to the estimated variance of the estimated number of students eligible for assessment. The trimming was done separately within sample type for mathematics and science, and overall for mathematics estimation and mathematics theme. Trimming was not done for the advanced mathematics or advanced science assessments because advanced students were expected to be concentrated in certain schools, so that the trimming algorithm was not appropriate in these cases. In each case, the value of the proportion was chosen to be 10/K, where K was the number of schools in which a specified assessment was conducted. The number of schools where weights were trimmed was no more than seven in any one assessment. The most extreme trimming factors applied were of the order of 0.65; trimming affects the weights of only a very small proportionof the assessed and excluded students.\nTable 10-2 shows the distributions of eligible students based on the trimmed weights of assessed students for the science samples in sample type 2 (the reporting population) for each grade. The distributions are similar to those before trimming shown in Tables 10-6, 10-7, and 10-8. To the extent that the characteristics in the table are related to student performance on the science assessment, there is a small bias introduced in the assessment by trimming.\n2 2 8\n205\n\n\fTable 10-2 Distribution of Populations of Eligible Students Based on Trimmed Weights of Assessed Students\nin Participating Schools, 1996 Main NAEP Science Sample, Sample Type 2\n\nPopulation Total population\n\nGrade 4 3,389,669\n\nGrade 8 3,365,499\n\nAge category At modal age or younger Older than modal age\nRace/ethnicity category White Black Hispanic Other\nGender' Male Female\nSD Yes No\nLEP Yes No\nSD, LEP SD yes, LEP yes SD yes, LEP no SD no, LEP yes SD no, LEP no\n\n64.6% 35.4%\n61.0% 14.3% 16.9% 7.8%\n49.6% 50.2%\n5.2% 94.8%\n3.0% 97.0%\n0.1% 5.1% 3.0% 91.8%\n\n57.9% 42.1%\n64.2% 15.7% 13.6% 6.6%\n50.2% 49.6%\n5.7% 94.3%\n1.9% 98.1%\n0.1% 5.6% 1.8% 92.5%\n\nI For a very small percentage of students at grades 4 and 8, gender is unknown.\n\nGrade 12 2,491,555\n64.5% 35.5%\n69.1% 12.3% 11.1% 7.5%\n48.3% 51.7%\n3.1% 96.9%\n2.2% 97.8%\n0.0% 3.0% 2.1% 94.8%\n\n10.2.1.6 Reporting Factor\nEach set of trimmed weights for a given sample type sums to the target population. Reporting factors were assigned to students in order to scale back the trimmed weights so that final student (reporting) weights within each reporting population (which may combine students from different sample types) sum to the target population. The reporting factors assigned to students are specific to the reporting populations defined in Table 10-1. Each assessed and excluded student in the reporting population received a reporting factor as shown in Table 10-3 on the following page.\n\n206\n\n2 2 9\n\n\fTable 10-3 Reporting Factors for Assessed and Excluded Students\n\nNon-SD/LEP Students\n\nSD/LEP Students\n\n---,Sample Type-- --Sample Type---\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nGrade 4 Mathematics Science Mathematics theme Mathematics estimation\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 1 1\n1\n\nGrade 8\n\nMathematics\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nScience\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMathematics theme\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMathematics estimation\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAdvanced mathematics (B)\n\n0.35 0.65\n\nGrade 12\n\nMathematics\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nScience\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMathematics theme\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMathematics estimation\n\n0.6667 0.3333\n\n1\n\nAdvanced mathematics (B)\n\n1\n\nAdvanced science (C)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10.2.1.7 Student-Level Poststratification\nAs in most sample surveys, the respondent weights are random variables that are subject to sampling variability. Even if there were no nonresponse, the respondent weights would at best provide unbiased estimates of the various subgroup proportions. However, since unbiasedness refers to average performance over a conceptually infinite number of replications of the sampling, it is unlikely that any given estimate, based on the achieved sample, will exactly equal the population value. Furthermore, the respondent weights have been adjusted for nonresponse and a few extreme weights have been reduced in\nsize.\nTo reduce the mean squared error of estimates using the sampling weights, these weights were further adjusted so that estimated population totals for a number of specified subgroups of the population, based on the sum of weights of students of the specified type, were the same as presumably better estimates based on composites of estimates from the 1993 and 1994 CurrentPopulation Survey and 1996 population projections made by the U.S. Census Bureau. This adjustment, called poststratification, is intended especially to reduce the mean squared error of estimates relating to student populations that span several subgroups of the population, and thus also to reduce the variance of measures of changes over time for such student populations.\nThe poststratification in 1996 was done for the mathematics, science, mathematics estimation, and mathematics theme assessments in each grade. The advanced mathematics and advanced science assessments were not poststratified. Within each grade and assessment type group, poststratification adjustment cells were defined in terms of race, ethnicity, and Census region as shown in Table 10-4. Note\n207\n\n\fthat NAEP region was used in previous years instead of Census region. This change was made because the data from the Current Population Survey and Census Projections are more reliable for Census regions than\nfor NAEP regions.\n\nTable 10-4 Major Subgroups for Poststratification in 1996\n\nSubgroup\n\nRace\n\nEthnicity\n\nCensus Region'\n\n1\n\nWhite\n\nNot Hispanic Northeast\n\n2\n\nWhite\n\nNot Hispanic Midwest\n\n3\n\nWhite\n\nNot Hispanic South\n\n4\n\nWhite\n\nNot Hispanic West\n\n5\n\nAny\n\nHispanic\n\nAny.\n\n6\n\nBlack\n\nNot Hispanic Any\n\n7\n\nOther\n\nNot Hispanic Any\n\nCensus region is the same as the NAEP region in Table 3-2 used for stratification and reporting, except that DE, DC, and MD moved from the Northeast to the South, OK and TX moved from the West to the South, Central is called Midwest, and Southeast is called South.\n\nThese subgroups were used as adjustment cells at grade 12. Each of these cells accounts for between 5 percent (Subgroup 7) and 21 percent (Subgroup 3) of the population. For grades 4 and 8, each of the seven subgroups was further divided into two eligibility classes: of modal age and not of modal age.\nThe procedure used at grade 12 was adopted because the independent estimates of the numbers of students in the population did not provide consistent data on the numbers of twelfth grade students by age. Specifically, the counts of twelfth grade students age 17 and older are not reliable because they include adult education students. This procedure has been used since 1988. (See Rust, Bethel, Burke, & Hansen, 1990, and Rust, Burke, & Fahimi, 1992, for further details.)\n\nThus, there were 7 or 14 cells for poststratification. The poststratified weight for each student\nwithin a particular cell was the student's base weight, with adjustments for nonresponse and trimming, and the reporting factor from Section 10.2.1.6, times a poststratification factor. The poststratification factor for student j in session type h and poststratification adjustment class c is given by\n\nPSFCTRk =\n\nTOTALC\n\n1W SESNRFJ SCHPSF; STUNRFJ TRIMFCTRJ RPTFCTRJ\n\nje C.\n\nwhere\n\nWB)\n\nthe base weight for student j (see Section 10.2.1.1);\n\nTOTAL,\n\n=\n\nthe total number of grade-eligible students in class c, from the October\n\n1993 and 1994 Current Population Surveys and 1996 population\n\nprojections;\n\nSESNRF;\n\n=\n\nthe session nonresponse adjustment factor for the school containing\n\nstudent j in session type h;\n\n208\n231\n\n\fSCHPSF;\n\n=\n\nfor grade 8, the school poststratification factor for the school containing\n\nstudent j (set to one for grades 4 and 12);\n\nSTUNRFJ\n\n=\n\nthe student nonresponse adjustment for student];\n\nTRIMFCTRi =\n\nthe trimming factor for student];\n\nRPTFCTRi =\n\nthe reporting factor for student j;\n\nSet Chc\n\n=\n\nconsists of the students in class c who were assessed in session type h,\n\nexcept those at grade 12 who were age 17 or older.\n\nNote that students at grade 12 who were age 17 or older received the poststratification factor according to their adjustment class and session type even though they were not used in calculating the factor. Details of the procedures used to obtain totals in the numerator of the adjustment factor are provided in Wallace and\nRust (1999).\n\n10.2.1.8 The Final Student Reporting Weights\nThe final weight assigned to a student is the student full-sample reporting weight. This weight is the student's base weight after the application of the various adjustments described above. The student full-sample reporting weight was used to derive all estimates of population and subpopulation characteristics that have been presented in the various NAEP reports, including simple estimates such as the proportion of students of a specified type who would respond in a certain way to an item and more complex estimates such as mean proficiency levels. The distributions of the final student reporting weights are given in Table 10-5.\nAs indicated earlier, under some simplifying assumptions the factor 1 + V2 indicates the approximate relative increase in variance of estimates resulting from the variability in the weights. The factor V2 for each sample is readily derivable from Table 10-5 by squaring the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean weight. These factors, resulting from the combined effect of the variations in weights introduced by design and from other causes, are discussed in Section 10.2.3.\n\n10.2.2 Evaluation of Potential for Bias Resulting from School and Student Nonparticipation\nAlthough school and student nonresponse adjustments are intended to reduce the potential for nonparticipation to bias the assessment results, they cannot completely eliminate this potential bias with certainty. The extent of bias remains unknown, of course, since there are no assessment data for the nonparticipating schools and students.\nSome insight can be gained about the potential for residual nonresponse bias, however, by examining the weighted school- and student-level distributions of characteristics known for both participants and nonparticipants, especially for those characteristics known or thought likely to be related to achievement on the assessment. If the distributions for the full sample of schools (or students) without the use of nonresponse adjustments are close to those for the participants with nonresponse adjustments applied, there is reason to be confident that the bias from nonparticipation is small.\n\n2 c 2\n\n209\n\n\fSample\nMathematics Science Mathematics Theme Mathematics Estimation\nMathematics Science Mathematics Theme Mathematics Estimation Advanced Mathematics\nMathematics Science Mathematics Theme Mathematics Estimation Advanced Mathematics Advanced Science\n\nTable 10-5 Distribution of Final Student Reporting Weights, 1996 Main Samples\n\nNumber of Cases\n\nMean\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nMinimum\n\n25th Percentile Median\n\n6831 8061 2072 1130\n\n577.41 489.35 1903.80 3409.86\n\nGrade 4\n380.69 324.35 1163.23 2052.49\n\n92.57 65.04 576.00 685.71\n\n315.28 275.04 1133.85 1935.01\n\n486.57 399.02 1587.94 3010.68\n\n7312 8200 2177 1255 2339\n\n510.55 455.26 1714.81 2974.61 346.90\n\nGrade 8 389.16 388.04\n1124.20 1906.19 246.57\n\n62.92 75.47 388.72 338.54 100.98\n\n247.63 219.81 921.25 1398.58 184.65\n\n389.41 313.58 1258.58 2574.86 234.99\n\n7020 7963 2097 1472 2972 2436\n\n415.75 380.19 1442.96 1949.24 235.55 241.49\n\nGrade 12 257.34\n222.13 862.82 1050.36 127.79 137.63\n\n64.39 64.80 313.34 488.10 77.16 58.23\n\n226.94 226.82 879.14 1170.72 142.67 134.85\n\n337.48 302.07 1117.08 1743.95 182.49 190.13\n\n75th Percentile\n729.48 598.53 2276.41 4316.83\n652.26 562.02 2321.66 3952.75 407.26\n539.29 500.33 1789.78 2523.71 324.65 323.81\n\nMaximum\n3887.53 4872.34 10676.50 12843.05\n5027.91 3605.79 8720.24 9812.97* 1545.58\n2313.01 1759.55 5171.06 8484.11 911.09 978.81\n\n4,233\n210\n\n\fThere are several school-level characteristics available for both participating and nonparticipating schools. The tables below show the combined impact of nonresponse and of the nonresponse adjustments on the distributions of schools (weighted by the estimated number of eligible students enrolled) and students, by the type of school (public, Catholic, other nonpublic) the size of the school as measured by the estimated number of eligible students enrolled, and the urban/rural nature of the place where the school is located. Three size classes have been defined for each grade. The data are for the science assessment, sample type 2 (the reporting population). Science from sample type 2 was chosen because it is the largest assessment at each grade. It is assumed that other large assessments would behave similarly.\nSeveral student-level characteristics are available for both absent and assessed students. The tables that follow show the impact of school nonresponse and nonresponse adjustments, and student nonresponse and nonresponse adjustments on the distributions of eligible students for each grade. This discussion also focuses on the science assessment for sample type 2, since it is the largest. The distributions are presented by age category (at or below modal age, and above modal age), race category (White, Black, Hispanic, and other), gender, SD, and LEP.\nTable 10-6 shows the weighted marginal distributions of students for each of the three classification variables for each grade, using weighted eligible schools. The distributions before school nonresponse adjustments are based on the full sample of in-scope schools for science--those participating, plus those refusals for which no substitute participated. The distributions after school nonresponse adjustments are based only on participating schools for science, with school nonresponse adjustments applied to them.\nIt can be seen from the tables that, even though the level of school nonparticipation is as high as 22.6 percent for grade 12 (see Table 3-11) and somewhat lower for the other grades, for the most part, the distributions for the three characteristics considered remain similar. Exceptions may be medium and large schools, and midsize cities and urban fringe of large cities at grade 12; and urban fringe of large cities and rural nonMSAs at grade 4.\n211\n2 5\n\n\fTable 10-6 Distribution of Populations of Eligible Students Based on Full Weighted Sample of Eligible Schools, Before and After School Nonresponse Adjustments, 1996 Main NAEP Science Samples, Sample Type 2\n\nPopulation Total population\n\nGrade 4\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nGrade 8\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\n3,777,554 3,777,554 3,198,390 3,198,390\n\nGrade 12 Before After\n2,762,448 2,762,448\n\nSchool type Catholic Other Nonpublic Public\nSchool size'\n\n5.7% 5.6% 88.7%\n\n7.2% 4.3% 88.5%\n\n6.0% 4.7% 89.3%\n\n6.8% 4.6% 88.7%\n\n5.5% 4.2% 90.3%\n\n5.9% 3.4% 90.7%\n\n1\n2 3 School location\n\n18.8% 46.4% 34.8%\n\n19.8% 47.2% 33.0%\n\n10.8% 55.7% 33.5%\n\n11.6% 55.8% 32.6%\n\n5.0% 70.5% 24.5%\n\n4.7% 67.0% 28.3%\n\nLarge city Midsize city Urban fringe/large city Urban fringe/midsize city Large town Small town Rural MSA Rural nonMSA\n\n18.3% 19.4% 23.9% 13.7% 0.3% 10.5% 2.3% 11.5%\n\n19.9% 19.7% 24.0% 11.9% 0.5% 8.8% 1.8% 13.5%\n\n17.7% 18.1% 23.1% 15.8% 0.7% 9.9% 5.1% 9.6%\n\n17.9% 18.1% 21.8% 16.7% 0.7% 8.8% 6.1% 9.9%\n\n15.4% 16.3% 23.3% 15.3% 1.5% 14.4% 3.7% 10.2%\n\n16.8% 18.3% 21.2% 14.4% 0.9% 15.5% 3.7% 9.5%\n\nDistributions by school size are not comparable to previous assessments, since students were eligible by grade only (instead of by grade or age) in 1996.

The table shows that with one exception at grade 12, for the distributions of type of school attended and place where the school is located, the combined effect of student nonparticipation and the subsequent nonresponse adjustments have resulted in very little change in distribution. The changes in the distribution of school type at grade 12 reflect the relatively high\n\n237\n\n213\n\n\fnonresponse rate of grade 12 public school students (22.7 percent versus 8.5 percent for nonpublic school students; see Table 3-9).\nTable 10-8 shows the weighted distributions of eligible students in participating schools, using the base weights of assessed and absent students unadjusted for school-level nonresponse. Tables 10-7 and 108 show that both school and student-level nonresponse and nonresponse adjustments have little effect on the distributions of eligible students by age, race/ethnicity, gender, SD and LEP. All of the distributions in the tables are similar.\n\nTable 10-8\nDistribution of Populations of Eligible Students Before School and Student Nonresponse Adjustments 1996 Main NAEP Science Samples, Sample Type 2\n\nPopulation Total population\n\nGrade 4 2,635,218\n\nGrade 8 2,743,713\n\nGrade 12\n1,935,174\n\nAge category At modal age or 'younger Older than modal age\nRace/ethnicity category White Black Hispanic Other\nGender' Male Female\nSD\nYes No LEP Yes No SD, LEP SD yes, LEP yes SD yes, LEP no SD no, LEP yes SD no, LEP no\n\n64.3% 35.7%\n60.8% 14.6% 16.9% 7.7%\n49.7% 50.1%\n5.3% 94.7%\n3.2% 96.8%\n0.1% 5.2% 3.1% 91.7%\n\nI Gender is unknown for a small percentage of students.\n\n56.3% 43.7%\n66.6% 14.0% 13.0% 6.5%\n50.3% 49.5%\n6.2% 93.8%\n2.0% 98.8%\n0.1% 6.1% 1.9% 91.9%\n\n63.9% 36.1%\n70.3% 12.4% 10.3% 6.9%\n48.8% 51.2%\n3.4% 96.6%\n2.0% 98.0%\n0.1% 3.3% 1.9% 94.7%\n\nWhen comparing the distributions in Table 10-7 before and after student nonresponse adjustments, we expect the distributions by age category and race/ethnicity to be similar because these variables were used to determine student nonresponse adjustment classes. However, the distributions by gender, SD, and LEP are also similar. To the extent that nonrespondents would perform like respondents with the same characteristics (defined by the classification variables in the tables), the bias in the assessment data is small.\nFurther information about potential nonresponse bias can be gained by studying the absent students. NAEP proficiency estimates are biased to the extent that assessed and absent students within the\n\n214\n238\n\n\fsame weighting class differ in their distribution of proficiency. It seems likely that the assumption that absent students are similar in proficiency to assessed students is reasonable for some absent students-namely, those whose absence can be characterized as random. Conversely, it seems likely that students with longer and more consistent patterns of absenteeism-such as truants, dropouts, near dropouts, and the chronically ill-are unlikely to be as proficient as their assessed counterparts.\nIn the 1996 assessments, schools were asked to classify each absent student into one of nine categories. The results of this classification for the science assessment are shown in Table 10-9. The discussion focuses on the science assessment because it is the largest. It is assumed that the other large\nassessments would behave similarly.\nTable 10-9 shows that, as anticipated, the majority of absence from the assessment was the result of an absence from school of a temporary and unscheduled nature. The table shows that absence among twelfth graders occurs at about four times the rate of absence among fourth or eighth graders. The proportion of absence classified as temporary differs somewhat by grade, but is of the same magnitude for grades 8 and 12. These two facts taken together suggest strongly that a substantial proportion of the temporary absences among twelfth grade students is not a result of illness, because such absences are occurring at almost three times the rate that they do among fourth or eighth grade students. Whereas it might be reasonable to regard temporary absence due to illness as independent of proficiency, for other temporary absences, this appears less tenable. The data in the table give support to the contention that, at grade 4, student absences are unlikely to introduce any significant bias into NAEP estimates. The absentee rate is low; most absences are temporary, and three quarters of the remaining absences are a result of\nparental refusal.\n\nTable 10-9 Weighted Distribution of Absent Students by Nature of Absenteeism for All Grades\n1996 Science Assessment, Sample Type 2\n\nNature of Absenteeism\n\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 8\n\nGrade 12\n\nTemporary absence' Long-term absence2 Chronic truant Suspended or expelled Parent refusal Student refusal In school, did not attend session In school, not invited3 Other Missing Total absentee sample Total sample size Overall absentee rate\n\n78.2% 1.6% 0.2% 0.7% 16.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.3% 2.6%\n384 7,689\n5.0%\n\n68.0% 1.4% 2.7% 6.4%\n13.1% 3.2% 3.0% 0.8% 0.9% 0.4% 569 8,343 6.8%\n\n63.6% 0.8% 1.4% 0.4% 9.2% 12.0% 7.0% 0.0% 3.9% 1.8%\n2,269 9,807\n23.1%\n\nI Absent less than two weeks due to illness, disability, or excused absence.\n2 Absent more than two weeks due to illness or disability. 3 In school, but not invited to assessment session due to disruptive behavior.\n\nAt grades 8 and 12, however, a significant component of absenteeism is not temporary or due to\nparental refusal. Chronic truants, those suspended, and those in school but not invited, constitute the obvious candidates for potential bias. These groups comprise 12.1 percent of absent students at grade 8 (or\n\n239\n\n215\n\n\f0.8 percent of the total sample) and 8.8 percent of absent students at grade 12 (or 2.0 percent of the total sample). Thus their potential for introducing significant bias under the current procedures is minor.\n10.2.3 Derivation of Modular Weights for the Main Samples\nAs discussed earlier, modular weights were computed to facilitate analyses involving students from a single sample type. The same procedures were used to derive modular and reporting weights up through the weight trimming step described in Section 10.2.1.5. After trimming, weighting continued in two parallel processes. Final student reporting weights were the result of one of these processes, and modular weights were the result of the other.\nModular weights differ from reporting weights in two ways. First, they do not contain the reporting factor described in Section 10.2.1.6. The second difference lies in the manner in which the weights were poststratified. The modular weights were poststratified as described in Section 10.2.1.7, except that each sample type within each grade and session was poststratified separately. The same initial adjustment cells were used: 7 cells based on race/region for each session/sample type combination at grade 12, and 14 cells based on race/region and eligibility class (of modal age, not of modal age) for each session/ sample type combination at grades 4 and 8. Some adjustment factors are quite variable for the same adjustment cell across different sample types for the same grade and session. This indicates that the individual samples by sample type may not be particularly stable, especially for the smaller sessions of 'mathematics theme and mathematics estimation.\nThe modular weight is the student's base weight after the application of the various adjustments described in Section 10.2.1, except for the reporting factor, and with the new poststratification factor described above. The distributions of the modular weights are given in Table 10-10. Note that modular weights are identical to reporting weights for a particular grade/session/sample type combination when that sample type is the only one included in the reporting population for that grade and session.\n10.2.4 Derivation of Student Weights for the Long-Term Trend Samples\nFinal student weights were derived for the long-term trend samples in a manner similar to that used in 1994. The procedure was identical to that used to derive reporting weights, described in Section 10.2.1, except as noted below.\nAs in 1994, excluded students for all subjects in the long-term trend samples were weighted together, separately from assessed students.\nBase weight. A student's base weight is the reciprocal of the product of four factorsall of the factors used for reporting weights except sample type weight (SMPTYPWT).\nSession nonresponse adjustments. Session nonresponse adjustments were calculated separately at each age class for the spiral assessment, the tape assessment, and excluded students, within classes formed by subuniverse.

Student nonresponse adjustments were calculated separately at each age class for the spiral assessment and the tape assessment within classes formed by subuniverse and modal grade status (at or above modal grade, below modal grade). For excluded students at each age class, the adjustments were calculated within classes formed by subuniverse. The formula for the adjustment does not contain sample type weight (SMPTYPWT) or the school-level poststratification factor (SCHPSF), and for excluded students, it does not contain session allocation weight (SESSWT). For excluded students, Set A consists of all excluded students in class C, and Set B consists of the excluded students in class C for whom an excluded student questionnaire was completed.\nTrimming. Trimming was done separately for the spiral assessment, the tape assessment, and excluded students at each age class.\nReporting factor: There was no reporting factor for the long-term trend assessments.\nStudent-level poststratification. Poststratification adjustments were calculated separately at each age class for the spiral assessment, the tape assessment, and excluded students. Adjustment cells were formed by race/region (as described in Section 10.2.1.7) and eligibility class (eligible by grade and of modal age, eligible by age only, and eligible by grade but not of modal age). Thus 21 cells were used for the spiral assessment and excluded students at each age class. Seven cells (by race/region only) were used for the tape assessment at each age class. For each cell the poststratification factor is a ratio whose denominator is the sum of weights (after adjustments for nonresponse and trimming) of assessed and excluded students, and whose numerator is an adjusted estimate of the total number of students in the population who are members of the cell.\nFinal student weights. The final weight assigned to each student is the student's base weight after application of the various adjustments described above. The distributions of the final student weights for the long-term trend samples are given in Table 10-11.\n10.2.5 Other Weights\nSpecial weighting adjustments were developed for certain subsets of the fourth-grade and eighthgrade students assessed in the main samples. The weights for these subsets, with these adjustments applied, were used in equating the results of the national and state assessments for subjects they had in common. Also, weights appropriate for analyzing school-level data files were developed.\n10.2.5.1 Weights for Equating National and State-by-State Samples\nWeights for Equating National and State-by-State Assessments. The fourth-grade mathematics and eighth-grade mathematics and science assessments conducted in February 1996 in the NAEP 1996 State Assessment consisted of identical assessment material to that administered in the corresponding national main sample sessions. Technical details of the NAEP 1996 State Assessments are given in Allen, Jenkins, Kulick, and Zelenak (1997) and Allen, Swinton, Isham, and Zelenak (1998). The national and state-by-state assessments were equated so that state and national results could be reported on a common scale. The equating was achieved by using from each assessment that part of the sample representing a common population. For the national samples, this consisted of those fourth-grade or eighth-grade public-school\n2 4 3\n218\n\n\fSample\nAge Class 9 Reading/Writing Mathematics/Science Excluded Students\nAge Class 13 Reading/Writing Mathematics/Science Excluded Students\nAge Class 17 Reading/Writing Mathematics/Science Excluded Students\n\nTable 10-11 Distribution of Final Student Weights, Long-Term Trend Samples\n\nNumber of Cases\n\nMean\n\nStandard\n\n25th\n\nDeviation Minimum Percentile Median\n\n75th Percentile\n\nMaximum\n\n5019 5414 1117\n\n923.09 613.85 431.66\n\n442.60 288.34 359.05\n\n227.42 189.55 121.12\n\n599.94 420.00 231.89\n\n827.79 562.09 327.31\n\n1140.65 696.40 448.31\n\n4314.81 2736.30 3049.25\n\n5493 5658\n933\n\n855.31 594.48 465.54\n\n369.72 284.74 347.50\n\n54.00 461.32\n38.77\n\n840.26 516.88 342.48\n\n840.26 516.88 342.48\n\n1073.19 670.97 482.85\n\n3655.57 3038.10 2909.37\n\n4669 3539 713\n\n944.55 900.51 549.66\n\n546.50 453.46 338.57\n\n203.58 287.24 160.95\n\n796.32 782.92 471.56\n\n796.32 782.92 471.56\n\n1207.55 1022.00 621.88\n\n3814.59 3505.95 2364.01\n\n245\n\n244\n\n219\n\n\fstudents from a participating state (including the District of Columbia) who were assessed in the main sample mathematics or (for grade 8) science assessment reporting samples.\nAlthough each sample of students received appropriate weights from the weighting procedure used for the national assessment, in an effort to increase the precision of the equating process, an additional weighting adjustment was developed and applied to each subsample by grade and subject, solely for use in equating. For each subsample, the distributions of the main sample reporting weights for three categorical variables were adjusted to agree closely with those obtained from the weighted aggregate sample from the state assessments from the participating states. The first two variables were NAEP region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West) and race/ethnicity (White nonHispanic, Black nonHispanic, Hispanic, and other). For fourth-grade mathematics, the third variable was mathematics skill (good, not sure, other). For eighth-grade mathematics, the third variable was the student's mathematics course (eighth-grade mathematics, pre-algebra, algebra, other). For eighth-grade science, the third variable was the student's science course (earth science only, physical science only or only earth science and physical science, other). The categorical variables and control totals for each of the assessed grades and subjects are presented in Tables 10-12 and 10-13.\n\nTable 10-12 First and Second Categorical Variables Used for Raking'\n\nRaking Dimensions\n\nFourth Grade Mathematics Control Total\n\nFirst Dimension NAEP Region\n1.

At the end of the fitting, adjustment factors were derived and multiplied to the main sample weights for each subgroup to force their distribution to agree with that from the aggregated state samples, for each of these three variables in turn. This process was then repeated, and the final set of adjusted weights was compared with the state sample weights on all three\ndistributions, and found to be in very close agreement.

So that the school samples can be utilized for making national estimates about schools, appropriate nonresponse adjusted survey weights have been developed.\nFor the first time in 1996, the school weights for the main assessments were computed separately by subject within grade. The school weights were a direct byproduct of the student weighting process. The weight for school i in session h is given by\nWhi = PSUWTi SCHWTi SESSWThi SESNRFN SCHPSFhi\n221\n247\n\n\fwhere PSUWT SCHWT, SESSWThi, SESNRFN, and SCHPSFhi are defined in Section 10.2.1.\nThe school weights for the long-term trend assessments in 1996 were computed using the same procedures used in earlier years. The weights were computed separately by age class. The school base weight was the product of PSUWT and SCHWT. School nonresponse adjustments were then applied to these base weights. The values of the adjustment factors are not subject specific. In fact, they are identical to the school nonresponse adjustment factors used for excluded students. Schools that did not participate in any of the sessions that they were assigned were treated as nonrespondents, but schools that conducted at least one,of 'their assigned sessions were treated as respondents.\nFifteen samples of Schools were weighted to be nationally representative in the main assessments, and three samples were weighted to be nationally representative in the long-term trend assessments. In the main samples, the population of schools represented is that of schools with grade 4 (for the grade 4 assessments), grade 8 (for the grade 8 assessments), or grade 12 (for the grade 12 assessments). In the long-term trend samples, the school population at age class 9 is that of schools having eligible students and at least one of the grades 2 through 5, the school population at age class 13 is that of schools having eligible students and at least one of the grades 6 through 9, while the school population at age class 17 is that of schools having eligible students and at least one of the grades 9 through 12.\n10.2.5.3 Jackknife Replicate Weights\nIn addition to the weights that were used to derive all estimates of population and subpopulation characteristics, other sets of weights, called jackknife replicate weights, were derived to facilitate the estimation of sampling variability by the jackknife variance estimation technique. These weights and the jackknife estimator are discussed in the next section.\n10.3 PROCEDURES USED BY NAEP TO ESTIMATE SAMPLING VARIABILITY\nA major source of uncertainty in the estimation of the value in the poPulation of a variable of interest exists because information about the variable is obtained on only a sample from the population. To reflect this fact, it is important to attach to any statistic (e.g., a mean) an estimate of the sampling variability to be expected for that statistic. Estimates of sampling variability provide information about how much the value of a given statistic would be likely to change if the statistic had been based on another, equivalent, sample of individuals drawn in exactly the same manner as the achieved sample.\nAnother important source of variability is that due to imprecision in the measurement of individual proficiencies. For the 1996 assessment, proficiencies in all subject areas were summarized through item response theory (IRT) models, but not in the way that these models are used in standard applications where each person responds to enough items to allow for precise estimation of that person's proficiency. In NAEP, each individual responds to relatively few items so that individual proficiency values are not well determined. Consequently, the variance of any statistic based on proficiency values has a component due to the imprecision in the measurement of the proficiencies of the sampled individuals in addition to a component measuring sampling variability. The estimation of the component of variability due to measurement imprecision and its effect on the total variability of statistics based on proficiency values are discussed in Chapter 11.\n222\n248\n\n\fThe estimation of the sampling variability of any statistic must take into account the sample design. In particular, because of the effects of cluster selection (students within schools, schools within PSUs) and because of effects of nonresponse and poststratification adjustments, observations made on different students cannot be assumed to be independent of each other (and are, in fact, generally positively correlated). Furthermore, to account for the differential probabilities of selection (and the various adjustments), each student has an associated sampling weight, which should be used in the computation of any statistic and which is itself subject to sampling variability. Ignoring the special characteristics of the sample design and treating the data as if the observations were independent and identically distributed, will generally produce underestimates of the true sampling variability, due to the clustering and unequal sampling weights.\nThe proper estimation of the sampling variability of a statistic based on the NAEP data is complicated and requires techniques beyond those commonly available in standard statistical packages. Fortunately, the jackknife procedure (see, e.g., Wolter, 1985; Kish & Frankel, 1974; Rust, 1985) provides good quality estimates of the sampling variability of most statistics, at the expense of increased computation, and can be used in concert with standard statistical packages to obtain a proper estimate of sampling variability.\nThe jackknife procedure used by NAEP has a number of properties that make it particularly suited for the analysis of NAEP data. When properly applied, a jackknife estimate of the variability of a linear estimator (such as a total) will be the same as the standard textbook variance estimate specified for the sample design (if the first-stage units were sampled with replacement and approximately so otherwise). Additionally, if the finite sampling corrections for the first stage units can be ignored, the jackknife produces asymptotically consistent variance estimates for statistics such as ratios, regression estimates or weighted means and for any other nonlinear statistic that can be expressed as a smooth function of estimated totals of one or more variables (Krewski & Rao, 1981).\nThrough the creation of student replicate weights (defined below), the jackknife procedure allows the measurement of variability attributable to the use of poststratification and other weight adjustment factors that are dependent upon the observed sample data. Once these replicate weights are derived, it is a straightforward matter to obtain the jackknife variance estimate of any statistic.\nThe jackknife procedure in this application is based upon the development of a set of jackknife replicate weights for each assessed student (or excluded student, or school depending upon the file involved). The replicate weights are developed in such a way that, when utilized as described below, approximately unbiased estimates of the sampling variance of an estimate result, with an adequate number of degrees of freedom to be useful for purposes of making inferences about the parameter of interest.\nThe estimated sampling variance of a parameter estimator t is the sum of M squared differences (where M is the number of replicate weights developed):\n\nis4ar(t)=\ni=I\nwhere t, denotes the estimator of the parameter of interest, obtained using the ith set of replicate weights, SRWTi, in place of the original sample of full sample estimates WT.\nFor each of the three sample types (see Section 3.4 and Chapter 5 for a description of the three sample types) in the main assessment samples, 62 replicate weights were developed using the procedures outlined below. Similar procedures were followed for the long term trend samples. However, since those\n\n249\n\n223\n\n\fsamples were based on fewer PSUs (52 rather than 94), the long-term trend samples have fewer replicate\nweights (36 instead of 62). Full details of the generation of replicate weights for all samples are given in Wallace and Rust (1999).\n\nOf the 62 replicate weights formed for each record from a main assessment sample, 36act to reflect the amount of sampling variance contributed by the noncertainty strata of PSUs, with the remaining 26 replicate weights reflecting the variance contribution of the certainty PSU samples.\nThe derivation of the 36 replicate weights reflecting the variance of the noncertainty PSUs involves first defining pairs of PSUs in a manner that models the design as one in which two PSUs are drawn with replacement per stratum. This definition of pairs is undertaken in a manner closely reflective of the actual design, in that PSUs are pairs that are drawn from strata within the same subuniverse, and with similar stratum characteristics. The same definition of pairs was used for each of the age/grade classes in the main assessment, since all were drawn from the same sample of noncertainty PSUs. The 72 noncertainty PSUs, drawn one from each of 72 strata, were formed into 36 pairs of PSUs, where the pairs were composed of PSUs from adjacent strata within each subuniverse (thus the strata were relatively similar on socioeconomic characteristics such as proportion minority population, population change since 1980, per capita income, educational attainment, and unemployment rate). Whereas the actual sample design was to'select one PSU with probability proportional to size from each of 72 strata, for variance estimation purposes the design is regarded as calling for the selection of two PSUs with probability proportional to size with replacement from each of 36 strata. This procedure likely gives a small positive bias to estimates of sampling error.\n\nThe student replicate weight for the eh pair of noncertainty PSUs, for the 36 pairs corresponding to values of i from 1 to 36, is computed as follows:\n\n1. Let Wg be the base weight of a student, as described in Section 10.2.1, which accounts for the various components of the selection probability for the student.\n\n2. At random, one PSU in each pair is denoted as PSU number 1, while the other is denoted as PSU number 2. The ith replicate base weight Wbi is given by:\n\n0 Whi = 2 * w8\nWB\n\nif the student belongs to PSU number 1 of pair i if the student belongs to PSU number 2 of pair i if the student is from neither PSU in pair i\n\n3. The ith student replicate weight SRWT; is obtained by applying the various school and student nonresponse adjustments, the weight trimming, and the poststratification to the h set of replicate base weights, using procedures identical to those used to obtain the final student weights WT from the set of base weights WB.\n\nIn brief, the procedure for deriving the sets of Wbi values from the Wg values reflects the sampling of PSUs, schools, sessions, and students. By repeating the various weight adjustment procedures in each set of replicate base weights, the impact of these procedures on the sampling variance of the estimator, t, is appropriately reflected in the variance estimator Var(t) defined above.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining the 26 sets of replicate weights to estimate the sampling variance from the certainty PSUs is analogous, but somewhat more complex. The first stage of sampling in this case is at the school level, and the derivation of replicate weights must reflect appropriately the sampling of schools within certainty PSUs. Since each of the three grade classes in the main assessment involved different\n\n224\nu\n\n\fsamples of schools, the procedure for forming replicate base weights was individualized to each of these sample components. In common across these three samples were the 22 certainty PSUs used, and the fact that 26 replicate weights were formed in each case.\n\nFor a given sample, the 22 certainty PSUs constituted strata, with a sample of schools drawn systematically within each. Using the schools listed in order of sample selection within each stratum, successive schools were paired or formed into triples. These pairs and triples numbered more than 26, so that each replicate weight was in general formed by perturbing the weights of students from more than a single pair or triple. These aggregates of pairs and triples were in general assigned in proportion to the size of the PSU. Thus generally speaking, the largest PSUs were assigned three replicates each, the next largest were assigned two replicates each, and the remaining self-representing PSUs were assigned onereplicate each. When splitting the larger PSUs, the schools were split into groups of (as close as possible) equal size, based on the ordering at the time of sample selection. One group was assigned to each replicate. Within each PSU (or partial PSU in the case of the large split PSUs) schools were alternately numbered 1 or 2 starting randomly. If, however, there were exactly three schools sampled in the PSU the schools were, randomly numbered 1, 2, or 3. The method of forming replicate base weights in strata where there were not exactly three schools was the same as for the noncertainty strata (except that members of a pair, i, could\ncome from more than a single \"stratum\").\n\nWhen a stratum contained three schools, students in these schools had their weights perturbed for two sets of replicates, say il and i2, as follows:\n\n0\nWhi = 1.5 * w11 WB\n\nif the student is in school number 1 of a PSU belonging to set i if the student is in school number 2 or 3 of a PSU belonging to set i if the student does not belong to a PSU in set i\n\n{1.5 * Wa\n0\nWB\n\nif the student is in school number 1 or 2 of a PSU belonging to set i if the student is in school number 3 of a PSU belonging to set i if the student does not belong to a PSU in set i\n\nThe actual pattern of replicate base weight assignment used for each of the samples is given in Wallace and Rust (1999).\n\nThe nonresponse, trimming, and poststratification adjustments were applied to each set of replicate base weights to derive the final replicate weights in each case, exactly as in the noncertainty PSUs. In fact these procedures were applied to the full set of weights from all parts of the given sample together, just as for the full sample weights. That is, for eixample, poststratification factors were derived from the full set of data for each replicate, not separately for certainty and noncertainty PSUs.\n\nThis estimation technique was used by NAEP to estimate all sampling errors presented in the various reports. A further discussion of the variance estimation procedure used by NAEP, including a discussion of alternative jackknife estimators that were also considered, appears in Johnson (1989).\n\nWe noted above (as discussed in Chapter 11) that a separate estimate of the contribution to\nvariance due to the imprecision in the measure of individual proficiencies is made and added to the jackknife estimate of variance. That variance component could have been approximately reflected in the\njackknife variance estimates simply by separately applying the IRT computations to each jackknife replicate. Because of the heavier IRT computational load, this was not done. Less work was involved by the simple procedure of making separate estimates of this component to be added to the jackknife variance\n\n225\n251\n\n\festimates. Also, a separate measure of this component of variance is then available, which would not be so if it were reflected in the jackknife variance estimate.\n10.4 APPROXIMATING THE SAMPLING VARIANCE USING DESIGN EFFECTS\nIn practical terms, the major expenditure of resources in the computation of a jackknife variance estimate occurs in the preparation of estimates for each of the pseudoreplicates. In the 1996 assessment, this implies that the statistic of interest has to be recomputed up to 63 times, once for the overall estimate t, and once for each of the up to 62 pseudoreplicates ti. Because this is a considerable increase in the amount of computation required, relative to a conventional variance estimate, it is of interest to see how much the jackknife variance estimates differ from their less computationally intensive, simple random sampling based, analogues.\nThe comparison of the conventional and the jackknife methods of variance estimation will be in terms of a statistic called the design effect, which was developed by Kish (1965) and extended by Kish and Frankel (1974). The design effect for a statistic is the ratio of the actual variance of the statistic (taking the sample design into account) over the conventional variance estimate based on a simple random sample with the same number of elements. The design effect is the inflation factor to be applied to the conventional variance estimate in order to adjust error estimates based on simple random sampling assumptions to account approximately for the effect of the sample design. The value of the design effect depends on the type of statistic computed and the variables considered in a particular analysis as well as the combined clustering, stratification, and weighting effects occurring among sampled elements. While stratification drives down the sampling variance, the effects of clustering and weighting that drive variances up are generally sufficiefit to produce variance estimates that are larger than variances based on simple random sampling assumptions. Consequently, the design effects will be greater than one. In NAEP, the underestimates are the result of ignoring the effects of clustering and unequal probabilities of selection in the variance calculations.\nSince most of the analyses conducted by NAEP are based on the results of scaling models that summarize performance of students across a learning area, we consider the design effects to be expected for analyses based on these scale scores. For reasons given in Chapter 11, NAEP provides each individual with a set of \"plausible values,\" each of which is a random draw from the distribution of the potential scale scores for that individual. Since our current interest is on the effect of the sampling design on estimation and inference, we will restrict our attention to a single measure of an individual's proficiency, the first plausible value of the individual's scale score.\nA key statistic of interest is the estimated mean proficiency of a subgroup of the population. An , estimate of the subgroup mean proficiency is the weighted mean of the first plausible values of proficiency\nof the sampled individuals who belong to the subpopulation of interest. Let Y be the weighted mean of the plausible values of the sampled members of the subpopulation. The conventional estimate of the variance of Y is\nVarc041=1wNi(Wyi\nwhere N is the total number of sampled individuals in the subpopulation for which plausible values are available, wi is the weight of the ith individual, yi is a plausible value from the distribution of potential proficiencies for that individual, and W, is the sum of the weights across the N individuals.\n226\nr 0\n\n\fThe design effect for the subgroup mean proficiency estimate is\ndeff(il= Varm(Y)/Var,(Y)\nwhere VARJAY ) is the jackknife variance of Y . (As has been pointed out previously, VARJ(Y ) as computed does not measure the variability of fi due to imprecision in the measurement of the proficiencies of the sampled individuals. The estimation of this very important source of variability isdiscussed in Chapter 11.) Of the factors that determine deaY ), the effects of stratification are usually less than one, which means the efficiency of a stratified sampling is better than a simple random sampling; whereas the clustering effects are always larger than one. The clustering effects can be approximated by\nwhere in is the average cluster size and p is the intracluster correlation (Cochran, 1977). Therefore, the large cluster size or large intracluster correlation will inflate the clustering effects.\nValues of the design effects for subgroup mean proficiencies are displayed, by grade, in Tables 1015 and 10-19 for the 1996 main assessments of mathematics and science respectively. Design effects are shown for the population as a whole (Total) as well as for a variety of demographic subgroups: gender; race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, other); type of location (Central City, Urban Fringe/Large Town, Rural/Small Town); parental education (did not graduate high school, graduated high school, post-high school, graduated college, unknown); and type of school (public, nonpublic). These particular demographic variables were selected because (1) they are major variables in NAEP reports and (2) they reflect different types of divisions of the population that might have different levels of sampling variability. Note that the tables of the design effects provided in the NAEP Technical Reports previous to 1994 are computed for the mean item scores, proportion-correct statistics, which can not be compared with the design effects for proficiency scale scores directly.\nThe 1996 main mathematics assessment contains the three sample types Sl, S2 and S3 (see Section 5.3). To conserve trend in the main mathematics assessment, the reporting samples were made up of A 1 and B1 portions in S1 samples and A2 in S2 samples (see Table 10-1). The advantage of including A2 in the reporting samples is to obtain more accurate scale scores, yet a trade-off is that the clustering effects for the reporting samples becomes lager than the clustering effects for only sample S I.\nThe larger intracluster correlation in Al and A2 and larger cluster sizes in sample type S1 are two factors that contribute to the increase in clustering effects. First, the reporting sample for the main mathematics assessment from sample type S2 has only non-SD/LEP students, A2. Compared with the SD/LEP students, the non-SD/LEP students are relative homogenous in scale scores. The high homogeneity in clusters implies a large intracluster correlation, p 1. Given other conditions, the large clustering effects that are due to a large intracluster correlation expand the design effects in the reporting samples. To check this conclusion, the design effects for subsamples of Al, A2, and B1 were calculated separately and are displayed in Tables 10-16, 10-17 and 10-18. The estimated design effects for subsamples of A 1 and A2 are much larger than those for subsample B1 that contains SD/LEP students in sample type SI. Secondly, the cluster sizes tended to be larger in sample type S1 because the schools in sample type S1 only provided samples for the main mathematics assessment, whereas the schools in sample type S2 provided samples for both the main mathematics and science assessments. Therefore, the design effects in Al are found to be larger than the design effects in A2 and both subsamples of Al and A2 contributed students to the reporting samples.\n227\n\n\fTables 10-20 and 10-21 provide equivalent information for the long-term trend samples. Table 10-20 provides, for each age class and demographic subgroup, the average of the design effects for mean reading and writing proficiencies for the students selected for the long-term trend assessments of reading and writing. Table 10-21 provides the average of the design effects for the mean mathematics and science proficiencies for the students selected for the long-term trend assessments of.mathematics and science.\nFinally, for comparison with the national mathematics and science results, Table 10-22 shows the average design effects for state-level mean mathematics proficiency, averaged across all jurisdictions participating in the grade 4 and grade 8 1996.State Assessment in mathematics. The results in Table 10-23 are the average design effects for state-level mean science proficiency, averaged across all jurisdictions participating in the grade 8 1996 State Assessment in science.\nThe tables show that the design effects are predominantly larger than 1, indicating that standard variance estimation formulas will be generally too small, usually markedly so. Although the design effects appear somewhat different for certain subgroups of the population, they are, perhaps, similar enough (at least within a subject and grade) to select an overall composite value that is adequate for most purposes. In choosing a composite design effect, some consideration must be made about the relative consequences of overestimating the variance as opposed to underestimating the variance. For example, if an overestimate of the variance is viewed as severe an error as an underestimate, the composite design effect should be near to the center of the distributions of the design effects. Possible composites of this type are the mean and median design effects across the combined distribution of all design effects. Larger design effects should be used if it is felt that it is a graver error to underestimate the variability of a statistic than to overestimate it. For example, Johnson and King (1987) examine estimation of variances using design effects (among other techniques) under the assumption that the consequences of an underestimate are three times as severe as those of an overestimate of the same magnitude. Adopting a loss function that is a weighted sum of absolute values of the deviations of predicted from actual with underestimates receiving three times the weight of overestimates, produces the upper quartile of the design effects as the composite value. This assumes that the distribution of design effects is roughly independent of the jackknife estimates of variance, so that the size of a design effect does not depend on the size of the variance.\nTable 10-24 gives the values of these potential composites, by grade, for the mathematics and science assessments, and across those assessments. Tables 10-25 and 10-26 gives composite values for the 1996 State Assessment of mathematics (grades 4 and 8), and the 1996 State Assessment of science (grade 8), respectively. Table 10-27 shows composite values for the 1996 State Assessment of mathematics and the 1996 State Assessment of science, combined. The state assessments tend to have smaller design effects than the matching national assessment, due to the lesser degree of clustering in the state assessment samples (i.e., the average cluster size of m is smaller). Table 10-28 gives the values of the composites for the two longterm trend samples.\nWe note that the Vara,(Y) as defined above is an estimate of S2/N where S2 represents the unit\nvariance for a simple random sample for the population of students from which the sample is drawn. This is an appropriate estimate of the increase in variance over simple random sampling from that population due to the effects of weighting. However, the computer packages used for estimating the variance may not reflect the weights in estimating the unit variance, as given above, but instead may provide an estimate of a unit variance of the form\nN2\nIn this case, the unweighted estimate of unit variance would be appropriate for the denominator of a design effect measure of the increase in variance over the unit variance as estimated by the computer package. If\n228\n'1\n\n\fthere is no correlation between the wi and yi, there would be little difference between the two.\n\nTable 10-15 Design Effects by Demographic Subgroup and Grade\nfor Mean Mathematics

Allen, Eugene G. Johnson, Robert J. Mislevy, and Neal Thomas Educational Testing Service\n11.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe primary method by which results from the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) were disseminated was scale-score reporting. With scaling methods, the performance of a sample of students in a subject area or subarea can be summarized on a single scale or series of scales even when different students have been administered different items. This chapter presents an overview of the scaling methodologies employed in the analyses of the data from NAEP surveys in general and from the 1996 assessment in particular. Details of the scaling procedures specific to the subject areas of science, mathematics., reading, and writing are presented in Chapters 12 through 17.\n11.2 BACKGROUND\nThe basic information from an assessment consists of the responses of students to the items presented in the assessment. For NAEP, these items are constructed to measure performance on sets of objectives developed by nationally representative panels of learning area specialists, educators, and concerned citizens. Satisfying the objectives of the assessment and ensuring that the tasks selected to measure each goal cover a range of difficulty levels typically require many items. For example, the mathematics assessment required 164 items at grade 8. Depending on the subject areas, a mixture of multiple-choice, short constructed-response, and extended constructed-response items were used. Multiple-choice and short constructed-response items were used in all assessments but writing. Extended constructed-response items, scored on a multipoint scale, were presented in the main mathematics and science assessments and in the long-term trend writing assessment. To reduce student burden, each assessed student was presented only a fraction of the full pool of items through multiple matrix sampling procedures.\nThe most direct manner of presenting the assessment results is to report separate statistics for each item. However, because of the vast amount of information, having separate results for each of the items in the assessment pool hinders the comparison of the general performance of subgroups of the population. Item-by-item reporting masks similarities in trends and subgroup comparisons that are common across items.\nAn obvious summary of performance across a collection of items is the average of the separate item scores. The advantage of averaging is that it tends to cancel out the effects of peculiarities in items\nI Nancy L. Allen is responsible for the psychometric and statistical analysis of national and state NAEP data. Eugene G. Johnson is a senior psychometrician, contributing to the design of NAEP and to discussions of sampling issues. Previously he was responsible for the psychometric and statistical analysis of NAEP data. Robert J. Mislevy is a technical consultant contributing in the area of.item response theory. Neal Thomas was a technical consultant to the NAEP analysis staff, contributing in the area of imputed values.\n235\n\n\fthat can affect item difficulty in unpredictable ways. Furthermore, averaging makes it possible to compare more easily the general performances of subpopulations.\nDespite their advantages, there are a.number of significant problems with average item scores. First, the interpretation of these results depends on the selection of the items; the selection of easy or difficult items could make student performance appear to be overly high or low. Second, the average score is related to the particular items comprising the average, so that direct comparisons in performance between subpopulations require that those subpopulations have been administered the same set of items. Third, because this approach limits comparisons to average scores on specific sets of items, it provides no simple way to report trends over time when the item pool changes. Finally, direct estimates of parameters or quantities such as the proportion of students who would achieve a certain score across the items in the pool are not possible when every student is administered only a fraction of the item pool. While the average score across all items in the pool can be readily obtained (as the average of the individual item scores), statistics that provide distributional information, such as quantiles of the distribution of scores across the full set of iterns, cannot be readily obtained without additional assumptions.\nThese limitations can be overcome by the use of response scaling methods. If several items require similar skills, the regularities observed in response patterns can often be exploited to characterize both respondents and items in terms of a relatively small number of variables. These variables include a respondent-specific variable, called proficiency, which quantifies a respondent's tendency to answer items correctly (or, for multipoint items, to achieve a certain score) and item-specific variables that indicate characteristics of the item such as its difficulty, effectiveness in distinguishing between individuals with different levels of proficiency, and the chances of a very low proficiency respondent correctly answering a multiple-choice item. (These variables are discussed in more detail in the next section.) When combined through appropriate mathematical formulas, these variables capture the dominant features of the data. Furthermore, all students can be placed on a common scale, even though none of the respondents takes all of the items within the pool. Using the common scale, it becomes possible to discuss distributions of proficiency in a population or subpopulation and to estimate the relationships between proficiency and background variables.\nIt is important to point out that any procedure of aggregation, from a simple average to a complex multidimensional scaling model, highlights certain patterns at the expense of other potentially interesting patterns that may reside within the data. Every item in a NAEP survey is of interest and can provide useful information about what young Americans know and can do. The choice of an aggregation procedure must be driven by a conception of just which patterns are salient for a particular purpose.\nThe scaling for the main assessments in mathematics and science was carried out separately within the content strands or fields specified in the frameworks for those subjects, respectively. This scaling within subareas was done because it was anticipated that different patterns of performance or different trends over time might exist for these essential subdivisions of the subject areas. By creating a separate scale for each of these content areas, potential differences in subpopulation performance between the content areas are preserved.\nThe creation of a series of separate scales to describe performance within a subject area does not preclude the reporting of a single index of overall performance in the subject areathat is, an overall subject area composite. A composite is computed as the weighted average of the content area scales, where the weights correspond to the relative importance given to each content area as defined by the framework. The composite provides a global measure of performance within the subject area, while the\n236\n6_ 2\n\n\fconstituent content area scales allow the measurement of important interactions within educationally relevant subdivisions of the subject area.\n\n11.3 SCALING METHODOLOGY\nThis section reviews the scaling models employed in the analyses of data of the 1996 assessment, and the multiple imputation or \"plausible values\" methodology that allows such models to be used with NAEP's sparse item-sampling design. The reader is referred to Mislevy (1991) for an introduction to plausible values methods and a comparison with standard psychometric analyses, to Donoghue (1994), Mislevy, Johnson and Muraki (1992), and Beaton and Johnson (1992) for additional information on how the models are used in NAEP, and to Rubin (1987) for the theoretical underpinnings of the approach. It should be noted that the imputation procedure used by NAEP is a mechanism for providing plausible values for the unobserved proficiencies and not for filling in blank responses to background or cognitive variables.\nWhile the NAEP procedures were developed explicitly to handle the characteristics of NAEP data, they build on other research, and are paralleled by other researchers. See, for example Dempster, Laird, and Rubin (1977); Little and Rubin (1983, 1987); Andersen (1980); Engelen (1987); Hoijtink (1991); Laird (1978); Lindsey, Clogg, and Grego (1991); Zwinderman (1991); Tanner and Wong (1987); and Rubin (1987, 1991).\n\n11.3.1 The Scaling Models\n\nThree distinct scaling models, depending on item type and scoring procedure, were used in the analysis of the data from the 1996 assessment. Each of the models is based on item response theory (IRT; e.g., Lord, 1980). Each is a \"latent variable\" model, defined separately for each of the scales, which expresses respondent's tendencies to achieve certain scores (such as correct/incorrect) on the items contributing to a scale as a function of a parameter that is not directly observed, called proficiency on the\nscale.\n\nA three-parameter logistic (3PL) model was used for the multiple-choice items (which were scored correct/incorrect). The fundamental equation of the 3PL model is the probability that a person whose proficiency on scale k is characterized by the unobservable variable ek will respond correctly to item j:\n\n(1-0\n\nP(x; = 110k, ahk, ci)= c; +\n1+ exp[-1.7aJ(Ok k)]\n\nPii(ek),\n\nwhere\nX\na\nb.;\n\nis the response to item j, 1 if correct and 0 if not;\nwhere ci.,>0, is the slope parameter of item j, characterizing its sensitivity to proficiency;\nis the threshold parameter of item j, characterizing its difficulty; and\nwhere Osc,<1, is the lower asymptote parameter of item j, reflecting the chances of students of very low proficiency selecting the correct option.\n\n237\n\n\fFurther define the probability of an incorrect response to the item as\n\nPp) P(x; = 016k, aj, bj,c,) = 1 P./1(6k).\n\n(11.2)\n\nA two-parameter logistic (2PL) model was used for the short constructed-response items that were scored correct or incorrect. The form of the 2PL model is the same as Equations (11.1) and (11.2) with the c; parameter fixed at zero.\n\nIn addition to the multiple-choice and short constructed-response items, a number of extended constructed-response items were presented in the assessments of mathematics and science; and only extended constructed-response items were presented in the long-term trend writing assessment. Each of these items was scored on a multipoint scale with potential scores ranging from 0 to 3 or from 0 to 4. Some short constructed-response items were scored on a three-point scale (0-2). Items that are scored on a multipoint scale are referred to as polytomous items, in contrast with the multiple-choice and short constructed-response items, which are scored correct or incorrect and referred to as dichotomous items.\nThe polytomous items were scaled using a generalized partial credit model (Muraki, 1992). The fundamental equation of this model is the probability that a person with proficiency ek on scale k will have, for the jth item, a response x; that is scored in the ith ofm, ordered score categories:\n\nP(x; = iIOk, a1, b1, where\n\n)) exp1 E1.7 ai(Ok b./ +4,\n\n. c11, m -1) =\n\nv=o\n\n= Pii(Ok)\n\ntexp(I1.7ai(Ok b; + v))\n\ng=0\n\nv=0\n\n(11.3)\n\nm. is the number of categories in the response to item]\n\nX is the response to item j, with possibilities\n\na. is the slope parameter;\n\nbj is the item location parameter characterizing overall difficulty; and is the category i threshold parameter (see below).\n\nIndeterminacies in the parameters of the above model are resolved by setting di3O = 0 and setting\nm -1\nc11, = 0. Muraki (1992) points out that bj d1,1 is the point on the ek scale at which the plots of PJ,1_1(8k)\nand P.,;(0k) intersect and so characterizes the point on the ek scale at which the response to item j has equal probability of falling in response category i-1 and falling in response category i.\nWhen m1 = 2, so that there are two score categories (0,1), it can be shown that P.,,(0k) of Equation (11.3) for i=0,1 corresponds respectively to Pio(Ok) and fll(Ok) of the 2PL model (Equations (11.1) and (11.2) with c1=0).\n\n238\n264\n\n\fClose examination of the 3PL and generalized partial credit models indicate that both models have a linear indeterminacy of the theta scale. In other words, if the item parameters were estimated in a different metric, the value of ek could be transformed to make (11.1) and (11.3) true. For the purposes of reporting item parameter estimates and other intermediary estimates, the linear indeterminacies apparent in (11.1) and (11.3) may be resolved by an arbitrary choice of the origin and unit size in a given scale. In most cases, a provisional scale standardizing the theta distribution to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is employed. Final results for each content area were linearly transformed from the 0 scale to a 0-to500 (for mathematics) or a 0-to-300 scale (for science), as described in the subject area chapters in this\nreport.\n\nA basic assumption of item response theory is the conditional independence of the responses by an individual to a set of items, given the individual's proficiency. That is, conditional on the individual's 0k, the joint probability of a particular response pattern x = (x),...,x) across a set of n items\nis simply the product of terms based on (11.1), (11.2), and (11.3):\n\nn 15-1\n13(.7CIOk, item parameters) = J I p.i.t(0k\nj=1 i=0\n\n(11.4)\n\nwhere /yak) is of the form appropriate to the type of item (dichotomous or polytomous), nij is equal to 2 for the dichotomously scored items, and up is an indicator variable defined by\n\nI if response x; is in category i uji =\n0 otherwise\n\nIt is also typically assumed that response probabilities are conditionally independent of background variables (y), given ek, or\n\nP(xIOk, item parameters, y)= p(xl0k, item parameters).\n\n(11.5)\n\nAfter x has been observed, equation 11.4 can be viewed as a likelihood function, and provides a basis for inference about Ok or about item parameters. Estimates of item parameters were obtained by the NAEP BILOGIPARSCALE program, which combines Mislevy and Bock's (1982) BILOG and Muraki and Bock's (1991) PARSCALE computer programs2, and which concurrently estimates parameters for all items (dichotomous and polytomous). Donoghue (1994) reports on the effect of having both dichotomous and polytomous items within a scale. The item parameters are then treated as known in subsequent calculations. In subject areas with multiple scales (main mathematics and science), the parameters of the items constituting each of the separate scales were estimated independently of the parameters of the other scales. Once items have been calibrated in this manner, a likelihood function for the proficiency ek is induced by a vector of responses to any subset of calibrated items, thus allowing Ok-based inferences from matrix samples. The likelihood function for the proficiency ek is called the posterior distribution of\nthe thetas for each student.\nIn almost all NAEP IRT analyses, missing responses at the end of each block of items a student was administered were considered \"not reached,\" and treated as if they had not been presented to the respondent. Missing responses to dichotomous items before the last observed response in a block were considered intentional omissions, and treated as fractionally correct at the value of the reciprocal of the\n\n2 See Muraki and Bock (1997) for the current version of PARSCALE.\n\n265\n\n239\n\n\fnumber of response alternatives, if the item was a multiple-choice item. These conventions are discussed by Mislevy and Wu (1988). With regard to the handling of not-reached items, Mislevy and,Wu found that ignoring not-reached items introduces slight biases into item parameter estimation when not-reached items are present and speed is correlated with ability. With regard to omissions, they found that the method described above provides consistent limited-information maximum likelihood estimates of item and ability parameters under the assumption that respondents omit only if they can do no better than responding randomly.\nOccasionally, extended constructed-response items were the last item in a block of items. Because considerably more effort was required of the student to answer these items, nonresponse to an extended constructed-response item at the end ofa block was considered an intentional omission (and scored as the lowest category, 0) unless the student also did not respond to the item immediately preceding that item. In that case, the extended constructed-response item was considered not reached and treated as if it had not been presented to the student.\nAlthough the IRT models are employed in NAEP only to summarize performance, a number of checks are made to detect serious violations of the assumptions underlying the models. Checks are made to detect multidimensionality of the construct being measured and certain condition dependencies. DIF analyses are used to examine issues of dimensionality, and what are called x2 statistics in the IRT literature are used to flag responses with serious departures from the IRT model. The latter statistics might better be called item fit statistics since they do not really have x2 distributions. These checks include comparisons of empirical and theoretical item response functions to identify items for which the IRT model may provide a poor fit to the data. When warranted, remedial efforts, such as collapsing categories of polytomous items or combining items into a single item, are made to mitigate the effects of such violations on inferences.\nScaling areas in NAEP are determined a priori by grouping items into content areas for which overall performance is deemed to be of interest, as defined by the frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). A proficiency scale Ok is defined a priori by the collection of items representing that scale. What is important, therefore, is that the models capture salient information in the response data to effectively summarize the overall performance on the content area of the populations and subpopulations being assessed in the content areas. NAEP has routinely conducted differential item functioning (DIF) analyses to guard against potential biases in making subpopulation comparisons based on the proficiency distributions.\nThe local independence assumption embodied in Equation (11.4) implies that item response probabilities depend only on 0 and the specified item parameters, and not on the position of the item in the booklet, the content of items around an item of interest, or the test-administration and timing conditions. However, these effects are certainly present in any application. The practical question is whether inferences concerning aggregate performance in the scaling area that are based on the IRT probabilities obtained via (11.4) are robust with respect to the ideal assumptions underlying the IRT model. Our experience with the 1986 NAEP reading anomaly (Beaton & Zwick, 1990) has shown that for measuring small changes over time, changes in item context and speededness conditions can lead to unacceptably large random error components. These can be avoided by presenting items used to measure change in identical test forms, with identical timings and administration conditions. Thus, we do not maintain that the item parameter estimates obtained in any particular booklet configuration are appropriate for other conceivable configurations. Rather, we assume that the parameter estimates are context-bound. This is the reason that the long-term trend booklets and administration procedures have not changed since the early 1980s and only a limited number of blocks of items are released after each main assessment cycle. It was also the reason we prefer common population equating to common item\n240\n6 6\n\n\fequating whenever equivalent random samples are available for linking. In common item equating, items\nare assumed to be measuring exactly the same thing for two or more populations, despite any differences in context or administration. In common population equating, results for two or more samples from the same population are matched to one another when linking the scales. Therefore, the data from the State Assessment were calibrated separately from the national NAEP data. In this case, the administration procedures differed somewhat between the State Assessment and the national NAEP.\nIn practice, PARSCALE item fit statistics are used as a way to identify items that need further examination. Most of the statistics of this type that are available for use in this setting have distributions that are unknown. Therefore, they cannot be used for final decisions about the fit of the items to the IRT model. Because of the lack of statistical tests for IRT model fit, the fit of the IRT models to the observed data was examined within each scale by comparing the empirical item response functions (IRFs) with the theoretical curves. The primary means of accomplishing this is to generate plots of empirical versus theoretical item response curves. The theoretical curves are plots of the response functions based on the estimates of the item parameters. The empirical proportions are calculated from the,posterior distributions of the thetas for each student who received the item. For dichotomous items, the sum of the values of the posterior distributions at a point on the theta scale for each student who answered an item correctly plus the sum of a fractional portion of the values of the posterior distribution at that point on the theta scale for each student who omitted the item is parallel in- meaning to the number of students who actually answered the item correctly plus a fraction of the number of students who omitted the item. The sum of the values of the posterior distributions for all students receiving the item at each point on the theta scale is parallel in meaning to the empirical number of students at that point on the theta scale who received the item. The plotted values are sums of these individual posteriors at each point on the theta scale for those who got the item correct plus a fraction of the omitters divided by the sum of the posteriors of those administered the item, in the case of dichotomous items, and for those who scored in the category of interest over the sum for those who received the item, in the case of polytomous items.\nFigure 11-1 contains a plot of the empirical and theoretical IRFs for a dichotomous item. In the plot, the horizontal axis represents the theta (proficiency) scale, the vertical axis represents the probability of a correct response. The solid curve is the theoretical IRF based on the item parameter estimates and Equation (11.1). The centers of the diamonds represent the empirical proportions correct as described above. The size of the diamonds are proportional to the sum of the posteriors at each point on the theta scale for all of those who received the item; this is related to the number of students\ncontributing to the estimation of that empirical proportion correct.\nFigure 11-2 contains a plot of the empirical and theoretical IRFs for apolytomous item from the 1997 Arts (Theatre) National Assessment. As for the dichotomous item plot in Figure 11-1, the horizontal axis represents the proficiency scale, but the vertical axis represents the probability of having a response fall in each category. The solid curves are the theoretical IRFs based on the item parameter estimates and Equation (11.3). The centers of the diamonds represent the empirical proportions of students with responses in each category and are proportional to the sum of the posteriors at each point on the theta scale for the students who received the item.\nFor good fitting items, the empirical and theoretical curves are close together. Therefore, items for which this is not true are examined carefully. Examples of plots for specific items are provided in the subject-area chapters. When the same items are presented in two assessment years, the empirical curves for the two years can be compared. Normally, these curves differ somewhat due to the sampling of students for each of the two years. Figure 12-1 contains a plot for an item with curves of this type. When the empirical curves differ dramatically, one cause might be achange in the meaning of the item due to instructional or societal changes across the years. This type of item is ordinarily treated as two different\n\n267\n\n241\n\n\fitemsone for each of the assessment years. Figure 12-4 contains the plot for an item that has been treated in this way.\nTo summarize, using current methodologies in psychometrics, assumption of conditional independence and the assumption that the data fit the models in Equations 11.1 and 11.3 are examined and controlled in NAEP in several ways. They are examined by considering tests of DIF, item fit statistics, and plots of empirical and theoretical IRFs. They are controlled by treating.thissing and \"not reached\" responses in reasonable ways, maintaining the context and admiiiitration of items across assessments, collapsing categories of polytomous items when appropriate, combining items into a single item, or making decisions about the inclusion or exclusion of an item in a scale based on data. The identification and amelioration of violations of IRT assumptions is an area of ongoing research in educational measurement.\nFigure 11-1 Example Cross-Sectional Dichotomous Item (R016102, Age 13/Grade 8)\nExhibiting Good Model Fit*\nF2 0 1 6 1 0 2 .\n0\nA 9\n*Note: The plot compares empirical and model-based estimates of the item response function (IRF).

In that setting, each individual is administered enough items (often 60 or more) to permit precise estimation of his or her 0, as a maximum likelihood estimate, 6, for example. Because the uncertainty associated with each 6 is negligible, the distribution of 0, or the joint distribution of 0 with other variables, can then be approximated using an individual's e values as if they were 0 values.\nThis approach breaks down in the assessment setting when, in order to provide broader content coverage in limited testing time, each respondent is administered relatively few items in a subject area scale. A first problem is that the uncertainty associated with individual Os is too large to ignore, and the features of the o distribution can be seriously biased as estimates of the 0 distribution. (The failure of this approach was verified in early analyses of the 1984 NAEFreading survey; see Wingersky, Kaplan, & Beaton, 1987.) A second problem, occurring even with test lengths of 60, arises when test forms vary across and within assessments as to the numbers, formats, and content of the test items. The measurement error distributions thus differ even if underlying 0 distributions do not, causing e distributions to exhibit\n243\n26 9\n\n\fspurious changes and comparisons in apparent population distributionseasily greater than actual differences over time or across groups. Although this latter problem is avoided in traditional standardized testing by presenting students with parallel test forms, controlled tightly across time and groups, the same constraints cannot be imposed in the design and data-collection phases of the present NAEP. Plausible values were developed as a way to estimate key population features consistently, and approximate others no worse than standard IRT procedures would, even when item booklet composition, format, and content balances change over time. A detailed development of plausible values methodology is given in Mislevy (1991). Along with theoretical justifications, that paper presents comparisons with standard procedures, discussions of biases that arise in some secondary analyses, and numerical exaniples.\nThe following provides a brief overview of the plausible values approach, focusing on its implementation in the 1996 NAEP analyses.\nLet y represent the responses of all sampled examinees to background and attitude questions, along with variables based on the sampling design such as the school where the student is enrolled, and let 0 represent the vector of proficiency values. If were known for all sampled examinees, it would be possible to compute a statistic t(9,y), such as a scale or composite subpopulation sample mean, a sample percentile point, or a sample regression coefficient, to estimate a corresponding population quantity T. A function U(0 y)e.g., a jackknife estimatewould be iised to gauge sampling uncertainty, as the variance of t around T in repeated samples from the population.\nBecause the scaling models are latent variable models, however, 0 values are not observed even for sampled students. To overcome this problem, we follow Rubin (1987) by considering 0 as \"missing data,\" and approximate t(ly) by its expectation given (x,y), the data that actually were observed, as follows:\n\nt * Y) = E[t(9_, Y)k, =5 t(P, y)p(8-1-1, 94'\n\n(11.6)\n\nIt is possible to approximate t* using random draws from the predictive conditional distribution of the scale proficiencies given the item responses xj, background variables yi, and model parameters for sampled student i. These values are referred to as imputations in the sampling literature, and plausible values in NAEP. The value of 0 for any respondent that would enter into the computation of t is thus replaced by a randomly selected value from the respondent's conditional distribution. Rubin (1987) proposes that this process be carried out several timesmultiple imputationsso that the uncertainty associated with imputation can be quantified. The average of the results of, for example, M estimates of t, each computed from a different set of plausible values, is a Monte Carlo approximation of (11.6); the variance among them, B, reflects uncertainty due to not observing 0, and must be added to the estimated expectation of U(9,y), which reflects uncertainty due to testing only a sample of students from the population. Section 11.5 explains how plausible values are used in subsequent analyses.\nIt cannot be emphasized too strongly that plausible values are not test scores for individuals in the usual sense. Plausible values are offered only as intermediary computations for calculating integrals of the form of Equation (11.6), in order to estimate population characteristics. When the underlying model is correctly specified, plausible values will provide consistent estimates of population characteristics, even though they are not generally unbiased estimates of the proficiencies of the individuals with whom they are associated. The key idea lies in the contrast between plausible values and\n244\n\n\fthe more familiar estimates of proficiency (e.g., maximum likelihood estimate or Bayes estimate) that are in some sense optimal for each examinee: Point estimates that are optimal for individual examinees have distributions that can produce decidedly nonoptimal (specifically, inconsistent) estimates of population characteristics (Little & Rubin, 1983). Plausible values, on the other hand, are constructed explicitly to provide consistent estimates of population effects. For further discussion see Mislevy, Beaton, Kaplan,\nand Sheehan (1992).\n\n11.3.3 Computing Plausible Values in IRT-Based Scales\nPlausible values for each respondent r are drawn from the predictive conditional distribution p(erlx,yr,T,L), where Fand Eare regression model parameters defined in this subsection. This subsection describes how, in IRT-based scales, these conditional distributions are characterized, and how the draws are taken. An application of Bayes' theorem with the IRT assumption of conditional independence produces\n\np(12,11, y ,\n\n) oc P(Ller , y , T, )42,1y , J L' ) = P(2a19.)p(grlyr, , T, )\n\n(11.7)\n\nwhere, for vector-valued Or. P(xrler) is the product over scales of the independent likelihoods induced by\nresponses to items within each scale, and p(firlyr,F,L) is the multivariateand generally nonindependentjoint density of proficiencies for the scales, conditional on the observed value yr of background responses, and the parameters Fand L'. The provisional scales are determined by the item parameter estimates that constrain the population mean to zero and standard deviation to one. The item parameter estimates are fixed and regarded as population values in the computation described in this\nsubsection.\n\nIn the analyses of the data from the main assessments, a normal (Gaussian) form was assumed for p('erlyr, F), with a common variance-covariance matrix, 2 and with a mean given by a linear model with slope parameters, r based on the first approximately 200 principal components of several hundred selected main-effects and two-way interactions of the complete vector of background variables. The included principal components will be referred to as the conditioning variables, and will be denoted yf. (The complete set of original background variables used in the analyses of each subject area are listed in\nAppendix C.) The following model was fit to the data within each subject area:\n\n= F'yc-i-E\n\n(11.8)\n\nwhere & is multivariately normally distributed with mean zero and variance-covariance matrix L'. The number of principal components of the background variables used for each sample was sufficient to account for 90 percent of the total variance of the full set of background variables (after standardizing each variable). As in regression analysis, Fis a matrix each of whose columns is the effects for one scale and L'is the matrix variance-covariance of residuals between scales.\nA model similar to (11.8) was used for the long-term trend assessments, with the difference that y_c_ consisted of main effects and interactions from the smaller set of background variables (rather than principal components of those variables) available in the long-term trend assessments.\n\n271\n\n245\n\n\fMaximum likelihood estimates of rand E, denoted by F and E , are obtained with extensions of Sheehan's (1985) MGROUP computer program using the EM algorithm described in Mislevy (1985). The EM algorithm requires the computation of the mean, Tilr, and variance-covariance matrix, Eli.' , of the predictive conditional distribution in (11.7) for respondent r when there are p scales within a subject area. For subject areas with multiple scales, the CGROUP version of the MGROUP program was used to compute the moments using higher order asymptotic corrections to a normal approximation (Thomas, 1993). For the long-term trend assessments, each of which have a single scale, the more precise but computationally intensive BGROUP version of MGROUP was used. BGROUP uses numeric quadrature to evaluate the predictive conditional distribution moments required by the E-step of the EM algorithm for one- and two-dimensional applications (Thomas, 1993). For estimation of group means on a single scale, CGROUP and BGROUP results will be nearly identical to those from the original MGROUP program. CGROUP and BGROUP yield better estimates of correlations between scales, and hence better estimates of composite scale means. BGROUP will, theoretically, yield better estimates than CGROUP, but because of the heavy computational demands of the methodology used, its function is limited to bivariate scales. Hence CGROUP is used for assessments involving more than two scales.\nAfter completion of the EM algorithm, the plausible values for all sampled respondents is drawn in the following three-step process. First, a value of ris drawn from a normal distribution with mean being F and variance being the variance of F. Second, conditional on the generated value of rand the fixed value of E. E, the predictive conditional distribution mean -6, and the predictive conditional distribution variance Er of respondent r are computed from Equation 11.7using the EM algorithm (see Thomas, 1993). Finally, the Or are drawn independently from a multivariate normal distribution with mean Or and variance E r approximating the distribution in (11.7). These three steps are repeated five times producing five sets of imputation values for all sampled respondents.\n11.4 INFERENCES ABOUT PROFICIENCIES\nWhen survey variables are observed without error from every respondent, usual variance estimators quantify the uncertainty associated with sample statistics from the only source of uncertainty, namely the sampling of respondents. Item-level statistics for NAEP cognitive items meet this requirement, but proficiency values do not. The IRT models used in their construction posit an unobservable proficiency variable 0 to summarize performance on the items in the subarea. The fact that 0 values are not observed even for the respondents in the sample requires additional statistical analyses to draw inferences about 0 distributions and to quantify the uncertainty associated with those inferences. As described above, Rubin's (1987) multiple imputations procedures were adapted to the context of latent variable models to produce the plausible values upon which many analyses of the data from the 1996 assessment were based. This section describes how plausible values were employed in subsequent analyses to yield inferences about population and subpopulation distributions of proficiencies.\n11.4.1 Computational Procedures\nEven though one does not observe the 0 value of respondent r, one does observe variables that are related to it: xr, the respondent's answers to the cognitive items he or she was administered in the area of interest, and yr, the respondent's answers to demographic and background variables. Suppose one wishes to draw inferences about a number T(0 Y) that could be calculated explicitly if the 0 and y values\n246\n2 72\n\n\fof each member of the population were known. Suppose further that if 0 values were observable, we\n\nwould be able to estimate T from a sample of N pairs of 0 and y values by the statistic t(6 y) [where\n\n(0 Y) (001,...,ON,y0], and respondents by the function\n\nthat we could estimate the variance in t (Jay). Given that observations consist\n\naround T due to sampling of (xra,) rather than (0,,y,),\n\nwe\n\ncan\n\napproximate t by its expected value conditional on (x,y), or\n\nt* (s,y) = E[t(Ety)lx,y] = ft(y) p(0 dO .\n\nIt is possible to approximate t* with random draws from the conditional distributions p(Oilxbyi), which are obtained for all respondents by the method described in Section 11.3.3. Letbm be the mth such vector of plausible values, consisting of a multidimensional value for the latent variable of each respondent. This vector is a plausible representation of what the true 0 vector might have been, had we been able to observe it.\nThe following steps describe how an estimate of a scalar statistic t(,y) and its sampling variance can be obtained from M (>1) such sets of plausible values. (Five sets of plausible values are used in NAEP analyses.)\n\n1. Using each set of plausible values Om in turn, evaluate t as if the plausible values were true values of 0. Denote the results im, for m=1,...,M.\n\n2. Using the jackknife variance estimator defined in Chapter 10, compute the estimated sampling variance of 1., denoting the result Um.\n\n3. The final estimate of t is\n\nM t,n m=1 M\n\n4. Compute the average sampling variance over the M sets of plausible values, to approximate uncertainty due to sampling respondents\n\nu* = m u\nm=1\n\n. Compute the variance among the M estimates -i to approximate the betweenimputation variance\n\n(rm *)2\n\nB =\n,n=1\n\n(M 1)\n\n6. The final estimate of the variance of ts is the sum of two components\nV = U*+(1+M-I)B.\n\nIn this equation, (1 -1-114-1)B is the estimate of variance due to the latency of O. Due to the excessive computation that would be required, NAEP analyses did not compute and\n\n247\n273\n\n\faverage jackknife variances over all five sets of plausible values, but only on the first set. Thus, in NAEP reports, U* is approximated by U1.\n11.4.2 Statistical Tests\nThe variance described in Section 11.4.1 is used to make statistical tests comparing NAEP results. This section describes the relationships between these tests and the variance components described above. Chapter 18 contains details of the hypothesis tests used in this assessment.\nSuppose that if 0 values were observed for sampled students, the statistic (t T)/Ull2 would follow a t-distribution with d degrees of freedom. Then the incomplete-data statistic (t* - 7)/17112 is approximately t-distributed, with degrees of freedom (Satterthwaite, 1941; Johnson & Rust, 1993) given by\n1\n=2\nd\nwhere f is the proportion of total variance due to not observing 0 values:\nI =(1+AllB/1/.\nWhen B is small relative to U*, the reference distribution for incomplete-data statistics differs little from the reference distribution for the corresponding complete-data statistics. This is the case with main NAEP reporting variables. If, in addition, d is large, the normal approximation can be used to flag \"significant\" results.\nFor k-dimensional t, such as the k coefficients in a:multiple regression analysis, each Um and U* is a covariance matrix, and B is an average of squares and cross-products rather than simply an average of squares. In this case, the quantity (T-ts)17-1 (T4*), is approximately F distributed, with degrees of freedom equal to k and v, with v defined as above but with a matrix generalization off\nf = (1 +MI ) Trace (BVI)/k .\nBy the same reasoning as used for the normal approximation for scalar t, a chi-square distribution on k degrees of freedom often suffices for multivariate t.\n11.4.3 Biases in Secondary Analyses\nStatistics t* that involve proficiencies in a scaled content area and variables included in the conditioning variables y are consistent estimates of the corresponding population values T. This includes interrelationships among scales within a content area that have been treated in the multivariate manner described above in Section 11.3.3. Statistics involving background variables y that were not conditioned on, or relationships among proficiencies from different content strands or fields, are subject to asymptotic biases whose magnitudes depend on the type of statistic and the strength of the relationships of the nonconditioned background variables to the variables that were conditioned on and to the proficiency of interest. That is, the large sample expectations of certain sample statistics need not equal the true population parameters.\n\n248\n\n7 4\n\n\fThe direction of the bias is typically to underestimate the effect of nonconditioned variables. For details and derivations see Beaton and Johnson (1990), Mislevy (1991), and Mislevy and Sheehan (1987, Section 10.3.5). For a given statistic t* involving one content area and one or more nonconditioned background variables, the magnitude of the bias is related to the extent to which observed responses x account for the latent variable 0, and the degree to which the nonconditioned background variables are explained by conditioning background variables. The first factorconceptually related to test reliabilityacts consistently in that greater measurement precision reduces biases in all secondary analyses. The second factor acts to reduce biases in certain analyses but increase it in others. In\nparticular,\nHigh shared variance between conditioned and nonconditioned background variables\nmitigates biases in analyses that involve only proficiency and nonconditioned\nvariables, such as marginal means or regressions.\nHigh shared variance exacerbates biases in regression coefficients of conditional effects for nonconditioned variables, when nonconditioned and conditioned background variables are analyzed jointly as in multiple regression.\nThe large number of background variables that have been included in the conditioning vectors for the 1996 assessments allows a large number of secondary analyses to be carried out with little or no bias, and mitigates biases in analyses of the marginal distributions of 0 in nonconditioned variables. Kaplan and Nelson's analysis of the 1988 NAEP reading data (some results of which are summarized in Mislevy, 1991), which had a similar design and fewer conditioning variables, indicates that the potential bias for nonconditioned variables in multiple regression analyses is below 10 percent, and biases in simple regression of such variables is below five percent. Additional research (summarized in MiAevy, 1990) indicates that most of the bias reduction obtainable from conditioning on a large number of variables can be captured by instead conditioning on the first several principal components of the matrix of all original conditioning variables. This procedure was adopted for the 1992, 1994, and 1996 main assessments by replacing the conditioning effects by the first K principal components, where K was selected so that 90 percent of the total variance of the full set of conditioning variables (after standardization) was captured. Mislevy (1990) shows that this puts an upper bound of 10 percent on the average bias for all analyses\ninvolving the original conditioning variables.\n\n11.4.4 A Numerical Example\nTo illustrate how plausible values are used in subsequent analyses, this subsection gives some of the steps in the calculation of the 1992 grade 4 reading composite mean and its estimation-error variance. This illustration is an example of the calculation of NAEP means and variances and can be used to understand their calculation for any NAEP assessment.\nThe weighted mean of the first plausible values of the reading composite for the grade 4 students in the sample is 217.79, and the jackknife variance of these values is 0.833. Were these values true 8 values, then 217.79 would be the estimate of the mean and 0.833 would be the estimation-eiror variance. The weighted mean of the second plausible values of the same students, however, is 217.62; the third, fourth, and fifth plausible values give weighted means of 217.74, 218.24, and 218.05. Since all of these figures are based on precisely the same sample of students, the variation among them is due to uncertainty about the students' Os, having observed their item responses and background variables. Consequently, our best estimate of the mean for grade 4 students is the average of the five plausible values: 217.89. Taking the jackknife variance estimate from the first plausible value, 0.833, as our\n\n275\n\n249\n\n\festimate U* of sampling variance, and the variance among the five weighted means, .063, as our estimate B of uncertainty due to not observing 0, we obtain as the final estimate V of total error variance 0.833 + (1+54) .063 = 0.908.\nIt is also possible to partition the estimation error variance of a statistic using these same variance components. The proportion of error variance due to sampling students from the population is Us/V, and the proportion due to the latent nature of 0 is (1+IITI)BIV. The results are shown in Table 11-1. The value of CIV roughly corresponds to reliability in classical test theory and indicates the amount of information about an average individual's 6 present in the observed responses of the individual. It should be recalled again that the objective of NAEP is not to estimate and compare values of individual examinees, the accuracy of which is gauged by reliability coefficients. The objective of NAEP, rather, is to estimate population and subpopulation characteristics, and the marginal estimation methods described above have been designed to do so consistently regardless of the values of reliability coefficients.\n\nTable 11-1\nEstimation Error Variance and Related Coefficients for the 1992 Grade 4 Reading Composite (Based on Five Plausible Values)\n\nU* 0.833\n\n(1i-54)B 0.076\n\nV\n0.908\n\nProportion of Variance Due to...\n\nStudent\n\nSampling:\n\nLatency of 0:\n\nU*/V\n\n(1+5-1)/3/V\n\n0.92\n\n0.08\n\nChapters 12 through 17 and Appendix E provide values of the proportion of variance due to sampling and due to the latent nature of 0 for all 1996 scales and composites for the populations as a whole and, in the appendix, for selected subpopulations. It will be seen that the proportion of variance due to the latency of 6 varies somewhat among subject areas, tending to be largest for the long-term trend\nwriting assessment, where there is low correlation between tasks and each student responded to only one\nor at most two tasks. The proportion of variance due to latency of 0 is smallest for the composites of the main assessment subjects, where the number of items per student is largest. Essentially, the variance due\nto the latent nature of 0 is largest when there is less information about a student's proficiency. (Note the distinction between estimation error variance of a parameter estimate and the estimate of the variance of the 0 distribution. The former depends on the accuracy of measurement; the large-sample model-based expected value of the latter does not.) Given fixed assessment time, this decrease in information will\noccur whenever the amount of information per unit time decreases as can happen when many short\nconstructed-response or multiple-choice items are replaced by a few extended constructed-response items.\n\n11.5 DESCRIBING STUDENT PERFORMANCE\nSince its beginning, a goal of NAEP has been to inform the public about what students in American schools know and can do. While the NAEP scales provide information about the distributions of proficiency for the various subpopulations, they do not directly provide information about the meaning of various points on the scale. Traditionally, meaning has been attached to educational scales by normreferencingthat is, by comparing students at a particular scale level to other students. In contrast, NAEP achievement levels and scale anchors describe selected points on the scale in terms of the types of\n250\nL76\n\n\fskills that are likely to be exhibited by students scoring at that level. The achievement level process was applied to the science composite. Scale anchoring ofcertain percentiles of the student proficiency distribution was applied to the long-term trend assessment composite using the 1996 data. The achievement level process for mathematics was completed for the 1990 assessment when the NAEP mathematics framework was revised, so the results were directly applied to the 1996 results. In addition, each item was mapped to a point on the scale in which it belonged, so that the content of each item provides information about what students at each score level can do in a probabistic sense.\n11.5.1 Achievement Levels\nNAGB has determined that achievement levels shall be the first and primary way of reporting NAEP results. Setting achievement levels is a method forsetting standards on the NAEP assessment that identify what students should know and be able to do at various points on the composite. For each grade of each subject, three levels were definedbasic, proficient, and advanced. Based on initial policy definitions of these levels, panelists were asked to determine operational descriptions of the levels appropriate with the content and skills assessed in the assessment. With these descriptions in mind, the panelists were then asked to rate the assessment items in terms of the expected performance of marginally acceptable examinees at-each of these three levels. These ratings were then mapped onto the NAEP scale to obtain the achievement level cutpoints for reporting. Further details of the achievement level-setting process for science appear in Appendix G.\n11.5.2 Performance Descriptions Based on Composite Scales\nA procedure known as scale anchoring was used to develop descriptions of student performance at selected points on the composite scales. The scale points that were selected for anchoring reflect three levels of knowledge and abilities corresponding to lower-, middle-, and higher-performing students for each subject.\nAround each percentile point, a band was built to define a range of scale scores. Students described as being at a particular level were within a five percentile point range on either side of the specified scale point. For example, the 50th percentile was defined as the region between the 45th and 55th percentile points on the scale. A question was identified as anchoring at a percentile point on the scale if.it was answered successfully by at least 65 percent of the students within that percentile band. (The criterion was set at 74 percent for multiple-choice questions to correct for the possibility of answering correctly by guessing.)\nAfter defining the bands of the scale to be anchored, the next step in the process was to identify: (1)' questions answered correctly for dichotomously scored questions, or (2) questions answered at a particular score level for partial credit constructed-response questions. Because the extended constructed-response questions were scored according to four levels of performance, each extended constructed-response question was treated as three distinct questions corresponding to scores of Partial or better, Essential or better, and Extensive. These distinct score levels were then analyzed in the same manner as questions scored dichotomously, as either correct or incorrect. Thus, for example, an extended constructed-response question might anchor at the 50th percentile for Partial or better responses and at the 90th percentile for Essential or better responses.\nA committee of subject area experts, including teachers for the grades involved, college professors, state curriculum supervisors, and researchers, was assembled to review the sets of questions\n251\n277\n\n\fidentified for each percentile band. The committee was divided into three groups, one for each grade. Each group examined and analyzed questions that anchored at the 25th, 50th, and 90th percentiles to determine the specific knowledge and abilities associated with each question.\nCommittee members were also provided with the sets of questions at each grade that \"did not anchor\" to inform their decisions about what students could do by seeing examples of what they could not do. Drawing on their knowledge of the subject area, committee members were asked to summarize student performance by describing the knowledge, skills, and abilities demonstrated by students in each of the score bands.\nThe performance descriptions are cumulative; that is, the abilities described for the lower performing students are considered to be among the abilities of students performing at higher points on the scale. Therefore, the full description of student's knowledge and abilities in the middle scale band would include those abilities described at the lower band. Similarly, the abilities of students performing at the higher scale band include the abilities described for students at the middle and lower bands.\n11.5.3 Item Mapping Procedures\nIn order to map items (questions) to particular points on each subject area scale, a response probability convention had to be adopted that would divide those who had a higher probability of success from those who had a lower probability. Establishing a response probability convention has an impact on the mapping of assessment items onto the scales. A lower boundary convention maps the items at lower points along the scales, and a higher boundary convention maps the same items at higher points along the scales. The underlying distribution of skills in the population does not change, but the choice of a response probability convention does have an impact on the proportion of the student population that is reported as \"able to do\" the items on the scales.\nThere is no obvious choice of a point along the probability scale that is clearly superior to any other point. If the convention were set with a boundary at 50 percent, those above the boundary would be more likely to get an item right than get it wrong, while those below that boundary would be more likely to get the item wrong than right. While this convention has some intuitive appeal, it was rejected on the grounds that having a 50/50 chance of getting the item right shows an insufficient degree of mastery. If the convention were set with a boundary at 80 percent, students above the criterion would have a high probability of success with an item. However, many of the students below this criterion show some level of achievement that would be ignored by such a stringent criterion. In particular, those in the range between 50 and 80 percent correct would be more likely to get the item right than wrong, yet would not be in the group described as \"able to do\" the item.\nIn a compromise between the 50 percent and the 80 percent conventions, NAEP has adopted two related response probability conventions: 74 percent for multiple-choice items (to correct for the possibility of answering correctly by guessing), and 65 percent for constructed-response items (where guessing is not a factor). These probability conventions were established, in part, based on an intuitive judgment that they would provide the best picture of students' knowledge and skills.\nSome additional support for the dual conventions adopted by NAEP was provided by Huynh (1998, 1994). He examined the IRT information provided by items, according to the IRT model used in scaling NAEP items. Following Bock (1972), Huynh decomposed the item information into that provided by a correct response [Ps, (0) *Is (0)] and that provided by an incorrect response [(1-P (0)) *I (0)]. Huynh showed that the item information provided by a correct response to a constructed-response item is\n252\n- 278\n\n\fmaximized at the point along the scale at which two-thirds of the students get the item correct (for multiple-choice items with four options, information is maximized at the point at which 75 percent get the item correct). Maximizing the item information, I (6), rather than the information provided by a correct response [P (0) * I (6)], would imply an item mapping criterion closer to 50 percent. Maximizing the item information, I (6), takes into account both responses that are correct and those that are incorrect,\nhowever.\n\nFor dichotomously scored items the information function as defined by Birnbaum (1968, p. 463) is defined for the jth item as\n\n(1.7a;)213;0(90[Pi,(190-4\n\nI;(0) =\n\nPil(0k)(1\n\nwhere the notation is the same as that used in Equations (11.1) and (11.2). The item information function was defined by Samejima (1969) in general for polytomously scored items, and has been derived for items scaled by the generalized partial credit model (Muraki, 1993; Donoghue, 1994) as (in a slightly\ndifferent, but equivalent form)\n\n_1\n\n= (l.7ai)2[ yi2Pfi(a)\n\n]\n\ni=o\n\n11.6 OVERVIEW OF THE 1996 NAEP SCALES\nThe following IRT scale-score analyses were carried out for the 1996 NAEP assessment:\nMathematics: Five IRT scales linked back to the 1990 and 1992 main assessment of mathematics and one unidimensional IRT mathematics scale linking 1996 results to results from mathematics assessments in 1973, 1976, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994. The first five scales, along with a composite scale, are associated with the 1996 main assessment, while the unidimensional scale is associated with the 1996 long-term trend assessment.\nScience: Three newly developed IRT scales for the main assessment of science and one unidimensional scale linking 1996 results to results from science assessments in 1969, 1973, 1977, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994. The first three scales, along with a composite scale, are associated with the 1996 main assessment, while the unidimensional scale is associated with the 1996 long-term trend assessment.\nLong-Term Trend Reading: One IRT scale linking 1996 results to results from reading assessments in 1971, 1975, 1979, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994. This\nscale is associated with the 1996 long-term trend assessment.\nLong-Term Trend Writing: One polytomous item scale linking 1996 writing results to the 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 assessments. This scale is associated with the 1996 long-term trend assessment.\n\nDetails follow in Chapters 12 through 17.\n\n279\n\n253\n\n\fChapter 12\nDATA ANALYSIS FOR THE MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT'\nFrank Jenkins, Hua-Hua Chang, and Edward Ku lick Educational Testing Service\n12.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes the analyses performed on the responses to the cognitive and background items in the 1996 mathematics assessment. This chapter focuses on the methods and procedures used to estimate IRT-based scale score distributions for subgroups of students. This includes a wide array of topics, such as the scoring of constructed-response items, classical item characteristics, item responsetheory (IRT) analysis of mathematics scales, and estimation of subgroup means by the imputation of plausible values. The statistical bases of the IRT and plausible values methodology described in this chapter are given in Chapter 11. These analyses led to the results presented in NAEP 1996 Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States (Reese, Miller, Mazzeo, & Dossey, 1997). For a description of the state analyses, see the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Mathematics (Allen, Jenkins, Kulick, & Zelenak, 1997).\nThe student samples that were administered mathematics items in the 1996 national assessment are shown in Table 12-1. (See Chapters 1 and 3 for descriptions of the target populations and the sample design used for the assessment.). These samples were defined only by grade (4, 8, or 12) and not by age of the student. Data from the Math Main samples comprised the spiraled balanced incomplete block (BIB) design. The present chapter contains information about the scaling of data from these samples. The long-term trend analyses are presented in a separate chapter (see Chapter 15). The other samples (MathEstimation, Math-Theme, and Math-Advanced) will be analyzed and presented in separate focus reports. A brief description of the analyses of these samples is presented in Section 12.3. Technical documentation detailing the analyses of the 1996 State Assessment of mathematics is provided in the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Mathematics (Allen, Jenkins, Kulick, & Zelenak, 1997).\nI Frank Jenkins was the primary person responsible for the planning, specifications, and coordination of the national mathematics analyses. He was assisted by Hua-Hua Chang. Data analysis and scaling were coordinated by Ed Kulick with help from Steve Wang and Xiaohui Wang and additional assistance from David Freund.\n255\n280\n\n\fTable 12-1 NAEP 1996 Mathematics Student Samples\n\nSample\n\nBooklet\n\nCohort\n\nNumber Mode Assessed\n\nTime of Testing'\n\n4 [Math Main] 8 [Math Main] 12 [Math Main]\n\n1-26 Print Grade 4 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1-26 Print Grade 8 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1-26 Print Grade 12 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\n4 [Math-Estimation]\n\n127\n\nTape Grade 4 1/3/96 - 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\n8 [Math-Estimation]\n\n127\n\nTape Grade 8 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\n12 [Math-Estimation]\n\n127\n\nTape Grade 12 1/3/96 - 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\n4 [Math-Theme] 8 [Math-Theme] 12 [Math-Theme]\n\n128,129 128,129 128,129\n\nPrint Print Print\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\n1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1/3/96 - 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\n8 [Math-Advanced] 12 [Math-Advanced]\n\n130\n\nPrint\n\n130\n\nPrint\n\nFinal makeup sessions were held April 1-5, 1996.\n\nGrade 8 Grade 12\n\n1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\nLEGEND:\n\nMath Main Estimation Advanced\n\nMathematics Main spiral BIB assessment Main estimation assessment Assessment with advanced booklets\n\nPrint Printed administration Tape Audiotape administration Theme Assessment with theme booklets\n\nNumber Assessed\n6,627 7,146 6,904\n2,023 2,183 1,849\n3,790 4,027 3,735\n2,337 2,965\n\n12.2 DESCRIPTION OF STUDENT SAMPLE, ITEMS, AND ASSESSMENT BOOKLETS\nThe data from the main BIB mathematics assessment (from samples 4[Math Main], 8 [Math Main], and 12[Math Main]) were used for main analyses comparing the levels of mathematics achievement for various subgroups of the 1996 target populations. In previous assessments the mathematics samples were defined as age/grade cohorts (e.g., students who were either in the fourth grade or 9 years old). Starting with the 1996 assessment, cohorts were defined solely by grade. The sampled students in each of these three grade cohorts were assessed in the winter. The samples in thern main assessment are presented in Table 12-1.\nThe pool of items used in the 1996 mathematics assessment contained a range of constructedresponse and multiple-choice questions measuring performance on sets of objectives (National Assessment Governing Board, 1994). The framework for the objectives is.described in Chapter 2. A total of 360 distinct mathematics items addressing these objectives were scaled (see Table 12-2). The number of items per grade was 144, 164, and 165 respectively for grades 4, 8, and 12 (before scaling). Tables 123, 12-5, and 12-7 give, for each grade, the numbers of items by item type and block (before scaling). For item counts after scaling, taking into account items that were dropped or collapsed, see Tables 12-4, 126, and 12-8. These tables indicate that there was a nearly fourfold increase in the number of polytomously-scored constructed-response items over the numbers presented in the 1992 assessment. In 1996, the number of items was 30 in grade 4, 30 in grade 8, and 33 in grade 12. The items were classified\n256\n`,2 8 1\n\n\finto five content strands: numbers and operations; measurement; geometry; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and algebra and functions. These five content strands (renamed number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and\nalgebra' and functions in the 1996 analysis) constituted the scales used in 1996 reporting.2 The items wer6 partitioned into 13 blocks and these blocks were then assigned to 26 booklets according to a BIB design. Each booklet contained relatively few items from each of the five categories.\n\nGrade(s)\n4 only 8 only 12 only 4 and 8 8 and 12 4 and 12 4, 8, and 12 Total Grade 4 Total Grade 8 Total Grade 12 Total\n\nTable 12-2 National Main BIB: Numbers of Scaled Mathematics Items\nCommon Across Grade Levels, by Content Strand Scale\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations Measurement\n\nGeometry and\nSpatial Sense\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\n\n40\n\n20\n\n12\n\n11\n\n20\n\n13\n\n12\n\n10\n\n23\n\n11\n\n17\n\n22\n\n10\n\n2\n\n9\n\n3\n\n8\n\n9\n\n6\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n59\n\n25\n\n25\n\n17\n\n47\n\n27\n\n31\n\n25\n\n40\n\n23\n\n27\n\n34\n\n110\n\n58\n\n60\n\n58\n\nAlgebra and\nFunctions\n8 18\n32 7 6 0\n3 18\n34 41 74\n\nTotal\n91\n73 105\n31 38\n0 22 144\n164 165 360\n\nIn the main samples, each student was administered a booklet containing three blocks of mathematics cognitive items, a block of background questions common to all booklets for a particular grade level, and a block of mathematics-related background questions common to all mathematics booklets for a particular grade level. At the end of each booklet there was a short block consisting of five questions concerning the student's motivation and his or her perception of the difficulty of the cognitive items. The BIB design by which the 13 blocks of mathematics cognitive items were assigned to the 26 booklets for each grade level is discussed in Chapter 4. The 13 blocks were not intended to be parallel measuring instruments. For example, several blocks contained only the items designed for calculator usage, and some blocks contained items for ruler and protractor usage. In addition, the proportion of items sampled from the five categories were not exactly the same among the 13 blocks.\nThe 360 unique items were constructed according to several formats, some traditionatand some more innovative: multiple-choice items, constructed-response items scored dichotomously, constructedresponse items scored polytomously, and cluster items.3 The multiple-choice items conformed to the familiar format of a stem followed by several possible answers, with only one answer being correct.\n2 The content stran'd number sense, properties, and operations was called numbers and operations in the 1990 and 1992 assessments. The content strand geometry and spatial sense was called geometry in the 1990 and 1992 assessments. 3 A cluster item is an aggregation of a group of items (in the case of NAEP mathematics, typically three to five items) that are related to a single content strand, topic, or stimulus, and are developed and scored as a single unit (see Wainer & Kiely, 1987, for further details and examples of different types of cluster items).\n257\n2 2\n\n\fConstructed-response items that were scored dichotomously were questions that required an open-ended response (e.g., explaining why the previous question was answered as it was). These questions were read by raters who determined whether or not the response was correct. Constructed-response items that were scored.polytomously were open-ended questions that required several stages of reasoning or problem solving. They were also read by raters but were given a score reflecting degree of correctness rather than simply judged right or wrong. Cluster items were derived from a set of three to five multiple-choice items that related to the same basic stem. The cluster score was the number of constituent cluster items that the respondent answered correctly.\nAs Table 12-3 indicates, of the 144 items at grade 4, 79 were multiple-choice items, 16 were constructed response items that were scored dichotomously, 48 were constructed-response items that were scored polytomously, and 1 was a cluster item. As shown in Table 12-5, of 163 items at grade 8, 91 were multiple-choice items, 21 were constructed-response items that were scored dichotomously, 48 were constructed-response items that were scored polytomously, and 3 were cluster items. For grade 12, Table 12-7 indicates that of the 166 items administered, 92 were multiple-choice items, 21 were constructed-response items that were scored dichotomously, 50 were constructed-response items that were scored polytomously, and 3 were cluster items.\nTables 12-4, 12-6, and 12-8 show comparable information for each grade after the scaling was carried out.\n\nTable 12-3 1996 NAEP

NAEP assessmentestimation, theme, and advanced studies. The block structure of the special study booklets is provided only in Table 12-9. The estimation and the two theme blocks have a linking BIB block, M4, in-the first position. This structure held for all three grades, but the actual items in the blocks varied over grades. In addition to the cognitive blocks, each of the special study booklets included three blocks in common with the main assessment:\na general student background block (BM1), a mathematics background block (MB1), and a motivation block (M2).\n\nTable 12-9 Block Structure of the Special Study Booklets\n\nStudy\n\nBooklet Cognitive Blocks\n\nEstimation\n\n- 127\n\nTheme\n\n128\n\nTheme\n\n129\n\nAdvanced Mathematics' 130\n\nGrades 8 and 12 only\n\nM4, M16, M17 M4, M21 M4, M22 M20, M18, M19\n\n261\n286\n\n\fThe cognitive portion of the estimation booklet was administered in two sections: first there was a regular mathematics block in common with the main assessment that was self-paced; and second, there were two estimation blocks (M16 and M17) in which items were administered by a paced audio tape. The theme and advanced booklets were self-paced. Note that the theme booklets contained a single non-theme block (M4) in common with the main assessment.\nThe special studies were not part of the main assessment; analysis for these booklets will appear in separate focus reports. The major findings for these studies will be derived from an analysis of the 'reporting' samples, which are subsamples of the assessment's total sample. The nonreporting segments of the total samples were added to the assessments in order to study the effects of changing inclusion rules and accommodations for students of limited English proficiency (LEP) and students with disabilities (SD) (See Section 12.4).\nThe estimation and theme samples were drawn from the same population as the main assessment. The grades 8 and 12 advanced booklets were drawn from a population of students considered to be high mathematics achievers. Students for the grade 8 study of advanced mathematics were sampled from a population of students who were enrolled in an advanced class (defined as algebra 1 or beyond) during the 1995-96 school year. For grade 12, the advanced study students were also sampled from a population of students who took an advanced course during the school year. Grade 12 advanced courses were; Algebra 3, Pre-calculus, Calculus and Analytical Geometry, Calculus, and AP Calculus. Table 12-10 lists the number of items in the special assessment blocks in the three grades. More detail is available in the procedural appendices of reports on the estimation, theme and advanced analyses.\n\nTable 12-10 Number of Cognitive Items in the 1996 Special Mathematics Assessment Blocks\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12\n\nEstimation Blocks\nM16 M17\n\n20\n\n14\n\n22\n\n16\n\n22\n\n16\n\nTheme Blocks M21 M22\n\n8\n\n6\n\n12\n\n15\n\n11\n\n7\n\nAdvanced Blocks\n1M20 M18 M19 1 _,\n\n13\n\n10\n\n12\n\n15\n\n11\n\n11\n\nI There were no advanced blocks administered to grade 4 students.\n\n12.4 ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF CHANGING INCLUSION CRITERION AND ACCOMMODATIONS FOR SD/LEP STUDENTS\nNAEP samples include SD/LEP students in at least the same percentages in which they are found in the general school population. Although a substantial percentage of these students are included in the assessment, schools are allowed to exclude some of these students from NAEP when the students are judged to be incapable of meaningfully participating in a large scale assessment. To facilitate the consistent implementation of NAEP's intention to include as many students as possible, NAEP provides specific criteria that staff in sampled schools can use to determine who should be included in the assessment.\n\n262\n\n\fIn the 1996 assessment, procedures for dealing with SD and LEP students were modified, based on recommendations from the U.S. Department of Education. First, inclusion criteria were revised with the intention of making them clearer, more inclusive, and more likely to be applied consistently across schools. Second, a variety of assessment accommodations and adaptations were offered to\nstudents with disabilities whose individualized education programs (IEPs) specified such accommodations, and LEP students who were unable to take the assessment in English.\nIn order to assess the impact of new inclusion criteria and accommodations, a three-sample design was instituted at all three grades. The first sample comprised students who were subject to the 1994 inclusion rules and, as was the case in past NAEP assessments, were offered no accommodations. Students in the second sample were subject to the 1996 inclusion rules but the SD/LEP students were offered no accommodations. The third sample had students who were comprised students who were assessed under conditions that will probably be used for future NAEP assessmentsnew inclusion rules and some accommodations being offered to the included SD/LEP students. See Chapter 3, Sections 3.4 to 3.8, for more details.\nResults of this study can be found in the focus report dealing with the comparison of the three accommodation samples.\n12.5 ITEM ANALYSIS\nThis section contains a detailed description of the item analysis performed using the national main BM sample data. The analysis examines items within blocks. In preparation for this analysis, constructed-response items with more than two categories and cluster items were polytomously scored, two-category constructed-response items were dichotomously scored, and derived background variables were calculated. Item statistics such as mean percent correct, average score, item to total score correlations and percent responding in each item category were calculated.\nTables 12-11, 12-12, and 12-13 show the number of items, mean proportion correct, mean item to total score correlation, and alpha reliability for each block administered at each grade level for the main assessment. These values were calculated within block only for those items used in the scaling process. The table also gives the number of students who were administered the block and the percent not reaching the last item in the block. Student weights were used, except for reporting the sample sizes. The results for the blocks administered at each grade level indicated that the blocks differ in number of items, average difficulty, reliability, and percent not reaching the last item.\nTables 12-11 through 12-13 show the item analyses by block position within a booklet. Each booklet had three cognitive blocks, and each block appeared in three different bookletsonce in the first, once in the second, and once in the third position. In some past assessments (e.g., 1992 science), students responded differently to the items depending on the block position. The IA tables evidence few systematic differences in item summary statistics as a function of block position. For grade 4 (Table 1211) the weighted average item score had a slight tendency to be higher when a block was in the first rather than the third position. For grades 8 and 12 no systematic difference can be seen.\n\n288\n\n263\n\n\fTable 12-11 Descriptive Statistics for Item Blocks by Position Within Test Booklet and Overall Occurrences for the

block (not-reached) and missing responses prior to the last completed response (omitted). Not-reached items are those occurring after the last item the student completed in a block. Items that were not reached are treated as if they had not been presented to the examinee, while omitted items are regarded as incorrect. The proportion of students attempting the last item of a block (or, equivalently, 1 minus the proportion not reaching the last item) is often used as an index of the degree of speededness of the block of items.\nStandard practice at ETS is to treat all students who did not respond to the last item as if they had not reached that item. For multiple-choice and short constructed-response items, this convention produced a reasonable pattern of results, in that the proportion of students reaching the last item does not differ markedly from the proportion attempting the next-to-last item. However, for the blocks that ended with extended constructed-response items, this convention resulted in an implausibly large drop in the number of students attempting the final item (see Koretz et al., 1993). Therefore, for blocks that ended with an extended constructed-response item, students who attempted the next-to-last item but did not respond to the last item were classified as having intentionally omitted that item.\nTables 12-11 to 12-13 also contain information about the effect of the position of blocks within booklets on the average percent correct for items within eachblock presented to the BM samples for each grade. The averages for the grade-only portion of the focused-BIB samples show that the order of blocks within booklets did not have a large or consistent effect on scale scores in the mathematics focused-BIB assessment.\n12.5.1 Constructed-Response Items\nAs indicated in Tables 12-3 to 12-8, over 40 percent of the mathematics items were constructedresponse. Constructed-response items that were scored dichotomously were given a right/wrong scoring. The categories of responses for the items and the number of responses that were rescored for each item are indicated in Appendix I. The percent agreement for the raters and Cohen's Kappa, a reliability estimate appropriate for items that are dichotomized, are also given in the tables. The sample sizes listed in the tables correspond to the samples used in calculating the rater reliability.\nIn general, the rater reliability of the scoring for dichotomized responses was quite high. Cohen's Kappa reliabilities ranged over items from 0.76 to 1.00 for grade 4, from 0.90 to 1.00 for grade 8, and from 0.67 to 1.00 for grade 12.\nChapter 7 discusses the definition of the item ratings and describes the process by which teams of raters scored the constructed-response items. This discussion includes the rating definitions for short and extended constructed-response items as well as the range of interrater reliabilities that occurred. Extended constructed-response items were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 to reflect degrees of knowledge. In scaling, this scale is shifted to 0 to 4. Rating information on extended constructed-response items can be found in Appendix I, which lists the sample sizes, percent agreement, and Cohen's Kappa reliability index.\n\n295\n\n267\n\n\f12.5.2 Differential Item Function Analysis\nA differential item functioning (DIF) analysis of the main-assessment mathematics items was done in order to guide committees in identifying biased items that should be examined more closely for possible bias. Sample sizes were large enough to compare male and female students, White and Black students, and White and Hispanic students.\nThe DIF analyses of the dichotomous items were based on the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square procedure, as adapted by Holland and Thayer (1988), which is described in Chapter 9. The procedure tests the statistical hypothesis that the odds of correctly answering an item are the same for two groups of examinees that have been matched on some measure of mathematics ability (usually referred to as the matching criterion). The DIF analyses of the polytomous items were based on the Mantel procedure (1963) and the Somes (1986) chi-square test (see also Chapter 9). These procedures compare proportions of matched examinees from each group in each polytomous item response category. The groups being compared are often referred to as the focal group (usually a minority or other group of interest, such as Black examinees or female examinees) and the reference group (usually White examinees or male examinees).\nFor each dichotomous item in the assessment, an estimate was produced of the Mantel-Haenszel common-odds ratio, expressed on the ETS delta scale for item difficulty. The estimates indicate the difference between reference group and focal group item difficulties (measured in ETS delta scale units), and typically run between about +3 and -3. Positive values indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group than the reference group after making an adjustment for the overall level of mathematics ability in the two groups. Similarly, negative values indicate items that are differentially harder for the focal group than the reference group. It is common practice at ETS to categorize each item into one of three categories (Peterson, 1988): \"A\" (items exhibiting no DIF), \"B\" (items exhibiting a weak indication of DIF), or \"C\" (items exhibiting a strong indication of DIF). Items in category \"A\" have MantelHaenszel common-odds ratios on the delta scale that do not differ significantly from 0 at the alpha = 0.05 level or are less than 1.0 in absolute value. Category \"C\" items are those with Mantel-Haenszel values that are significantly greater than 1 and larger than 1.5 in absolute magnitude. Other items are categorized as B items. A plus sign (+) indicates that items are differentially easier for the focal group; a minus sign (- ) indicates that items are differentially more difficult for the focal group.\nThe ETS/NAEP DIF procedure for polytomous items incorporates both the MH ordinal procedure and the generalized MH statistic. The summary tables of identified polytomous items contain generalizations of the dichotomous \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" categories namely \"AA,\" \"BB,\" and \"CC\" respectively. Analogous to the dichotomous case, only the \"CC\" items are considered to have a strong indication of DIF and are flagged for scrutiny by the subject matter committee\nFor each block of items at each grade four DIF comparisons were made: male/female, White/Asian American, White/Black, and White/Hispanic. The first subgroup in each comparison is the reference group; the second subgroup is the focal group.\nFollowing standard practice at ETS for DIF analyses conducted on final test forms, all \"C\" and \"CC\" items were reviewed by a committee of trained test developers and subject-matter specialists. As indicated by Tables 12-14 and 12-15, two dichotomous items and five polytomous items met the criteria to be considered by the DIF committee. Such committees are charged with making judgments about whether or not the differential difficulty of an item is unfairly related to group membership. See Appendix J for a list of the \"C\" and \"CC\" items.\n268\n9 G\n\n\fThe committee assembled to review NAEP items included both ETS staff and outside members with expertise in the field. It was the committee's judgment that none of the \"C\" or \"CC\" items for the national data were functioning differentially due to factors irrelevant to test objectives. In other words, all of the items that were classified as \"C\" or \"CC\" items measured concepts in the assessment framework and specifications that could not be measured in another way. Hence, none of the items were removed\nfrom scaling due to differential item functioning.\n\nTable 12-14 DIF Category by Grade for Dichotomous Items\n\nGrade\n\nDIF CategorYI\n\nMale/Female\n\nAnalysis White/Black White/Hispanic\n\n4\n\nC-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\nA-\n\n11\n\n9\n\n10\n\nA+\n\n7\n\n5\n\n9\n\nB+\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\nC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nC-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB-\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nA-\n\n13\n\n7\n\n13\n\nA+\n\n9\n\n15\n\n8\n\nB+\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\nC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n12\n\nC-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB-\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\nA-\n\n14\n\n8\n\n11\n\nA+\n\n5\n\n12\n\n10\n\nB+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nC+\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPositive values of the index indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group (female, Black, or Hispanic students) than for the reference groups (male or White students). \"A+\" or \"A-\"\nmeans no indication of DIF, \"B+\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the focal group, \"B-\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the reference group and \"C+\" or \"C-\" means a strong\n\nindication of DIF.\n\n297\n\n269\n\n\fTable 12-15 DIF Category by Grade for Polytomous Items\n\nGrade\n\nDIF Category'\n\nMale/Female\n\nAnalysis White/Black\n\nWhite/Hispanic\n\n4\n\nCC-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nBB-\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nAA-\n\n13\n\n14\n\n12\n\nAA+\n\n10\n\n11\n\n15\n\nBB+\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\nCC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\nCC-\n\n'0\n\n3\n\n1\n\nBB-\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\nAA-\n\n10\n\n14\n\n13\n\nAA+\n\n16\n\n7\n\n10\n\nBB+\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n12\n\nCC-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nBB-\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\nAA-\n\n9\n\n14\n\n15\n\nAA+\n\n18\n\n10\n\n12\n\nBB+\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nCC+\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nPositive values of the index indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group (female, Black, or Hispanic students) than for the reference groups (male or White students). \"A+\" or \"A-\"\n\nmeans no indication of DIF, \"B+\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the focal group, \"B-\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the reference group and \"C+\" or \"C-\" means a strong indication of DIF.\n\n12.5.3 Estimation of Item Parameters\nThe BILOG/PARSCALE computer program was used to estimate the item parameters for the main assessment and for the special estimation study. For dichotomous multiple-choice and dichotomized constructed-response items, a three-parameter IRT model was used. Extended constructed-response and cluster items were polytomously scored and were analyzed with a generalized partial credit model (Muraki, 1992).\nRecall from section 12.5 that for calibration, items that were missing prior to the last completed item in a block were considered omitted and scored as wrong. Also, items that were not reached were treated as if they were not presented to the examinees (and not counted as wrong.) However, there is an exception for blocks that end with an extended constructed-response item. In these blocks, students who respond to the next-to-last item but do not respond to the last item are classified as having omitted the last item (i.e., the last item is counted as wrong). Responses to extended constructed-response items that were off-task were also treated as omitted. The multi-category constructed-response items had two, three, four or five categories of partial credit. Scoring levels were labeled as listed in Table 12-16.\n\n270\n9 3\n\n\fScore 4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nTable 12-16 Labels for Score Levels of Polytomous Items\n\n3-Category Item\n\n4-Category Item\n\nCorrect 2\"d Category Incorrect, off-task, or omitted\n\nCorrect 3rd Category 2\"d Category Incorrect, off-task, or omitted\n\n5-Category Item Correct\n4th Category 3rd Category 2\"d Category Incorrect, off-task, or omitted\n\nNote that the categories falling between \"incorrect\" and \"correct\" represent increasing levels of a partially correct response.\nThe item parameter estimation was done separately, within grade, but the final mathematics scale estimates were transformed to conform with the cross-grade scales of the 1990 and 1992 assessments. Within each grade, items were scaled using the grade-only sample of students available from the 1992 and the 1996 assessments. The 1992 data were included at the scaling step of the analysis to assure that parameter estimates for items administered at both time points would not drift drastically between assessments. Item parameters were estimated separately for each of the five content strands and the mathematics scale means and variances for samples from the two assessment years were allowed to be different. In the final BlLOG/PARSCALE run, the prior distributions of the population abilities were free to be estimated and the overall distribution was centered at zero. In general, if an item was common to both assessment years, identical item parameters were used for both assessments. The appropriateness of the use of the identical parameters across assessments was examined by comparing the fit of the empirical item response functions against the estimated IRT item response functions. If lIZT parameters did not fit the data, parameters specific to the assessment year were used. (See Chapter 11 for further descriptions of the scaling process.) The calibration was based on student weights that were rescaled so that the their sum equaled the unweighted sample size of the 1996 sample. Also, weights for the 1992 data were restandardized to give equal weight to the two assessment years included in the scaling (see Appendix K).\nItems that received special treatment in the scaling procedure are listed in Table 12-17, along with the reason for special treatment. Items were dropped, combined into clusters, split between assessment years and collapsed. If items had empirical item response functions that were nonmonotonic, they were dropped. If several items had highly correlated responses (conditional on theta) they were combined into a single polytomous item called a cluster item. If items were administered in both 1992 and 1996 but showed evidence of having a distinct item response functions for each assessment year, the item is treated as two separate items and parameters estimated separately for each assessment year. If polytomous items had sparse or nonmonotonic responses in one or more categories, the items were collapsed so that some response categories were combined into a single category. Only about ten percent of the total scaled items were given special treatment.\n\n299\n\n271\n\n\fTable 12-17 Items from the 1996 Assessment in Mathematics Receiving Special

of estimating an IRT model, individual items were evaluated to determine how well the item response model fit the data. This was done by visual inspection of plots comparing empirically based and theoretical item response functions. Specifically, for dichotomous items these plots consisted of nonmodel-based estimates of the expected proportion correct for each level of mathematics ability compared to the proportion correct for each level of mathematics ability as predicted by the theoretical item response function. For polytomous extended constructed-response items, similar plots were produced for each item category response function (see Chapter 9 for a fuller explanation of these plots).\nIn making decisions about excluding items from the final scales, a balance was sought between being too stringent, hence deleting too many items and possibly damaging the content representativeness of the pool of scaled items, and being too lenient, hence including items with model fit poor enough to endanger the types of model-based inferences made from NAEP results. Items that clearly did not fit the\n274\n3 ,2\n\n\fmodel were not included in the final scales; however, a certain degree of misfit was tolerated for a number of items included in the final scales.\nFor most items, the model fit well. In a few cases, poor fit with the data led.to special treatment or deletion of the item. Figures 12-1, 12-4, 12-5 and 12-6 give item response plots of dichotomous items. In the plots, the x-axis depicts scale score, and the y-axis the probability of a correct response. The solid line is the logistic model prediction, and the symbols (usually a circle or diamond) are the nonmodelbased predicted proportions. The size of the symbols are proportional to the estimated number of students at a particular scale score level. The symbols are ordinarily larger in the middle of the theta scale, where most students' scale scores fall. The item parameter values are also included in the plot.\nItem response plots for polytomously scored items are given in Figures 12-2, 12-3, 12-7, and 12-8. These are similar to the plots for dichotomous items except that there are several solid lines, one for each item category, with each line indicating the probability of responding in the respective item category. As before, the circles or diamonds indicate the empirical response function, with the size of the circles and diamonds proportional to the.estimated number of students at a scale score level.\nIn the plots good fit of the model to the data is indicated when the model-based functions (solid lines) coincide with the empirical functions (circles, diamonds, or other symbols).When the empirical plot is far away from the model based line, there is poor fit of the model to the data.\nFour examples of fit are illustrated. First there is good model fit which is shown by Figure 12-1 for a dichotomous item and Figure 12-2 for a polytomous item. In both cases empirical and theoretical lines coincide.\nSecond is an example of an item that displayed non-logistic empirical functions and was dropped. Figure 12-3 shows a polytomous item that was dropped from the assessment.\nThird is an example of an item that changed function from one assess year to another. Figure 124 shows that the empirical item functions for two assessment years (diamonds for 1992 and circles for 1996) are distinctly different. Figures 12-5 and 12-6 show the result of estimating item parameters separately for the two years. This 'splitting' of the item across years results in quite good fit for each year.\nThe fourth example is of a poor fitting polytomous item that was modified by collapsing categories. Figure 12-7 shows a 5-category item which evidences poor fit mostly in the upper category, due in large part to a low number of respondents, As a result, the upper two categories were collapsed resulting in a 4-category item which, as Figure 12-8 illustrates, fits satisfactorily.\n\n3 3\n\n275\n\n\fNAEP ID: M017901\n\nFigure 12-1 Dichotomous Item Exhibiting Good Model Fit*\nSEQUENCE: 009\n\nSCALE: MUN&OPER\n\nCD\n\nCD CD LO CD\n\na = 1.3859\n\nb = -0.6952\n\nc = 0:2650\n\nCD\n\nn alt = 4\n\nCD\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\nTHETA\n\n*Circles (1996 form; the solid\n\ndata) and diamonds (1992 data) indicate estimated conditional probabilities curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a logistic form.\n\nobtained\n\nwithout\n\nassuming\n\na\n\nlogistic\n\n276\n304\n\n\fFigure 12-2 Polytomous Item Exhibiting Good Model Fit*\n\nNAEP ID: M075101\n\nSEQUENCE: 060\n\nSCALE: NUM&OPER\n\n5 CATEGORIES\n\na= b=\ndl =\nd2 = d3 = d4 =\n\n0.5634 0.6933 1.9463 -0.3616 -1.0074 -0.5773\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0)\n\n0.0 THETA\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\n*Circles indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtaiwneithdout assuming a model-based form; the solid curves indicate estimated item response function assuming a model-bfoarsme.d\n\n277\n3C.5\n\n\fFigure 12-3 Polytomous Item Exhibiting Bad Model Fit That\nWas Deleted from the Assessment*\n\nNAEP ID: M073401\n\nSEOUENCE: 050\n\nSCALE: MUN&OPER\n\n-44.03\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1..0\n\n0.0\n\nTHETA\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\n*Circles indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a model-based form; the solid curves indicate estimated item response function assuming a model-based form.\n\n278\n3 C. 6\n\n\fFigure 12-4 Dichotomous Item Exhibiting Different Empirical Item Functions for Different Assessment Years*\n\nNAEP ID: M018901\nCD\n\nSCALE: DATA.ANL\n\nCD\n\nCD\n\n0CO\n\n0\n\nCD\n\nCD\ng c P Q4V\n\na = 0.7685 b = 1.9216 c = 0.1707\nn alt = 5\n\nCD\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\nTHETA\n\n*Diamonds represent 1992 data; circles represent 1996 data.

They were used for two purposes: as conditioning variables and as reporting variables used to define subgroups. Some of these variables are common to all the subject areas; others are specific to the 1996 mathematics assessment. Derived variables used for conditioning and reporting are described in Appendix C.\n\n311\n\n283\n\n\f12.5.6 Generation of Plausible Values\n\nFor the entire sample, multivariate plausible values for content strand scales were generated for each grade group separately using the multivariate conditioning program CGROUP as revised by Thomas (1993). As with the scaling, student weights were used at this stage of the analysis. Instead of using selected background variables for conditioning variables (as had been done prior to the 1990 assessment), principal components of the background variables were used. The principal components used accounted for 90 percent of the variance of the original conditioning variables. Principal components were employed to remedy problems of extreme collinearity among some of the original conditioning variables.\nResearch based on data from the 1990 Trial State Assessment in mathematics suggests that results obtained using the 90 percent subset of components will differ only slightly from those obtained using the full set (Mazzeo, Johnson, Bowker, & Fong, 1992). Table 12-18 lists the number of principal components included in conditioning, as well as the proportion of variance accounted for by the conditioning model for each grade.\n\nTable 12-18 Proportion of Scale Score Variance Accounted for by the Conditioning Model\nfor the Mathematics Main Assessment\n\nNumber of Number of\nConditioning Principal Grade Contrasts Components\n\n4\n\n895\n\n321\n\n8\n\n1,027\n\n362\n\n12\n\n812\n\n314\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations\n.70\n.71\n.76\n\nProportion of Scale Score Variance\n\nData\n\nGeometry Analysis,\n\nand Statistics,\n\nSpatial\n\nand\n\nMeasurement Sense Probability\n\n.71\n\n.61\n\n.75\n\nAlgebra and\nFunctions\n.69\n\n.75\n\n.68\n\n.77\n\n.73\n\n.79\n\n.81\n\n.70\n\n.83\n\nThe codings of the original mathematics-specific conditioning variables, before principal components were calculated, are presented in Appendix C. The CGROUP program estimates distributions of scale scores by combining information from item responses of individuals and information from linear regression of scale score on conditioning variables. For each individual, five plausible values are randomly drawn from their predictive conditional distribution.\nThe proportion of variance of each original conditioning variable accounted for by the principal components included in the conditioning model is listed in Appendix F. The estimated conditioning effects for the principal components of the three samples defined by the three grade groups are also given in Appendix C. The values of the conditioning effects are expressed in the metrics of the original calibration scale. Definitions of derived conditioning variables are given in Appendix B.\n\n284\n31\n\n\f12.5.7 The Transformation of the Mathematics Calibration Scale for Reporting and the Formation of the Composite Scale\nLike all IRT scales, the mathematics content strand scales have a linear indeterminacy that may be resolved by an arbitrary choice of the origin and unit-size in each given content strand. In 1990 the NAEP mathematics data were scaled across grades separately for each scale. The linear indeterminacies among the scales were resolved by transforming the scale means and variances of three grade samples combined together to the 250.5 4, 50.0 metric using a transformation of the form,\n()target = A Ocalibrated B,\nwhere A and B are linear transformation constants.\nAs a result, all of the scales that spanned all three grade samples were on a common scale. By contrast, the 1992 and 1996 data were scaled within grade. It was necessary, therefore, to transform data from both assessments to the 1990 cross-grade scale. This was accomplished first in the 1992 assessment, when the 1992 data were linked to the 1990 scale in a two-stage process. In the next assessment, the 1996 data were linked to the 1992 transformed scale, which in effect put the 1996 data on the 1990 cross-grade scale. The procedure for transforniing the 1996 data will be described below. The similar procedure for transforming the 1992 data was presented in The NAEP 1992 Technical Report (Johnson and Carlson, 1994).\nThe 1996 data were put on the 1992 reporting metric by using a linear transformation that converts the 1996 thetas to the 1992 reporting scale. This linear transformation was created by the following procedure. The 1992 thetas were reconditioned using CGROUP with the 1996 item parameters. This analysis resulted in 1992 scores which were in the 1996 theta metric. We then transformed the new 1992 thetas (in the 1996 metric) to the 1992 reporting metric (in the 1992 metric) by a linear transformation which created scores having the same mean and variance as the 1992 reporting scale. This is a common population equating procedure. The linear constants of this transformation were then used to transform the 1996 thetas to the 1992 reporting metric. The transformation constants used for the five content strand scales and for the estimation scale are given in Table 12-19.\nWhile scores in five content strands provide useful insights into the relationships among subpopulations, a single index to summarize overall performance is a useful tool for a compact overview of subpopulation trends. For that reason, a composite score was defined as a weighted average of the five mathematics content strands. The weight given to each content strand is a direct reflection of the relative testing time intended for that content strand in the assessment, as defined in the Mathematics Framework for the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment Governing Board, 1994). Since the emphasis given to each content strand was different across grades, the weights assigned to each strand in the composite also differed across grades.\nThe function RP, = 250 + 50(0) would have been preferable. Holland and Zwick (1986) have noted that the values actually used correspond to the bi varying from 5.00 to +4.98 in steps of .02 instead of 4.99 to +4.99 as intended. The result is that the RP scores are a half-point higher than appropriate for the hypothetical test.\n285\n313\n\n\fTable 12-19\nCoefficients of the Linear Transformations that Transform the Five Content Strand Scales from the 1996 Calibration Metric to the 1992 Reporting Metric\n\nGrade\n4\n8 12\n\nCoefficient\nB A\nB A\nB\nA\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations\n\nMeasurement\n\n220.32 33.13\n\n226.02 32.22\n\n273.44 35.12\n\n269.33 43.65\n\n300.43 32.48\n\n300.85 35.71\n\nGeometry and Spatial\nSense\n224.70 28.04\n266.83 33.54\n304.67 36.05\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\nProbability\n223.38 30.86\n270.97 41.00\n301.03 34.58\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n223.63 29.47\n271.13 35.52\n303.42 35.95\n\nThe definition of weights for the composite in each grade is given in Table 12-20.

The variance is partitioned into two parts; the proportion of error variance due to sampling students (sampling variance) and the proportion of error variance due to the fact that scale score, 0, is a latent variable that is estimated rather than observed. Table 12-22 contains estimates of the total error variance, the proportion of error variance due to sampling students and the proportion of error variance due to the latent nature of 0 (for stability, the estimates of the between-imputation variance, B, in Equation 11.9). More detailed information by gender and race/ethnicity is presented in Appendix E.\n\nTable 12-22 Estimation Error Variance and Related Coefficients for the Mathematics Main Assessment\n\nGrade\n\nScale\n\nTotal Estimation Error Variance\n\nProportion of Variance Due to...

Variables derived from the questionnaire were used in the conditioning models for the grade 4 and the grade 8 samples, along with a variable that indicated whether a student record had been matched with a teacher record, so that means for subgroups defined by these variables could be compared with no bias. Of the 6,612 fourth-grade students in the main sample, 6,105 (92%) were matched with both parts of the teacher questionnaire and 99 (1.5%) were matched with only the first part of the questionnaire. Of the 7,146 eighthgrade students in the main sample, 6,144 (86%) were matched with both parts of the teacher questionnaire\n287\n315\n\n\fand 49 (less than 1%) were matched with only the first part of the questionnaire. Thus, 92 percent of the\nfourth graders and 86 percent of the eighth graders were matched with at least the background information about their mathematics teachers.\n\n12.5.10 Analysis of Dimensionality\nPlausible values are drawn from the set of five correlated content strands (see Section 12.5.6). For this reason, it is useful to inspect the correlations among the content strands for evidence of multidimensionality. Tables 12-23 and 12-24 give conditional and marginal correlations for the five scales for the three grades. Conditional correlations are analogous to pooled-within groups correlations when the groups are the grouping variables used to condition the data with CGROUP. They are obtained from the error correlations of a CGROUP analysis. The conditional correlations are quite high, averaging .85 for grade 4, .91 for grade 8, and .85 for grade 12. The marginal correlations are the average correlations of the five plausible values of each scale. In this case they average .86 for grade 4, .88 for grade 8, and .87 for grade 12. Although it is of substantive interest to analyze the scales separately, the correlations indicate that they are highly redundant.\n\nTable 12-23 Conditional Correlations from Conditioning (CGROUP)\n\nNumber Sense,\n\nProperties,\n\nand\n\nGrade\n\nScale\n\nOperations Measurement\n\n4 Number Sense, Properties, and\n\nOperations\n\n1.00\n\nMeasurement\n\n.89\n\n1.00\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n.80\n\n.78\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\n\nProbability\n\n96\n\n.90\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n.94\n\n.85\n\n8 Number Sense, Properties, and\n\nOperations\n\n1.00\n\nMeasurement\n\n.92\n\n1.00\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n.79\n\n.92\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\n\nProbability\n\n.96\n\n.95\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n.97\n\n.95\n\n12 Number Sense, Properties, and\n\nOperations\n\n1.00\n\nMeasurement\n\n.96\n\n1.00\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n.90\n\n.94\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\n\nProbability\n\n.84\n\n.80\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n.91\n\n.89\n\nGeometry and\nSpatial Sense\n1.00 .75 .78\n1.00 .86 .84\n1.00 .67 .88\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\n1.00 .89\n1.00 .96\n1.00 .66\n\nAlgebra and\nFunctions\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n\n288\n\n316\n\n\fTable 12-24 Marginal Correlations of Science Scales1\n\nNumber Sense,\n\nProperties,\n\nand\n\nGrade\n\nScale\n\nOperations Measurement\n\n4 Number Sense, Properties, and\n\nOperations\n\n1.00\n\nMeasurement\n\n.89\n\n1.00\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n.84\n\n.83\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\n\nProbability Algebra and Functions\n\n.91\n\n.86\n\n.92\n\n.86\n\n8 Number Sense, Properties, and\n\nOperations\n\n1.00\n\nMeasurement\n\n.89\n\n1.00\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n.84\n\n.89\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\n\nProbability\n\n.91\n\n.89\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n.92\n\n.89\n\n12 Number Sense, Properties, and\n\nOperations\n\n1.00\n\nMeasurement\n\n.90\n\n1.00\n\nGeometry and Spatial Sense\n\n.90\n\n.90\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and\n\nProbability\n\n.88\n\n.86\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n.90\n\n.87\n\nGeometry and\nSpatial Sense\n1.00 .81 .82\n1.00 .85 .86\n1.00\n.81\n.90\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability\n1.00 .86\n1.00 .90\n1.00 .80\n\nAlgebra and\nFunctions\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n\nTabled values were obtained by computing a separate Pearson correlation coefficient for each plausible value, computing Fisher's z-transformation for each value, computing the average of the transformed values, and computing the inverse transformation of the average.\n\n317\n\n289\n\n\fChapter 13\nDATA ANALYSIS FOR THE SCIENCE ASSESSMENT'\nJohn R. Donoghue, Jinming Zhang, Steven P. Isham, Lois H. Worthington, and Ingeborg U. Novatkoski Educational Testing Service\n\n13.1 OVERVIEW\n\nThis chapter describes the analyses performed on the responses to the cognitive and background items in the 1996 assessment of science. These analyses led to the results presented in the NAEP 1996 Science Report Card for the Nation and the States: Findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (O'Sullivan, Reese, & Mazzeo, 1997). The emphasis of this chapter is on the methods and results of procedures used to develop the IRT-based scale scores that formed the basis of these reports. However, some attention is given to the analysis of constructed-response items as reported in the NAEP 1996 Science Report Card for the Nation and the States. The theoretical underpinnings of the IRT and plausible values methodology described in this chapter are given in Chapter 11, and several of the statistics are described in Chapter 9.\n\nFor 1996, the NAEP science assessment framework incorporated a balance of knowledge and skills based on current reform reports, exemplary curriculum guides, and research on the teaching and learning of science. The 1996 assessment included the use of hands-on science tasks and theme blocks as well as considerably more constructed-response items than previous NAEP assessments.\n\nThe student samples that were administered science items in the 1996 assessment are shown in Table 13-1. Chapters 1 and 3 contain descriptions of the target populations and the sample design used for the assessment.\n\nTable 13-1 NAEP 1996 Science Student Samples\n\nSample\n\nBooklet\n\nIDs\n\nMode\n\nNumber\n\nCohort Assessed\n\nTime of Testing'\n\n4 [Science Main] 8 [Science Main] 12 [Science Main] 12 [Sci-Advanced]\n\n201-237 201-237 201-237 238-240\n\nPrint Print Print Print\n\n'Final makeup sessions were held April 1-5, 1996.\n\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 12 Grade 12\n\n1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1/3/96 3/29/96 (Winter) 1/3/96 - 3/29/96 (Winter)\n\nNumber Assessed\n7,305 7,774 7,537 2,431\n\nLEGEND:\nPrint Main Advanced\n\nPrinted administration Main assessment Assessment with advanced booklets\n\nJohn Donoghue was the primary person responsible for the planning, specification, and coordination of the science analyses. He was assisted by Jinming Zhang. Computer activities for all science scaling arid data analyses were directed by Steve Isham and completed by Lois Worthington and Ingeborg Novatkoski. Others contributing to the analysis of science data were David S. Freund, Katharine Pashley, and Norma A. Norris.\n\n291\n- 318\n\n\fThe objectives of the science analyses were to\n* prepare scale values and estimate subgroup proficiency distributions for national . samples of students who were administered science items from the main assessment, and\nO prepare the analysis of the advanced science assessment. The advanced science sample 12[Sci-Advanced] is a separate sample from the 12[Science Main] sample. Analyses of the advanced science assessment will be described in a subsequent NAEP report. The 12[Sci-Advanced] sample is discussed further in section 13-3.\nThe 1996 science samples were analyzed to provide comparisons of science achievement for various subgroups of the 1996 target populations. The target populations were grade 4, grade 8, and grade 12 students in the United States. Unlike previous NAEP assessments, only grade-defined cohorts were assessed in the 1996 NAEP. The age of students was based on a calendar year, with birthdates in 1986, 1982, and 1978, respectively, for ages 9, 13, and 17. The sampled students in each of these three cohorts were assessed in the winter (January to March with final makeup sessions held during the first week of April). As described in Chapter 9, the reporting sample for the national science assessment consisted of students in the S2 sample (also see Chapter 19 for tables describing the students assessed and the reporting sample for each component of the science assessment).\nThe major analysis components are discussed in turn. Some aspects of the analysis, such as procedures for item analysis, scoring of constructed-response items, and methods of scaling, are described in previous chapters and are therefore not detailed here. There were five major steps in the analysis of the science data, each of which is described in a separate section:\n1. conventional item and test analyses, and DIP analyses (Section 13.4); 2. item response theory (IRT) scaling (Section 13.5); 3. estimation of subgroup proficiency distributions based on the \"plausible\nvalues\" methodology (Section 13.6); 4. transforming the 1996 assessment scales to the final reporting metric for each\nof the fields of science, and (Section 13.7.1); and 5. creation of the science composite scale (Section 13.7.2).\nSection 13.8 describes the results of partitioning the error variance, 13.9 discusses the matching of student responses to those of their teachers, and 13.10 provides a brief explanation of sampling weights.\nTo set the context within which to describe the methods and results of scaling procedures, a brief review of the assessment instruments and administration procedures is provided.\n\n13.2 DESCRIPTION OF ITEMS AND ASSESSMENT BOOKLETS\nThe 1996 NAEP main science assessment differed from the long-term trend assessment in regard to the sample age definition, time of testing, the objectives that define the emphasis of the assessment, and most of the items used. It also differed from the 1990 main NAEP science assessment in the same regards. Because of these differences, equating or linking the main and the long-term trend assessments was not appropriate. Neither is a direct comparison to the results of the 1990 main science assessment. The 1996 main science assessment can be used to start a new baseline for measuring trends in the nation.\nThe pool of items used in the 1996 science assessment contained a range of constructed-response and multiple-choice questions measuring performance on sets of objectives. The items in the assessment\n\n292\n\n319\n\n\fwere based on the curriculum framework described in Science Framework for the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment Governing Board, 1993). The total number of scaled items was 136, 190, and 186, respectively, for grades 4, 8, and 12. Note that some items overlap across grade. Each of the items was classified into one of three fields of science: earth science; physical science; and life science. These three fields of science constituted the scales used in 1996 reporting. Table 13-2 shows the numbers of items within content area scales for each grade. The numbers presented in Table 13-2 show item counts both for the original item pool, and after the necessary adjustments were made during scaling (see Section 13.5.2, below).\n\nTable 13-2 Number of Items in Scales in the Science Main Assessment by Field of Science\n\nGrade\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth\nScience\n\nLife Science\n\nTotal\n\n4\n\nPre-Scaling\n\n45\n\n53\n\n47\n\n145\n\nPost-Scaling\n\n43\n\n49\n\n44\n\n136\n\n8\n\nPre-Scaling\n\n63\n\n65\n\n66\n\n194\n\nPost-Scaling\n\n62\n\n63\n\n65\n\n190\n\n12\n\nPre-Scaling\n\n60\n\n64\n\n66\n\n190\n\nPost-Scaling\n\n59\n\n62\n\n65\n\n186\n\nFor each grade, the items were divided into 15 mutually exclusive, separately timed blocks. At grade 4, students were given 20 minutes to complete each block; at grades 8 and 12 each block required 30 minutes. As described in Chapter 2, the blocks were combined into booklets according to a complex spiraling design. (See Chapter 4 for more information about the blocks and booklets.) Each student's booklet contained three blocks of cognitive items. Four of the 15 blocks were hands-on tasks in which students were given a set of equipment and asked to conduct an investigation and answer questions (mostly constructed-response) relating to the investigation. These hands-on tasks were always presented in the last position, after two paper-and-pencil blocks. Three of the remaining 11 blocks were theme blocks. Theme blocks were placed randomly in student booklets, but not in every booklet. No student received more than one theme block. Each theme block was paired with each non-theme paper-and-pencil block just once. Each paper-and-pencil block appeared in the first or second position the same number (3 or 4) of times. For each of the grades, the composition of each block of items, in terms of content and format, is given in Tables 13-3 through 13-5.2 Common labeling of these blocks across grade levels does not denote common items.\n\n2 The numbers in Tables 13-2 through 13-8 differ slightly from those given in Chapter 2. The numbers in Chapter 2 do not reflect the grouping of certain sets of items into cluster items for the purposes of scaling.\n293\n320\n\n\fTable 13-3 1996 NAEP Science Block Composition by Item Type, Grade 4, As Defined Before Scaling\n\nBlock\nS3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10\nS 11\nS12 S13 S14 S15 S20 S21\nTotal\n\nMultipleChoice Items\n0\n1\n2 0 2\n1\n2 6 6 6 6 5 3 6\n5\n51\n\nConstructed-Response Items Scored Polytomously\n\n2-\n\n3-\n\n4-\n\n5-\n\ncategory category category category\n\n1\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\n72\n\n13\n\n3\n\nCluster Items\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTotal Items\n7 7\n8 5\n10 9 9 12 11 15 11 10 9\n11 11\n145\n\nTable 13-4 1996 NAEP Science Block Composition by Item Type, Grade 8, As Defined Before Scaling\n\nBlock\nS3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10\nS 11\nS12 S13 S14 S15 S20 S21 Total\n\nMultipleChoice Items\n0\n3\n0 0 2\n5 3 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 7\n74\n\nConstructed-Response Items Scored Polytomously\n\n2-\n\n3-\n\n4-\n\n5-\n\ncategory category category category\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n2\n\n0\n\n5\n\n95\n\n17\n\n1\n\nCluster Items\n1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1\n0 0 0 2\n\nTotal Items\n6 10\n8 7 12 10 13 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16\n194\n\n294\n\\\n\n\fTable 13-5. 1996 NAEP Science Block Composition by Item Type, Grade 12, As Defined Before Scaling\n\nBlock\nS3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 S10\nSll\nS12 S13 S14 S15 S20 S21 Total\n\nMultipleChoice Items\n0 0 0 0\n5\n6 4\n8 8 8 8 8\n0 7\n8\n70\n\nConstructed-Response Items Scored Polytomously\n\n2-\n\n3-\n\n4-\n\n5-\n\ncategory category category category\n\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n7\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n0\n\n5\n\n85\n\n24\n\n6\n\nCluster Items\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTotal Items\n6 4 8 8 15 13 14 18 16 16 16 16 8 16 16 190\n\nSome items (fewer than 10%) received special treatment during scaling. For each of the grades, Tables 13-6 through 13-8 show the composition of each block after deletions of items and collapsing of categories for polytomously-scored constructed-response items as a result of scaling. If data had poor fit with the response model for an item, the item was deleted. If a constructed-response item was scored in multiple categories but one category had no (or very few) responses, or one of the categories had responses that had poor fit to the response model, that category was combined with other categories (\"collapsed\"). All item deletions and all but one category collapse were performed in the course of scaling the national science assessment data; the remaining collapse was performed based on data in State Assessment, with the same collapse performed for the national scaling. In addition, categories of a small number of items were combined These changes were made so that the scaling model used for these items fit the data more closely, and are described more fully in Section 13.5.\nFor grade 4, each of the 11 paper-and-pencil blocks contained from five to nine constructedresponse items. Seven of these blocks contained one or more constructed-response items scored on a 0-3 scale. Two items were scored on a 0-4 scale. The four hands-on task blocks contained from five to seven constructed-response items and up to two multiple-choice items.\nFor grade 8, each of the 11 paper-and-pencil blocks contained from five to ten constructedresponse items. Eight of these blocks contained one or more constructed-response items scored on a 0-3 scale. One item was scored on a 0-4 scale. The four hands-on task blocks contained from six to eight constructed-response items. One of these blocks also contained three multiple-choice items.\nFor grade 12, each of the 11 paper-and-pencil blocks contained from seven to ten constructedresponse items. Ten of these blocks contained one or more constructed-response items scored on a 0-3 scale. Two items were scored on a 0-4 scale. The four hands-on task blocks contained from four to eight constructed-response items. None of these blocks contained multiple-choice items.\n295\n322\n\n\fTable 13-6 1996 NAEP Science Block Composition by Item Type, Grade 4, As Defined After Scaling*\n\nBlock\n\nMultipleChoice Items\n\nConstructed-Response Items Scored Polytomously\n\n2-\n\n3-\n\n4-\n\n5-\n\ncategory category category category\n\nS3\n\n0\n\nS4\n\n1\n\nS5\n\n2\n\nS6\n\n0\n\nS7\n\n2\n\nS8\n\n1\n\nS9\n\n1\n\nS10\n\n6\n\nS 11\n\n6\n\nS12\n\n6\n\nS13\n\n6\n\nS14\n\n5\n\nS15\n\n3\n\nS20\n\n6\n\nS21\n\n5\n\nTotal\n\n50\n\n1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n13\n\n60\n\n8\n\n3\n\n*Counts reflect items that were dropped and collapsed.\n\nCluster Items\n1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nTotal Items\n6\n7 7\n4\n10 9 8\n11 11 11 11\n10 9\n11 11\n136\n\nTable 13-7 1996 NAEP Science Block Composition by Item Type, Grade 8, As Defined After Scaling*\n\nBlock\n\nMultipleChoice Items\n\nConstructed-Response Items Scored Polytomously\n\n2-\n\n3-\n\n4-\n\n5-\n\ncategory category category category\n\nS3\n\n0\n\nS4\n\n2\n\nS5\n\n0\n\nS6\n\n0\n\nS7\n\n2\n\nS8\n\n5\n\nS9\n\n3\n\nS10\n\n8\n\nSll\n\n8\n\nS12\n\n8\n\nS13\n\n8\n\nS14\n\n7\n\nS15\n\n6\n\nS20\n\n8\n\nS21\n\n7\n\nTotal\n\n72\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n7\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\n2\n\n0\n\n18\n\n82\n\n13\n\n1\n\n* Counts reflect items that were dropped and collapsed.\n\nCluster Items\n1\n1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1\n1\n0 0 0 4\n\nTotal Items\n6 9 8 6 12 10 13 16 16 16\n15 16 15 16 16\n190\n\n296\n\" 32:1\n\n\fTable 13-8 1996 NAEP Science Block Composition by Item Type, Grade 12, As Defined After Scaling*\n\nBlo Ck\n\nMultipleChoice Items\n\nConstructed-Reiponse Items Scored Polytomously\n\n2-\n\n3-\n\n4-\n\n5-\n\ncategory category category category\n\nS3\n\n0\n\nS4.\n\n0\n\nS5\n\n0\n\nS6\n\n0\n\nS7\n\n5\n\nS8\n\n6\n\nS9\n\n4\n\nS10\n\n8\n\nS 11\n\n8\n\nS12\n\n8\n\nS13\n\n8\n\nS14\n\n8\n\nS15\n\n0\n\nS20\n\n6\n\nS21\n\n8\n\nTotal\n\n69\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n0\n\n19\n\n71\n\n24\n\n2\n\n* Counts reflect items that were dropped and collapsed.\n\nCluster Items\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1\n0 0 0 0\n1\n\nTotal Items\n6 4\n8 8 15 12 14 18 16 16 15 16 8 14 16\n186\n\nAll constructed-response items were scored by specially trained readers, as described in Chapter 5. In addition, a small number of \"cluster items\" were formed. A cluster item is an aggregation of a group of items (in the case of NAEP science, typically two to four items) that are related to a single content strand, topic, or stimulus, and are developed and scored as a single unit (see Wainer & Kiely, 1987, for further details and examples of different types of cluster items). Some items were initially scored as cluster items, and the additional clusters were formed in scaling due to data dependencies.\nIn the main samples, each student was administered a booklet containing two paper-and-pencil blocks and one block consisting of a hands-on task. In addition, the booklet contained a block of background questions common to all booklets for a particular grade level, a block of questions concerning the student's motivation and his or her perception of the difficulty of the cognitive items, and a block of science-related background questions common to all science booklets for a particular grade level.\nThe design of the 1996 science assessment required that each student be administered one of the 37 booklets in the design. Within each administration site, all booklets were \"spiraled\" together in a random sequence and distributed to students sequentially, in the order of the students' names on the Student Listing Form (see Chapter 4). As a result of the design and the spiraling of booklets, a considerable degree of balance was achieved in the data collection process. Each block of items (and, therefore, each item) was administered to randomly equivalent samples of students.\n\n13.3 SPECIAL SCIENCE ASSESSMENT\nAs stated previously, there was a special study in the 1996 national NAEP assessment in addition to the main and long-term trend assessments. This was the advanced study, denoted by the 12[Sci-Advanced] sample in Table 13-1. This study examined the performance of twelfth-\n297\n324\n\n\fgrade students who were taking advanced science courses. Students were assessed for approximately two hours, and each student received four cognitive blocks, consisting of a common block (SS, composed of 18 items) and three special blocks (each composed of 16 items) designed to assess advanced material. Each block assessed specific science content: one block for physics, one for chemistry, and one for life sciences. The common block was composed of items from the main assessment, although these items were drawn from several different blocks from the main assessment. The block structure of the special study booklets is provided in Table 13-9. In addition to the cognitive blocks, the special study booklets had three blocks in common with the main assessment:\n1. a general student background block (CS) 2. a science background block (SB), and 3. a motivation block (SX).\n\nTable 13-9 Block Structure of the 12[Sci-Advanced] Special Study Booklets\n\nBooklet IDs\n238 239 240\n\nFirst\nSS SS SS\n\nCognitive Blocks\n\nSecond\n\nThird\n\nSR\n\nSV\n\nSV\n\nSP\n\nSP\n\nSR\n\nFourth\nSP SR SV\n\nThe advanced study was not part of the main assessment and analyses for these booklets will be described in an NCES publication by Christine O'Sullivan to be published in the third quarter of 1999. Therefore, the special 12[Sci-Advanced] sample will not be discussed further in this chapter.\n\n13.4 ITEM ANALYSES\n13.4.1 Conventional Item and Test Analyses\nThis section contains a detailed description of the conventional item analysis performed on the science data. This analysis was done within block so that a student's score is the sum of item scores in a block. Dichotomous items (multiple-choice and 2-category constructed-response) were scored as right or wrong. Polytomous items were not scored right/wrong but were scored with three or more categories reflecting several degrees of knowledge.\nTables 13-10, 13-11, and 13-12 show the number of items, average weighted item score, average weighted item-to-total score correlation (biserial or polyserial), and weighted alpha reliability for each block administered at each grade level for the main assessment. The table also gives the number of students who were administered the block and the weighted percent reaching the last item in the block. Student sampling weights were used to compute all statistics except for the sample sizes. Preliminary item analyses for all items within a block were completed before scaling; however, the results shown here reflect the characteristics of the items that contributed to the final science scales.\n\n298\n325\n\n\fStatistic Number of scaled items\n\nTable 13-10 Descriptive Statistics for Item Blocks by Position Within Test Booklet and Overall\nOccurrences for the Science Main Sample,

responses at the end of each block (not reached) and missing responses prior to the last observed response (omitted). Standard practice at ETS is to treat all nonrespondents to the last item as if they had not reached the item. Items that were not reached were treated as if they had not been presented to the examinee, while omitted items were regarded as incorrect. The proportion of students attempting the last item of a block (or, equivalently, one minus the proportion not reaching the last item) can be used as an index of the degree of speededness of the block of items.\nAs is evident from Tables 13-10 through 13-12, the difficulty and the average item-to-total correlations of the blocks varied somewhat. Such variability was expected since these blocks were not created to be parallel in either difficulty or content. Based on the proportion of students attempting the last item, no block seemed to be speeded, by the criterion of a proportion less than .8 attempting the last item. The most speeded block showed 84 percent of the students reaching the last item in the block.\nFor the 11 paper-and-pencil blocks, small but consistent differences were noted based upon whether a block occurred in the first or second position within a booklet. When the block appeared first in the booklet, the average item score tended to be higher and the average polyserial correlation tended to be lower. The largest differences were noted in the proportion of students not attempting the last item in the block; more students attempted the last item when the block appeared in the second position. It appears that the students learned to pace themselves through the second block, based on their experience with the first block. Similar effects (slightly larger) were noted in the 1992 NAEP reading assessment (Donoghue, 1994). At that time, a study was completed to examine the effect of the serial position differences. Due to the balance of the complex design of the booklets, the serial position differences were found to have minimal effects on scaling.\n13.4.2 Scoring the Constructed-Response Items\nAs indicated in Table 13-4 through 13-6, about two-thirds of the science items were constructed-response. Two-category constructed-response items were given a right/wrong scoring. The categories of responses for the items and the number of responses that were rescored for each item are indicated in Appendix I. The percent agreement for the raters and Cohen's (1968) Kappa, a reliability estimate appropriate for items that are dichotomized, are also given in the tables. For grades 4 and 12, a 20 percent sample was used in calculating the reliability. At grade 8, the national and State Assessment data were combined. A 6 percent sample of these combined data was used to calculate the reliability results.\nIn general, the rater reliability of the scoring for dichotomized responses was quite high. Cohen's Kappa reliabilities ranged over items from .86 to .93 for grade 4, from .75 to .96 for grade 8, and from .71 to .95 for grade 12.\nChapter 7 discusses the definition of the item ratings and describes the process by which teams of raters scored the constructed-response items. This discussion includes the rating definitions for regular, short and extended constructed-response items as well as the range of interrater reliabilities that were obtained. Extended constructed-response items were scored on a scale from 1 to 5 to reflect degrees of knowledge. In scaling, this scale is shifted to 0 to 4. Rating information on extended constructed-response items can be found in Appendix I, which lists the sample sizes, percent agreement, and Cohen's Kappa reliability index.\n13.4.3 Differential Item Functioning\nA differential item functioning (DIF) analysis of the science items was done to identify potentially biased items. Sample sizes were large enough to compare male and female students, White and Black students, and White and Hispanic students. The purpose of the analysis was to identify items that should be examined\n302\n3 3\n\n\fmore closely by a committee of trained test developers and subject-matter specialists for possible bias and consequent exclusion from the assessment. The presence of DIF in an item means that the item is differentially\nharder for one group of students than another, while controlling for the ability level of the students.\n\nFor dichotomous items, the Mantel-Haenszel procedure as adapted by Holland and Thayer (1988) was used as a test of DIF (this is described in Chapter 9). The Mantel procedure (Mantel, 1963) was used for detection of DIF in polytomous items and also as described by Zwick, Donoghue, and Grima (1993). This\nprocedure assumes ordered categories.\n\nFor DIF analyses, weights were rescaled separately for each comparison, as described in Chapter 9. DIF analyses were conducted separately by grade. For dichotomous items, the DIF index generated by the Mantel-Haenszel procedure was used to place items into one of three categories: \"A,\" \"B,\" or \"C.\" \"A\" items exhibit no DIF, \"B\" items exhibit a weak indication of DIF, and \"C\" items exhibit a strong indication of DIF.\n\"C\" items were examined by a DIF committee for presence of bias.\n\nTable 13-13 summarizes the results of the DIF analyses for dichotomous items. Focal groups are female, Black, and Hispanic groups.\n\nTable 13-13 DIF Category by Grade for Dichotomous Items\n\nDIF\n\nAnalysis\n\nGrade Category' Male/Female White/Black White/Hispanic\n\n4\n\nC-\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB-\n\n13\n\n4\n\n1\n\nA-\n\n21\n\n26\n\n33\n\nA+\n\n19\n\n26\n\n23\n\nB+\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nC-\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB-\n\n10\n\n6\n\n2\n\nA-\n\n41\n\n33\n\n34\n\nA+\n\n23\n\n40\n\n43\n\nB+\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\nC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n12\n\nC-\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nB-\n\n13\n\n4\n\n2\n\nA-\n\n38\n\n31\n\n33\n\nA+\n\n22\n\n35\n\n41\n\nB+\n\n5\n\n9\n\n3\n\nC+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\ni Positive values of the index indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group (female, Black, or Hispanic students) than for the reference groups (male or White students). \"A+\" or \"A-\" means no indication of DIF, \"B+\" means a weak indicationof DIF in favor of the focal group, \"B-\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the reference group and \"C+\" or \"C-\" means a strong\nindication of DIF.\n\nPositive values indicate items that were differentially easier for the focal group. Table 13-14 summarizes the results of the DIF analyses for polytomous items. Again, focal groups are female, Black, and Hispanic groups, and positive values indicate that the item was differentially easier for the focal group. The Mantel statistic provides a statistical test of the hypothesis of no DIF. To aid in interpreting the results for polytomous items, the standardized mean difference between focal and reference groups was produced. This statistic was rescaled\n303\n, 333\n\n\fby dividing the standardized mean differences by the standard deviation of the respective item. The description of this procedure can be found in Chapter 9. For polytomous items, a standardized mean difference ratio of .25\nor greater (coupled with a significant Mantel statistic) was considered a strong indication of DIF. It can be shown that standardized mean difference ratios of .25 are at least as extreme as Mantel-Haenszel statistics corresponding to \"C\" items (see Chapter 9 for details).\n\nTable 13-14 DlF Category by Grade for Polytomous Items\n\nDIF\n\nAnalysis\n\nGrade Category' Male/Female White/Black White/Hispanic\n\n4\n\nCC-\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\nBB-\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\nAA-\n\n39\n\n39\n\n40\n\nAA+\n\n29\n\n36\n\n41\n\nBB+\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\nCC+\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n8\n\nCC-\n\n7\n\n0\n\n2\n\nBB-\n\n7\n\n5\n\n3\n\nAA-\n\n43\n\n48\n\n54\n\nAA+\n\n57\n\n57\n\n54\n\nBB+\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\nCC+\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n12\n\nCC-\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBB-\n\n7\n\n2\n\n2\n\nAA-\n\n40\n\n54\n\n54\n\nAA+\n\n49\n\n45\n\n45\n\nBB+\n\n9\n\n5\n\n4\n\nCC+\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n' Positive values of the index indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group (female, Black, or Hispanic students) than for the reference groups (male or White students). \"A+\" or \"A-\" means no indication of DIF, \"B+\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the focal group, \"B-\" means a weak indication of DIF in favor of the reference group and \"C+\" or \"C-\" means a strong indication of DIF.\n\nFollowing standard practice at ETS, all items identified as showing DIF were reviewed by a committee of trained test developers and subject-matter specialists. As described in Chapter 9, such committees are charged with making judgments about whether the differential difficulty of an item is unfairly related to group membership; that is, whether the item is biased. The committee assembled to review NAEP items that were identified as \"C\" or \"CC\" items. The committee included both ETS staff and outside members with expertise in the field. It was the committee's judgment that one of the items for the national data was\nfunctioning differentially due to factors irrelevant to test objectives. The item asked the student to list two\nways that cold temperatures could cause problems. Although the item appeared to be disadvantaging Hispanic\nstudents, the committee concluded that this was probably because a large proportion of Hispanic Americans live in warmer parts of the country, and that anyone without experience of cold weather would be disadvantaged in answering this question. The item was removed from scaling due to this differential item functioning.\n\n304\n334\n\n\f13.5 ITEM RESPONSE THEORY (IRT) SCALING\nIn 1993, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) determined that future NAEP assessments should be developed using within-grade frameworks. Within-grade scaling removes the constraint that the trait being measured is cumulative across the grade levels of the assessment. It also means that there is no need for overlap items across grades. Consistent with this view, NAGB also declared that scaling be performed within-grade. Any items that happened to be the same across grades in the assessment were scaled separately for each grade, thus making it possible for common items to function differently in the separate grades. Therefore, the Science Framework for the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment Governing Board, 1993) specifies that the 1996 science assessment be developed within-grade. Likewise, all IRT scaling was performed within-grade.\nWithin each grade, items were grouped into three distinct sets corresponding to the three fields of science: earth, physical, and life. IRT-based scales corresponding to each of the fields of science above were developed using the scaling models described in Chapter 11. The scales summarize student performance across all three item types in the assessment (multiple-choice, short constructed-response, and extended constructed-response).\n13.5.1 Item Parameter Estimation\nFor each fields of science scale, item parameter estimates were obtained by the NAEP BILOG/PARSCALE program, which combines Mislevy and Bock's (1982) BILOG and Muraki and Bock's (1991) PARSCALE computer programs. The program uses marginal estimation procedures to estimate the parameters of the one-, two-, and three-parameter logistic models, and the generalized partial credit model described by Muraki (1992) (see Chapter 11). The calibration was performed using all the available examinees in the reporting group. Student sampling weights were used for the analysis.\nAs described in Chapter 11, multiple-choice items were dichotomously scored (scored 0,1) and were scaled using the three-parameter logistic model. Omitted responses to multiple-choice items were treated as fractionally correct, with the fraction being set to the reciprocal of the number of response options for an item. All constructed-response items with two categories were dichotomously scored and were scaled using the twoparameter logistic model with the lower asymptote parameter set at 0. Omitted responses to these items were treated as incorrect. For calibration, all items that were not reached were treated as if they were not presented to the examinees. Responses to extended constructed-response items that were off-task were also treated as if they had not been presented.\nA key assumption associated with IRT scales is that of conditional independence. Conditional on proficiency,.examinee's item responses are assumed to be independent. When sets of items are logically dependent on each other, or are based on a single stimulus, this assumption can be violated to a degree that results in aberrant scaling results. In order to avoid possible problems with inter-item d6pendencies, a small number of additional cluster items was created by combining examinee responses to sets of related items into a single score for each set. The cluster items, rather than their original constituent items, were used in scaling the 1996 science assessment. Examinees omitting all constituents of the cluster item were placed in the \"zero correct\" category of the cluster item. Examinees classified as \"not reaching\" all constituent parts were treated as having not been presented the cluster item. All cluster items were scaled using the generalized partial credit model.\nEach of the multi-category constructed response items was also scaled using the generalized partial credit model. These items had two, three, four, or five categories of partial credit. One cluster item had six categories. Scoring levels were labeled as shown in Table 13-15.\n\n335\n\n305\n\n\fScore\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n3-Category\n\nTable 13-15 Labels for Score Levels of Polytomous Items\n\n4-Category\n\n5-Category\n\nComplete Partially correct Wrong, off-task, or omitted\n\nComplete Partially correct Unsatisfactory Wrong, off-task, or omitted\n\nComplete Essential Partially correct Unsatisfactory Wrong, off-task, or omitted\n\n6-Category\nComplete Essential Adequate Partially correct Unsatisfactory Wrong, off-task, or omitted\n\nEmpirical Bayes modal estimates of all item parameters were obtained from the BILOG/PARSCALE program. Prior distributions were imposed on item parameters with the following starting values: thresholds (normal [0,2]); slopes (log-normal [0,.5]); and asymptotes (two-parameter beta with parameter values determined as functions of the number of response options foran item and a weight factor of 50). The locations (but not the dispersions) of the item parameter prior distributions were updated at each program estimation cycle in accordance with provisional estimates of the item parameters.\nStarting values were computed from item statistics. Item parameter estimation proceeded in two phases. First, the subject ability distribution was assumed fixed (normal [0,1]) and a stable solution was obtained. The parameter estimates from this solution were then used as starting values for a subsequent set of runs in which the subject ability distribution was freed and estimated concurrently with item parameter estimates. After each estimation cycle, the subject ability distribution was restandardized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Correspondingly, parameter estimates for that cycle were also linearly restandardized.\n\n13.5.2 Evaluation of Model Fit\nDuring and subsequent to item parameter estimation, an evaluation of the fit of the IRT models was carried out for each of the items in the item pool. These evaluations were conducted to determine the final composition of the item pool making up the scales by identifying misfitting items that should not be included. Evaluations of model fit were based primarily on graphical analyses. For dichotomously-scored multiplechoice and two-category response items, model fit was evaluated by examining plots of estimates of the expected conditional (on 0) probability of a correct response that do not assume a two-parameter or threeparameter logistic model versus the probability predicted by the estimated item characteristic curve (see Mislevy & Sheehan, 1987, p. 302). For the cluster items and multiple-category constructed-response items, similar plots were produced for each item category characteristic curve (see Chapter 9).\nAs with most procedures that involve evaluating plots of data versus model predictions, a certain degree of subjectivity is involved in determining the degree of fit necessary to justify use of the model. There are a number of reasons why evaluation of model fit relied primarily on analyses of plots rather than seemingly more objective procedures based on goodness-of-fit indices such as the \"pseudo chi-squares\" produced in BlELOG (Mislevy & Bock, 1982). First, the exact sampling distributions of these indices when the model fits are not well understood, even for fairly long tests. Mislevy and Stocking (1987) point out that the usefulness of these indices appears particularly limited in situations like NAEP where examinees have been administered relatively short tests. A study by Stone, Mislevy, and Mazzeo (1994) using simulated data suggests that the correct reference chi-square distributions for these indices have considerably fewer degrees of freedom than the value indicated by the BILOG/PARSCALE program and require additional adjustmentg of scale. However, it is not yet clear how to estimate the correct number of degrees of freedom and necessary scale factor adjustment factors. Consequently, pseudo chi-square goodness-of-fit indices are used only as rough guides in interpreting the severity of model departures.\n306\n\n\fSecond, as discussed in Chapter 9, it is almost certainly the case that, for most items, item-response models hold only to a certain degree of approximation. Given the large samples sizes used in NAEP, there will be sets of items for which one is almost certain to reject the hypothesis that the model fits the data (since the likelihood of rejecting the null increases with sample size) even though departures are minimal in nature or involve kinds of misfit unlikely to impact on important model-based inferences about student achievement. In practice, it is always wise to temper statistical decisions with judgments about the severity of model misfit and the potential impact of such misfit on final results.\nIn making decisions about excluding items from the final scales, a balance was sought between being too stringent, hence deleting too many items and possibly damaging the content representativeness of the pool of scaled items, and too lenient, hence including items with model fit poor enough to invalidate the types of inferences made from NAEP results. Items that clearly did not fit the model were not included; however, a certain degree of misfit was tolerated for a number of items included in the final scales.\nFor the large majority of the items, the fit of the model was extremely good. Figure 13-1 provides a typical example of what the plots look like for a dichotomously-scored item in this class of items. The plot that is shown is for an item from the physical science scale. In the plot, the y-axis indicates the probability of a correct response and the x-axis indicates scale score level (0). The crosses show estimates of the conditional (on 0) probability of a correct response that do not assuMe a logistic form (referred to subsequently as nonlogistic-based estimates). The sizes of the crosses are proportional to the estimated density of the theta distribution at the indicated value. The solid curve shows the estimated theoretical item response function. The item response function provides estimates of the conditional probability of a correct response based on an assumed logistic form. The vertical dashed line indicates the estimated location parameter (b) for the item and the horizontal dashed line indicates the estimated lower asymptote (c). Also shown in the plot are the actual values of the item parameter estimates (lower right-hand corner). As is evident from the plot, the 'empirical' or non-logistic-based item trace is in extremely close agreement with the model-based item response function logistic curve.\nFigure 13-2 provides an example of a plot for a 4-category extended constructed-response item exhibiting good model fit. Like the plots for the dichotomously-scored multiple-choice items, this plot shows two estimates of each item category characteristic curve, one set that does not assume the partial credit model (the empirical trace shown as asterisks) and one that does (the theoretical trace shown as solid curves). The estimates for all parameters for the item in question are also indicated on the plot. As with Figure 13-1, the two sets of estimates agree quite well, although there is a slight tendency for the nonlogistic-based estimates for category two to be somewhat higher than the model-based estimates for theta values less than 1. An aspect of Figure 13-2 worth noting is the large proportion of examinees that responded in the two lowest response categories for this item3. Such results were typical for the extended constructed-response items. Substantial proportions of examinees were either unable or unwilling to provide even minimally adequate answers to such items.\nAs discussed above, some of the items retained for the final scales display some degree of model misfit. Figures 13-3 (a dichotomously-scored multiple-choice item) and 13-4 (an extended constructedresponse item) provide typical examples of such items. Note that in Figure 13-4, the empirical curve lies above the theoretical curve in the lower part of the ability scale for the lowest category, but below the theoretical curve for the next higher category. Combining these two categories would have improved the model fit, but it was judged that the misfit was not sufficiently pronounced in this case to warrant such collapsing. In general, good agreement between empirical and theoretical item traces were found for the regions of the theta scale that includes most of the examinees. Misfit was confined to conditional probabilities associated with theta values in the tails of the subject ability distributions.\n3 This is evidenced by the relatively large size of the asterisks indicating estimated conditional probabilities for these two categories.\n307\n337\n..\n\n\fItem K049907 (grade 12, earth science scale) did not fit in a run with and unconstrained (to normal) prior and with all the adjustments that had been made in the national scaling (Figure 13-5). Categories 1 and 2 were combined to yield a 0-1 dichotomous item, and the fit improved substantially (Figure 13-6).\n\nFigure 13-1\nPlot* Comparing Empirical and Model-Based Estimates of Item Response Functions for Binary Scored (Multiple-Choice) Items Exhibiting Good Model Fit\n\n0 NAEP ID: K034201\n\nSEQUENCE: 022\n\nSCALE: Physi\u00e1al\n\n0\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nTHFTA\n\na = 0.7243 b = 0.1137 c = 0.1814 n alt = 4\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\n*Asterisks indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a logistic form; the solid curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a logistic form.\n\n308\n338\n\n\fFigure 13-2 Plot* Comparing Empirical and Model-Based Estimates of Item Category Characteristic Curves\nfor a Polytomously Scored Item Exhibiting Good Model Fit\n\nNAEP ID: K059201 I 4 CATEGORIES\n\nSEQUENCE: 064\n\nSCALE: Life\n\na = 0.8051 b = 0.8505 dl = 0.9570 d2 = -0.0674 d3 = -0.8896\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\nTHETA\n\n*Asterisks indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a model-based form; the solid curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a model-based form.\n\n339 309\n\n\fFigure 13-3 Plot* Comparing Empirical and Model-Based Estimates of Item Response Functions\nfor Binary-Scored (Multiple-Choice) Item Exhibiting Some Model Misfit\n\n0 NAEP ID: K033801\n05\n\nSEQUENCE: 028\n\nSCALE: Earth\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nTHETA\n\na = 0.6177 b = -0.1688\nc = 0.2207 n alt = 4\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\n*Asterisks indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a logistic form; the solid curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a logistic form.\n\n310\n340\n\n\fFigure 13-4 Plot* Comparing Empirical and Model-Based Estimates of Item Category Characteristic Curves\nfor a Polytomously Scored Item Exhibiting Some Model Misfit\n\nNAEP ID: K040606\n4 CATEGORIES1\n\nSEQUENCE: 006\n\nSCALE: Physical\n\na = 0.4970 b = -0.2413\ndl = 2.6825\nd2 = -1.6833 d3 = -0.9992\n\no\n-4.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 D\n\nTHETA\n\n*Asterisks indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a model-based form; the solid curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a model-based form.\n\n341\n\n311\n\n\fFigure 13-5 Plot* Comparing Empirical and Model-Based Estimates of Item Category Characteristic Curves\nfor a Polytomously Scored Item (K044101) Exhibiting Poor Model Fit\n\nNAEP ID: K049907\n3 CATEGORIES\n\nSEQUENCE: 028\n\nSCALE: Earth\n\na = 0.5089 b = -0.1524\ndl = 0.1188\nd2 = -0.1188\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\nTHETA\n\n*Asterisks indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a model-based form; the solid curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a model-based form.\n\n312\n\n342\n\n\fFigure 13-6 Plot* Comparing Empirical and Model-Based Estimates of Item Category Characteristic Curves\nfor Polytomously Scored Item (K044101) After Collapsing Categories 2 and 3\n\nNAEP ID: K049907\na,\n\nSEQUENCE: 028\n\nSCALE: Earth\nV./\n\n0\n0 -4.0\n\n1 .4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-1.o\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nTHETA\n\na = 0.8810 b = -0.7023\nc = 0.0000 n alt = 0\n\n2 0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\n*Asterisks indicate estimated conditional probabilities obtained without assuming a logistic form; the solid curve indicates estimated item response function assuming a logistic form.\nNote: When the number of alternatives of a constructed-response item equaled zero, the item was scored in only two categories.\n\nOn the following pages, Table 13-16 lists the items that received special treatment during the scaling\n\nprocess.

This procedure employed student weights. Prior to 1990, selected background variables were used for conditioning. However, from 1990 to the present, principal components of the background variables have been used as conditioning variables. Almost all of the background variables were coded as 0-1 contrasts, so no standardization took place. Principal components of\nthese contrasts were employed to remedy problems of extreme collinearity among some of the original cOnditioning variables. The principal components used accounted for at least 90 percent of the variance of the original conditioning variables.\n\nResults from research on the 1990 Trial State Assessment in mathematics suggests that using a large subset of principal components will yield estimates that differ only slightly from those obtained using the full set (Mazzeo, Johnson, Bowker, & Fong, 1994). Table 13-17 contains a list of the number of principal\ncomponents included in conditioning, as well as the proportion of variance accounted for by the conditioning model for each grade.\n\nTable 13-17 Proportion of Proficiency Variance Accounted for by the Conditioning Model\nfor the Science Main Assessment\n\nNumber of\nConditioning Grade Contrasts'\n\n4\n\n948\n\n8\n\n1,041\n\n12\n\n808\n\nI Excluding the constant term\n\nNumber of Principal Components'\n317 326 290\n\nProportion of Proficiency Variance\n\nPhysical\n\nEarth\n\nLife\n\nScience\n\nScience\n\nScience\n\n.64\n\n.57\n\n.59\n\n.63\n\n.63\n\n.64\n\n.71\n\n.71\n\n.70\n\n13.6.2 Conditioning (CGROUP Program)\nThe codings of the original science-specific conditioning variables, before principal components were calculated, are presented in Appendix C. NAEP-CGROUP (described in Chapter 11) creates posterior distributions of proficiencies by combining information from item responses of individuals and information from linear regression of proficiency on conditioning variables. For each individual, five plausible values are randomly drawn from their posterior proficiency distribution.\nThe values of the conditioning effects are expressed in the metrics of the original calibration scale. Definitions Of derived conditioning variables are given in Appendix B.\n\n13.6.3 Analysis of Dimensionality\nAs mentioned earlier, the main assessment is multivariate with three content area scales. Tables 13-18 and 13-19 give conditional and marginal correlations for the three scales for the three grades. The conditional correlations can be thought of as correlations from information pooled within the demographic subgroups corresponding to grouping variables used to condition the data with CGROUP. The conditional correlations correspond to the error correlations of a CGROUP analysis. The conditional correlations are high, averaging .79 for grade 4, .90 for grade 8, and .83 for grade 12. The marginal correlations are the average of the scale correlations over five plausible values generated by CGROUP. Since these correlations are not pooled within\n318\n348\n\n\fbackground groupings, marginal correlations tend to be larger than conditional correlations, averaging .84 for grade 4, .91 for grade 8, and .90 for grade 12. Although it is of substantive interest to analyze the scales separately, the correlations indicate that they are highly redundant with each other.\n\nGrade\n4\n8\n12\n\nTable 13-18 Conditional Correlations from Conditioning (CGROUP)\n\nField of Science Scale\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science Life Science\n\n1.00\n\n0.79\n\n1.00\n\n0.79\n\n0.78\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science Life Science\n\n1.00\n\n0.92\n\n1.00\n\n0.89\n\n0.88\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science Life Science\n\n1.00\n\n0.87\n\n1.00\n\n0.82\n\n0.80\n\n-- Life Science --1.00 --1.00\n1.00\n\nTable 13-19 Marginal Correlations of Science Scales'\n\nGrade\n\nField of Science Scale\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science Life Science\n\n4\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n1.00\n\n0.84\n\n1.00\n\n0.84\n\n0.84\n\n1.00\n\n8\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n12\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n1.00\n\n0.93\n\n1.00\n\n0.91\n\n0.90\n\n1.00\n\n1.00 0.92\n\n1.00\n\n-\n\n0.90\n\n0.89\n\n1.00\n\nI Tabled values were obtained by computing a separate Pearson correlation coefficient for each plausible value, computing Fisher's z-transformation for each value, computing the average of the transformed values, and computing the inverse transformation of the\naverage.\n\n13.7 THE FINAL PROFICIENCY SCALES\n\n13.7.1 Field of Science Scales\nLike all MT scales, the field of science scales have a linear indeterminacy that may be resolved by an arbitrary choice of origin and unit-size for each scale. The 1996 science assessment was developed using a new framework. Because it was not appropriate to compare results from the 1996 assessment with those of previous NAEP science assessments, no attempt was made to link or align scores on the new assessment to those of previous assessments. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a new scale for reporting. NAEP assessments developed earlier (such as the 1992 reading assessment) were developed with a cross-grade framework, in which the trait being measured is conceptualized as cumulative across the grades of the assessment. Accordingly, a single 0-to-500 scale was established for all three grades in each of these\nassessments.\n\n349\n\n319\n\n\fIn 1993, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) determined that future NAEP\nassessments should be developed using within-grade frameworks. This removes,the.constraint that the trait being measured is cumulative. It also means that there is no need for overlap items across grades. Consistent with this view, NAGB also declared that scaling be performed within-grade. Any items that happened to be the same across grades in the assessment were scaled separately for each grade, thus making it possible for common items to function differently in the separate grades. The NAEP 1994 U.S. history and geography\nassessments were developed and scaled within-grade. After scaling, the scales were aligned so that grade 8 had a higher mean than grade 4, and grade 12 had a higher mean than grade 8. The results were reported on a final 0-to-500 scale that looked similar to those used in reading, in spite of the differences in development and scaling. This choice of the reporting scale was the source of potential confusion and misinterpretation.\n\nTherefore, for the NAEP 1996 science assessmentwhich was also developed and scaled using within-grade proceduresa new reporting metric was adopted. The results are reported on 0-to-300 scales and the means for each of the grades are identical. For each grade, the mean for each field of science was set at 150 and the standard deviation was 35. Constraining the mean and standard deviation of the scales to 150 and 35 also constrained, to some degree, the percentiles for the total group of students at each grade. However,\nwithin-grade comparisons of percentiles across subgroups can still provide valuable comparative information. The reporting metric was developed using data from the national assessment program, and the results for the state assessment program were linked to these scales.\n\nFor each field of science, the scale mean and standard deviation were set to 150.0 and 35.0 using the transformation:\n()target = A Ocalibrated + B.\n\nwhere ()target denotes values on the final transformed scale and ()calibrated denotes values on the original calibration scale from BILOG/PARSCALE. The calculation of the value of \"A\" and \"B\" is described\nin Chapter 9, Section 9.3.5. The constants for the linear transformation for each scale are given in Table 13-20.\n\nTable 13-20 Coefficients of Linear Transformations of the Fields of Science Scales from the Calibrating Scale Units to the Units of Reporting Proficiency\n\nGrade Field of Science Scale\n\nA\n\n4\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n34.91 34.09 35.09\n\n151.17 150.67 150.51\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science Life Science\n\n35.85 34.56 35.64\n\n150.23 150.58 150.25\n\n12\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n37.76 36.59 35.91\n\n149.65 149.77 150.19\n\n13.7.2 The Composite Science Proficiency Scale\nIn addition to the plausible values for each scale, a composite of the three fields of science scales was created as a measure of overall science performance. The composite was a weighted average of plausible values on the fields of science scales (earth, physical, and life). The weights for the scales were proportional to the importance assigned to each field of science contained in the assessment specifications given in the Science Framework. The weights are given in Table 13-21. As indicated in Table 2-4 of Chapter 2, the weights for each of the fields of science are similar to the actual proportion of assessment time devoted to that field. In\n320\n350\n\n\fdeveloping the composite scale, the weights were applied to the plausible values for each fields of science as expressed in terms of the final scale (i.e., after transformation from the provisional BILOG/PARSCALE scales). ,\n\nTable 13-21 Weights Used for Each Field ofScience Scale to Form the Science Composite\n\nField of Science Scale\n\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 8\n\nGrade 12\n\nPhysical science\n\n.33\n\n.30\n\n.33\n\nEarth science\n\n.33\n\n.30\n\n.33\n\nLife science\n\n.33\n\n.40\n\n.33\n\nFinally, it is necessary to caution that, although the science composite is expressed in units that seem somewhat similar to the long-term trend science scale, it is not appropriate to compare scores. The transformation chosen to resolve the linear indeterminacy in the science composite is a convenient transformation, but it is only one of a conceptually infinite number of such transformations that could have been chosen. Any one of these transformations would have provided equivalent information about the relative standings of subgroups in the population. Because there is no link, real or implied, in the construction ofthe science composite and the field of science scales to either the mathematics assessment or to the previous science assessments, the comparison of students' science proficiencies to students' proficiencies in other\nsubject areas is devoid of meaning.\n\n13.8 PARTITIONING OF ME ESTIMATION ERROR VARIANCE\nFor each grade, the error variance of the final, transformed scale mean was partitioned as described in Chapter 11. This analysis yielded estimates of the proportion of error variance due to sampling students and the proportion due to the latent nature of 9. These estimates are given in Table 13-22 for each field of science scale and the composite scale (for stability, the estimates of the between-imputation variance, B, in Equation 11.9). Additional results, including those by gender and race/ethnicity, are presented in Appendix E.\n\nTable 13-22 Estimation Error Variance and Related Coefficients for the Science Main Assessment\n\nGrade\n\nField of Science Scale\n\nTotal Estimation\nError\nVariance\n\n'Proportion of Variance Due to ...\nStudent Sampling Latency of 9\n\n4\n\nPhysical Science\n\n1.16\n\n0.82\n\n0.18\n\nEarth Science\n\n0.72\n\n0.85\n\n0.15\n\nLife Science\n\n0.86\n\n0.78\n\n0.22\n\nComposite\n\n0.64\n\n0.89\n\n0.11\n\n8\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n0.91\n\n0.92\n\n0.08\n\n0.89\n\n0.91\n\n0.09\n\n1.07\n\n0.86\n\n0.14\n\nComposite\n\n0.78\n\n0.94\n\n0.06\n\n12\n\nPhysical Science\n\nEarth Science\n\nLife Science\n\n1.03\n\n0.92\n\n0.08\n\n0.91\n\n0.94\n\n0.06\n\n0.80\n\n0.89\n\n0.11\n\nComposite\n\n0.76\n\n0.96\n\n0.04\n\n321\n\n\f13.9 SCIENCE TEACHER QUESTIONNAIRES Teachers of fourth- and eighth-grade students were surveyed about their educational background and\nteaching practices. The students in a particular classroom had their records matched with their teacher's survey information. Variables derived from the questionnaire were used in the conditioning models, along with a variable that indicated whether a student record had been matched with a teacher record, which controls estimates of subgroup means for differences that exist between the matching and non-matching students. Of the 7,305 fourth-grade students in the sample, 89.0 percent were matched with both parts of the teacher questionnaire and 2.2 percent were matched with only the first, teacher background, part of the questionnaire. For the eighth-grade students sample, 82.4 percent were matched with both parts of the teacher questionnaire and 1.4 percent were matched with only the first part of the questionnaire. The lower match rate for both parts of the questionnaire for eighth-grade students was due in part to the fact that in grade 8 students were matched to the particular class that the teacher taught. Class membership information was often missing or ambiguous. For grade 4, students only had to be matched to the teacher, resulting in higher match rates. Thus, 91.4 percent of the fourth graders and 83.8 percent of the eighth graders were matched with at least the background information about their science teachers.\n13.10 THE WEIGHT FILES\nWestat produced the final student and school weights and the corresponding replicate weights for the 1996 science assessment. Information for the creation of the weight files was supplied by NCS under the direction of ETS.\nAs was described in the Technical Report of the 1996 State Assessment Program in Science (Allen, Swinton, Isham, & Zelenak, 1998), the State Assessment sample was split into two subsamples, one using the 1992 inclusion rules (S1) and one using the 1996 inclusion rules (S2) the weighting process was more complex than in previous assessments (see Allen, Swinton, Isham, & Zelenak, 1998 for more details).\nIn the national science assessment, only the 1996 inclusion rules (S2) were used. Also, there were no accommodations offered for students with disabilities or for students with limited English proficiency in the national science assessment. Thus, a single sample was used for both analysis and reporting, and only a single set of student sampling weights. The student sampling weights have replicate weights associated with them. Replicate weights are used to estimate jackknife standard errors for each statistic estimated for the national science assessment.\n322\n352\n\n\fChapter 14\nDATA ANALYSIS FOR THE LONG-TERM TREND READING ASSESSMENT1\nJo-Lin Liang and Lois H. Worthington Educational Testing Service\n14.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes the analyses performed on the responses to the cognitive and background items in the 1996 long-term trend reading assessment. These analyses led to the results presented in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997). The emphasis of this chapter is on the methods and results of procedures used to develop the IRT-based scale scores that formed the basis of this report. The theoretical underpinnings of the IRT and plausible values methodology described in this chapter are given in Chapter 11, and several of the statistics are described in Chapter 9.\nThe objectives of the reading long-term trend analysis were to prepare scale values and perform all analyses necessary to produce a long-term trend report in reading. The reading long-term trend results include the years 1971, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. The major analysis components are discussed in turn. Some aspects of the analysis, such as procedures for item analysis, scoring of constructed-response items, and methods of scaling, are described in previous chapters and are therefore not detailed here.\nThe student samples that were administered reading items in the 1996 long-term trend reading assessment are shown in Table 14-1. See Chapters 1 and 3 for descriptions of the target populations and the sample design used for the assessment.\nThe long-term trend results reported in Trends in Academic Progress are based on print administrations and occur at all of the age levels. The samples involved in the analysis are shown in Table 14-1 as 9[RW-LTTrend], 13[RW-LTTrend], and 17[RW-LTTrend]. The long-term trend booklets for these samples contained blocks of reading and writing items administered in print form. All students received a block of common background questions, distinct for each age, and subject-area background questions that were presented in the cognitive blocks. The booklets are identical to those used for longterm trend assessments in 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994. The booklets and the blocks within those booklets are listed in Chapter 4. Additional information about all of the items in these blocks also appears in that chapter. This chapter includes specific information about the long-term trend items that were scaled. Both age- and grade-selected students contributed to the long-term trend scaling. However, only students in the \"age-only\" portion of the reading long-term trend samples contributed to the results presented in Trends in Academic Progress.\nI Jo-Lin Lang was the primary person responsible for the planning, specification, and coordination of the reading long-term trend analyses, advised by Eiji Muraki, and Nancy L. Allen. Data analyses and scaling were performed by Lois H. Worthington, advised by David S. Freund. Others contributing to the analysis of data were Bruce A. Kaplan, and Norma A. Norris. John R. Donoghue provided consultation.\n323\n353\n\n\fTable 14-1 NAEP 1996 Long-Term Trend Reading Student Samples\n\nSample\n\nBooklet IDs Mode\n\nCohort Assessed\n\nTime of Testing\n\nAge Modal Number Definition Grade Assessed\n\n9 [RW-LTTrend] 51-56 Print Age 9/Grade 4 1/3/96 - 3/8/96 (Winter)\n\nCY\n\n4\n\n5,019\n\n13 [RW-LTTrend] 51-56 Print Age 13/Grade 8 10/9/95 12/22/95 (Fall)\n\nCY\n\n8\n\n5,493\n\n17 [RW-LTTrend] 51-56 Print Age 17/Grade 11 3/11/96 5/10/96 (Spring) Not CY\n\n11\n\n4,669\n\nLEGEND\n\nRW LTTrend Print CY Not CY\n\nReading and writing Long-term trend assessment Print administration Calendar year: birthdates in 1986, and 1982 for ages 9, and 13 Age 17 only: birthdates between October 1, 1978, and September 30, 1979\n\nTable 14-2 clarifies the relationships between the 1996 long-term trend samples and samples from previous years. For ages 9, 13, and 17, the [RW-LTTrend] samples allow direct comparisons with 1994, 1992, 1990, 1988, and 1984 samples. The long-term trend scale, established in 1984, was linked to the 1971, 1975, and 1980 assessments using a complex equating strategy described in Implementing the New Design: The NAEP 1983-84 Technical Report (Beaton, 1987). At each age, several intact booklets were retained from the 1984 assessment, forming the basis of the reading long-term trend assessment in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. Information about the 1988 assessment is available in Focusing the New Design: The NAEP 1988 Technical Report (Johnson & Zwick, 1990); information about the 1990 assessment is given in The NAEP 1990 Technical Report (Johnson & Allen, 1992); information about the 1992 assessment is given in The NAEP 1992 Technical Report (Johnson & Carlson, 1994); and information about the 1994 assessment is given in The NAEP 1994 Technical Report (Allen, Kline, & Zelenak, 1996).\nThe 1996 long-term trend included, at each age level, six of the assessment booklets administered in 1984. These booklets (51-56) contained both reading and writing blocks, as well as background items. Although these long-term trend booklets represented only about one-tenth of the reading booklets administered in the complex 1984 BIB design,2 they contained 10 of the 12 reading blocks that were scaled at each age/grade level in 1984. The samples of students who received these long-term trend booklets are described in Table 14-1 and in Chapter 3. The purpose of the reading longterm trend analysis was to add to the reading trend results that extended from 1971 to 1994 for ages 9, 13, and 17. The numbers of scaled items for each age are presented in Table 14-3. Each age was scaled separately. The numbers of items scaled in 1996 that were common across assessment years are given in Table 14-4. As was the case for previous long-term trend analyses, the long-term trend scale is univariate. Dimensionality analyses conducted folloWing the 1984 assessment showed that the reading items were well summarized by a unidimensional scale (Zwick, 1987).\n\n2 The long-term trend assessment included 1984 Booklets 16, 17, 27, 34, 55, and 60 at age 9 and Booklets 13, 16, 17, 21, 34, and 57 at ages 13 and 17 (see J. R. Johnson, 1987, pp. 120-121). The 1984 main assessment focused-BIB design included 57 booklets that contained at least one scaled reading block at age 9 and 56 such booklets at ages 13 and 17.\n324\n3 3 4\n\n\fTable 14-2 NAEP Reading Samples Contributing to 1996 Long-Term Trend Results, 1971-1996\n\nCohort Year Sample Subjects\n\nTime of Testing\n\nAge 9 1971\n\nMain\n\nRL\n\n1975\n\nMain\n\nRA\n\n1980\n\nMain\n\nRA\n\n'1984\n\nMain\n\nRW\n\n1984\n\nT-84\n\nRW\n\n1988 LTTrendl\n\nRW\n\n1990 LTTrendl\n\nRW\n\n1992 LTTrendl\n\nRW\n\n1994 LTTrendl\n\nRW\n\n1996 LTrrendl\n\nRW\n\nWinter Winter Winter Winter, Spring Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter\n\nAge 13 1971\n\nMain\n\nRL\n\n1975\n\nMain\n\nRA\n\n1980\n\nMain\n\nRA\n\n1984\n\nMain\n\nRW\n\n1984\n\nT-84\n\nRW\n\n1988 LTTrencll\n\nRW\n\n1990 LTTrencll\n\nRW\n\n1992 LTTrencll\n\nRW\n\n1994 LTTrendl\n\nRW\n\n1996 LTTrendl\n\nRW\n\nFall Fall Fall Winter, Spring Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall\n\nAge 17\n\n1971 1975 1980 1984 1984 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\nMain Main Main Main T-84 LTTrencll LTTrencll LTTrendl LTTrencll LTTrencli\n\nRL RABS\nRA RW RW RW RW RW RW RW\n\nSpring Spring Spring Winter, Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring\n\n'Note: Within a cohort, these samples received common booklets.\n\nMode of Administration\nTape Tape Tape Print Tape Print Print Print Print Print\nTape Tape Tape Print Tape Print Print Print Print Print\nTape Tape Tape Print Tape Print Print Print Print Print\n\nAge Definition\nCY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY\nCY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY\nNot CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY\n\nModal Grade\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n11\n11\n11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11\n\nLEGEND\n\nRL RA RABS RW Main T-84\n\nReading and literature Reading and art Reading, art, index of basic skills Reading and writing Main assessment Special sample in the 1984 assessment that was used to establish links to previous assessments (1971-1980) for the purposes of long-term trend\n\nLTTrend\nPrint Tape CY\nNot CY\n\nLong-term trend (these samples received common booklets within an age group) Print administration Audiotape administration Calendar year: birthdates (1996 sample) in 1986 and 1982 for ages 9 and 13 Age 17 only (1996 sample): birthdates between October 1 and September 30 of the appropriate\nyears\n\n355\n\n325\n\n\fTable 14-3 Numbers of Scaled Reading Long-Term Trend\nItems Common Across Ages\n\nAge 9 only 13 only 17 only 9 and 13 only 9 and 17 only 13 and 17 only 9, 13, and 17\nTotal\n\nNumber of Items 61'\n221\n23 13 2 42\n26' 189'\n\nI These figures have been updated since their publication in the 1992 and 1994 NAEP technical reports (Table 12-3 and Table 15-3, respectively).\n\nTable 14-4 Numbers of Scaled Reading Long-Term Trend Items Common Across Assessments\n\nAssessment Year\n\nNumber of Items Age 9 Age 13 Age 17\n\n1984, 1992, 1994, 1996 1984, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 1980, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 1971, 1975, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996\n\n102\n\n103\n\n931\n\n101\n\n101\n\n92'\n\n98\n\n98\n\n87\n\n67\n\n71\n\n52\n\n36\n\n45\n\n37\n\nThese figures have been updated since their publication in the NAEP 1992, and 1994 Technical Reports (Table 12-4, and Table 15-4, respectively).\n\nThe steps in the reading long-term trend analysis are documented in the following sections. As is\nusual in NAEP analyses, the first step was to gather item and block information. The trend items were then calibrated according to the IRT model. Plausible values were generated after conditioning on available background variables. Finally, the scale values were placed on the final reading long-term trend scale used in previous trend assessments.\n\n14.2 ITEM ANALYSIS FOR THE READING LONG-TERM TREND ASSESSMENT\nConventional item analyses did not identify any difficulties with the long-term trend data. The results displayed in Table 14-5 contain the number of items, size of the unweighted sample administered the block, average weighted proportion correct, average weighted r-biserial, and average weighted alpha as a measure of reliability for each block. Because the blocks were presented in self-paced, printadministered form, the weighted proportion of students attempting the last item is included in the table to give an indication of the speededness of each block. Common labeling of these blocks across ages does not denote common items. Booklet information is detailed in Chapter 4. Student weights were used for\n\n326\n356\n\n\fall statistics except for the sample sizes. The average values reflect only the items in the block that were scaled. Overall, the 1996 item-level statistics were not very different from those for the 1994 assessment.\n\nTable 14-5 Descriptive Statistics for Item Blocks in the Reading Long-Term Trend Samples\n\nStatistics\n\nBlocks\nB8 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B22\n\nAge 9 Number of scaled items\n\n10 8 11\n\n7 11 12 11 -1\n\n11\n\n12\n\n9\n\nNumber of scaled , constructed-response items\nUnweighted sample size\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-I 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n03\n\n630 610 610 603 624 624 595 --I 603 1222 592\n\nAverage weighted proportion correct\n\n-I .62 .43 .43 .50 .41 .60 .51\n\n.56 .47 .60\n\nAverage weighted r-biserial Weighted alpha reliability\n\n.75 .62 .62 .82 .61 .75 .60\n\n.74 .64 .73\n\n-3 .75 .67 .71 .76 .71 .84 .64\n\n.81 .75 .74\n\nWeighted proportion of students\n\nattempting last item\n\n.92 .82 .77 .72 .66 .66 .86\n\n.86 .82 .97\n\nAge 13 Number of scaled items\n\n12 9\n\n8\n\n-2 5 11 12 10 9 16 11\n\nNumber of scaled constructed-response items\nUnweighted sample size\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 -2\n\n-2 629 642 630 673 630 615 658 642 673 629\n\nAverage weighted proportion correct\nAverage weighted r-biserial\n\n-2 .64 .59 .63 .64 .58 .66 .66 .73 .59 .67 -2 .71 .59 .73 .80 .65 .68 .64 .77 .56 .74\n\nWeighted alpha reliability\n\n.71 .60 .68 .57 .66 .78 .55 .67 .70\n\n-2 Weighted proportion of students\n\nattempting last item\n\n.94 .83 .98 .95 .91 .81 .84 .92 .78 .97\n\nAge 17 Number of scaled items\n\n12 4\n\n8\n\n6 11 12 13 10 10\n\n7 _2\n\nNumber of scaled constructed-response items\nUnweighted sample size\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 -2\n\n-2 605 638 585 643 585 588 622 638 643 605\n\nAverage weighted proportion correct\n\n-2 .72 .72 .79 .72 .68 .84 .65 .74 .53 .68\n\nAverage weighted r-biserial Weighted alpha reliability\n\n-2 .75 .78 .83 .81 .76 .78 .62 .71 .63\n.72 .43 .67 .41 .68 .80 .73 .74 .70 .70\n\n-2 Weighted proportion of students\n\nattempting last item\n\n.95 .97 1.00 .96 .96 .89 .69 .82 .72 .98\n\nBlock B16 was not administered at age class 9. 2 Block B22 was not administered at age class 13 or 17.\n\n357\n\n327\n\n\f14.3 TREATMENT OF CONSTRUCTED-RESPONSE ITEMS\nData for constructed-response items in the long-term trend analysis were used for the 1984, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 assessments only. Constructed-response items were not included in the original scoring of the 1988 reading assessment because a previous study (Zwick, 1988) had shown that scoring inconsistencies (drops in interrater reliability and/or scorer driftthat is, scorers showed evidence of rating items more strictly or more leniently than did the original 1984 scorers) had affected these items.\nRater reliability within year was computed for the 1996 constructed-response items at each age. Between year reliability was also studied with the 1994, and the 1984 responses. In general, the 1996 scoring did not show irregularities. All of the 1996 constructed-response items were used in the trend analysis except the items that were excluded from calibration in the previous assessment. The deleted items are listed in Table 14-6. The remaining constructed-response items were dichotomized according to criteria developed by subject-area experts. The dichotomized versions of the constructed-response items were included in the calibration.\n\nTable 14-6 Items Deleted from the Reading Long-Term Trend Analysis\n\nAge Block Item\n\nReason for Exclusion\n\n9\n\nB10 N001801 Excluded in previous assessment\n\nB13 N003003 Excluded in previous assessment\n\nB10 N008905 Excluded in previous assessment (constructed-response item)\n\n13\n\nB10 N001801 Excluded in previous assessment\n\nB10 N001904 Excluded in previous assessment (constructed-response item)\n\nB11 N002302 Excluded in previous assessment\n\nB12 N002804 Excluded in previous assessment (constructed-response item)\n\nB17 N005001 Excluded in previous assessment\n\n17\n\nB10 N001702 Excluded in previous assessment\n\nB11 N002302 Excluded in previous assessment\n\nB17 NO15905 Excluded in previous assessment (constructed-response item)\n\n14.4 IRT SCALING FOR THE READING LONG-TERM TREND ASSESSMENT\n14.4.1 Item Parameter Estimation\nThe first step in the scaling process was the estimation of item parameters for the long-term trend items. This item calibration was performed using the BILOG/PARSCALE program described in Chapter 11. Items were calibrated separately for each of the three age/grade groups. Item parameters were estimated using combined data from the assessment years 1994 and 1996, treating each assessment as a sample from a separate subpopulation. Student weights were used for the calibration. To ensure that each assessment year had a similar influence on the calibration, student weights for 1994 examinees were multiplied by a constant, to adjust them to have the same sum as the sum of the weights for the 1996 examinees. Approximately 600-700 examinee responses for each item were present in each assessment year.\n\n328\n358\n\n\fStarting values for item parameters were based on the final item parameter values from the analysis of the 1994 long-term trend assessment. As described in Chapter 9, BILOG/PARSCALE calibrations were completed in two stages. At stage one, the proficiency distribution of each assessment year was constrained to be normal, although the means and variances differed across assessment years. The values of the item parameters from this normal solution were then used as starting values for a second-stage estimation run in which the proficiency distribution (modeled as a separate multinomial distribution for each assessment year) was estimated concurrently with item parameters. Calibration was concluded when changes in item parameters became negligibly small (i.e., less than .005).\n\n14.4.2 Evaluation of Model Fit\nDuring and subsequent to item parameter estimation, evaluations of the fit of the IRT models were carried out for each of the items. These evaluations were based primarily on graphical analysis. First, model fit was evaluated by examining plots of nonmodel-based estimates of the expected proportion correct (conditional on proficiency) versus the proportion correct predicted by the estimated item response function (see Chapter 9, and Mislevy & Sheehan, 1987, p. 302). In making decisions about excluding items from the final scales, a balance was sought between being too stringent, hence deleting too many items and possibly damaging the content representativeness of the pool of scaled items, and being too lenient, hence including items with model fit poor enough to endanger the types of modelbased inferences made from NAEP results. A certain degree of misfit was tolerated for a number of items included in the final scales.\n. Most of the items fit the model well. Items excluded from the analysis of the 1996 assessment were the same items that were deleted from the 1994 reading long-term trend analysis. Table 14-6 lists items that were excluded from the analysis of the 1996 long-term trend assessment.\nThe adequacy of the assumption of a common item response function across assessment years was also evaluated by comparing the nonmodel-based expected proportions for each assessment year to the single, model-based item response function fit by BILOG/PARSCALE. Items that showed clear evidence of functioning differently across assessments were treated as separate items for each assessment year--that is, separate item response functions were estimated for each assessment. As was the case with deleting items, in making decisions about scaling items separately by assessment year, a balance was sought between being too stringent, hence splitting too many items and possibly damaging the common item link between the assessment years, and being too lenient, hence including items with model fit poor enough to endanger the model-based trend inferences. These separately scaled items will be reexamined in future long-term trend assessments.\nAt age 9, one constructed-response item was calibrated separately for each assessment year. Examination of residual plots identified the item as functioning differently across assessments. Figure 14-1 shows item NO14502 from the analysis for grade 4/age 9. Data are presented for 1994 (squares), and for 1996 (asterisks)3. For middle proficiency values, the two sets of symbols diverge, and the discrepancy of the item characteristic curves of the two years is substantial. The top (1994 data), and the bottom (1996 data) of Figure 14-2 show the plots for the item treated separately by assessment year. The 1996 data showed poorer fit. In order to maintain the link for the trend, this item was kept in the analysis but with the 1994 data calibrated separately and the 1996 data excluded from the final calibration. The remaining misfit is relatively small. Overall, one long-term trend reading item was calibrated separately by assessment year. Table 14-7 lists the item that was calibrated separately across assessment years.\n\n3 The size of the symbols are proportional to the estimated number of students at a particular scale score level. The symbols are ordinarily larger in the middle of the theta scale, where most students' scale scores fall.\n\n359\n\n329\n\n\fFigure 14-1 Example Long-Term Trend Item (N014502, Age 9) Demonstrating Differential Item Functioning Across Assessment Years 1994 and 19961\n\nNAEP ID: N014502\n\nSEQUENCE: 104\n\nSCALE: TOTAL\n\n-4.0\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nTHETA\n\na = 0.5294\nb = -0.5177 c = 0.0000 n alt = 0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4 0\n\n'This plot compares empirical and model-based estimates of the item response function (IRF).

In preliminary calibrations, both items did not fit the model well and had large slope-parameter values (3.9 and 5.0, respectively). The item response function of N002202 also demonstrated an elevated tail. Further examination of the items indicated that this might be due to local dependence of the items, although neither item had been problematic at this age group in the 1994 assessment. The approach of fixing the slope-parameter was taken to obtain stable item parameter estimates. At calibration stage-two, after the estimation of the proficiency distribution was constrained to be normally distributed and calibrated to convergence, the slope-parameter of N002201 was fixed at the value, and all items were calibrated to convergence. Parameters estimates from this run served as the final estimates for age 17.\nA list of the items scaled for each of the ages, along with their item parameter estimates, appears in Appendix D.\n\n14.5 GENERATION OF PLAUSIBLE VALUES\n\nThe generation of plausible values was conducted independently for each age/grade level for each of the assessment years. The item parameters from B1LOG/PARSCALE, final student weights, item responses, and selected background variables were used with the computer program BGROUP (described in Chapter 11) to generate the values for each age. The background variables included student\ndemographic characteristics (i.e., race/ethnicity of the student, highest level of education attained by parents), students' perceptions about reading, and student behavior both in and out of school (e.g., amount of television watched daily, amount of homework done each day). Appendix C gives the codings for the conditioning variables for the three age groups. Table 14-8 contains a list of the number of background contrasts included in conditioning, as well as the proportion of variance accounted for by the conditioning model for each age/grade.\n\nTable 14-8 Proportion of Proficiency Variance Accounted for by the Conditioning Model\nfor the Reading Long-Term Trend Assessment\n\nAge/Grade 9/4\n13/8 17/11\nExcluding the constant term.\n\nNumber of Conditioning Contrasts'\n49 49 47\n\nProportion of Proficiency Variance\n.32 .35 .34\n\nnr\n332\n\n\f14.6 THE FINAL READING LONG-TERM TREND SCALE\nThe linear indeterminacy of the long-term trend scale was resolved by linking the 1996 long-term trend scales to previous long-term trend scales. For each age, the item parameters from the joint calibration based on data from both 1994 and 1996 were used with the 1994 data to reestimate plausible values for the 1994 data. The mean and standard deviation of the new 1994 estimates were calculated and matched to the mean and standard deviation of the old 1994 plausible values that were reported previously. The linear constants of this transformation were then applied to transform the 1996 scales to the 1994 proficiency metric. The transformation equations (described in Chapter 9) that resulted from this matching of the first two moments for the 1994 data are\nAge 9: Otarget 54.57 ()calibrated + 206.13,\nAge 13: ()target = 39.06 Ocalibrated + 257.88, and\nAge 17: Otarget = 44.14 ()calibrated + 283.19,\nwhere Otarget denotes values on the final transformed scale, and \u00b0calibrated denotes values on the calibration scale. Overall summary statistics for the long-term trend samples are given in Table 14-9.\nAs in the past, interpretation of the long-term trend results was facilitated through the provision of scale anchoring information. In 1984, five NAEP reading scale levels were selected as anchor points. These points (described in Trends in Academic Progress) are:\n150 = simple, discrete reading tasks; 200 = partially developed skills and understanding; 250 = interrelation of ideas and generalizations; 300 = understanding complicated information; and 350 = learning from specialized reading materials.\nDetailed descriptions of the skills required to read at each level were derived and benchmark exercises were selected to exemplify each level. These same anchor points were used in the 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 reading long-term trend reports. The estimated proportion of students in each reporting category who are at or above each anchor point was examined in Trends in Academic Progress.\n14.7 PARTITIONING OF THE ESTIMATION ERROR VARIANCE\nFor each age, the error variance of the final, transformed proficiency mean was partitioned into two parts as described in Chapter 11. This analysis yielded estimates of the proportion of error variance due to sampling students, and the proportion of error variance due to the latent nature of 0. These estimates are given in Table 14-10 (for stability, the estimates of the between-imputation variance, B, in Equation 11.9 are based on 100 imputations).

Norris Educational Testing Service\n\n15.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes the analyses performed on the responses to the cognitive and background items in the 1996 long-term trend assessment of mathematics. The emphasis of this chapter is on the methods and results of procedures used to develop the IRT-based scale scores; however, some attention is given to the analysis of constructed-response items. The theoretical underpinnings of the IRT and plausible values methodology described in this chapter are given in Chapter 11.\n\nThe objectives of the mathematics analyses were to prepare scale values and perform all analyses\nnecessary to produce a long-term trend report in matliematics. The mathematics long-term trend results include the years 1973, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. The results of 1996 long-term trend assessment of mathematics are presented in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Studentsin Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to\n1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997).\n\nThe student samples that were administered mathematics items in the 1996 long-term trend assessment are shown in Table 15-1. See Chapters 1 and 3 for descriptions of the target populations and\nthe sample design used for the assessment.\n\nTable 15-1 NAEP 1996 Mathematics Long-Term Trend Student Samples\n\nSample Booklet IDs Mode\n\n9 [MS-LTTrend] 13 [MS-LTTrend] 17 [MS-LTTrend]\n\n91-93 91-93 84-85\n\nTape Tape Tape\n\nCohort Assessed\nAge 9 Age 13 Age 17\n\nTime of Testing\n1/3/96 - 3/8/96 (Winter) 10/9/95 12/22/95 (Fall) 3/11/96 - 5/10/96 (Spring)\n\nAge Definition\nCY CY Not CY\n\nModal Grade\n4 8\n11\n\nLEGEND\n\nMS LTTrend Tape CY Not CY\n\nMathematics and science Long-term trend assessment: booklets are identical to 1986 long-term trend assessments\nAudiotape administration Calendar year: birthdates (1996 sample) in 1986 and 1982 for ages 9 and 13 Age 17 only (1996 sample): birthdates between October 1 and September 30 of the appropriate years\n\nNumber Assessed\n5,414 5,658 3,539\n\nliahe Qian was the primary person responsible for the planning, specification, and coordination of the mathematics long-term trend analyses. Computer activities for all long-term trend mathematics scaling and data analyses were performed by Norma\nNorris. Nancy Allen and Eiji Muraki provided consultation.\n\n365\n\n335\n\n\fData from the 1996 long-term trend samples that contributed to the trends in mathematics achievement were scaled separately from the 1996 mathematics main samples. Accordingly, the long-term trend analysis and main analysis are presented in separate chapters. This chapter pertains to the scaling of the long-term trend data; information about the scaling of the data from the mathematics main assessment samples is presented in Chapter 12.\nThe long-term trend results reported in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress are based on paced-tape administrations and occur at all age levels. The samples involved in the analysis are shown as 9[MS-LTI'rend], 13[MS-LTTrend], and 17[MS-LTTrend] in Table 15-1. For ages 9 and 13, the longterm trend booklets contained blocks of reading, mathematics and science items. In the assessments, the mathematics and science blocks were administered by audiotape to pace the students through blocks (the reading blocks were only presented in print form). The age 17 long-term trend booklets contained only mathematics and science blocks, both administered by paced-tape recordings as well. All students received a block of common background questions, yet distinct for each age. Subject-area background questions were presented in the cognitive blocks. The booklets for the age 9 and age 13 samples (Booklets 91-93) are the same as those used for long-term trend assessments in 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994. The booklets for the age 17 sample (Booklets 84-85) are the same as those Used for the 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994 long-term trend assessments. The booklets and the blocks within those booklets are listed in Tables 4-20 through 4-22 in chapter 4.\nTable 15-2 clarifies the relationships among the 1996 long-term trend samples and samples from previous years. For ages 9, 13, and 17, the paced-tape bridge to the 1986 samples allows direct comparisons between the samples from the long-term assessments after 1990 and the 1986 long-term trend samples. There was also a paced-tape administration in 1988, at ages 9 and 13, that was comparable to the other years. However, a paced-tape administration was not conducted at age 17 in 1988. Instead, a noncomparable paper-based assessment was administered. Hence, 1988 is not included as a point in the long-term trend reporting. In 1986, the mathematics long-term trend items were scaled with common items from the 1978 and 1982 assessments. Because the 1973 assessment had few items in common with the current assessment, data from that assessment was not scaled using the IRT model but was linked to the trend line by a linear transformation involving the mean proportion correct for common items (See Expanding the New Design: The NAEP 1985-86 Technical Report (Beaton, 1988)). When comparisons were made including the 1970 and 1973 assessment results, z-tests rather than t-tests were used to test statistical significance (See Section 18.5.1). The 1996 long-term trend assessment was linked to the 1973, 1978, and 1982 assessments through the 1986 assessment. Inforination about previous assessment years is available in Expanding the New Design: The NAEP 1985-86 Technical Report (Beaton, 1988), The NAEP 1992 Technical Report (Johnson & Carlson, 1994), and The NAEP 1994 Technical Report (Allen, Kline, & Zelenak, 1996).\nTable 15-3 indicates the number of items in common across different age combinations. Table 15-4 shows the number of items scaled in 1996 that were common across assessment years. The 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 assessments had all items in common. For age 9, the number of items common across assessment years 1978 to 1996 was only 35; for age 13, it was 56; and for age 17, it was 54. Item parameters were estimated assuming a univariate scale, since the number of items presented to each student was small and there were too few items to estimate several content area scales separately.\n\n336\n\nSo'\n\n26 6\n\n\fTable 15-2 NAEP Mathematics Samples Contributing to 1996 Long-Term Trend Results, 1973-1996\n\nCohort Assessed\nAge 9\nAge 13\nAge 17\n\nYear\n1973 1978 1982 1986 1990 1992 1994 1996,\n1973 1978 1982 1986 1990 1992 1994 1996\n1973 1978 1982 1986 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\nSample\nMain Main Main LTTrend1 LTTrendi LTTrend1 LTTrendi LTTrend1\nMain Main Main LTTrend1 LTTrend1 LTTrend1 LTI'rend1 LTI'rend1\nMain Main Main LTTrend1 LTTrend1 LTTrend1 LTTrend1 LTTrend1\n\nSubjects\nMS\nMCS MS MS MS MS MS\nMS\nMCS MS MS MS MS MS\nMS\nMCS MS MS MS MS MS\n\nTime of Testing\nWinter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter\nFall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall\nSpring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring\n\nMode of Administration\nTape Tape Tape Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2\nTape Tape Tape Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2\nTape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape\n\nAge Definition\nCY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY\nCY CY CY CY CY CY CY CY\nNot CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY\n\nModal Grade\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11\n\nI Within an age group, these samples received common booklets. 2 Mathematics and science administered by audiotape, reading administered by print.\n\nLEGEND\nMS MCS LTTrend\n\nMathematics Mathematics and science Mathematics, civics, and science Long-term trend: booklets are identical to the long-term trend assessment of 1986.\n\nMain Tape CY\nNot CY\n\nMain assessment Audiotape administration Calendar year: birthdates (1996 sample) in 1986 and 1982 for ages 9 and 13 Age 17 only (1996 sample): birthdates between October 1 and September 30 of the\nappropriate years\n\nThe steps in the mathematics long-term trend analysis are documented in the following sections. Consistent with the procedures in earlier NAEP analyses, the first step was to calculate standard item statistics. The results served as a check for data entry errors and as a reasonableness check against results\nfrom previous assessments.\nThe second step was to fit an IRT model to the data from the 1996 and 1994 assessments for each age separately. This procedure puts item parameters and ability estimates on the same scale across years. The same item may have different item parameters for different age groups.\n\n367\n\n337\n\n\fTable 15-3 Numbers of Scaled Mathematics Long-Term Trend\nItems Common Across Ages\n\nAge Total\n\nBooklet Numbers\n\nNumber of Items\n153\n\n9 only\n\n91-93\n\n32\n\n13 only\n\n91-93\n\n30\n\n17 only\n\n84-85\n\n41\n\n9 and 13 only 91-93, 91-93\n\n20\n\n9 and 17 only 91-93, 84-85\n\n0\n\n13 and 17 only 91-93, 84-85\n\n27\n\n9, 13, and 17 91-93, 91-93, 84-85\n\n3\n\nTable 15-4\nNumbers of Scaled Mathematics Long-Term Trend Items Common Across Assessments\n\nAssessment Year\n1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 1978, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996\n\nNumber of Items\n\nAge 9\n\nAge 13 Age 17\n\n55\n\n80\n\n71\n\n53\n\n79\n\n65\n\n35\n\n56\n\n54\n\n35\n\n56\n\n54\n\nNext, the analysis for an age group was completed by the creation of plausible values through a\n\nmultiple imputation estimation procedure in which item parameter estimates, student responses, and\n\nstudent background information were combined to produce the most subgroup ability.

The conventional item analysis, with results displayed in Table 15-5, was performed at the block level on the paced-tape long-term trend data.\nTable 15-5 contains the number of items, size of the sample administered to the block, mean weighted proportion correct, mean weighted r-biserial, and mean weighted alpha as a measure of\n\n338\n\n1/4.,\n\n363\n\n\freliability for each block. The average values were calculated using examinee weights and the items in the block that were scaled. The 1996 item-level statistics were not very different from those for the 1994 assessment. Similar statistics for the 1994 assessment were reported in Table 16-5 of The NAEP 1994 Technical Report.\n\nTable 15-5 Descriptive Statistics for Item Blocks in the Mathematics Long-Term Trend Samples (1996)\n\nStatistic\n\nBlock\n\nM1\n\nM2\n\nM31\n\nAge 9 Number of scaled items Number of scaled constructed response items Unweighted sample size Average weighted proportion correct Average weighted r-biserial Weighted alpha reliability\n\n24 9 1,852 .62 .61 .82\n\n26 9\n1,841 .64 .65 .86\n\n5\n0 1,721\n.68 .83 .50\n\nAge 13\nNumber of scaled items Number of scaled constructed response items Unweighted sample size Average weighted proportion correct Average weighted r-biserial Weighied alpha reliability\n\n36 9 1,928 .68 .59 .87\n\n36 8\n1,864 .62 .55 .85\n\n8\n0 .\n1,866 .66 .68 .61\n\nAge 17\nNumber of scaled items Number of scaled constructed response items Unweighted sample size Average weighted proportion correct Average weighted r-biserial Weighted alpha reliability\n\n33 10 1,848 .66 .69 .90\n\n33 5 1,848 .67 .63 .87\n\n5\n1\n1,691 .56 .76 .54\n\nThis block is mostly calculator items, which were not analyzed. For the item analysis, students who did not respond to any items in the block were omitted; however, such students were assigned proficiencies in the final database.\n\nIn the 1996 mathematics long-term trend assessment, 20 percent of the samples of the constructed-response items were used to check the interrater reliabilitythe score agreement between first and second raters. The percent of exact agreement ranged from 96.3 to 100 percent; and the intraclass correlation ranged from .902 to 1.00except .886 for item N269201 in the age 13 sample. In general, the interrater reliability was very high in the 1996 mathematics long-term trend assessment.\nThe correspondence between blocks, booklets, and samples is given for the mathematics longterm trend assessment in Tables 4-20 through 4-22 in Chapter 4. Common labeling of these blocks across ages does not denote common items.\n\n339\n- 369\n\n\f15.3 IRT SCALING FOR THE MATHEMATICS LONG-TERM TREND ASSESSMENT\n15.3.1 Item Parameter Estimation\nThe scaling process began with the estimation of item parameters. IRT parameters were estimated using the NAEP version of the BILOG/PARSCALE program (Mislevy & Bock, 1982; Muraki & Bock, 1991) described in Chapter 11. Item calibration was performed separately for each of the three age groups, using the total combined data from the 1994 and 1996 assessments. Including the 1994 assessment data assures that item parameters will be similar for adjacent assessments so that year-to-year trends will not be distorted by abrupt changes in calibration. The calibration was performed on the entire sample of students, resulting in a range of about 1,700 to 1,900 examinee responses to each item in each assessment year. The calibration was based on student weights that were rescaled for the 1996 data so that the sum of the weights equaled the unweighted sample size. Also, weights for the 1996 data were restandardized to give equal weight to the two assessment years included in the scaling. As with the previous assessment, calculator items were excluded from the analysis. Because calculators have changed greatly since the start of the long-term trend assessment, it was judged that calculator questions are no longer comparable across time. These items were kept in the assessment, since excluding them would have changed the testing context.\nSince parameters for items in blocks MI, M2, and M3 were estimated separately for ages 9, 13, and 17, items administered at more than one age have multiple sets of item parameter estimates. Items were examined for lack of fit with the data. Those that exhibited extreme violation of IRT assumptions (i.e., did not have monotonically increasing item characteristic curves) were deleted from the analysis, as .they were in previous assessments. Other items were deleted because they were calculator items, which were not considered part of the regular assessment. These excluded items appear in Tables 15-6, 15-7, and 15-8. As a result of these deletions, 55 items were scaled for age 9, 80 items were scaled for age 13, and 71 items were scaled for age 17. Of the 153 noncalculator items that were part of the assessment, seven items (5%) were excluded due to poor fit with the data. A list of the items scaled for each of the ages, along with their item parameter estimates, appears in Appendix D.\n15.4 DERIVED BACKGROUND VARIABLES\nIn the long-term trend analysis, all derived background variables were used to define subgroups of students for reporting. For this reason, these variables were also used in conditioning. Derived reporting variables are described in Appendix B.\n340\nL. 370\n\n\fTable 15-6 Items Deleted from the Age 9 Mathematics Long-Term Trend Analysis\n\nBooklet IDs Block Item\n\nReason for Exclusion\n\n91\n\nM1 N252601 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\nN262502 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\n92\n\nM3 N268221 Calculator itemi\n\nN276021 Calculator item\n\nN276022 Calculator item\n\nN276821 Calculator item\n\nN276822 Calculator item\n\nN276823 Calculator item\n\nN277621 Calculator item\n\nN277622 Calculator item\n\nN277623 Calculator item\n\nN284021 Calculator item\n\nN284022 Calculator item\n\nI All calculator items were deleted from the analysis.\n\nTable 15-7 Items Deleted from the Age 13 Mathematics Long-Term Trend Analysis\n\nBooklet IDs Block Item\n\nReason for Exclusion\n\n91\n\nM1 N262502 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\n93\n\nM2 N261601 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\n92\n\nM3 N264521 Calculator item'\n\nN259921 Calculator item\n\nN276821 Calculator item\n\nN276822 Calculator item\n\nN276823 Calculator item\n\nN278921 Calculator item\n\nN278922 Calculator item\n\nN278923 Calculator item\n\nN278924 Calculator item\n\nN278925 Calculator item\n\nN280621 Calculator item\n\nN280622 Calculator item\n\nN280623 Calculator item\n\nN280624 Calculator item\n\nN280625 Calculator item\n\nN280626 Calculator item\n\nI All calculator items were deleted from the analysis.\n\n371\n\n341\n\n\fTable 15-8 Items Deleted from the Age 17 Mathematics Long-Term Trend Analysis\n\nBooklet\n\nIDs\n\nBlock\n\nItem\n\nReason for Exclusion\n\n84\n\nM1\n\nN282801 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\nN285701 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\n84\n\nM2\n\nN266801 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\nN255301 Was deleted in prior assessment\n\n85\n\nM3 N259921 Calculator item'\n\nN264321 Calculator item\n\nN264521 Calculator item\n\nN267921 Calculator item\n\nN276821 Calculator item\n\nN276822 Calculator item\n\nN276823 Calculator item\n\nN278921 Calculator item\n\nN278922 Calculator item\n\nN278923 Calculator item\n\nN278924 Calculator item\n\nN278925 Calculator item\n\nN280621 Calculator item\n\nN280622 Calculator item\n\nN280623 Calculator item\n\nN280624 Calculator item\n\nN280625 Calculator item\n\nN280626 Calculator item\n\nN285321 Calculator item\n\n'All calculator items were deleted from the analysis.\n\n15.5 GENERATION OF PLAUSIBLE VALUES\nPlausible values were calculated separately for each age group. In this phase of analysis, student background information was used to condition item responses in order to more accurately estimate average subgroup abilities. The conditioning program BGROUP was used to combine NAEP BILOG/PARSCALE item parameters with weighted item responses and background variables to produce posterior ability estimates called plausible values. As defined in Chapter 11, BGROUP is an enhanced version of the original conditioning program, MGROUP. Plausible values are not test scores in the usual sense, but can be used to provide consistent estimates of population characteristics. There were 53 contrasts in the conditioning model at age 9, 56 at age 13, and 63 at age 17. Appendix C gives the codings for the conditioning variables for the three age groups. A check was made on the distributions of the plausible values for each age, including inspection of the whole group and subgroup means and standard deviations. Table 15-9 contains a list of the number of background contrasts included in conditioning, as well as the proportion of variance accounted for by the conditioning model for each age/grade.\n\n342\n\n372\n\n\fTable 15-9 Proportion of Proficiency Variance Accounted for by the Conditioning Model\nfor the Mathematics Long-Term Trend Assessment\n\nNumber of Age/Grade Conditioning Contrasts'\n\nProportion of Proficiency Variance\n\n9/4\n\n53\n\n.37\n\n13/8\n\n56\n\n.35\n\n17/12\n\n63\n\n.57\n\nI Including the constant term.\n\n15.6 THE FINAL MATHEMATICS LONG-TERM TREND SCALE\nSince the plausible value (theta) scales have a linear indeterminacy, comparisons with previous assessments will be sensible only if the scale is linearly transformed to a meaningful metric. This indeterminacy was resolved by linking the 1996 scales to previous long-term trend scales. The 1996 data had to be transformed to compensate for linear changes in the scale due to employing newly estimated item parameters and new BGROUP conditioning parameters in 1996. The transformation was accomplished by first reestimating the 1994 student abilities using 1996 item parameters and 1996 BGROUP parameters. (For score metric transformation, see Chapter 9.) The new 1994 ability estimates were then equated to the old 1994 ability estimates by matching the first two moments (i.e., the mean and standard deviation). The constants for this transformation were then applied to the 1996 data. The transformation equations that resulted are\nAge 9: Otarget = 34.04 ()calibrated + 230.46\nAge 13: \u00b0target = 33.08 Ocalibrated + 273.91\nAge 17: ()target = 30.46 ()calibrated + 306.57,\nwhere Otarget denotes an individual's value on the final transformed scale of the 1996 data and Ocahbrated denotes an individual's value on the original 1996 theta scale. Overall summary statistics for the long-term trend samples are given in Table 15-10. For the descriptions of the results of the mathematics long-term trend study, see NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997).\nTo provide a context for interpreting the overall mathematics long-term trend results, the NAEP mathematics results were \"anchored\" at five NAEP mathematic scale levels. These points (described in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress) are:\n150 = simple arithmetic facts; 200 = beginning skills and understanding; 250 = numerical operations and beginning problem solving; 300 = moderately complex procedures and reasoning; and 350 = multi-step problem solving and algebra.\nThese same anchor points were used in the 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994 mathematics longterm trend reports.\n\n343\n373\n\n\fTable 15-10 Means and Standard Deviations on the Mathematics Long-Term Trend Proficiency Scale\n\nAll Five Plausible Values\n\nAge\n\nAssessment\n\nMean\n\nS.

Norris Educational Testing Service\n16.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes the analyses performed on the responses to the cognitive and background items in the 1996 long-term trend assessment of science. The objectives of the science analyses are to prepare scale values and perform all analyses necessary to produce a long-term trend report in science. The results obtained from these analyses includes the years 1969-1970, 1973, 1977, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996, and are presented in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997). The theoretical underpinnings of the IRT and the plausible values methodology used in this chapter are described in Chapter 9 and Chapter 11, and are therefore not detailed here.\nThe student samples that were administered science items in the 1996 long-term trend assessment are shown in Table 16-1 as 9[MS-LTTrend], 13[MS-LTTrend], and 17[MS-LTTrend]. (See Chapters 1 and 3 for descriptions of the target populations and the sample design used for the assessment.) Data from the long-term trend samples that contributed to the trends in science achievement were scaled separately from the 1996 science main focused-BIB samples. Accordingly, the long-term trend and main analyses are presented in separate chapters. Information about the scaling of the data from the science main focused-BLB samples is presented in Chapter 13.\nThe science long-term trend results reported in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress are based on paced-tape administrations at all three age levels. For ages 9 and 13, the long-term trend booklets contain one mathematics block, one reading block, and one science block. The science and mathematics blocks were paced by tape-recordings (i.e., tape-recordings were used to be sure that the items were read in a consistent manner in every session and pace students through the blocks) and the reading block was presented in print form only and were not paced by tape-recordings. The age 17 longterm trend booklets contain only mathematics and science blocks, both paced by tape-recordings. All students received a block of common background questions, distinct for each age. Subject-area background questions were presented in the cognitive blocks. The booklets for the age 9 and age 13 samples (Booklets 91-93) and the booklets for the age 17 samples (Booklets 84-85) are the same as those used for long-term trend assessments in 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994. The booklets and the blocks within those booklets are listed in Chapter 4. Additional information about all of the items in these blocks is also found in that chapter. This chapter includes specific information about the long-term trend items that were scaled.\n\nI Jinming Zhang was the primary person responsible for the planning, specification, and coordination of the science long-term trend analyses. Computer activities for all long-term trend science scaling and data analyses were performed by Norma Norris. Nancy Allen, Eiji Muraki, and John Donoghue provided consultation.\n\nf'.;.\n\n345\n\nLi\n\n\fTable 16-1 NAEP 1996 Long-Term Trend Science Student Samples\n\nSample\n\nBooldet IDs\n\n9 [MS-LTTrend] 13 [MS-LTTrend] 17 [MS-LTTrend]\n\n91-93 91-93 84-85\n\nLEGEND\n\nCohort Mode Assessed\n\nTape Tape Tape\n\nAge 9 Age 13 Age 17\n\nTime of Testing\n1/3/96 3/8/96 (Winter) 1019195 12/22/95 (Fall) 3/11/96 5/10/96 (Spring)\n\nAge Definition\nCY CY Not CY\n\nMS\n\nMathematics and science\n\nLTTrend Long-term trend assessment: booklets are identical to 1986 long-term trend assessments\n\nTape\n\nAudiotape administration\n\nCY\n\nCalendar year: birthdates in 1986 and 1982 for ages 9 and 13, respectively\n\nNot CY Age 17 only: birthdates between October 1, 1978, and September 30, 1979\n\nModal Grade\n4\n8 11\n\nNumber Assessed\n5,414 5,658 3,539\n\nTable 16-2 clarifies the relationships among the 1996 long-term trend samples and samples from previous years. For all ages, the 1996 science long-term trend samples allow direct comparisons with 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1994 long-term trend samples because the same booklets were used in these assessments. There was also a tape administration in 1988 at ages 9 and 13 that was comparable to the other years. However, a tape administration was not conducted at age 17 in 1988. Instead, a noncomparable paper-based assessment was conducted. Hence, 1988 is not included as a point in the long-term trend reporting. In 1986, the science long-term trend items were scaled with common items from the 1977 and 1982 assessments. Because of the small number of items in common with those in the 1969-70 and 1973 assessments, data from the 1969-70 and 1973 assessments were not scaled using the IRT model, but were linked to the long-term trend line by a linear transformation involving the logit of mean proportion correct for common items. When comparisons were made including the 1969-70 and 1973 assessment results, z-tests rather than t-tests were used to test statistical significance (See Section 18.5.1). From 1990, each new long-term trend assessment was linked to the previous assessments through the last assessment. For instance, the 1996 long-term trend assessment was linked to the previous assessments through the 1994 long-term trend assessment. Information about previous assessment years, including 1969-70 and 1973, is available in Chapter 11 of Expanding the New Design: The NAEP 198586 Technical Report (Yamamoto, 1988), Chapter 14 of The NAEP 1990 Technical Report (Johnson & Allen, 1992), Chapter 14 of The NAEP 1992 Technical Report (Allen & Isham, 1994), and Chapter 17 of The NAEP 1994 Technical Report (Swinton, Allen, Isham & Chen, 1996).\nThe numbers of scaled items in common across different ages are presented in Table 16-3. As was done with previous long-term trend analyses, each age was scaled separately and the long-term trend scales are univariate. Derivation of scales for specific content areas was not feasible given the limited number of items presented to students in the long-term trend samples. The number of items scaled in 1996 that were common across assessment years is presented in Table 16-4.\nThe steps in the science long-term trend analysis are documented in the following sections. As is usual in NAEP analyses, the first step was to gather item-level and block-level information. Then, the cognitive items were calibrated according to the IRT model. Next, derived background variables were calculated, and plausible values were generated after conditioning on available background variables and selected two-way interactions. Finally, the scale values were placed on the final science long-term trend scale used in previous trend assessments.\n\n346\n376\n\n\fTable 16-2 NAEP Science Samples Contributing to 1996 Long-Term Trend Results, 1970-1996\n\nCohort Assessed Year\n\nSample\n\nTime of\n\nMode of\n\nAge\n\nSubjects Testing Administration Definition\n\nModal Grade\n\nAge 9 Age 13\n\n1970 1973 1977 1982 1986 1990 1992 1994 1996\n1970 1973 1977 1982 1986 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\nMain Main Main Main LTTrend' LTTrend'\nLThend'\nLTTrend' LTTrend '\nMain Main Main Main LTTrend' LTTrend' LTTrend' LTTrend' LTTrend\n\nSWC MS SCI MSC MS MS MS MS MS\nSWC MS SCI MSC MS MS MS MS MS\n\nWinter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter\nFall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall\n\nTape Tape Tape Tape Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2\nTape Tape Tape Tape Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2 Tape2\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\nCY\n\n4\n\n8 CY\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nCY\n\n8\n\nAge 17\n\n1969 1973 1977 1982 1986 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\nMain Main Main Main LTTrend' LTTrend' LTTrend' LTTrend' LTTrend '\n\nSWC MS SCI MSC MS MS MS MS MS\n\nSpring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring\n\nTape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape Tape\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nNot CY\n\n11\n\nI Within an age group, these samples received common booklets. 2 Mathematics and science administered by audiotape, reading administered by print.\n\nLEGEND\n\nSCI MS MSC SWC\n\nScience Mathematics and science Mathematics, science, and citizenship\nScience, writing, and citizenship\n\nMain Main assessment\n\nLTTrend\nTape CY\nNot CY\n\nLong-term trend: booklets are identical to the longterm trend assessment of 1986\nAudiotape administration Calendar year: birthdates in 1986 and 1992 for ages 9 and 13 in the 1996 assessment Age 17 only: birthdates between October 1 and September 30 of the appropriate years\n\n377\n\n347\n\n\fTable 16-3 Numbers of Scaled Science Long-Term Trend\nItems Common Across Ages\n\nAge\n9 only 13 only 17 only 9 and 13 only 9 and 17 only 13 and 17 only 9, 13, and 17\nTotal\n\nBooklet Numbers\n91-93 91-93 84-85 91-93, 91-93 91-93, 84-85 91-93, 84-85 91-93, 91-93, 84-85\n\nNumber of Items\n55 30 32 0 0\n451\n1\n163\n\n'One of these items (N406303) was treated as a different item from 1990 in the scaling of the 1992 assessment, but only for age 13.

Table 16-5 contains information about the science long-term trend blocks. These blocks were presented to samples 9[MS-LTTrend], 13[MS-LTTrencl], and 17[MSLTTrend]. At all ages, the blocks labeled S I, S2, and S3 were presented intact to students in the 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 long-term trend samples. The age 9 and age 13 blocks appeared in Booklets 91 through 93. For age 17, Block S3 was in Booklet 84, and Blocks S1 and S2 were in Booklet 85. The correspondence between blocks, booklets, and samples is given for the long-term trend assessment in Tables 4-14 through 4-16 in Chapter 4. Common labeling of these blocks across ages does not denote common items.\nTable 16-5 contains the number of scaled items, size of the sample administered to the block, mean weighted proportion correct, mean.weighted r-biserial, and mean weighted alpha as a measure of reliability for each block. The average values were calculated using examinee sampling weights and the\n348\n378\n\n\fresponses to the items in the block that were scaled. On average, the 1996 item-level statistics were not very different from those for the 1994 assessments. The percent of examinees not reaching items in the science long-term trend blocks was almost always zero because the items were administered with a tape-\nrecording to pace response time.\n\nTable 16-5 Descriptive Statistics for Item Blocks in the Science Long-Term Trend Samples ( 1996)\n\nStatistic\n\nBlocks\n\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS3\n\nAge 9 Number of scaled items Number of scaled constructed-response items Unweighted sample size Average weighted proportion correct Average weighted r-biserial Weighted alpha reliability\n\n17\n0 1,852 0.62 .0.57 0.71\n\n20 0\n1,721 0.58 0.48 0.64\n\n19 0\n1,841 0.71 0.58 0.73\n\nAge 13 Number of scaled items Number of scaled constructed-response items Unweighted sample size Average weighted proportion correct Average weighted r-biserial Weighted alpha reliability\n\n23 0\n1,928 0.53 0.53 0.74\n\n30 0 1,866 0.56 0.50 0.79\n\n23 0 1,864 0.61 0.52 0.72\n\nAge 17 Number of scaled items Number of scaled constructed-response items Unweighted sample size .

This item calibration was performed using the NAEP version of the BILOG/PARSCALE program, which combines Mislevy and Bock's (1982) BILOG and Muraki and Bock's (1991) PARSCALE computer programs. Items were calibrated separately for each of the three age groups, using combined data from the 1994 and 1996 assessment years and treating each assessment sample as a sample from a separate subpopulation. In several previous long-term trend analyses, combined data from the last assessment and the current assessment were used for item parameter estimation. The purposes for including the last long-term trend assessment data are to assure that item parameter estimates will be similar for adjacent assessments so that year-to-year trends will not be distorted by abrupt changes in calibration, and to make it possible to link the current long-term trend assessment to the previous assessments through the last assessment. Student weights were used for the calibration. To ensure that\n\n379\n\n349\n\n\feach assessment year had a similar influence on the calibration, student weights for each 1994 age group were multiplied by a constant, to adjust them to have the same sum as the sum of the student weights for the corresponding 1996 age group.\nAlthough other items were examined for irregularities, only items that were deleted from the previous scaling of the paced-tape long-term trend data were excluded in the 1996 analysis. Eight percent of the items (18 items) administered to the long-term trend sample were excluded from analyses of previous assessments. The deleted items appear in Table 16-6. As a result of these deletions, 56 items were scaled for age 9, 76 items were scaled for age 13, and 78 items were scaled for age 17. A list of the items scaled for each of the ages, along with their item parameter estimates, appears in Appendix D.\n\nTable 16-6 Items Deleted from the Paced-Tape Science Long-Term Trend Analysis\n\nBooklet\n\nAge\n\nIDs\n\nBlock Item\n\n9\n\n91\n\nS1\n\nN400201\n\n92\n\nS2\n\nN401701\n\n92\n\nS2\n\nN402003\n\n92\n\nS2 N402004\n\n92\n\nS2\n\nN402601\n\n92\n\nS2 N402603\n\n93\n\nS3\n\nN403802\n\nReason for Exclusion Excluded in previous assessment Excluded in previous assessment Excluded in previous assessment Excluded in previous assessment Excluded in previous assessment Excluded in previous assessment Excluded in previous assessment\n\n13\n\n91\n\nS1\n\nN404902\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n91\n\nS1\n\nN404903\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n92\n\nS2\n\nN407501\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n93\n\nS3\n\nN409401\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n93\n\nS3\n\nN409402\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n93\n\nS3\n\nN409403\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n93\n\nS3\n\nN409801\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n17\n\n85\n\nS1\n\nN410001\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n85\n\nS1\n\nN410002\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n85\n\nS1\n\nN410301\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n85\n\nS2\n\nN407402\n\nExcluded in previous assessment\n\n16.3.2 Derived Background Variables\nIn the long-term trend analysis, all variables derived from background questions were used both in generating plausible values and in reporting (to define subgroups). Derived conditioning and reporting variables are described in Appendix B.\n\n350\n3 3 0\n\n\f16.4 GENERATION OF PLAUSIBLE VALUES\nThe generation of plausible values was conducted independently for each age group. The item parameters from NAEP-BILOG/PARSCALE, final student weights, item responses and selected background variables (conditioning variables) were used with the computer program BGROUP (described in Chapter 11) in order to generate the plausible values for each student. There were 49 contrasts in the conditioning model (11.8) at age 9, excluding an overall constant, 52 at age 13, and 58 at age 17. Appendix C gives the codings for the conditioning variables for the three age groups. A check on the distributions of the plausible values for each age was made. The generation of plausible values is described in more detail in Chapters 9 and 11. Table 16-7 contains a list of the number of background contrasts included in conditioning, as well as the proportion of variance accounted for by the conditioning model for each age. This proportion is the ratio of the difference between the total variance and the BGROUP residual variance, divided by the total variance. The total variance is the mean of the\nfive theta-scale variances obtained by their respective plausible values.\n\nTable 16-7 Proportion of Proficiency Variance Accounted for by the Conditioning Model\nfor the Science Long-Term Trend Assessment\n\nNumber of\n\nProportion of\n\nAge\n\nConditioning Contrasts' Proficiency Variance\n\n9\n\n49\n\n0.33\n\n13\n\n52\n\n0.37\n\n17\n\n58\n\n0.46\n\nI Excluding the constant term.\n\n16.5 THE FINAL SCIENCE LONG-TERM TREND SCALE\nThe linear indeterminacy of the long-term trend scale was resolved by linking the 1996 long-term trend scales to the previous long-term trend scales using the following procedure. For each age, the item parameters based on combined data from 1994 and 1996 were used with the 1994 data to find plausible values for the 1994 data. The mean and standard deviation of all of the plausible values (theta scale) were calculated and matched to the mean and standard deviation of all of the science long-term trend scale scores (final reporting scale) based on the 1994 item parameters and 1994 data as reported in the NAEP 1994 Technical Report. The transformations that resulted from this matching ofthe first two moments for\nthe 1994 data are\n\nAge 9: ()target = 38.57 ()calibrated + 232.56, Age 13: ()target = 40.11 ()calibrated + 255.54, and Age 17: ()target = 48.28 Ocahbrated + 293.82,\n\nwhere ()target denotes values on the final reporting scale of the 1996 data and ()calibrated denotes values on the original 1996 calibration (theta) scale.

In 1986, five science scale levels were selected as anchor points, using the process described in Expanding the New Design: The 1985-86 Technical Report (Beaton, 1988). Because the 1996 science long-term trend scale was tied to the 1986 long-term trend scale through the 1990, 1992, and 1994 data, the distribution of proficiency scores derived from the longterm trend samples can be described in terms of scale anchors. The five levels of science proficiency are\n150 = Knows everyday science facts; 200 = Understands simple scientific principles; 250 = Applies basic scientific information; 300 = Analyzes scientific procedures and data; and 350 = Integrates specialized scientific information.\n\n352\n3 8\n\n\f16.6 PARTITIONING OF THE ESTIMATION ERROR VARIANCE\nFor each age, the error variance of the final reporting scale mean was partitioned into two parts as described in Chapter 11. One part of the error variance is due to the sampling of students (sampling variance) and the other is due to the fact that proficiency 0 is a latent variable that is estimated rather than observed. These estimates are given in Table 16-9 (for stability, the estimates of the between-imputation variance, B, in Equation 11.9 are calculated based on 100 imputations).

Kaplan Educational Testing Service\n\n17.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis chapter describes analyses of the writing prompts2 and background items in the 1996 long-term trend assessment of writing. These analyses led to the results reported in the NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress: Achievement of U.S. Students in Science, 1969 to 1996; Mathematics, 1973 to 1996; Reading, 1971 to 1996; and Writing, 1984 to 1996 (Campbell, Voelkl, & Donahue, 1997). Emphasis is given to the psychometric methods used to develop the composite scores that formed the basis of those reports.\nThe 1996 samples used for the analysis of writing achievement are presented in Table 17-1. These samples comprise students selected both on the basis of age and grade in school. For the writing long-term trend analysis, unlike other subject-area long-term trend analyses, only those students selected on the basis of grade were included in the reporting sample, which is referred to as a \"grade-only\" sample. The analyses were based on the full age/grade sample.\n\nTable 17-1 NAEP 1996 Long-Term Trend Writing Student Samples\n\nSample\n\nBooklet\n\nTime of Age\n\nIDs Mode Cohort Assessed Testing_ Definition\n\n9 [RW-LTTrend] 13 [RW-LTTrend] 17 [RW-LTTrend]\n\n51-56 51-56 51-56\n\nPrint Age 9/Grade 4 Winter Print Age 13/Grade 8 Fall Print Age 17/Grade 11 Spring\n\nCY CY Not CY\n\nLEGEND\n\nRW LTTrend Print CY Not CY\n\nReading and writing Long-term trend assessment Printed administration Calendar year: birthdates in 1986, 1982, and 1978, for ages 9, 13, and 17 Age 17 only: birthdates between October 1 and September 30 of the appropriate years\n\nModal Grade\n4 8\n11\n\nNumber Assessed\n5,019 5,493 4,669\n\nI Eiji Muraki was the primary person responsible for the planning, specification, and coordination of the writing long-term trend analyses. Computer activities for all long-term trend writing scaling and data analyses were directed and performed by Bruce Kaplan. 2 The terms \"item\" and \"prompt\" are used interchangeably in this chapter.\n355\n384\n\n\fThe objectives of the writing analyses were to prepare scale values and perform all analyses\nnecessary to produce a long-term trend report in writing. The writing long-term trend results include the years 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. Table 17-2 describes the samples of these years.\n\nTable 17-2 NAEP Writing Samples Contributing to 1996 Long-Term Trend Results, 1984-1996\n\nCohort\nAge 9/ Grade 4\nAge 13/ Grade 8\nAge 17/ Grade 11\n\nYear\n1984 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\n1984 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\n1984 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\nSample\nMain LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2\nMain LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2\nMain LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2 LTTrend2\n\nSubjects\nRW RW RW RW RW RW\nRW RW RW RW RW RW\nRW RW RW RW RW RW\n\nTime of Testing\nWinter, Spring Winter Winter Winter Winter Winter\nWinter, Spring Fall Fall Fall Fall Fall\nWinter, Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring Spring\n\nMode\nPrint Print Print Print Print Print\nPrint Print Print Print Print Print\nPrint Print Print Print Print Print\n\nAge Definition\nCY CY CY CY CY CY\nCY CY CY CY CY CY\nNot CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY Not CY\n\nModal Grade\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8\n8\n11 11 11 11 11 11\n\n2Within an age class group, these samples received common booklets and constituted a trend line.

The 1992 assessment established the first such scale. The 1994 assessment represented the first time that the long-term trend writing scale had to be linked to a previously established scale. The 1996 assessment was directly linked to the 1994 assessment. Sampling weights, as described in Chapter 17, were used for all analyses of the writing prompts.\n\n17.2 LONG-TERM TREND WRITING DATA ANALYSIS\nWhen IRT scaling was used for the long-term trend writing assessment for the first time in 1992, a new scale was developed, and data from the 1984, 1988, 1990, and 1992 long-term trend samples were reanalyzed to establish the scale. The 1994 writing long-term trend points were linked to that scale, and\n356\nr) 0\n\n\fthe 1996 writing long-term trend points, based on data from the 1996 reading/writing long-term trend samples (RW-LTTrend in Table 17-2), were linked to those 1994 writing trend points. Each subsequent assessment matched the 1984 assessment in terms of the time of administration and age definitions. The booklets used in this assessment contained blocks of reading and writing items, as well as background items. Identical booklets were used in 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996.\nThe items on which the long-term trends in writing achievement are based are shown in Table 17-3. The table shows the block that contained the item in 1984 and long-term trend booklets containing the item in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. Twelve writing prompts were used to measure long-term trends, with six prompts presented at each grade level. To allow comparisons in writing ability across grades, three of the six prompts presented to fourth-grade students were also presented to eighth-grade students; three of the eighth-grade prompts were also presented to eleventh-grade students; and one of the common prompts (Appleby House) was presented at all three grade levels.\n\nTable 17-3 Assignment of 1984-96 Writing Long-Term Trend Items in\n1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996\n\nWriting Task\n\n1984 BIB-Spiral Blocks Used for Long-Term Trend Analyses\nAge 9/ Age 13/ Age 17/ Grade 4 Grade 8 Grade 11\n\n1988-96 Long-Term Trend Booklet Numbers Age 9/ Age 13/ Age 17/\nGrade 4 Grade 8 Grade 11\n\nN0003 Recreation Opportunity\n\nN0004 Food on Frontier\n\nN0005 Dissecting Frogs\n\nN0006 XYZ Company\n\nN0009 Radio Station\n\nN0010 Appleby House\n\nN0076 Flashlight\n\nV2\n\nN0147 Plants\n\nN0148 Spaceship\n\nN0180 Space Program\n\nN0190 Job Application\n\nN0210 Bike Lane\n\n52, 54 54,55 54,55\n56 51,53 52,54\n\n52,54 51,54 53,55 53,55 55,56 55,56\n\n52,54 51,54\n55,56\n53,55 53,55 55,56\n\n2Block V was not placed in a booklet with any other writing block in 1984 (all other blocks appeared with every other block at the same grade level in 1984), and hence could not be used in scaling.\n\n17.2.1 Primary Trait Scoring of the Writing Tasks and Measures of Scorer Reliability\nAll writing exercises from the 1996 assessment were scored for task accomplishment (primary trait). For the purposes of analysis, the student responses were coded as 0 (not rated), 1 (unsatisfactory), 2 (minimal), 3 (adequate), and 4 (elaborated). Not-reached and omitted items were excluded from the scaling. The writing long-term trend blocks contained either one or two items. If an item was left blank in a one-item block, it was scored as an omission. Items considered not-reached occurred only in writing blocks that had two cognitive items where the first item was answered and the second was not.\n\n386\n\n357\n\n\fA 25 percent random subsample of all 1996 papers was rescored by a second rater to provide an estimate of interrater reliability. Although the measures of scorer agreement in NAEP have been consistently high, the possibility existed that there might be variation between the ratings provided by the group of scorers assembled in 1996 and the scorers assembled in previous years. Such a variation would be a confounding effect in trend measurement. The most direct way of controlling the effect of across-year variation in scoring would be to eliminate it entirely by rescoring all of the data from the previous four assessments, using the same set of scorers who scored the 1996 data. Unfortunately, resources did not allow for the rescoring of the full set of writing papers, but did allow for a rescoring of over 11,000 of the papers from 1988 (the numbers by prompt and grade are displayed in Table 17-4). The rescored papers for a given item constituted approximately 25 percent of all 1988 papers and consisted of all grade-eligible respondents to selected 1988 booklets containing that item. The procedure of rescoring data from other writing assessments was also used in the previous years' assessments in the current longterm trend analysis (1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994).\nBecause of rigorous training of scorers, it was expected that the between-year variability in scoring would be low enough to permit the use of the full set of the 1988 data. Table 17-4 shows scorer reliability, as measured by the intraclass correlation, for each prompt in the 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 data. The percentage of exact agreement between first and second raters is also given. In addition, the table shows the intraclass correlation and percentage of exact score agreement comparing the scores of samples of the 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 raters with those of the 1988 raters on a sample of the 1988 papers. The reliabilities and percentages of exact agreement (between first and second raters) were generally high for 1996 data, as they were for prior assessments (1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994).\n17.3 ITEM ANALYSIS FOR THE WRITING LONG-TERM TREND ASSESSMENT\nA standard item analysis for polytomous items, as described in Chapter 9, was conducted on the writing-long-term trend item data. Table 17-5 displays the item analysis statistics for each gradethe number of examinees responding to each prompt, the percentage of examinees receiving each of the assigned scores, and the mean score of the prompt. R-polyserials and alpha reliabilities were not calculated since there is only one or two items per block.\nThe results of the item analysis were examined to verify that statistics for each item were in expected ranges. No difficulties were found in this process. Comparisons of item statistics with those of previous years were also made, and it was found that the items had similar statistics for all five years of the long-term trend in writing.\n38

A listing of the prompts used in scaling at the three grade levels is presented in Table 17-6. Five prompts were used at the fourth-grade level and six prompts were used at each of the eighth- and eleventh-grade levels. Either three or four scoring categories were used in the scaling for each of the prompts. Three prompts (N0006, N0009, and NO147) at the fourth-grade level and two (N0006 and N0009) at the eighth-grade level were scaled with three categories because the frequencies of responses in the fourth category were zero or near zero. All other prompts were scaled with four categories. After examining the pattern of omitted, not-reached, off-task, and illegible responses relative to responses to other prompts, it was decided to treat these responses as missing, because there appeared to be no obvious relationship between writing performance and nonresponse (for whatever reason) to other prompts. Treating such prompts as missing meant that they would not enter into the scaling process. One of the prompts administered in the assessment, \"Flashlight,\" was not administered with any other prompt, and therefore could not be put on the same scale as the other prompts. Hence, this prompt was excluded from scaling and from the number of prompts cited above.\nThe resulting sample sizes for scaling the long-term trend items are provided in Table 17-6. The 1984 long-term trend point was based on a rescoring of a sample of the 1984 data by the 1988 raters. For details, see Johnson (1990).\nWhen the long-term trend items were administered for the first time in 1984, they were used as part of the 1984 BIB design. By applying the additional information that was obtained from the 1984 design, the long-term trend items for each grade were calibrated together. This task was not straightforward. Due to rater drift, the 1984 original data for long-term trend items had to be rescored in 1988 and not all the booklets were included in the rescoring. Although enough information was captured to calibrate all the fourth-grade items together, this was not the case for the eighth- and eleventh-grade items. There were two non-overlapping groups of items at these two grade levels. Items within the groups were administered to common samples of examinees, but there were no common samples for items between these two groups. This prohibited a direct linking via scaling all items simultaneously. As a result, an additional step was required for these two grade levels.\nAge 9/Grade 4 Level. For this level, the generalized partial credit model was used to calibrate, simultaneously, the prompts in the 1994 and 1996 data. This required a single run on the NAEP BILOG/PARSCALE computer program specifying two subpopulations, one for each year.\nAge 13/Grade 8 and Age 17/Grade 11 Levels. For each of these two levels, two separate PARSCALE computer runs were conducted, one on each of the two separate groups of prompts discussed above. Like the fourth-grade level, the 1994 and 1996 data were simultaneously scaled using two subpopulations.\n362\n394\n\n\fNAEP Item\n\n1984 Rescore\n\nTable 17-6 Age/Grade Sample Sizes for Scaling Items Used in Long-Term Trends in Writing Petformance'\n\nAge 9/Grade 4 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\n1984 Rescore\n\nAge 13/Grade 8 1988 1990 1992\n\n1984 1994 1996 Rescore\n\nAge 17/Grade 11\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\nN0006 XYZ Company\n\n603\n\n1398 1679 2023 1488 1393\n\n751\n\nNO009 Radio Station\n\n582\n\n1506 1794 2099 1577 1495\n\n713\n\nN0010 Appleby House\n\n530\n\n1143 1413 1684 1217 1133\n\n674\n\nNO147 Plants\n\n709\n\n1604 1833 2213 1708 1552\n\n2\n\nNO148 Spaceship\n\n664\n\n1508 1765 2076 1587 1513\n\n2\n\nN0003 Recreation Opportunity\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n598\n\nNO004\n\nFood on Frontier\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n731\n\nN0005 Dissecting\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n- 2\n\n2\n\n- 2\n\n2\n\n777\n\nFrogs\n\nNO180 Space Program\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nNO190\n\nJob Application\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nNO210 Bike Lane\n\n2 - - - 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1766\n\n1992\n\n1787\n\n1776\n\n1785\n\n1801\n\n2025 1834 1831\n\n1831\n\n2\n\n1658\n\n1848 1681\n\n1681\n\n1651\n\n694\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n- - - - - 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1758\n\n1962\n\n1729\n\n1739 1737\n\n635\n\n1748\n\n1951\n\n1735\n\n1749 1680\n\n714\n\n1796\n\n2016\n\n1816\n\n1803\n\n1822\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n713\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n728\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n- - 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n748\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n- - 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1322\n\n1628\n\n1614\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n- - - 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1482 1482\n2\n\n1767 1756\n2\n\n1790 1806\n2\n\n1464 1473 1495\n\n1776 1796 1823\n\n1777 1804 1801\n\nI Omitted and off-task responses were treated as not presented. 2 The indicated NAEP item was not administered at this age/grade class.\n\n1994 1996\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n1344 1410\n\n- 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1542 1498 1547 1400\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1496 1449 1472 1470 1536 1547\n\nBEST COPY AVAILABLE\n\n39 6\n363\n\n\f17.4.1 Item Parameter Estimation Using the Generalized Partial Credit Model\n\nThe first step in the scaling process was the estimation of item parameters for the long-term trend items. This item calibration was performed using the BILOG/PARSCALE program described in Chapter 11. Items were calibrated separately for each of the three age/grade groups. Item parameters were\nestimated using combined data from the assessment years 1994 and 1996, treating each assessment as a sample from a separate subpopulation. In age 13/grade 8 and age 17/grade 11, there were two sets of\nnonoverlapping items. Each set was scaled separately (see Table 17-7). Therefore, there were five sets of calibrationsone for age 9/grade 4, and two each for age 13/grade 8 and age 17/grade 11. Student weights were used for the calibration. To ensure that each assessment year had a similar influence on the\ncalibration, student weights for 1994 and 1996 examinees were multiplied by a constant in order to adjust them to have the same sum, arbitrarily placed at 1,000. Approximately 1,200-1,800 examinees were present in each assessment year for each item.\n\nTable 17-7 Nonoverlapping Sets of Items for the Writing Long-Term Trend Assessment\n\nAge/Grade Set\n\nBooklets\n\nItems\n\n9/4\n\nA\n\n51-55\n\nN0006, N0009, N0010, N0147, N0148\n\n13/8\n\nA\n\n51, 52, 54 N0003, N0004\n\nB\n\n53, 55, 56 N0005, N0006, N0009, N0010\n\n17/11\n\nA\n\n51, 52, 54 N0003, NO004\n\n53, 55, 56 N0010, N0180, N0190, N0210\n\nThe final 1994 item parameter estimates were used as starting values. The proficiency\ndistribution of each assessment year was constrained to be normally distributed, although the means and variances differed across assessment years. Calibration was concluded when changes in item parameters became negligibly small (i.e., less than .005). The item parameter estimates appear in Appendix D.\n\n17.5 GENERATION OF PLAUSIBLE VALUES\nThe generation of plausible values was conducted independently for each set of items within an age/grade level for each of the assessment years. The item parameters from BILOG/PARSCALE, final student weights, item responses, and selected background variables were used with the computer program BGROUP (described in Chapter 11) to generate the values for each age/grade level. The background variables included student demographic characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity of the student, highest level of education attained by parents), students' perceptions about writing, and student behavior both in and out of school (e.g., amount of television watched daily, amount of homework done each day). Appendix C gives the codings for the conditioning variables for the three age/grade groups. Table 17-8 contains a list of the number of background variables included in conditioning, as well as the proportion of variance accounted for by the conditioning model for each age/grade.\n\n364\n9 7\n\n\ftable 17-8\nProportion of Proficiency Variance Accounted for by the Conditioning Model for the Writing Long-Term Trend Msessment\n\nAge/Grade\n9/4 13/8 17/11\n\nNumber of ConditioningConstants2\n48 48 48\n\nProportion of Variance\n0.43 0.55 0.38\n\n2 Excluding the constant term.\n\n17.6 THE FINAL WRITING LONG-TERM TREND SCALE\nThe linear indeterminacy of the long-term trend scale was resolved by linking the 1996 trend scales to previous trend scales. For sets within each age/grade, the item parameters from the joint calibration based on data from 1994 and 1996 were used with the 1994 data to find plausible values for the 1996 data. The mean and standard deviation for all of the plausible values were calculated and matched to the mean and standard deviation for all of the plausible values, based on the original analysis of the 1994 data, as given in earlier reports. The transformations that resulted from this matching of the first two moments for the 1994 data are\n\nAge 9/Grade 4:\n\nOtarget 39.15 ()calibrated + 202.21,\n\nAge 13/Grade 8A:\n\n()target = 37.61 Ocalibrated + 258.92,\n\nAge 13/Grade 8B:\n\nOtarget = 37.04 ()calibrated + 260.29,\n\nAge 17/Giade 11A: 0target = 36.33 ()calibrated + 280.48, and\n\nAge 17/Grade 11B:\n\nPtaI rget = 34.75 ()calibrated + 279.66,\n\nwhere Otarget denotes values on the final transformed scale and ()calibrated denotes values on the calibration scale.\nAs described above, the IRT parameters are estimated, plausible values computed, and final scale transformations established using the age/grade samples. Reporting was done, however, using grade-only samples. Overall summary statistics for the long-term trend grade samples are given in Table 17-9.\n\n1.\n365\n\n\fTable 17-9 Means and Standard Deviations on the Writing Long-Term Trend Scale\n\nGrade\n4\n\nAssessment Year\n1984 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\n\nAll Five Plausible Values\n\nMean\n\nS.D.\n\n203.8\n\n36.5\n\n205.7\n\n42.0\n\n201.7\n\n41.7\n\n207.1\n\n38.3\n\n204.8\n\n38.3\n\n207.4\n\n38.1\n\n8\n\n1984\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n266.7\n\n29.5\n\n263.7\n\n32.4\n\n256.6\n\n37.5\n\n274.4\n\n36.3\n\n265.3\n\n35.9\n\n263.6\n\n36.4\n\n11\n\n1984\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n289.7\n\n31.8\n\n291.3\n\n27.9\n\n287.1\n\n36.5\n\n287.3\n\n32.0\n\n284.6\n\n34.4\n\n283.0\n\n34.6\n\n17.7 PARTITIONING OF ESTIMATION ERROR VARIANCE\n\nThe variance of proficiency means for each age/grade level was partitioned into the part due to the sampling of students and the part due to the latency of proficiency, 0, as described in Chapter 17.\nThese estimates are given in Table 17-10 (for stability, the estimates of the between-imputation variance, B, in Equation 11.9 are computed based on 100 imputations).

Swinton, David S. Freund, and Nancy L. Allen Educational Testing Service\n\n18.1 OVERVIEW\nResults for the 1996 NAEP Assessments were disseminated in several different reports: the NAEP 1996 Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States, the NAEP 1996 Science Report Card for the Nation and the States, NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress, Cross-State Data Compendium from the NAEP 1996 Mathematics Assessment, Cross-State Compendium from the NAEP 1996 Science Assessment, and, distributed only in electronic form, six sections of summary data tables for each report. These reports are published on the NCES/NAEP website http://nces.ed.gov/naep. Several other reports based on 1996 NAEP data will be forthcoming.\nThe NAEP 1996 Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States and the NAEP 1996 Science Report Card for the Nation and the States highlight key assessment results for the nation and summarize results across the jurisdictions participating in the assessments. These reports contain composite scale score results (scale score means, etc.) for the nation, for each of the four regions of the country, and for public-school students within.each jurisdiction participating in the State Assessment2, both overall and by primary reporting variables. The seven key reporting variables (referred to here as primary reporting variables) are gender, race/ethnicity, level of parents' education, Title I participation, eligibility for free or reduced cost school lunch, type of location, and type of school (public, Catholic schools, other religious schools, and other private schools). For public-school students, scale score means were reported for a variety of other subpopulations defined by responses to items from the student, teacher, and school questionnaires and by school and location demographic variables provided by Westat, Inc.3 Upcoming reports will include estimates of scale score means and selected percentiles for specific subgroups of students of interest in each report.\nThe report NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress provides a look at NAEP results for Science, Mathematics, Reading, and Writing since the first NAEP assessments of those subjects in 196970. This report includes scale score results for the nation overall and by gender, race/ethnicity, gender and race/ethnicity, region, level of parents' education and type of school (public and nonpublic). It also provides percentages of students in categories defined by subject specific background variables (such as students who reported having experimented with living plants), along with their average scale scores. The report contains trends in average scale scores by quartile and percentages of students performing at or above selected'performance levels. An additional report gives data for the mechanics of writing long-\nterm trend.\nI Spencer S. Swinton played a role in making decisions about hypothesis testing methods and procedures and worked with David S. Freund who implemented many of the methods and procedures in computer programs. Nancy L. Allen contributed to the current version of this chapter. 2 Further technical documentation for the State Assessments appears in the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Mathematics and the Technical Report of the NAEP 1996 State Assessment Program in Science. 3 Some of these variables were used by Westat, Inc., in developing the sampling frame for the assessment and in drawing the\nsample of participating schools.\n\n4 0\n\n367\n\n\fThe third type of report consists of a number of data compendia. Two of these are entitled the Cross-State Data Compendiuni from the NAEP 1996 Mathematics Assessment and the Cross-State Data Compendium from the NAEP 1996 Science Assessment. Like the Report Cards, the Compendia report results for the nation and for all of the jurisdictions participating in the State Assessment. The Compendia contain most of the tables included in the Report Cards plus tables that provide composite scale results for a large number of secondary reporting variables (e.g., amount of homework, teacher preparation).\nThe fourth type of summary report is an electronically-delivered collection of summary data tables that contain detailed breakdowns of the science scale score data for each sample according to the responses to the student, teacher, and school questionnaires for the public-school, nonpublic-school, and combined populations as a whole and for important subgroups of the public-school population, as defined by the primary reporting variables. There are six sections in each collection of summary data tables:\nThe Distribution Data Section provides selected composite-scale and science subscale percentiles for the public-school, nonpublic-school, and total populations and for the major demographic subgroups of the national school population.\nThe Student Questionnaire Section breaks down the composite scale score dafa according to the students' responses to questions in the three student questionnaires (common core,\nsubject-specific background, and motivational section) included in the assessment\nbooklets.\nThe Teacher Questionnaire Section breaks down the composite scale score data according to the teachers' responses to questions in teacher questionnaires, where they\nare available.\nThe School Questionnaire Section breaks down the composite scale score data according\nto the principals' (or other administrators') responses to questions in the school\ncharacteristics and policies questionnaire.\nThe Scale Section breaks down the scale score data for the mathematics content strands or the fields of science according to selected items (such as the amount of science homework done per day) from the questionnaires.\nThe Item Section provides the response data (percent of students choosing each option) for each cognitive item in the assessment.\nThe production of these reports required many decisions about a variety of data analysis and statistical issues. For example, certain categories of the reporting variables contained limited numbers of examinees. A decision was needed as to what constituted a sufficient sample size to permit the reliable reporting of subgroup results, and which, if any, estimates were sufficiently unreliable to need to be \"flagged\" as a caution to readers. As a second example, the performance for subgroups of students were compared. A number of inferential rules, based on logical and statistical considerations, had to be developed to ensure that conclusions are adequately supported by the data from the assessment. Practical comparison procedures were required to control for Type I errors without paying too large a penalty with respect to the statistical power for detecting real and substantively interesting differences. For most tests, the number of related tests was not so large that the Bonferroni test (Hochberg, 1988) exacted too large a penalty in power in exchange for protection from Type I error. For sets of comparisons with very large numbers of related tests, such as comparing a state to all other states, a new multiple comparison\n368\n401\n\n\fcriterion, False Discovery Rate or FDR (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1994), was implemented. FDR controls the rate of false rejections (e.g., five false rejections per 100 rejections), rather than controlling the probability of one such error (Familywise Error Rate, or FWE), as the Bonferroni procedure does.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to document the major conventions and statistical procedures used in generating the Report Cards, NAEP 1996 Trends, the Data Compendia, and the summary data tables. Additional details about procedures relevant to the Report Card and Cross-State Data Compendia can be found in the text and technical appendices of those reports.\n18.2 MINIMUM SCHOOL AND STUDENT SAMPLE SIZES FOR REPORTING SUBGROUP RESULTS\nIn all of the reports, estimates of quantities such as composite and scale score means and percentages of students indicating particular levels of background variables (as measured in the student, teacher, and school questionnaires) are reported for the population of students in each grade. These estimates are also reported for certain key subgroups of interest as defined by primary NAEP reporting variables. Where possible, NAEP reports results for gender, for five racial/ethnic subgroups (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaskan Native), three types of locations (central cities, urban fringes/large towns, rural/small town areas), four levels of parents' education (did not finish high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate), Title 1 participation, eligibility for the free or reduced-cost school lunch component of the National School Lunch Program, and type of school. However, for some regions of the country and sometimes for the nation as a whole, school and/or student sample sizes were too small for one or more of the categories of these variables to permit accurate reporting.\nA consideration in deciding whether to report an estimated quantity is whether the sampling error is too large to permit effective use of the estimates. A second, and equally important, consideration is whether the standard error estimate that accompanies a statistic is itself sufficiently accurate to inform potential readers about the reliability of the statistic. The precision of a sample estimate (be it sample mean or standard error estimate) for a population subgroup from a three-stage sample design (the one used to select samples for the national assessments) is a function of the sample size of the subgroup and of the distribution of that sample across first-stage sampling units (i.e., PSUs in the case of the national assessments). Hence, both of these factors were used in establishing minimum sample sizes for reporting.\nHere a decision was reached to report subgroup results only if the student sample size exceeded 61.5 A design effect of two was assumed for this decision, implying a sample design-based variance twice that of simple random sampling. This assumption is consistent with previous NAEP experience (Johnson & Rust, 1992). In carrying out the statistical power calculations when comparing a subgroup to the total group, it was assumed that the total population sample size is large enough to contribute negligibly to standard errors. Furthermore, it was required that the students within a subgroup be adequately distributed across PSUs to allow for reasonably accurate estimation of standard errors. In consultation with Westat, a decision was reached to publish only those statistics that had standard error estimates based on five or more degrees of freedom. The same minimum student and PSU sample size restrictions were applied to proportions and to comparisons of percentages or proportions as well as average scale scores and comparisons of average scale scores.\n5 This number was obtained by determining the sample size necessary to detect an effect size of 0.5 with a probability of 0.8 or greater.\n369\n402\n\n\f18.3 IDENTIFYING ESTIMATES OF STANDARD ERRORS WITH LARGE MEAN SQUARED ERRORS\n\nAs noted above, standard errors of average scale scores, proportions, and percentiles play an\n\nimportant role in interpreting subgroup results and in comparing the performances of two or more\n\nsubgroups. The jackknife standard errors reported by NAEP are statistics whose quality depends on\n\ncertain features of the error6 associated with\n\nsample from which the estimate is the estimated standard errors may\n\nobtained. In certain cases, the mean squared be quite large. This result typically occurred\n\nwhen the number of students upon which the standard error is based is small or when this group of\n\nstudents comes from a small number of participating PSUs. The minimum PSU and student sample sizes\n\nthat were imposed in most instances suppressed statistics where such problems existed. However, the\n\npossibility remained that some statistics based on sample sizes that exceed the minimum requirements\n\nhad standard errors that were not well estimated. Therefore, in the reports, estimated standard errors for\n\npublished statistics that are themselves subject to large mean squared errors are followed by the symbol\n\nThe magnitude of the mean squared error associated with an estimated standard error for the mean or proportion of a group depends on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimated size of the\npopulation group, denoted as A/ (Cochran, 1977, Section 6.3). The coefficient of variation is estimated by:\nS(N)\n\nwhere // is a point estimate of N and SEA is the jackknife standard error (described in Chapter 10 of this report) of N.\nExperience with previous NAEP assessments suggests that when this coefficient exceeds 0.2, the mean squared error of the estimated standard errors of means and proportions based on samples of this size may be quite large. (Further discussion of this issue can be found in Johnson & Rust, 1992.) Therefore, the standard errors of means and proportions for all subgroups for which the coefficient of variation of the population size exceeds 0.2 are marked as described above. In the Report Cards, NAEP Trends, the Data Compendia, and the summary data tables, statistical tests involving one or more quantities that have standard errors, confidence intervals, or significance tests so flagged should be interpreted with caution.\n\n18.4 TREATMENT OF MISSING DATA FROM THE STUDENT, TEACHER, AND SCHOOL QUESTIONNAIRES\nAs previously described, responses to the student, teacher, and school questionnaires played a prominent role in all reports. Although the return rate on all three types of questionnaire was high,' there were missing data for each type of questionnaire.\n\n6 The mean squared error of the estimated standard error is defined as [ S - at, where :\u00a7 is the estimated standard error,0 is the \"true\" standard error, and is the expectation, or expected value operator.\n7\nInformation about survey participation rates (both school and student), as well as proportions of students excluded by each jurisdiction from the assessment, is given in Appendix B. Sampling adjustments intendedto account for school and student nonresponse are described in Chapter 7.\n\n370\n\n403\n\n\fThe reported estimated percentages of students in the various categories of background variables, and the estimates of the average scale score of such groups, were based on onlythose students for whom data on the background variable were available. In the terminology of Little and Rubin (1987), the analyses pertaining to a particular background variable presented in the reports are contingent on the assumption that the data are missing completely at random.8\nThe estimates of proportions and proficiencies based on \"missing-completely-at-random\" assumptions are subject to potential nonresponse bias if, as may be the case, the assumptions are not correct. The amount of missing data was small (usually, less than 2%) for most of the variables obtained from the student, school, and teacher questionnaires. For analyses based on these variables, reported results are subject to little, if any, nonresponse bias. However, for particular background items from the student, school, and teacher questionnaires, the level of nonresponse was somewhat higher. As a result, the potential for nonresponse bias in the results of analyses based on this latter set of background items is also somewhat greater. Background items for which more than 10 percent of the returned questionnaires were missing are identified in the questionnaire sections (as specified at the beginning of this chapter) of the summary data tables. Again, results for analyses involving these background variables should be\ninterpreted with caution.\nTo analyze the relationships among teachers' questionnaire responses and their students' achievement, each teacher's questionnaire had to be matched to the students who were taught by that teacher. If a student could not be matched to a teacher, all teacher questionnaire responses are missing for that student. The percentages of students that were matched to teacher questionnaires in each sample for which a teacher questionnaire was administered are reported in the subject area Chapters 12 and 13. Lower percentages of students with teacher questionnaire data indicate that there is less certainty about results for variables from the teacher questionnaire. Note that these match rates do not reflect the additional missing data due to item-level nonresponse. The amount of additional item-level nonresponse in the returned teacher questionnaires can be found in the summary data tables.\n\n18.5 HYPOTHESIS TESTING CONVENTIONS\n\n18.5.1 Comparing Means and Proportions for Different Groups of Students\n\nMany of the group comparisons explicitly commented on in the reports involved mutually exclusive sets of students. Examples include comparisons of the average scale score for male and female students, White and Hispanic students, students attending schools in central city and urban fringe/large town locations, students who reported watching six or more hours of television each night and students\nwho report watching less than one hour each night.\n\nThe text in the reports indicate that means or proportions from two groups were different only when the difference in the point estimates for the groups being compared was statistically significant at\nan approximate simultaneous cc level of 0.05. An approximate procedure was used for determining statistical significance NAEP staff judged to be statistically defensible, as well as being computationally tractable. Although all pairs of levels within a variable were tested and reported in the summary data tables, some text within the reports was developed for only a subset of these comparisons although the family size was maintained at that of the original tests. For example, text was included in the reports to compare the majority ethnic group and each minority group, but text for all possible comparisons of\ngroups may not have been included.\n\n8 The mechanism generating the missing data is independent of both the response to the particular background items and the scale score.\n\n404\n\n371\n\n\fThe procedure used to make statistical tests is described in the following paragraphs. This procedure was used in all cases except when comparisons were made with students assessed in assessment years for which average scale scores were extrapolated as part of the long-term trend analyses. In those cases, z-tests comparing the test statistics to the appropriate value from the standard normal distribution was used.\nLet Ai be the statistic in question (e.g., a mean for group i) and let SAi be the jackknife standard error of the statistic. The text in the reports identified the means or proportions for groups i and j as being different if:\n\nI A1 - A; I\n\n(Ai) + S,%2j (Ai)\n\nT.0.5 2c\n\nwhere Ta is the (1 - a) percentile of the t distribution with degrees offreedom, df, as estimated below, and c is the number of related comparisons being tested. See the following section (Section 18.5.2) for a more specific description of multiple comparisons. In cases where group comparisons were treated as individual units, the value of c was taken as 1, and the test statistic was approximately equivalent to a standard two-tailed t-test for the difference between group means or proportions from large independent samples with\nthe a level set at 0.05. When c is not 1, this test is based on the Bonferroni procedure described in Hochberg\n(1988). The degrees of freedom of this t-test is defined by a Satterthwaite (Johnson & Rust, 1992) approximation as follows:\n\ny,4)2\n\ndf =\n\nk=1 N\n\nk=1 dfA,\n\nwhere N is the number of subgroups involved, and diA, is as follows:\n\ndfAk = (3.16\n\nE(4-kt)2\ni=1\nE(tA-tk)4\ni=1\n\nwhere m is the number of replicates, ti is the ith replicated estimate for the mean of a subgroup, and t is the estimate of the subgroup mean using the overall weights and the first plausible value.\nThe procedures in this section assume that the data being compared are from independent samples. Because of the sampling design in which PSUs, schools, and students within school are randomly sampled, the data from mutually exclusive sets of students may not be strictly independent. Therefore, the significance tests employed are, in many cases, only approximate. As described in Section\n372\nu 45\n\n\f10.4, another procedure, one that does not assume independence, could have been conducted. However, that procedure is computationally burdensome. A comparison of the standard errors using the independence assumption and the correlated group assumption was made using NAEP data. The estimated standard error of the difference based on independence assumptions was approximately ten percent larger than the more complicated estimate based on correlated groups. In almost every case, the correlation of NAEP data across groups was positive. Because, in NAEP, significance tests based on assumptions of independent samples are only somewhat conservative, the approximate procedure was\nused for most comparisons.\n\nThe procedures described above were used for testing differences of both means and nonextreme percentages. The approximation for the test for percentages works best when sample sizes are large, and the percentages being tested have magnitude relatively close to 50 percent. Statements about group differences should be interpreted with caution if at least one of the groups being compared is small in size and/or if \"extreme\" percentages are being compared. Differences in percentages were treated as\ninvolving \"extreme\" percentages if for either percentage, P:\n\nP\n\n<\n\nPum\n\n=\n\n200\nivEFF + 2\n\n,where\n\nthe\n\neffective\n\nsample\n\nsize\n\nis\n\nNEFF\n\n=\n\nP(100 P)\n(SEfic)2\n\n,\n\nand\n\nSEJK\n\nis\n\nthe\n\njackknife\n\nstandard error of P. Similarly, at the other end of the 0 100 scale, a percentage is deemed extreme if 100\n\n- P < Pun,. In either extreme case, the normal approximation to the distribution is a poor approximation,\n\nand the value of P was reported, but no standard error was estimated and hence no significance tests were\n\nconducted.\n\n18.5.2 Multiple Comparison Procedures\nFrequently, groups (or families) of comparisons were made and were presented as a single set. The appropriate text, usually a set of sentences or a paragraph, was selected for inclusion in a report based on the results for the entire set of comparisons. For example, some reports contain a section that compared average scale scores for a predetermined group, generally the majority group (in the case of race/ethnicity, for example, White students) to those obtained by other minority groups. The entire set of tests was presented in the summary data tables. For families of comparisons like these, a Bonferroni procedure (Miller, 1966), controlling the Familywise Error Rate (FWE), was used. This procedure defines the value of Ta., as in the previous section, where c is the number of contrasts in the set. In the race/ethnicity example, c was taken to be the number of minority groups meeting minimum sample size requirements, and each statistical test was consequently carried out at an a level of 0.05/c.\nHowever, in an attempt to gain greater power, two separate definitions of family size were employed for comparisons in two-way tables. For n levels of a control variable (e.g., ethnicity) and m levels of a comparison variable (e.g., number of hours of homework), the standard Bonferroni family size of nxmx (m-1)12 was used. In addition, when the m x (m-1)/2 marginal tests yielded a significant difference for a pair of categories of the comparison variable, the n levels of thecontrol variable corresponding to that pair of categories were tested with a family size of n. Significance was reported if either definition of family size met the criterion.\nFurther, in the Report Card and summary data tables, two-way interactions were tested directly for some variables. The tests for an m x n table were t-tests using a family size n x (n-1) x m x (m-1)/4. In these cases, a modification due to Hochberg of the standard Bonferroni procedure was employed, in which probabilities associated with outcomes are ordered, and a is divided by an integer which increases\n\n4 6\n\n373\n\n\ffrom 1 to the family size as successively smaller probabilities are tested. More formally, the Hochberg Stagewise Procedure (Hochberg, 1988) is defined as follows;\n\nLet q be the number of significance tests made (the family size) and let Pi -1325.\"... s\"P, be the\n\nordered significance levels for the q tests. Let a be the combined significance level. The Hochberg\n\nprocedure compares Pq with a; Pq_j with a/2, ..., Pi with a/(qj+1), stopping comparisons with the first j\n\nsuch that P, < Wqj+1). All tests associated with Pi, ..., pi are declared significant; all tests associated\n\nwith\n\nPq are declared nonsignificant.\n\nTo compare a jurisdiction in a State Assessment with the nation and all other participating jurisdictions, as many as 46 different comparisons need to be computed. This is done in the comparisons of overall scale score maps in the State Assessment reports and in the comparisons of short-term trends in mathematics achievement in the Mathematics Report Card. A potentially more powerful multiple comparison procedure was used to judge significance in this case. The procedure, described by Benjamini and Hochberg (1994), was the procedure chosen. Unlike the Bonferroni procedure that controls the FWE, the procedure described by Benjamini and Hochberg (1994) controls the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses among all rejections (FDR). For example, at the 0.05 level, for every 100 rejections of the null hypothesis, the procedure ensures that no more than five will be expected to be false. Note that control of the FDR is a less conservative type of error control than that of the FWE.\nSimulations have shown that \"the FDR is controlled at level a for the dependent tests involved in pairwise comparisons as well as for independent tests\" (Shaffer, 1994).\n\nThe Benjamini and Hochberg application of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) criterion can be\n\ndescribed as follows. Let q be the number of significance tests made and let\n\nPI\n\n.\"13(1 be the ordered significance levels of the q tests, from lowest to highest probability. Let\n\na be the combined significance level desired, usually 0.05. The procedure will compare Pq with a,\n\nPq_, with a(q-1)/q, . . Pi with ajlq, stopping the comparisons with the first j such that pi s-ajlq. All tests\n\nassociated with P1, . . p, are declared significant; all tests associated with p3+1, . . Pq are declared nonsignificant.\n\n18.5.3 Linear and Quadratic Tests of Trends\nTests of significance designed to identify consistent patterns of trend data are available and, although they are more complex, they provide more power to identify those specific patterns than a series of t- or z-tests would provide.\nOne such set of tests of significance is the test of linear and test of quadratic trends applied to the long-term trend data for the nation and selected subpopulations. The purpose of this first set of general tests was to determine whether the results of the series of assessments in a given subject could be generally characterized as increasing or decreasing, and whether the results have steadily increased (or decreased) over the time period of interest. Simple curvilinear (i.e., quadratic) relationships capture more complex patterns. For example, one possible pattern is to have initial score declines over part of the time period followed by score increases in more recent assessments. Another possible pattern is to have a sequence of several assessments in which scores increased followed by a period of relative stable performance. These examples are two, but not all, of the simple curvilinear relationships that were tested.\nThe linear and quadratic components of the trend in average scale scores for a given subject area and age group were estimated by applying two sets of contrasts to the set of average scale scores by year. The linear component of the trend was estimated by the sum bi=Eckyi, where the x; are the average scale\n374\n407\n\n\fscores by year and the ci are defined such that b., corresponds to the slope of an unweighted regression of the average scale scores on the assessment year. In other words,\n1\nYi 2_,Yi Cj =\nDYk -11,Y02\nwhere y, represents an assessment year. The quadratic component was estimated by the sum b2 =Zdx , in which the di are formally orthogonal to the c, and are defined such that b2 is the quadratic term in the unweighted regression of the average scale scores on the assessment year and the square of the assessment year. In other words,\nwhere\nI1 = (y;2 N yi2)[Ick(yk2-N-I /Yi2)](Yi-N1- i Yi)\nBoth cj and di match expected linear quadratic contrasts in common texts when the years are equally spaced through time (Winer, 1962/1971). The statistical significance of 131 and b2 was evaluated by comparing each estimate to its estimated standard error. The standard error of b1 was estimated as the square root of the sum I C.12. SEi2 , in which SEi is the estimated standard error of xi. The estimated standard error of the b2 was analogously defined.\nThe linear and quadratic trend tests allow statements to be made about results across assessment years in a more powerful way than is possible if results for each year had been compared to those of every other year, using a multiple-comparison procedure such as the Bonferroni method. These tests do not control the overall Type I error rate when they are applied to several related subgroups, such as the students in each region of the country. For this reason, the Bonferroni method for controlling Type I error was used when the trends for related subgroups were tested. For example, when tests were conducted for linear trend for the separate race/ethnicity groups (i.e., White, Black, and Hispanic), these tests were treated as a single family of comparisons of size 3. The significance level for each of the separate tests was adjusted by the Bonferroni procedure to yield a family-wise error rate of .05.\n18.5.4 Comparing Proportions Within a Group\nCertain analyses involved the comparison of proportions. One example was the comparison of the proportion of students who reported that a parent graduated from college to the proportion of students who indicated that their parents did not finish high school to determine which proportion was larger. There are other such proportions of interest in this example, such as the proportion of students with at least one parent graduating from high school but neither parent graduating from college. For these types of analyses, NAEP staff determined that the dependencies in the data could not be ignored.\n375\n408\n\n\fUnlike the case for analyses of the type described in Section 18.5.1, the correlation between the proportion of students reporting a parent graduated from college and the proportion reporting that their parents did not finish high school is likely to be negative and large. For a particular sample of students, it is likely that the higher the proportion of students reporting \"at least one parent graduated from college\" is, the lower the proportion of students reporting \"neither parent graduated from high school\" will be. A negative dependence will result in underestimates of the standard error if the estimation is based on independence assumptions (as is the case for the procedures described in Section 18.5.1). Such underestimation can result in an unacceptably large number of \"nonsignificant\" differences being identified as significant.\nThe procedures of Section 18.5.1 were modified for analyses that involved comparisons of proportions within a group. The modification involved using a jackknife method for obtaining the standard error of the difference in dependent proportions. The standard error of the difference in proportions was obtained by first obtaining a separate estimate of the difference in question for each jackknife replicate, using the first plausible value only, then taking the standard deviation of the set of replicate estimates as the estimate. The procedures used for proportions within a group differed from the procedures of Section 18.5.1 only with respect to estimating the standard error of the difference; all other aspects of the procedures were identical.\n376\n409\n\n\fChapter 19\nSTATISTICAL SUMMARY OF THE 1996 NAEP SAMPLES1\nBruce A. Kaplan Educational Testing Service\n\n19.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe analysis of the 1996 NAEP data has resulted in the production of thousands of tables presenting estimates of the proficiency of students, and various subgroups of students, in American schools. This chapter provides a, statistical summary of the 1996 NAEP national samples. The chapter assumes a general familiarity with the structure of NAEP as summarized in the Introduction and in the overviews presented in Chapters 1 and 9. Similar results for the state samples appear in the data compendia for the state mathematics and science assessments.\nTwo of the many types of NAEP results are presented here:\n1. the results of the instrument development process, including the sizes of the item pools and numbers of booklets; and\n2. the results of the sampling process, including the numbers of students in each sample by selected subgroups.\n\n19.2 MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS\nFor the 1996 assessment, 79 different assessment booklets and questionnaires were printed for age class 9, 80 for age class 13, and 81 for age class 17. These instruments are shown by age level and type in Table 19-1.\nThe item pool contributing to all main and long-term trend booklets is described in Table 19-2. In general, there are two types of items, cognitive and noncognitive. The cognitive items are developed to measure proficiency in particular subject areas, such as reading and mathematics. Cognitive items may be constructed-response or multiple-choice. The noncognitive items are usually questions about the student's or teacher's backgrounds and perceptions but may also probe other areas, such as school policies or teaching methods. Because many items were used at more than one age class, the total number of items in an item pool is not the sum of the item pools used for the three age classes. However, results for cognitive items that were common across two or three age classes were not compared, due to a NAEP policy of within grade scaling.\nThe SD/LEP Student Questionnaires, Teacher Questionnaires, and School Characteristics and Policies Questionnaires contained only noncognitive questions. The number of items in the noncognitive\n\nI Bruce A. Kaplan was responsible for the text, specifying the tables, and coordinating table production. Shuyi Hua produced most of the tables in this chapter. David Freund's advice was invaluable in the production of this chapter.\n\n- 410\n\n377\n\n\fpools is the same as the number of items in the questionnaires. More information about the instruments that were developed is provided in Chapters 2 and 4.\n19.3 SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS\nIn this section, the characteristics of the final reporting NAEP samples are described. The process by which the samples were selected is discussed in Chapter 3.\nIn the 1996 main assessment, NAEP contacted 2,267 schools (2,263 original and 4 replacements), of which 1,791 contributed data to the assessment. The disposition of these schools is shown in Table 19-3. Some of the schools were unwilling to cooperate; others were believed to be eligible from the sampling frame, but were not. The cooperation rate is calculated as the sum of cooperating schools and the schools that were found to have no eligible students divided by the same sum plus the schools that refused or were from districts that refused to cooperate.\nTable 19-3 also shows the number of schools in several categories: region of the country (Northeast, Southeast, Central, West), school type (public, nonpublic, Catholic, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Defense Education Activity), type of location, number of teachers, and number of students.\nFor the 1996 long-term trend studies, NAEP contacted 856 schools (844 original and 12 replacements), of which 681 contributed data to the various trend assessments. Table 19-4 supplies the same information for the schools assessed for the long-term trend studies that Table 19-3 supplies for the main assessment schools.\nThe numbers of respondents to the teacher questionnaires are summarized in Table 19-5. The first column in this table includes the number of teachers who responded, by grade and subject area. The second column is the number of students who were not linked to teachers. The third column is the number of students linked to teachers, but not specific classes of these teachers (for eighth grade) or teachers who did not answer classroom information (for fourth grade). The last column is the number of students linked to their teachers and their specific classes.\nNAEP is administered in units called assessment sessions. If the number of students attending an assessment session is fewer than a predetermined number, the students missing from the session are assigned to a makeup session and then assessed. Table 19-6 shows the number of regular and makeup sessions in 1996 NAEP by age class for the main and long-term trend samples. Altogether, 103,814 assessed and excluded students were involved in the 1996 NAEP.\nTables 19-7 through 19-9 display the distribution of the students assessed in the cross-sectional NAEP assessment in several basic categories: gender, racial/ethnic grouping, region of the country, parental education, type of location, school type, and modal age. These data are presented for assessed students in the mathematics main and estimation samples in Table 19-7, the mathematics theme and advanced samples in Table 19-8, and the science main and advanced samples in Table 19-9. Tables 1910, 19-11, and 19-12 provide equivalent information, respectively, for excluded students.\nTables 19-13, 19-14, and 19-15 display the distribution of students assessed in the long-term trend reading and writing assessment for several basic categories: gender, racial/ethnic grouping, region of the country, parental education, type of location, and school type.\n378\n411\n\n\fThere is one table for each age/grade. The tables have four columns:\neligible by age, which means that the students were in an appropriate age group;\neligible by grade, which means that the students were in an appropriate grade;\neligible by age and by grade, which means that the students were of both an appropriate age and appropriate grade; and\neligible by age or by grade, which is the total number of students for whom data were collected.\nTables 19-16, 19-17, and 19-18 provide similar information for the long-term trend science and mathematics assessment. Note that since these are age-only samples, the number of students who are age-eligible only will be the same as the number of students who are age- or grade-eligible. Likewise, the number of students who are grade-eligible only will be the same as the number of students who are both age- and grade-eligible. Tables 19-19 through 19-24 enumerate the excluded students across the various long-term trend samples.\n\n19.4 POPULATION ESTIMATES\nThe 1996 NAEP samples were designed for estimating the size and attributes of a number of different populations of students. The estimation procedures use sampling weights, developed by Westat, Inc., that are associated with the members of the sample (see Chapter 3). In this chapter, all estimates of population parameters are calculated using these sampling weights. Note these estimates are for the reporting samples (see Chapter 3 for an explanation of the reporting and modular samples).\nThe sum of the initial weights for a given sample is an estimate of the number of students who are in the population represented by the sample. In other words, the sum of the initial weights is taken as the estimated population size. In analyses, however, this sum of weights was resealed to sum to the sample size. For example, in Table 19-25, the estimated number of fourth graders in the nation is 3,711,786, as estimated from the main mathematics sample, as opposed to the 6,627 students in the sample given in Table 19-7.\nDue to design considerations the main assessment was divided into subsamples, and were administered, and therefore weighted, independently, so that the sum of the initial weights for each subsample estimates the population size. The subsamples for mathematics were main, estimation, theme and advanced; for science, the subsamples were main and advanced.\nNote that the samples for the main (cross-sectional) assessment are grade-only samples, while reading and writing long-term trend are grade and age samples. The samples for the mathematics and science long-term trend are age-only samples. The sum of the initial weights of the excluded students estimates the number of ineligible students at the respective age/grade levels.\nIn most cases, the number of students in an age/grade combination is not of interest; a researcher will be interested in estimating the number of students at either a grade or an age level. For the samples that contain both grade- and age-eligible students, an estimate of the total number of students at an age level can be made by summing the initial weights of only the age-eligible students and adding the\n\n412\n\n379\n\n\fcorresponding sample of age-eligible excluded students' 'initial weights. An estimate of the total number of students in a grade sample can be made by summing the initial weights of grade-eligible students plus the initial weights of grade-eligible students from the appropriate excluded student sample.\nTables 19-25 to 19-42 show the sizes of the estimated populations of assessable students and the weightedpercentages forthe NAEP reporting categories of gender, race/ethnicity, region of the country, parents' education level, type of location, school type and modal age. The estimated Subpopulation percentages for the cross-sectional samples are shown in Tables 19-25 through 19-30. Tables 19-31 to 1936 show the same information for the long-term trend samples. In a similar manner, Tables 19-37 to 19-42 show the estimated total population of excluded students and the weighted percentages by demographic subgroups (data about parents' education level is not collected for excluded students and therefore not reported; data about reasons for exclusion are included instead).\nIn previous years, this chapter also provided several tables showing selected proficiency results for assessed students, as an aid to readers who are interested in the estimates of proficiency that led to the interpretive results provided in the NAEP subject area reports. These tables are no longer included in this report. Instead, readers are encouraged to take advantage of the electronic version of these resuits, in the form of thousands of summary data tables computed to analyze the 1996 data. The summary data tables are available both on CD-ROM and via the World-Wide Web at http://nces.ed.gov/naep.\n\nTable 19-1 Measurement Instruments Developed for 1996 NAEP\n\nStudent Assessment

The following explains how each of these subgroups was derived.\nDSEX (Gender)\nThe variable SEX is the gender of the student being assessed, as taken from school records. For a few students, data for this variable was missing and was imputed by ETS after the assessment. The resulting variable DSEX contains a value for every student and is used for gender comparisons among students.\nDRACE (Race/Ethnicity for Main and Long-Term Trend Assessments)\nThe variable DRACE is an imputed definition of race/ethnicity, derived from up to three sources of information. This variable is used for race/ethnicity subgroup comparisons in the 1996 main assessments (science and mathematics), in the 1996 long-term trend samples (reading, mathematics, and science), and in the 1996 writing trend samples (see also \"observed race/ethnicity\" below). Two items from the student demographics questionnaire were used in the determination of derived race/ethnicity:\nDemographic Item Number 2:\n2. If you are Hispanic, what is your Hispanic background? co I am not Hispanic. Mexican, Mexican American, or Chicano Puerto Rican\nc) Cuban\nc) Other Spanish or Hispanic background\n\n463\n\n431\n\n\fStudents who responded to Item Number 2 by filling in the second, third, fourth, or fifth oval\n\nwere considered Hispanic. For students who filled in the first oval, did not respond to the item, or\n\nprovided information examined in an effort\n\nthat was illegible or could not be to determine race/ethnicity. Item\n\nclassified, Number 1\n\nresponses to item read as follows:\n\nnumber\n\n1\n\nwere\n\nDemographic Item Number 1:\n1. Which best describes you?\no White (not Hispanic) o Black (not Hispanic)\nHispanic (\"Hispanic\" means someone who is Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or from some other Spanish or Hispanic background.) o Asian or Pacific Islander (\"Asian or Pacific Islander\" means someone who is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, or from some other Asian or Pacific Island background.) American Indian or Alaskan Native (\"American Indian or Alaskan Native\" means someone who is from one of the American Indian tribes, or one of the original people of Alaska.) Other (What?)\nStudents' race/ethnicity was then assigned to correspond with their selection. For students who filled in the sixth oval (Other), provided illegible information or information that could not be classified, or did not respond at all, race/ethnicity as provided from school records was used. Derived race/ethnicity could not be determined for students who did not respond to background items 1 or 2 and for whom race/ethnicity was not provided by the school.\n\nRACE (Observed Race/Ethnicity)\nThe variable RACE is the race/ethnicity of the student being assessed as observed and recorded by the exercise administrator. Observed race/ethnicity was used in NAEP assessments before 1984 (see also \"self-identified race/ethnicity\" above). Observed race/ethnicity is used for all race/ethnicity subgroup trend comparisons for which the starting long-term trend point comes from pre-1984 assessment data.\n\n432\n46,2\n\n\fTOL8 (Type of Location) TOL5 TOL3\n\nThe variable TOL8 is used by NAEP to provide information about the type of location in which schools are located. The variable is defined using population size information from the 1990 Census and the definitions of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) as of June 1995. There are eight categories for\nTOL8:\n\n1 Large Central City\n\na central city of an MSA with a population greater than or equal to 400,000, or a population density greater than or equal to 6,000\npersons per square mile\n\n2 Midsize Central City\n\na central city of an MSA but not designated as a large city\n\n3 Urban Fringe of Large City\n\na place within an MSA of a large central city and defined as urban by the U.S. Bureau of Census\n\n4 Urban Fringe of a Midsize City\n5 Large Town\n\na place within an MSA of a midsize central city and defined as urban by the U.S. Bureau of Census\na place not within an MSA, but with a population greater than or equal to 25,000 and defined as urban by the U.S. Bureau of Census\n\n6 Small Town\n\na place not within an MSA, with a population less than 25,000, but greater than or equal to 2,500 and defined as urban by the U.S.\nBureau of Census\n\n7 Rural MSA\n\na place within an MSA with a population of less than 2,500 and defined as rural by the U.S. Bureau of Census\n\n8 Rural NonMSA\n\na place not within an MSA with a population of less than 2,500 and defined as rural by the U.S. Bureau of Census\n\nThese categories are designed to be exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Every place in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia is classified as belonging to exactly one of these categories. The definitions of MSAs and PMSAs, and their central cities, are carried out by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB Bulletin No. 93-17 states that \"all agencies that conduct statistical activities to collect and publish data for Metropolitan Areas should use the most recent definitions of Metropolitan Areas established by OMB.\" The definitions used (as of June 1995) were those current at the time of the 1996 assessment. The definitions of places and their populations are obtained from the published results of the 1990 Population Census, as are the definitions of Urbanized\nAreas.\nFurther details about the creation of the eight-category type of location variable are provided in The NAEP 1994 Sampling and Weighting Report (Wallace & Rust, 1996).\n\n465\n\n433\n\n\ffive\n\nThe levels:\n\nvariable\n\nTOL5\n\nwas\n\ncreated\n\nby\n\ncollapsing\n\nthe\n\ninformation\n\nprovided\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nvariable\n\nTOL8\n\nto\n\n1 Large Central City 2 Midsize Central City 3 Urban Fringe of Large City, Urban Fringe of Midsize City, and Large Town 4 Small Town 5 Rural MSA and Rural NonMSA\n\nlevels: The variable TOL3 is used extensively in the NAEP reports. TOL3 collapses TOL8 to three\n\n1 Central City\n\n(Large Central City and Midsize Central City) This category includes central cities of all MSAs. Central City is a geographic term and is not synonymous with \"inner city.\"\n\n2 Urban Fringe/Large Town (Urban Fringe of Large City, Urban Fringe of Midsize City, and\nLarge Town) An Urban Fringe includes all densely settled places and areas within MSAs that are classified as urban by the Bureau of Census. A Large Town is defined as a place outside MSAs with a population greater than or equal to 25,000.\n\n3 Rural/Small Town\n\n(Small Town, Rural MSA, and Rural NonMSA) Rural includes all places and areas with a population of less than 2,500 that are\nclassified as rural by the Bureau of Census. A Small Town is defined as a place outside MSAs with a population of less than\n25,000 but greater than or equal to 2,500.\n\nPARED (Student's Report of Parents' Education Level)\nThe variable PARED is derived from responses to two questions, B003501 and B003601, in the student demographic questionnaire. Each student was asked to indicate the extent of his or her mother's education (B003501How far in high school did your mother go?) by choosing one of the following:\no She did not finish high school. o She graduated from high school. o She had some education after high school. o She graduated from college. o I don't know.\nEach student was asked to provide the same information about the extent of his or her father's education (B003601How far in high school did your father go?) by choosing one of the following:\no He did not finish high school. o He graduated from high school. o He had some education after high school. o He graduated from college. o I don't know.\n\n434\n466\n\n\fThe information was combined into one parental education reporting category (PARED) as follows: If a student indicated the extent of education for only one parent, that level was included in the data. If a student indicated the extent of education for both parents, the higher of the two levels was included in the data. For students who did not know the level of education for both parents or did not know the level of education for one parent and did not respond for the other, the parental education level was classified as unknown. If the student did not respond for both parents, the student was recorded as\nhaving provided no response.\n\nREGION (Region of the Country)\nJurisdictions were grouped into four geographical regionsNortheast, Southeast, Central, and Westas shown in Table B-1. All 50 states and the District of Columbia are listed. The part of Virginia that is included in the Washington, DC, metropolitan statistical area is included in the Northeast region; the remainder of the state is included in the Southeast region.\n\nNORTHEAST\nConnecticut Delaware District of Columbia Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia\n\nTable B-1 NAEP Geographic Regions\n\nSOUTHEAST\n\nCENTRAL\n\nAlabama\" Arkansas Florida Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee Virginia West Virginia\n\nIllinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North Dakota Ohio South Dakota Wisconsin\n\nWEST\nAlaska Arizona California Colorado Hawaii Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oklahoma Oregon Texas Utah Washington Wyoming\n\nMODAGE (Modal Age)\nThe modal age (the age of most of the students in the grade sample) for the fourth-grade students is age 9 (age 13 for grade 8 and age 17 for grade 12). A value of 1 for MODAGE indicates that the student is younger than the modal age; a value of 2 indicates that the student is of the modal age; a value of 3 indicates that the student is older than the modal age.\n\n487\n\n435\n\n\fIEP (Individualized Education Program)1\nThe variable IEP comes from the student booklet cover. A value of 1 indicates that a student has an individualized education program, while a value of 2 indicates no individualized education program.\nLEP (Limited English Proficiency)\nThe variable LEP comes from the student booklet cover. A value of 1 indicates that a student is considered to have limited English proficiency while a value of 2 indicates that the student does not have limited English proficiency.\nTITLE1\nThe variable TITLE1 comes from the student booklet cover. A value of 1 indicates that a student is eligible for Title 1 funding and a value of 2 indicates that the student is not eligible for Title 1 funding.\nSLUNCH SLUNCH1\nThe variable SLUNCH is provided by Westat, Inc. and is used to determine if a student participates in the National School Lunch Program. The values for this variable are as follow:\n1 not eligible 2 eligible for reduced price lunch 3 eligible for free lunch 4 no information available 5 school refused to provide information\nThe variable SLUNCH1 collapses the information provided in the variable SLUNCH to three levels:\n1 eligible for free or reduced price lunch 2 not eligible for free or reduced price lunch 3 no information available\nA student identified on the Administration Schedule as a student with a disability (SD) or an equivalent classification may be excluded from the assessment if: 1) the student is mainstreamed less than 50% of the time in academic subjects and is judged incapable of participating meaningfully in the assessment, or 2) the Individualized Education Program (IEP) team or equivalent group has determined that the student is incapable of participating meaningfully in the assessment. SD/LEP students meeting the above criteria should be assessed if, in the judgment of school staff, they are capable of taking the assessment.\n436\n- 468\n\n\fSCHTYPE\nThe variable SCHTYPE is provided by Westat, Inc., and is used to determine the type of school that a student attended. The values for this variable are as follow:\n1 Public 2 Private 3 Catholic 4 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 5 Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools\n\n469\n\n437\n\n\fVARIABLES DERIVED FROM THE STUDENT AND TEACHER QUESTIONNAIRES\nSeveral variables were formed from the systematic combination of response values for one or more items from either the student demographic questionnaire, the student background questionnaire, or the teacher questionnaire.\n\nHOMEEN2 (Home EnvironmentArticles [of 4] in the Home) - Science\n\nFor the science sample the variable HOMEEN2 was created from the responses to student demographic items B000901 (Does your family get a newspaper regularly?), B000903 (Is there an encyclopedia in your home?), B000904 (Are there more than 25 books in your home?), and B000905 (Does your family get any magazines regularly?). The values for this variable were derived as follows:\n\n1 0-2 types\n\nThe student responded to at least two items and answered \"yes\" to two or fewer.\n\n2 3 types\n\nThe student answered \"yes\" to three items.\n\n3 4 types 8 Omitted\n\nThe student answered \"yes\" to four items. The student answered fewer than two items.\n\nHOMEEN3 (Home EnvironmentArticles [of 4] in the Home) - Mathematics\nFor the mathematics samples the variable HOMEEN3 was created from the responses to student demographic items B000901 (Does your family get a newspaper regularly?), B000903 (Is there an encyclopedia in your home?), B008801 (How many books are in your home?), collapsed to indicate whether or not there are more than 25 books in the home), and B000905 (Does your family get any magazines regularly?). The values for this variable were derived as follows:\n1 0-2 types The student responded to at least two items and answered \"yes\" to two or fewer.\n\n2 3 types The student answered \"yes\" to three items.\n\n3 4 types 8 Omitted\n\nThe student answered \"yes\" to four items. The student answered fewer than two items.\n\n439\n470\n\n\fNCOMP (Number of Computer Science Courses Taken)\n\nFor age class 17 (long-term trend mathematics and science), NCOMP was created from responses to items B005312 and B005313 concerning the student's coursework in computer science. The values for NCOMP were derived as follows:\n\n10\n21 32\n8 No response 9 Mu lt. & out-of-range\n\nThe student answered HAVE NOT to both courses. The student answered HAVE to one course. The student answered \"yes\" to both courses. The student did not respond to one or both items. The student filled in more than one oval for both items.\n\nNMATH (Highest Level of Mathematics Courses Taken)\n\nFor age class 17, long-term trend mathematics and science) NMATH was created from responses to items B005301 through B005307 concerning the student's coursework in mathematics. The values for NMATH were derived as follows:\n\n1 Gen. mathematics or pre-algebra\n\nThe student answered HAVE NOT to all items or\nHAVE to B005301 or B005302 and HAVE NOT to all others.\n\n2 Algebra 3 Geometry\n\nThe student answered HAVE to B005303 and HAVE NOT to B005304, B005305, B005306, and B005307.\nThe student answered HAVE to both B005303 and B005305 and HAVE NOT to B005304, B005306, and B005307.\n\n4 Algebra 2\n\nThe student answered HAVE to B005304 or B005306 but HAVE NOT to B005307.\n\n5 Calculus 6 Something else\n\nThe student answered HAVE to B005307. Anyl other response combination\n\n8 No response\n\nThe student did not respond to any item.\n\n440\n4 71\n\n\fNSCI (Highest Level of Science Courses Taken)\n\nFor age class 17, (long-term trend mathematics and science) NSCI was created from responses to items B005308 through B005311, which concerned the student's coursework in science. The values for\nNSCI were derived as follows:\n\n1 No biology\n\nThe student answered HAVE NOT to all items or HAVE to B005308 and other than HAVE to all other items.\n\n2 Biology\n\nThe student answered HAVE to B005309 and other than HAVE to both B005310 and B005311.\n\n3 Chemistry\n\nThe student answered HAVE to both B005309 and B005310 and other than HAVE to B005311.\n\n4 Physics\n\nThe student answered HAVE to B005309, B005310, and B005311.\n\n5 Something else 8 No response\n\nAny other response combination The student answered none of the items.\n\n472\n\n441\n\n\fVARIABLES DERIVED FROM COGNITIVE ITEMS\nBKSCOR (Booklet-Level Score)\nThe booklet-level score is a student-level score based on the sum of the number correct for dichotomous items plus the sum of the scores on the polytomous items, where the score for a polytomous item starts from 0 for the unacceptable category. Thus, for a 4-point extended constructed-response item, scores of \"no response\", \"off-task\", and \"unsatisfactory\" are assigned an item score of 0. Scores of \"partial,\" \"essential,\" and \"extensive\" are assigned item scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The score is computed based on all cognitive items in a student's assessment booklet.\nLOGIT (Logit Percent Correct Within Booklet)\nIn order to compute the LOGIT score, a percent correct within booklet was first computed. This score was based on the ratio of the booklet score (BKSCOR) over the maximum booklet score. The percent correct score was set to .0001 if no items were answered correctly; if BKSCOR equaled the maximum booklet score, the percent correct score was set to .9999. A logit score, LOGIT, was calculate for each student by the following formula:\nPCTCOR 1 LOGIT = ln[\nLi- PCTCOR\nA logit score, LOGIT, was calculated within booklet for each student by the following formula: LOGIT was then truncated to a value x, such that -3 s x s 3. After computing LOGIT for each student, the mean and standard deviation were calculated for each booklet as the first step in standardizing the logit scores. The standardized logit score, ZLOGIT, was then calculated for each student by the following formula:\nZLOGIT =[LOGIT mean\nstandard deviation\n\n473\n\n443\n\n\fNORMIT (Normit Gaussian Score) SCHNORM (School-Level Mean Gaussian Score)\nThe normit score is a student-level Gaussian score based on the inverse normal transformation of the mid-percentile rank of a student's number-correct booklet score within that booklet. The normit scores were used to decide collapsing of variables, finalize conditioning coding, and check the results of scaling.\nThe number correct is based on the number of dichotomous items answered correctly plus the score obtained on extended constructed-response items. The mid-percentile rank is based on the formula:\nCF(0+ CF(i 1)\n2N\nwhere CF(i) is the cumulative frequency at i items correct and N is the total sample size. If i = 0 then\nCF(0)+CF(1)\n2 2N\nA school-level normit, SCHNORM, was also created; this was the mean normit across all reading booklets administered in a school. These school-level mean normit scores were used in conditioning procedures to take into account differences in school proficiency. For each school, the weighted mean of the logits for the students in that school was calculated. Each student was then assigned that mean as his or her school-level mean logit score value.\n\n444\n\n474\n\n\fVARIABLES RELATED TO PROFICIENCY SCALING\nProficiency Score Variables\nItem response theory (1RT) was used to estimate average proficiency for the nation and for various subpopulations, based on students' performance on the set of cognitive items they received. IRT provides a common scale on which performance can be reported for the nation and subpopulations, even when all students do not answer the same set of questions. This common scale makes it possible to report on relationships between students' characteristics (based on their responses to the background questions) and their overall performance in the assessment.\nA scale ranging from 1 to 500 or from 1 to 300 was created to report performance for each content area or strand. A composite scale was created based on a weighted average of scales, where the weight for each content area or strand was proportional to the relative importance assigned to the content area as specified in the mathematics and science objectives.\nScale proficiency estimates were obtained for all students. The NAEP methods use random draws (plausible values) from estimated proficiency distributions to compute population statistics. Plausible values are not optimal estimates of individual proficiency; instead, they serve as intermediate values to be used in estimating population characteristics. Chapter 11 provides further details on the computation and use of plausible values. Chapters 12-18 provide additional information as appropriate to each sample/subject area.\nThe proficiency score (plausible value) variables are provided on the student data files for each of the scales and are named as shown in Table B-2.\n\nTable B-2 Scaling Variables for the 1996 National Assessment Samples\n\nSample\n\nScale\n\nData Variables\n\nMathematics Main\n\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations Measurement Geometry and Spatial Sense Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability Algebra and Functions Composite\n\nMRPS11 to MRPS15\nMRPS21 to MRPS25 MRPS31 to MRPS35 MRPS41 to MRPS45\nMRPS51 to MRPS55 MRPCM1 to MRPCM5\n\nScience Main\n\nPhysical Science Earth Science Life Science Composite\n\nSRPS11 to SRPS15 SRPS21 to SRPS25 SRPS31 to SRPS35 SRPCM1 to SRPCM5\n\nReading Long-Term Trend Writing Long-Term Trend Mathematics Long-Term Trend\n\nUnivariate Univariate Univariate\n\nREDVAL1 to REDVAL5 WRPSCT1 to WRPSCT5 MRPSCT1 to MRPSCT5\n\nScience Long-Term Trend\n\nUnivariate\n\nSRPSCT1 to SRPSCT5\n\n445\n475\n\n\fSMEANx, SMNx1 SRANKx, SRNKx1 SRNK3x, SRK3x1 where x = M or S\n\n(School Mean Score Using First Plausible Value) (School Rank Using First Plausible Value) (Top, Middle, Bottom Third Using First Plausible Value for Science or Mathematics)\n\nA mean composite score (SMEANx on the student files, SMNx1 on the school files) was calculated using the first composite plausible value for each school within each grade/subject area. The mean composite score was based on the values from the scaling variable xRPCM1 and was calculated\nusing the students' sampling weights. The schools were then ordered from highest to lowest mean score (SRANKx on the student files, SRNKx1 on the school files) within a sample using school-level weights the school with the highest mean score was given a ranking of 1, and the school with the lowest mean score was given a ranking equal to the number of schools in the sample.\n\nThese variables were then used in partitioning the schools within the national grade sample into\nthree groups (top third, middle third, and bottom third) based on their ranking (SRNK3x on the student files, SRK3x1 on the school files).\n\nSMNxn SRNKxn SRK3xn SMNRPn\n\n(School Mean Score Using Plausible Values 2 Through 5) (School Rank Using Plausible Values 2 Through 5) (Top, Middle, Bottom Third Using Plausible Values 2 Through 5) (School Mean Score Using Plausible Values 2 Through 5, Public Schools Only)\n\nSchool ranking results presented in the 1996 NAEP reports are based on the first plausible value. However, since there are four additional estimates of proficiency (plausible values) for each student,\nschool ranking data were also created for those estimates. These school rank values were created using the same procedures described above, substituting proficiency variables xRPCM2 through xRPCM5 to compute the results. In the variable names, n denotes the plausible value 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n446\n476\n\n\fQUALITY EDUCATION DATA VARIABLES (QED)\nThe data files contain several variables obtained from information supplied by Quality Education Data, Inc. (QED). QED maintains and annually updates lists of schools showing grade span, total enrollment, instructional dollars per pupil, and other information for each school. These data variables are retained on both the school and student files and are identified in the data layouts by \"(QED)\" in the SHORT LABEL field.\nMost of the QED variables are defined sufficiently in the data codebooks. Explanations of others are provided below.\nORSHPT is the Orshansky Percentile, an indicator of relative wealth that specifies the percentage of school-age children in a district who fall below the poverty line.\nIDP represents, at the school district level, dollars per student spent for textbooks and supplemental materials. The range code for instructional dollars spent per pupil excluding teacher salaries are:\n0 = Unclassified 1 = Under $10 2 = $10-49 3 = $50-99 4 = $100-149 5 = $150-299 6 = $300-399 7 = $400-499 8 = $500-999 9 = $1000 + ADULTED indicates whether or not adult education courses are offered at the school site. URBAN defines the school's urbanization: urban (central city); suburban (area surrounding central city, but still located within the counties constituting the metropolitan statistical area); or rural (area outside any metropolitan statistical area).\n477\n447\n\n\fAppendix C\nCONDITIONING VARIABLES AND CONTRAST CODINGS\nThis appendix contains information about the conditioning variables used in scaling/plausible value estimation for the 1996 NAEP assessment. The initial step in construction of conditioning variables involves forming primary student-based vectors of response data from answers to student, teacher, and school questionnaires, demographic and background data such as supplied by Westat, Inc., and other student information known prior to scaling. The initial conditioning vectors concatenate this student background information into a series of identifying \"contrasts\" comprising:\n1. Categorical variables derived by expanding the response options of a questionnaire variable into a binary series of one-degree-of-freedom \"dummy\" variables or contrasts, (these form the majority of each student\nconditioning vector);\n2. Questionnaire or demographic variables that possess ordinal response options, such as number of hours spent watching television, which are\nincluded as linear and/or quadratic multi-degree-of-freedom contrasts;\n3. Continuous variables, such as student logit scores based on percent correct values, included as contrasts in their original form or a transformation of their original form, and;\n4. Interactions of two or more categorical variables forming a set of orthogonal one-degree-of-freedom dummy variables or contrasts.\nThis appendix gives the specifications used for constructing the conditioning variables. Table C1 defines the information provided for each main sample variable. Table C-2 provides a summary of the mathematics conditioning variables specifications that are contained in the remainder of this appendix. Table C-3 provides a summary of the science conditioning variables specifications that are contained in the remainder of this appendix. Conditioning variable data specific to each subject area is shown for main mathematics in Table C-4 and for science in Table C-5. Similar information for long-term trend samples is given in Tables C-6, C-7, C-8, and C-9 respectively for reading, mathematics, science, and writing.\nAs described in Chapter 9, the linear conditioning model employed for the estimation of plausible values did not directly use the conditioning variable specifications listed in this appendix. To eliminate inherent instabilities in estimation encountered when using a large number of correlated variables, a principal component transformation of the correlation matrix obtained from the conditioning variable contrasts derived according to these primary specifications was performed. The principal components scores based on this transformation were used as the predictor variables in estimating the linear conditioning model. The proportions of variance of the conditioning contrast accounted for by the principal components are given for each age/grade level in Tables C-10, C-11, and C-12 for mathematics, and Tables C-13, C-14, and C-15 for science.\n\nlas\n\n449\n\n\fTable C-1 Description of Specifications Provided for Each Conditioning Variable\n\nTitle CONDITIONING ID\nDESCRIPTION GRADES/ASSESSMENTS CONDITIONING VAR LABEL NAEP ID TYPE OF CONTRAST\nTOTAL NUMBER OF SPECIFIED CONTRASTS\nNUMBER OF INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS\n\nDescription A unique eight-character ID assigned to identify each conditioning variable corresponding to a particular background or subject area question within the entire pool of conditioning variables. The first four characters identify the origin of the variable: BACK (background questionnaire), READ (student reading questionnaire), SCHL (school questionnaire), TCHR (background part of teacher questionnaire), and TSUB (subject classroom part of teacher questionnaire). The second four digits represent the sequential position within each origin group. A short description of the conditioning variable. Three characters identifying assessment (\"S\" for state, \"N\" for national) and grade (04, 08, and 12) in which the conditioning\nvariable was used.\nA descriptive eight-character label identifying the conditioning\nvariable. The seven-character NAEP database identification for the conditioning variable. The type of conditioning variable. \"CLASS\" identifies a categorical conditioning variable and \"SCALE\" identifies continuous or quasicontinuous conditioning variables. \"INTERACTION\" identifies a set of orthogonal contrasts formed from two or more \"CLASS\" variables.\n\"OTHER\" conditioning variables do not fall into any of the above\ntypes. Each conditioning variable forms a set of one or more contrasts. For each valid response value of conditioning variable a contrast must be defined. One or more response values may be collapsed together to\nform one contrast. The number of response value \"sets\" of a\nconditioning variable forming a unique contrast is the value given in\nthis field. The number of degree of freedom in a set of contrasts formed from a conditioning variable. For a categorical conditioning variable this number would be the number of response options minus one if each response option formed its own unique contrast.\n\n479\n\n451\n\n\fTable C-2 Summary Table of the 1996 Mathematics Assessment Conditioning Variable Specifications\n\nk8 0\n\nConditioning NAEP\n\nID\n\nID\n\nBACK0001 BACK0002 BACK0003 BACK0004 BACK0005 BACK0006 BACK0007 BACK0008 BACK0009 BACK0010 BACK0011 BACK0012 BACK0013 BACK0014 BACK0015 BACK0016 BACK0017 BACK0018 BACK0019 BACK0020 BACK0021 BACK0022 BACK0023 BACK0024\nBACK0025 BACK0026 BACK0027 SCHL0001 SCHL0002 BACK0028 BACK0029 BACK0030 BACK0031 BACK0032 BACK0033 BACK0034 BACK0035 BACK0036 BACK0037 BACK0038 BACK0039 BACK0040 BACK0041 SUBJ0001 BACK0042 BACK0043.

For each of the polytomously scored items (i.e., the extended constructedresponse items), the tables also show the estimates of the di, parameters (see Equation 11.3) and their associated standard errors.\nFor the main assessment items, the tables also show the block in which each item appears for each age class (Block) and the position of each item within its block (Item).\nNote that item parameters shown in this appendix are in the metrics used for the original calibration of the scales. The transformations needed to represent these parameters in terms of the metric of the final reporting scales are given in Chapters 12 through 18.\n\n7 E 2\n\n671\n\n\fTable D-1 IRT Parameters for the 1996 Mathematics Main Samples\nNumber Sense, Properties, and Operations, Grade 4\n\nNAEP ID\n1m010131 1m010231 1m010431 1m010531 1m010631 1m010831 1m011131 1m017401 1m017701 1m017901 1m018201 1m018401 1m018501 1m018601 1m020001 1m020101 1m020501 1m039001 1m039201 1m039901 1m040201 1m040301 1M040701 1m040901 1m042601 1m042901 1m043001 1m043301 1m046001 1m046301 1m046501 1m046801 1m046901 1M047501 1M066101 1m066401 1m066701 1m066801 1m067801 1m068001 1m068002 1m068301 1m068401 1m068501\n\nBlock Item\n\nmH 2A\n\nmH 3A\n\nmH\n\n5A\n\nmH\n\n6A\n\nmH 7A\n\nmH\n\n9A\n\nmH 13A\n\nmD\n\n1\n\nmD\n\n4\n\nmD\n\n6\n\nmD\n\n9\n\nmD 11\n\nmD 12\n\nmD 13\n\nmF 4A\n\nmF 5A\n\nmF\n\n9A\n\nMc\n\n1\n\nmC\n\n3A\n\nmC 10\n\nMc 13A\n\nm1\n\n1A\n\nmi\n\n5\n\nmi\n\n7A\n\nmm\n\n1\n\nmm\n\n4\n\nmm\n\n5\n\nmm 8A\n\nMK\n\n1A\n\nmK\n\n4\n\nmK\n\n6\n\nmK\n\n9A\n\nmK 10A\n\nmK 16\n\nmE\n\n2\n\nmE\n\n5\n\nmE 8A\n\nPIE\n\n9A\n\nmG\n\n3\n\nmG 5A\n\nMG 6A\n\nML 1A\n\nML 2A\n\nmL 3A\n\nai (s.e.)\n\n0.461 0.556 0.711 0.569 0.295 1.005 0.872 0.359 0.961 1.383 1.052 1.414 0.738 0.740 1.159 0.934 0.678 0.766 0.792 0.899 1.005 0.647 0.671 1.412 0.830 0.603 0.690 0.781 0.658 1.175 0.684 1.035 0.919 0.511 0.791 0.793 0.731 0.470 1.937 0.731 0.710 1.192 0.889 1.177\n\n(0.037) (0.044) (0.065) (0.078) (0.025) (0.068) (0.062) (0.037) (0.074) (0.087) (0.102) (0.113) (0.210) (0.120) (0.042) (0.044) (0.034) (0.050) (0.032) (0.095) (0.055) (0.029) (0.069) (0.053) (0.060) (0.068) (0.047) (0.034) (0.031) (0.089) (0.100) (0.041) (0.037) (0.043) (0.065) (0.120) (0.031) (0.018) (0.167) (0.046) (0.032) (0.101) (0.085) (0.103)\n\n(s.e.)\n\n-1.996 -0.586\n0.194 1.387 -2.058 0.095 -0.053 -3.271 0.438 0.539 1.297 0.767 3.443 2.359 -0.185 1.301 1.030 -1.617 -0.217 1.694 1.632 0.116 0.629 0.422 -0.445 0.831 -0.870 0.738 -1.104 0.609 1.454 0.616 0.425 -0.750 -0.877 1.508 -0.114 0.108 1.001 0.713 0.544 -0.173 0.191 0.369\n\n(0.220) (0.155) (0.106) (0.130) (0.177) (0.058) (0.075) (0.365) (0.056) (0.032) (0.056) (0.039) (0.488) (0.172) (0.024) (0.046) (0.051) (0.130) (0.032) (0.076) (0.057) (0.037) (0.101) (0.022) (0.100) (0.109) (0.126) (0.038) (0.053) (0.044) (0.107) (0.029) (0.030) (0.183) (0.123) (0.110) (0.032) (0.042) (0.040) (0.055) (0.034) (0.071) (0.086) (0.055)\n\nc.

ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS FOR THE 1996 MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT\nMary Lyn Bourque National Assessment Governing Board\nIntroduction\nSince 1984, NAEP has reported the performance of students in the nation and for specific subpopulations on a 0-to-500 proficiency scale. The history and development of the scale and the anchoring procedure used to interpret specific points on that scale is described elsewhere in this report.\nThe achievement levels reported in 1996 were first developed in 1992 through a process described in more detail in the following sections of this chapter. The levels were based on the mathematics assessment framework and item pools developed for the 1990 and 1992 assessments. Although the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) updated this framework in preparation for the 1996 assessment, the differences in test and item specifications were not large enough to warrant a new mathematics scale. Therefore, a decision was made by the Board to retain the same levels as reported for the 1990 and 1992 assessments, thus allowing a third point of comparison for the short-term mathematics trend.\nHistory of the Achievement Levels Development 1990 - 1992\nThe 1988 legislation' created an independent board, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), responsible for setting policy for the NAEP program. The Board has a statutory mandate to identify \"appropriate achievement goals for each . .. grade in each subject area to be tested under the National Assessment.\" Consistent with this directive, and striving to achieve one of the primary mandates of the statute \"to improve the form and use of NAEP results,\" the Board set performance standards (called achievement levels by NAGB) for the National Assessment in 1990 and again in 1992. The 1994 legislation (Public Law 103-382) continued the, policy Board with slightly increased membership, and a continued mandate to set student performance standards on each age and grade tested.\nThe 1990 trial, initiated in December 1989 with the dissemination of a draft policy statement (NAGB, 1989) and culminating 22 months later in the publication of the NAGB report, The Levels of Mathematics Achievement (Bourque & Garrison, 1991), consisted of two phases: the main study and a replication-validation study. Although there were slight differences between the two phases, there were many common elements. Both phases used a modified (iterative/empirical) Angoff (1971) procedure for arriving at the levels; both focused on estimating performance levels based on a review of the 1990 NAEP mathematics item pool; and both phases employed a set of policy definitions for Basic, Proficient, and Advanced (NAGB, 1990) as the criteria for making the item ratings. However, the 1990 process was evaluated by a number of different groups (see Hambleton & Bourque, 1991) who identified technical flaws in the 1990 process. These evaluations influenced NAGB's decision to set the levels again in 1992\nPublic Law 100-297. (1988). National assessment of educational progress improvement act (Article No. USC 1221). Washington, DC.\n739\n8' 2 3\n\n\fand to not use the 1990 levels as benchmarks for progress toward the national goals during the coming decade. However, it is interesting to note that the 1990 and 1992 processes produced remarkably similar results.\nIn September 1991 NAGB contracted with American College Testing (ACT) to convene the panels of judges that would recommend the levels on the 1992 NAEP assessments in reading, writing, and mathematics. While the 1992 level-setting activities were not unlike those undertaken by NAGB in 1990, there were significant improvements made in the process for 1992. There was a concerted effort to bring greater technical expertise to the process: The contractor selected by NAGB has a national reputation for setting standards in a large number of certification and licensure exams; an internal and external advisory team monitored all the technical decisions made by the contractor throughout the process; and state assessment directors periodically provided their expertise and technical assistance at key stages in the project.\nSetting achievement levels is a method for setting standards on the NAEP assessment that identifies what students should know and be able to do at various points along the proficiency scale. The initial policy definitions of the achievement levels were presented to panelists along with an illustrative framework for more indepth development and operationalization of the levels. Panelists were asked to determine descriptions/definitions of the three levels from the specific framework developed for the NAEP assessment with respect to the content and skills to be assessed. The operationalized definitions were refined throughout the level-setting process, as well as validated with a supplementary group of judges subsequent to the level-setting meetings. Panelists were also asked to develop a list of illustrative tasks associated with each of the levels, after which sample items from the NAEP item pool were identified to exemplify the full range of performance of the intervals between levels. The emphasis in operationalizing the definitions and in identifying and selecting exemplar items and papers was to represent the full range of performance from the lower level to the next higher level. The details of the implementation procedures are outlined in the remainder of this appendix.\nPreparing for the 1992 Mathematics Level-Setting Meeting\nIt is important for the planning of any standard-setting effort to know how various process elements interact with each other. For example, panelists interact with pre-meeting materials, the meeting materials (i.e., the assessment questions, rating forms, rater feedback, and so forth), each other, and the project staff. All of these elements combine to promote or degrade what has been called intrajudge consistency and interjudge consensus (Friedman & Ho, 1990).\nPrevious research has conceptualized the effects of two major kinds of interaction: people interacting with text (Smith & Smith, 1988) and people interacting with each other (Curry, 1987; Fitzpatrick, 1989). To assess the effects of textual and social interaction and adjust the standard setting procedures accordingly, a pilot study was conducted as the first phase of the 1992 initiative.\nReading was chosen as the single content area to be pilot-tested since it combined all of the various features found in the other NAEP assessments, including multiple-choice, short constructedresponse, and extended constructed-response items. The pilot study provided the opportunity to implement and evaluate all aspects of the operational planbackground materials, meeting materials, study design, meeting logistics, staff function, and participant function.\n\n740\n\n8 4\n\n\fThe overall pilot effort was quite successful. The level-setting process worked well, and the pilot allowed the contractor to make improvements in the design before implementation activities began. For example, schedule changes were made that allowed the panelists more time to operationalize the policy definitions before beginning the item-rating task. Also, the feedback mechanisms used to inform panelists about interjudge and intrajudge consistency data were improved for clarity and utility to the entire\nprocess.\n\nThe Mathematics Level-Setting Panel\nSixty-nine panelists representing 32 jurisdictions (31 states and the District of Columbia) from the 424 nominees were invited to participate in the level-setting process. They represented mathematics teachers at grades 4, 8, and 12, nonteacher educators, and members of the noneducator (general public) community. The group was balanced by gender, race/ethnicity, NAEP regions of the country, community type (low SES, not low SES), district size, and school type (public/private). One panelist was unable to attend due to a family emergency, resulting in 68 participants: 24 at grade 4 and 22 at grades 8 and 12.\n\nProcess for Developing the Achievement Levels\n\nThe four-and-one-half day session began with a brief overview of NAEP and NAGB, a presentation on the policy definitions of the achievement levels, a review of the NAEP mathematics assessment framework, and a discussion of fadtors that influence item difficulty. The purpose of the presentation was to focus panelists' attention on the mathematics framework and to emphasize the fact that panelists' work was directly related to the NAEP assessment, not to the whole.domain of\nmathematics.\n\nAll panelists completed and self-scored an appropriate grade-level form of the NAEP assessment. The purpose of this exercise was to familiarize panelists with the test content and scoring protocols before beginning to develop the preliminary operationalized descriptions of the three levels.\n\nWorking in small groups of five or six, panelists expanded and operationalized the policy definitions of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced in terms of specific mathematical skills, knowledge, and behaviors that were judged to be appropriate expectations for students in each grade, and were in\naccordance with the current mathematics assessment framework.\n\nThe policy definitions are as follows:\n\nBasic\n\nThis level, below proficient, denotes partial mastery of the knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade-4, 8, and 12.\n\nProficient\n\nThis central level represents solid academic performance for each grade tested-4, 8, and 12. Students reaching this level have demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter and are well prepared for the next level of schooling.\n\nAdvanced\n\nThis higher level signifies superior performance beyond proficient gradelevel mastery at grades 4, 8, and 12.\n\n741\n\n\fThe small groups were allowed to brainstorm about what student performance should be, using the framework and their experience in completing the NAEP assessment as guides2. A comprehensive listing of grade-level descriptors was developed, and panelists were asked to identify the five that best described what students should be able to do at each of the levels. Those descriptors appearing with the greatest frequency were compiled into a discussion list for the grade-level groups. Additions, deletions, and modifications were made as a result of discussions, and the groups reached general agreement that the final list of descriptors represented what students should be able to do at each achievement level.\nPanelists next received two hours of training in the Angoff method. Training was customized to reflect the unique item formats of the particular subject area assessment. Once a conceptual consensus was reached about the characteristics of marginally acceptable examinees at each of the three levels, practice items from the released pool were rated by the panelists according to the process defined in the contractor's plan. For multiple-choice and short constructed-response items, panelists were asked to rate each item for the expected probability of a correct response for a group of marginally acceptable examinees at the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced levels. For extended constructed-response items, panelists were asked to review 20 to 25 student response papers and select three papers, one for each achievement level, that typified marginally acceptable examinee performance for that level.\nFollowing training in the Angoff method, the judges began the rating process, inspecting and rating each item in the pool for the expected probabilities of answering the item correctly at each level. Panelists completed three rounds of item ratings. For Round 1, panelists first answered the items in each section, then reviewed their answers using scoring keys and protocols. This process helped ensure that panelists would be thoroughly familiar with each item, including the foils and scoring rubrics, before rating the items. Panelists provided item ratings/paper selections for all three achievement levels, one item at a time, for all the items in a section, then proceeded to the next set of items, for which the process was repeated. During Round 1, panelists used their lists of descriptors and other training materials for guidance in the rating process.\nFollowing Round 1, item response theory (IRT) was used to convert the rating results3 for each rater to a latent ability scale represented by the Greek letter theta (0). This 0 scale was the same scale used to calibrate the NAEP items evaluated by each panelist. In order to provide meaningful feedback about item ratings, a special relative scale was constructed, which was a linear transformation of the theta scale having a mean of 75 and standard deviation of 15. Before Round 2 of the rating process, panelists were given interjudge consistency information using this relative scale. This information allowed panelists to see on the scale where their individual mean item ratings were, relative to the mean for the group and to the means for other panelists. Reasons for extreme mean ratings, including the possibility that some panelists misinterpreted the item rating task, were discussed briefly.\nBefore Round 2, panelists were also given item difficulty data. This information was presented as the percentage of students who answered each item correctly during the actual NAEP administration, for items scored \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" (i.e., multiple-choice and short constructed-response items), and as the percentage of students rec,eiving scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the extended constructed-response items4. Panelists were told that this item difficulty information should be used as a reality check. For items on which item ratings differed substantially from the item difficulty value, panelists were asked to\n2 The panelists also reviewed about half the item pool (the half they would not be rating later) so the descriptors could be further modified if appropriate. 3 Because the IRT item parameters were not available for the polytomously scored (extended constructed-response) items, these items (five at grade 4, six each at grades 8 and 12) were not included in the following discussion of results. 4 The percentages presented to the raters summed to 100 percent, but this excluded the percentagesaround 80 percent, in some casesof students who wrote responses that were judged to be \"off-task,\" those who \"skipped\" that question and continued beyond that question, and those who, apparently, \"never reached\" that question.\n742\n\n\freexamine the item to determine if they had misinterpreted the item or misjudged its difficulty. Results of the data analysis, and panelists' own evaluations, indicated that the item difficulty information was perceived as very useful but had little impact on panelists' ratings.\nFor Round 2, panelists reviewed the same set of items they had rated in Round 1 and, using the interjudge consistency information, the item difficulty information, and the information provided prior to Round 1, they either confirmed their initial item ratings or adjusted their ratings to reflect the additional information. About one-third of Round 1 item ratings were adjusted during Round 2.\nFollowing Round 2, panelists' ratings were reanalyzed and additional information was presented to panelists concerning intrajudge variability prior to Round 3. For each panelist, the intrajudge variability information consisted of those items that they had rated differently than items having similar difficulty, taking into consideration the panelist's aggregated item ratings. That is, the panelists' aggregated item ratings were converted to the theta (A) scale. All items rated by the panelists were then analyzed in terms of the panelist's achievement level (0) in comparison to actual student performance on the items. The observed item rating from each panelist was contrasted to an expected item rating. Those items with large differences between observed and expected ratings were identified. Panelists were given this information and asked to review each of these items and decide if their Round 2 ratings still accurately reflected their best judgments of the items. The intrajudge consistency data was to be used to flag items for reconsideration in the final round of rating.\nFor Round 3, panelists reviewed the same set of items they rated in Rounds 1 and 2 using both the new intrajudge variability information and the information made available during Rounds 1 and 2. In addition, panelists could discuss, within their small groups, ratings of specific items about which they were unsure. About 20 percent of the item ratings were adjusted during Round 3.\nProcess of Selecting Exemplar Items\nFollowing the standard-setting meeting, a series of procedures was implemented to select exemplar items. First, expected and empirical p-values were computed for each item in the released item pool. Expected p-values were based on predicted performance at the cut-off score for each achievement level and empirical p-values were based on the average performance of all students responding to the item. Items that did not have expected p-values - 0.51 for any of the levels were deleted from the item pool. Second, items were compared to the operationalized descriptions of the levels. Items that did not match the content of the descriptions were deleted from the item pool. Third, the remaining items were classified as possible Basic, Proficient, or Advanced exemplars based on content match. Fourth, the validation panel reviewed the items and recommended a set of items to serve as exemplars for the levels. The final set of items was reviewed and approved by NAGB at their May 1992 meeting. These procedures are described in detail below.\nUsing the standard-setting ratings, expected p-values were computed for each item at the cut point for each achievement level. The criteria described below were applied to the scale-level results and an analysis was conducted to delineate items that could serve as exemplars for each achievement level (Basic, Proficient, Advanced).\n\n827\n\n743\n\n\fMore specifically, for an item to be chosen as a possible exemplar for the Basic achievement level:\n1. The expected p-value for students at the cut point for the Basic level of achievement had to be greater than 0.51;\n2. The content of the item had to match the content of the operationalized description of Basic; and\n3. The empirical p-value for the item had to be higher than empirical p-values for items selected as exemplars for the Proficient level.\nAs an example:\n\nGrade 4 Basic Level Item M022801\n\nLevel\n\nBasic\n\nProficient\n\nScale point\n\n211\n\n248\n\nExpected p-value\n\n0.70\n\n0.82\n\nEmpirical p-value = 0.52\n\nAdvanced 280 0.94\n\nFor an item to be chosen as a possible exemplar for the Proficient achievement level:\n1. The expected p-value for students at the cut-off score for the Proficient level of achievement had to be greater than 0.51;\n2. The content of the item had to match the content of the operationalized description of Proficient; and\n3. The empirical p-value for the item had to be lower than empirical p-values for Basic exemplar items, but higher than student p-values for Advanced exemplar items.\nAs an example:\n\nGrade 4 Proficient Level Item M022001\n\nLevel\n\nBasic\n\nProficient\n\nScale point\n\n211\n\n248\n\nExpected p-value\n\n0.37\n\n0.58\n\nEmpirical p-value = 0.35\n\nAdvanced 280 0.76\n\n744\n\n\fFor an item to be chosen as a possible exemplar for the Advanced achievement level:\n1.

The content of the item had 'to match the content of the operationalized description\nof Advanced; and\n3. The empirical p-value for the item had to be lower than empirical p-values for\nProficient exemplar items.\nAs an example:\n\nGrade 4 Advanced Level Item M023101\n\nLevel\n\nBasic\n\nProficient\n\nScale point\n\n211\n\n248\n\nExpected p-value\n\n0.29\n\n0.43\n\nEmpirical p-value = 0.22\n\nAdvanced 280\n0.61\n\nThe analysis procedures described above yielded 31 items as possible grade 4 exemplars, 43 items as possible grade 8 exemplars, and 37 items as possible grade 12 exemplars, as follows:\n\nPossible Exemplar Items by Grade and Achievement Level\n\nGrade\n\nBasic\n\nProficient\n\nAdvanced\n\n4\n\n9\n\n14\n\n8\n\n8\n\n23\n\n15\n\n5\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n7\n\nFor grade 4, the possible exemplars represented 49 percent of the released item pool. For grades 8 and 12, the possible exemplars represented 54 percent of the released item pool for each grade.\n\nProcess for Validating the Levels\nEighteen mathematics educators participated in the item selection and content validation process. Ten of the panelists were mathematics teachers who had participated in the original achievement levelssetting process and who had been identified as outstanding panelists by grade group facilitators during this meeting. The other eight panelists represented the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the\n745\n\n\fMathematical Sciences Education Board, and state-level mathematics curriculum supervisors. To the extent possible, the group was balanced by race/ethnicity, gender, community type, and region of the country.\nThe two-and-one-half day meeting began by briefing panelists on the purpose of the meeting. They first reviewed the operationalized descriptions of the achievement levels for consistency with the NAGB policy definitions of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced and with the NAEP Mathematics Objectives. Next, they reviewed the operationalized descriptions of the achievement levels for qualities such as within- and across-grade consistency, grade-level appropriateness, and utility for increasing the public's understanding of the NAEP mathematics results. Finally, working first in grade level (4, 8, and 12) groups of six panelists each, then as a whole group, panelists revised the operationalized descriptions to provide more within- and across-grade consistency and to align the language of the description more closely with the language of the NCTM Standards. Both the original descriptions and the revised descriptions are included later in this appendix.\nOn the third day, panelists again split into grade-level groups of six panelists each and reviewed the possible exemplar items. The task was to select a set of items, for each achievement level for their grade, that would best communicate to the public the levels of mathematics ability and the types of skills needed to perform in mathematics at that level.\nAfter selecting sets of items for their grades, the three grade-level groups met as a whole group to review item selection. During this process, cross-grade items that had been selected as exemplars by two grade groups (three such items were selected by grade groups 4 and 8) were assigned to one grade by whole-group consensus. In addition, items were evaluated by the whole group for overall quality. Two items were rejected by the group during this process due to possible bias. This process yielded 14 items as recommended exemplars for grade 4, 11 items as recommended exemplars for grade 8, and 14 items as recommended exemplars for grade 12.\nMapping Panelists' Ratings to the NAEP Scales\nThe process of mapping panelists' ratings to the NAEP scales made significant use of item response theory (1RT). IRT provides statistically sophisticated methods for determining the expected performance of examinees on particular test items in terms of an appropriate measurement scale. The same measurement scale simultaneously describes the characteristics of the test items and the performance of the examinees. Once the item characteristics are set, it is possible to precisely determine how examinees are likely to perform on the test items at different points of the measurement scale.\nThe panelists' ratings of the NAEP test items were likewise linked, by definition, to the expected performance of examinees at the theoretical achievement level cut points. It was therefore feasible to use the IRT item characteristics to calculate the values on the measurement scale corresponding to each achievement level. This was done by averaging the item ratings over panelists for each achievement level and then simply using the item characteristics to find the corresponding achievement level cut points on the IRT measurement scale. This process was repeated for each of the NAEP content strands within each grade (4, 8, and 12).\nIn the final stage in the mapping process, the achievement level cut points on the IRT measurement scale were combined over content strands and rescaled to the NAEP score scale. Weighted averages of the achievement level cut points were computed. The weighting constants accounted for the measurement precision of the test items evaluated by the panelists, the proportion of items belonging to\n746\n83 0\n\n\feach NAEP content strand, and the linear NAEP scale transformation. These weighted averages produced the final cut points for the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced achievement levels within each grade.\nEvaluation of the Mathematics Levels\nThe 1992 mathematics achievement levels used here to report the 1996 NAEP data were evaluated under a Congressional mandate by the National Academy of Education (NAE). A series of research studies were mounted by the NAE (National Academy of Education, 1993) to look at various aspects of the validity of the level-setting process, and the levels adopted by NAGB. Several of these studies focused specifically on the mathematics achievement levels, and were conducted for the Academy by staff at the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Based on these studies, the Academy's 1993 policy report concluded that the achievement levels in mathematics were flawed and should not be continued. The more recent report from the Academy (National Academy of Education, 1997) concluded that the current achievement levels raised serious concerns about their reliability and validity, were not reasonable (i.e., were set too high), and in the final analysis, should be abandoned by the end of the century.\nWhile NAGB did not agree with the earlier policy report and continues to disagree with the more recent one, and while the Board's contractor and its technical advisors do not believe the weight of the evidence supported the NAEP conclusions, the Board believes that standards-based reporting is responsive to the needs of the users of NAEP data, is an important aspect of the national reform movement, and assists in making NAEP data more useful and understandable to the public. The Board is committed to making improvements in the process, and will continue to support further investigation into the validity of the levels through additional research.\nFigure F-1 Final Description of 1992 Mathematics Achievement Levels\nGRADE 4\nThe NAEP content strands include: (1) number sense, properties, and operations; (2) measurement; (3) geometry; (4) data analysis, statistics, and probability; (5) algebra and functions.

That is, the Board's statutory authority requires that it be the final judge in developing the achievement levels. In so doing, the Board uses a national consensus process, seeking advice from a broad audience. The preliminary descriptions, for example, are widely circulated as partof the assessment framework documents before adoption by the Board. Similarly, in designing the level setting process the Board solicits broad input from relevant professional organizations, thetechnical community, and others. And after the proposed levels are recommended, they are generally widely circulated for comment and reflection by stakeholder groups, policymakers, content specialists, and others.\nThe Board's current decision in science considered several evaluative features of the student performance standards, including the reasonableness of the levels, whether they are valid, and whether they are likely to be useful to the public in interpreting the NAEP data. These evaluation criteria are part of the authorizing legislation, and are among the criteria against which the National Academy of Sciences will judge their merit.\nBefore adopting achievement levels in a particular subject area, the Board examines relevant extant data from other sources to inform the decision and to place it in a broader context. In the case of the 1996 science, the Board examined other data sources, including Advanced Placement (AP) science data for the grade 12 cohort; Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data for grade 8; and performance standards already set by the Board in reading, mathematics, U.S. history, and geography. They also examined the individual ratings of panelists who participated in the ACT level setting process.\nIn the final analysis, the Board adopted cut scores at points on the scale they judged to be reasonable, taking other available information into account. The interim cut points on the NAEP scale varied from those generated through the level setting process in non-systematic ways: some were higher than the recommendations; some were lower. Consequently, the relationships between the interim cut scores and the content descriptions was not clear.\nTherefore, the Board determined that a further examination of the descriptions was necessary, either to modify those that existed, or to craft new ones that would be more consistent with the policy defmitions, the framework, and the item pool used to measure the 1996 NAEP science performance. In this way, the Board could have some assurance that the descriptions would be providing a proper interpretation of the interim cut scores of what students know and can do at the various achievement levels. This report provides a summary of the process used to develop the descriptions of the levels, as well as the results of this initiative from a meeting convened in St. Louis, Missouri from June 19 through June 22, 1997.\n\n843\n\n759\n\n\fPanel Selection\n\nThe plan called for convening about 24 content experts who have knowledge of what students in the respective grades can do and are capable of doing in elementary, middle school, and secondary school science. Generally teachers, curriculum specialists, and science educators are in the best position to make these kinds of judgments. The Board-approved plan also called for some number of noneducators, though a proportionally smaller number than is typically used in the level setting process. The Advisory Committee on Education Statistics (ACES) who provides technical advice to the Board, recommended that the grade level groups include at least 5 panelists (rather than 4 as was suggested in the original plan).\nA combination of two sources of experts was used to identify participants: (1) states who had participated in the 1996 NAEP state assessments; and (2) an American College Testing (ACT) sample previously identified for the various panels which ACT assembles in conducting its work for the Board under the achievement level setting contract. Thirty-two state assessment directors were contacted and encouraged to submit the name of one person who would represent their state at the meeting. Twenty-three states responded by electing to send a participant, with one state (MA) electing to send two, and another state (TX) sending three representatives. Participatingjurisdictions are shown in Figure G-1.\n\nFigure G-1\nParticipating Jurisdictions in Developing Achievement Level Descriptions for the 1996 NAEP Science Assessment\n\nAlabama Alaska Arizona Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia\n\nGeorgia Hawaii Louisiana Maine\nMassachusetts Minnesota\n\nMontana Nebraska Nevada North Dakota New York Rhode Island\n\nTennessee Texas Utah Virginia Washington\n\nBecause some states in the initial sample were not able to send a representative, the multiple participants from a single state were honored. In addition, three noneducator panelists participated, taken from the sample of nine nominees supplied by ACT. The total number of panelists was 28. Participants were given the opportunity to select the grade level to which they wished to be assigned in a pre-registration interview. They were given their first choice in all cases, and randomly assigned to one of the two parallel groups (either Group A or Group B), ensuring that male participants and noneducators were assigned throughout the groups (since there were fewer participants in both categories).\n\nStudy Design\nThe plan approved by the Board called for two independent panels to conduct this work. Each panel was composed of 14 persons, assigned to grade level groups of 4 or 5 persons per grade. All participants were provided the same training and were asked to complete the same tasks. The design of two independent panels was for purposes of embedding a validity check into the process, which, if successful, would provide a built-in replication study. Panelists were asked in the opening plenary session to honor the independent groups design and to refrain from discussing their work with members of the other group until it was appropriate to do so, on the last day.\n\n760\n- 814\n\n\fThe plan was implemented as a multi-step process, with individual judgments being the focus of Day 2, within-grade consensus the focus of Day 3, and cross-grade, cross-level consistency being the focus of Day 4. Further, it was made clear to the panelists that this was an empirically-based design insofar as data based on actual student performances was the basis for developing the descriptions of what students know and can do at each level.\nMaterials\nPrior to the meeting panelists were sent copies of the 1996 NAEP science assessment framework. They referred to this regularly during the course of their work. In addition, on Day 2 they were given the item anchor book from which they would do all their work. The items in a given grade level appeared in the anchor book in the order in which they map to the NAEP scale, from easiest to hardest. In addition, panelists were given an index listing of the items in the same order as the anchor book, copies of the policy definitions, and forms on which they could submit the work of Day 2 and Day 3.\nTraining\nPanelists were trained simultaneously to insure standardized exposure to all relevant information needed to accomplish the task. Since all panelists were not equally familiar with NAEP and NAGB, a brief introduction was provided covering such topics as the scope of the framework, the nature of the item pool, a non-technical summary of NAEP scaling and item mapping, and instructions on how to read the information provided in the anchor binders containing all the items, from easiest to hardest.\nDuring the first plenary session, panelists were given an overviewof NAEP and NAGB, and had the tasks of the next three days presented in summary form. The training focused on giving them a level of comfort with the tasks they were going to be doing, introducingthe scope of the 1996 NAEP science assessment, with a full explanation of the content of the assessment, the vocabulary peculiar to NAEP, e.g., \"blocks of exercises,\" and the chronology of the 1996 NAEP assessment. It was important for panelists to understand where they were coming into the process, that the assessment had already been administered, scored, scaled, and reported. The achievement levels remained the only unfinished aspect of the science assessment.\nOn Day 2 the agenda called for a plenary session to provide specific training in the task of making independent judgments about the content represented by the items at the grade level. Though not described in these terms, this activity was designed to provide panelists with first-hand knowledge of the contents of the NAEP assessments, the kinds of items used, the manner of scoring the items, and the performance of students on average, at the borderline of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced, and across the levels. The time spent in reviewing each item without the assistance of other panelists forced each participant to deal with the notion of item difficulty without being influenced by others, and with the idea of operationalizing the Board's policy definitions. The real goal of Day 2, though not formally stated to panelists, was to train them in the item pool. Requiring each panelist to make an individual judgment about each item was more likely to have them read and try to understand the cognitive demand of the items than would the simpler task of reading the items thoughtfully.\nPanelists were directed to start with the items in the Basic level, those items falling between the lower and upper borderline for Basic (according to the interim levels adopted by the Board), and generate working lists of general statements representing the content of the assessment. They could generate these lists by clustering similar content together and developing generalized statements which summarized that content. When they had completed this part of the task, they were asked to compare the results with the\n761\n845\n\n\fpolicy definition for Basic, i.e., partial mastery of the prerequisite knowledge and skill fundamentalfor\nproficient work. The consistency check between the descriptions and the definitions was encouraged on an holistic basis, not an item-by-item basis. The question to be answered was, \"Does this description, in general, reflect the policy definition?\", not \"Does this item, and this item, etc., reflect the policy definition?\" If the panelist was satisfied with the general consistency between the two, they could move on to the next level, Proficient, and repeat the process; then to Advanced, and repeat the process a third time. The product for Day 2 was a working list of statements for each level from each participant. The grade 4 panelists reviewed 226 items in this process; grades 8 and 12 reviewed 312 items each.\nDuring the training panelists were given suggestions for verbs that could be used to indicate increasing knowledge and skills from one level to the next, as well as common phrases that are also indicators of hierarchical skill levels and increasing levels of sophistication in the knowledge domain. These linguistic features had been used in the past in other anchoring settings and were judged to be useful in this one as well. Panelists were not required to use these words, but most found them helpful in completing the task.\n\nPanelists were also trained in how to \"read\" the data accompanying each item. The scale value for the item using a response probability (rp) criterion of .65 was explained, as well as the differences between the \"borderline\" p-values and the \"across the range\" p-values. The training also focused on the differences between a constructed response coded [2] or partial, and those coded [3] or [4], complete.\nFinally, panelists were led through a set of about 10 items as a model for the task they were about to complete, demonstrating how to use the data, judge the difficulty of the items, and write statements using the linguistic suggestions.\n\nDay 3 was designed to have the grade level panels confer and reach group agreement on the initial\n\ndescriptions for Basic, Proficient, and Advanced at grades 4, 8, and 12. As on the previous day, the plenary\n\nsession in the morning was focused on the groups' task. They were instructed to start by reading each\n\nother's lists from the work of Day 2. They were then to select those statements from the lists for which there\n\nwas general group agreement, and to return to the remaining statements where there was lack of agreement\n\nand work them through to inclusion or exclusion, in the end creating a group master working list for Basic.\n\nThey needed to ensure that in general the master list was consistent with the policy definition for Basic,\n\nbefore they could move on to the Proficient or Advanced levels. Each group worked between the individual\n\nlists created the previous day and flip charts of the master lists. For tracking purposes, groups were\n\nencouraged to list the items that were the underpinnings for their statements, thus creating a \"paper trail\", as\n\nit were, for grade level\n\nthe statements group.\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nlists.\n\nThe\n\nproduct\n\nfor\n\nDay\n\n3\n\nwas\n\na\n\nworking\n\nlist\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nthree\n\nlevels\n\nfor\n\neach\n\nDay 4 training was focused on achieving clarity in the statements, examining consistency across levels, across grades, and with the policy definitions. Panelists were organized conference style which supported group discussion and consensus-building. Panelists were asked to track the general statements found to be inconsistent, as well as the associated items, so that a \"paper trail\" existed for the content judged to be irregular or inappropriately placed at a particular level. Such anomalies would be handled at the end of the work session if necessary.\n\nResults\nThe results of the initiative can be found in Figures G-2, G-3, and G-4 below. These are the narrative versions of the results, which have been professionally edited and returned to the panelists for their concurrence. Table 0-1 shows the percentages of panelists who approved the narratives.\n762\n\n\fFigure G-2 1996 NAEP Science Achievement Level Descriptions\nGrade 4\n\nCut Score Basic 138\n\nContent Desc dons*\n\n1\n\nStudents performing at the Basic level demonstrate some of the knowledge and reasoning required for understanding of\n\nthe earth, physical. and life sciences at a level appropriate to Grade 4.

In general, there are few differences to be noted between the results for Group A and Group B, though, according to one reviewer, Group B's statements tend to be more general than Group A's. Even though the descriptions were produced on-site, without benefit of time to be very selective in language and style, and the opportunity to conduct careful checks across grades and levels, they are remarkably consistent one to another. However, the consensus among reviewers is that Group A's descriptions are probably more consistent both within and across grades than Group B's, as well as more complete in terms of representing the items in the pool than Group B's.\nEvaluation\nPanelists were asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire at the end of the process. The purpose of the evaluation was to accomplish two goals: (1) provide feedback regarding the panelists' opinion about the consistency of the achievement levels descriptions across levels and grades, as well as between the descriptions and the policy definitions; and (2) provide feedback on the interim cut scores and the percentage of students at or above the levels. The questions covering the latter were adapted from an evaluation questionnaire used by ACT in conducting the achievement level setting process. It should be noted that the Board-approved plan did not allow for providing consequences data to the panelists during the working sessions. However, consequences data were presented on the evaluation questionnaire during the debriefing segment of the meeting when it could in no way influence the results.\nThe first eight questions dealt with consistency. Panelists provided a rating from [1] not at all consistent, to [5] very consistent. In examining differences between the two parallel groups, [A] and [B], Group [B] reports slightly more consistency than does Group [A]. Within Group [A], the grade 12 group reports less consistency in all comparisons than either grades 4 or 8.\nThe questionnaire also asked a series of questions which were adapted from the ACT questionnaires regarding the cut scores adopted on an interim basis, the percentage of students at or above the levels, and the achievement levels descriptions. Additionally, the questionnaire gave panelists the opportunity to recommend no changes in the cut scores and thus leaving the percentages of students who score at or above the levels as presented, or to recommend smaller or larger percentages of students who\nI Percentages based on the total number of respondents, not necessarily the total number ofpanelists.\n\n766\n850\n\n\fshould score at or above the levels and consequently changing the cut scores. Opinion was split evenly among those who would not change the cut scores and those who would either raise or lower the cut scores.\nThe final question asked panelists to take a position regarding the recommendations they wished to make to the National Assessment Governing Board regarding the achievement level descriptions. The majority of panelists (between 64% and 71%) recommended that the achievement levels adopted by the Board on an interim basis, and which were used to develop the achievement levels descriptions, be reported.\nSummary and Recommendations\nThe Board's plan called for describing the performance of students within the ranges on the NAEP scale for the achievement levels adopted by the Board on an interim basis. This report provides the results of the Board's plan as carried out by this process. These descriptions represent what students know and can do within the achievement level ranges of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced.\nIt is recommended that, should the Board adopt the interim levels on a permanent basis for the 1996 NAEP science achievement levels, then these descriptions should be adopted to assist in the proper interpretation of the NAEP scores. It is also recommended that in the Board's report on the levels, the differences between these descriptions on the 1996 NAEP science assessment of what students know and can do and achievement levels descriptions in other NAEP content areas of what students should know and be able to do, needs to be made clear to the readers. Additionally, it is recommended that the exemplar items (in a separate document) which are typical of student performances for each level accompany the cut scores and descriptions to assist in the proper interpretation of the NAEP scores.\nFinally, a word about the Group A and Group B descriptions. The purpose of the parallel working groups was to provide the Board with some evidence that the resulting descriptions were not idiosyncratic to a particular set of panelists. The evidence points to the fact that either set of descriptions could be used in the report. However, since the Group A descriptions seem to be slightly more internally consistent, it is recommended that Group A's become the official set, and Group B's be viewed as the validation set, and not used to report the achievement levels results.\n\n851\n\n767\n\n\fAppendix H\nTHE INFORMATION WEIGHTING E I: 0\nSusan C. Loomis, Luz Bay, and Wen-Hung Chen American College Testing\nThe Error\nIn the process of recomputing the reading cutscores set in 1992 for the three achievement levels, an error in the information weighting function was detected. The error affected data for all achievement levels set in 1992: reading and mathematics. The Muraki information weighting function published in 1993 was used in the 1994 programs to.compute achievement levels, so only 1992 levels are affected.\nThe procedures used for 1992 were printed and reported in numerous places. No one had detected an error. The psychometrician who developed the programs for the 1994 process used Muraki's information weighting function because he found it to be more straightforward than the 1992 procedure.\nThe 1992 equation' is as follows:\nrn j\nI(0) = D2\nc=1\nThe 1994 equation is as follows:\n(0) = D2 af I [Tc -T.; (6)12 Pk (0) ,\nc=I\nwhere T is the expected score for item j or proficiency 0\nmi\nTi (0) =\nc.i and Tc is the score assigned to the response category c.\n1 Notations for this equation were modified to correspond to those of Equation 2. The reader will need to refer to the articles (Luecht, 1993, and Muraki, 1993) for a complete explanation of the equations.\n769\n852\n\n\fAnalysis of the Error: Magnitude\n\nThe differences in achievement levels reported for 1992 and the corrected achievement levels are due both to the error in item parameters and to the error in information weights. The cutscores and percentages of students scoring at or above each for each achievement level are reported in Tables H-1 and H-2. Data in Table H-1 are the previously reported (incorrect) data, and data in Table H-2 are the corrected data.\n\nTable H-1 Mathematics Cutpoints and Percents At or Above as Reported\n\nGrade\n4\n8\n12\n\nCutpoint %>92 Dist Cutpoint %>92 Dist Cutpoint %>92 Dist\n\nBasic 211\n61\n256 63 287 64\n\nProficient\n248\n18\n294 25 334\n16\n\nAdvanced 280 2\n331 4\n366 2\n\nTable H-2 Corrected Mathematics Cutpoints and Percents At or Above as Reported\n\nGrade\n4\n8\n12\n\nCutpoint %>92 Dist Cutpoint %>92 Dist Cutpoint %>92 Dist\n\nBasic 214 59 262\n58 288 64\n\nProficient\n249\n18\n299 21 336\n15\n\nAdvanced 282\n2 333\n3\n367 2\n\nThe corrected cutscores are consistently the same or higher than those previously reported. The maximum difference in cutscores originally reported and the corrected cutscores is found for grade 8 at the Basic level:\n((original cutscore = 256) - (corrected cutscore = 262)) = -6 points.\nThe differences attributable to each error (parameter estimates and information weighting) appear to be rather small in most cases.\nTable H-3 reports the differences in cutscores due to the two errors, examined one at a time. Relative to the correct data, the information weighting error generally resulted in a lower composite cutscore, and the recoding error resulting in incorrect item parameters generally resulted in an even lower composite cutscore.\n\n770\n\n8 3\n\n\fTable H-3 Composite NAEP Scale Cutpoint Differences in Mathematics Due to Errors\n\nAchievement Level Cutpoint\nGrade 4 Basic Proficient Advanced\nGrade 8 Basic Proficient Advanced\nGrade 12\nB asic\nProficient Advanced\n\nInformation Weighting'\n-2\n-1 -1\n-4 -3\n-1\n0\n-1 -1\n\nItem Parameters2\n-5 -1 -1\n-8 -2 -2\n-4 -2 -2\n\nI Difference = Incorrect - Correct, based on correct item parameters.

The center row for each grade shows student performance relative to each achievement level in 1992 using both correct item parameters and correct information weights. The first row for each grade shows student performance relative to achievement levels computed with the correct item parameters and incorrect information weights. The third row for each grade shows student performance relative to achievement levels computed with the incorrect item parameters and the correct information weights.\n\n854\n\n771\n\n\fTable H-4 NAEP Mathematics Achievement Levels:\nCutpoints and 1992 Distribution Data\n\nCorrect Data, Incorrect Weight Correct Data, Correct Weight Incorrect Data, Correct Weight\n\nBasic 212 214 209\n\nGRADE 4\n\nCutpoint\n\nProficient Advanced\n\n248\n\n281\n\n249\n\n282\n\n248\n\n281\n\nPercent At or Above Cutpoint\n\nBasic Proficient Advanced\n\n62.2\n\n19.7\n\n2.1\n\n60\n\n18.7\n\n1.9\n\n65.6\n\n19.7\n\n2.1\n\nCorrect Data, Incorrect Weight Correct Data, Correct Weight Incorrect Data, Correct Weight\n\nBasic 258 262 254\n\nGRADE 8\n\nCutpoint\n\nProficient Advanced\n\n296\n\n332\n\n299\n\n333\n\n297\n\n331\n\nPercent At or Above Cutpoint\n\nBasic Proficient Advanced\n\n62.6\n\n24.4\n\n3.6\n\n58.6\n\n21.8\n\n3.3\n\n66.5\n\n23.5\n\n3.8\n\nCorrect Data, Incorrect Weight Correct Data, Correct Weight Incorrect Data, Correct Weight\n\nBasic 288 288 284\n\nGRADE 12\n\nCutpoint\n\nProficient Advanced\n\n335\n\n366\n\n336\n\n367\n\n334\n\n364\n\nPercent At or Above Cutpoint\n\nBasic Proficient Advanced\n\n64.8\n\n16.1\n\n1.9\n\n64.8\n\n15.4\n\n1.8\n\n68.7\n\n16.9\n\n2.3\n\nAnalysis of the Error: The Information Weighting Functions\nVarious analyses were conducted to determine what, if any, general conclusions could be drawn to help inform users of NAEP achievement levels data about the factors related to differences in cutscores due to the information weighting error.\nItem ratings are collected from two groups of panelists at each grade level. These groups are called item rating groups, and panelists are assigned to an item rating group so that the two are as equivalent as possible in terms of panelist type (teacher, career educator, or general public; gender; race/ethnicity; and region of residence). These item rating groups rate slightly over half of all items at their grade level. Item rating pools are developed so that the items in each are as equivalent as possible in terms of item difficulty, item format (multiple choice, short constructed response, and extended constructed response), test time for the block, and so forth. Item blocks remain intact for the item rating pools. At least one block (a \"common block\") is rated by all panel members (i.e., both item rating groups, in the grade group).\nItem ratings are placed on the NAEP scale by computing a theta value for the dichotomous items and for the polytomous items in each subscale for each rating group. Information weights are applied for the polytomous items at the subscale level before computing the subscale score for both dichotomous and polytomous items.\n\n772\n8 3 5\n\n\fTable H-5 presents the information weights computed for each rating group for the mathematics NAEP achievement levels. Those data show that there is a consistent pattern of error caused by the incorrect information function for math. Analyses of the data from 1992 and 1994 Trial State Assessments in reading show the corrected cutscores are consistently neither higher nor lower as a result of this error, although the impact of the error was generally to estimate a higher cutscore for the polytomous items. Simulated item parameters were used to demonstrate that there was no consistent effect of the incorrect information function on weights used to form the final composite cutpoints.\nAnalysis of the Effect of Item Discrimination\nFigures H-1 through H-3 show graphs for the correct and the incorrect information functions holding other parameters constant while varying the item discrimination parameter in the generalized partial credit item response theory (MT) model. In general, the differences between correct and incorrect weights increase as item discrimination increases.\nThese figures show no consistent pattern in the direction (positive or negative) of the difference between the correct and incorrect information function based on item discrimination. When the correct information function is greater than the incorrect function, we observe that information is in the area of maximum information. It is not the case, however, that the correct function always results in a greater information weight where information is maximized.\n\n6 5 6\n\n773\n\n\fTable H-5 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Infoi-mation Weights for 1992 Mathematics Achievement Levels\nBased on Corrected Item Parameters\n\n857\n\nGrade\n4\n\nRating Group\nA\n\nB\n\n8\n\nA\n\nB\n\n12\n\nA\n\nB\n\nScale\n1\n3 5\n1\n4\n1\n3\n2 4\n5 3\n4\n5 5\n\nBasic\n\nIncorrect Correct\n\n0.24\n\n0.80\n\n0.22\n\n0.39\n\n0.34\n\n0.77\n\n0.26\n\n0.66\n\n0.51\n\n1.10\n\n0.72\n\n1.23\n\n1.05\n\n1.79\n\n0.50\n\n1.25\n\n1.04\n\n2.85\n\n0.41\n\n1.31\n\n0.13\n\n0.29\n\n0.17\n\n-0.37\n\n1.59\n\n4.11\n\n1.41\n\n2.60\n\nProficient\n\nDiff Incorrect Correct\n\n-0.57 -0.16 -0.42 -0.40 -0.59\n\n0.22\n\n0.70\n\n0.21\n\n0.33\n\n0.32\n\n0.61\n\n0.25\n\n0.57\n\n0.49\n\n0.96\n\n-0.51 -0.74 -0.75 -1.81 -0.90\n\n0.76\n\n1.57\n\n1.08\n\n2.00\n\n0.47\n\n1.11\n\n0.94\n\n2.19\n\n0.32\n\n0.92\n\n-0.16 -0.21 -2.52 -1.19\n\n0.13\n\n0.29\n\n0.16\n\n0.36\n\n1.69\n\n4.82\n\n1.52\n\n3.60\n\nAdvanced\n\nDiff Incorrect Correct\n\n-0.48 -0.12 -0.29 -0.32 -0.47\n\n0.14\n\n0.25\n\n0.21\n\n0.32\n\n0.30\n\n0.50\n\n0.22\n\n-.40\n\n0.50\n\n1.01\n\n-0.81 -0.92 -0.64 -1.24 -0.60\n\n0.63\n\n1.00\n\n1.05\n\n1.82\n\n0.39\n\n0.78\n\n0.83\n\n1.59\n\n0.27\n\n0.69\n\n-0.16 -0.20 -3.17 -2.09\n\n0.13\n\n0.29\n\n0.15\n\n0.26\n\n1.67\n\n4.77\n\n1.43\n\n3.26\n\nDiff\n-0.11 -0.11 -0.20 -0.18 -0.51 -0.37 -0.76 -0.39 -0.76 -0.42 -0.16 -0.11 -3.09 -1.83\n\n774\n\n\fFigure H-1 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions Using Hypothetical Item Parameters a=.2, b=0, d0=0, d1=2, d2=0, d3=-2,\nin Case of Four Response Categories\n\n6\n\nDifference\n\n5\n\nCorrect\n\nIncorrect\n\n4\n\ng 3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTheta\n\n859\n\n\fFigure H-2 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions\nUsing Hypothetical Item Parameters a=.5, b=0, d0=0, dl=2, d2=0, d3=-2, in Case of Four Response Categories\n\n6\nDifference 5 -\nCorrect Incorrect 4\n\nIE 3 o\n2 -\n\n1-\n\n0\n\n............. ..................................................... ...... ....................... 1111111111111111111111111111111111IIIIIIIIII11111111111111\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTheta\n\n776\n\n\fFigure H-3 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions Using Hypothetical Item Parameters a=1, b=0, d0=0, d1=2, d2=0, d3=-2,\nin Case of Four Response Categories\nDifference Correct Incorrect\n\n..\n\n-.....\".'\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nTheta\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n863\n\n864\n\n\fAnalysis of the Effect of Location Parameters\nFigures H-4 through H-6 show the correct and incorrect information weighting functions for varying location parameters. The location parameters only shift the distribution of information, and that is the case for both the correct and incorrect information weighting functions. The amount of difference between the two is unchanged; only the locations change.\nAnalysis of the Effect of the Threshold Parameters.\nIf the threshold parameters are close, in terms of the locations of ICCs, the correct information function will have a high peak. In the area of maximum information, i.e. around the peak of the distribution, the incorrect information function underestimates information.\nAs can be seen in Figures H-6 through H-8, when the threshold parameters are relatively far apart, the information is relatively low and the distribution is multimodal. When the threshold parameters are closer information is higher and the distribution tends to be more unimodal. As the threshold parameters move even closer, the difference between the correct and incorrect information functions increases. As the threshold parameters become closer, the rate at which the incorrect weighting function increments weights at the peak of the distribution is slower than that for the correct function. This results in a negative difference between the two functions in the area of maximum information.\nAnalysis of the Error: Conclusions\nThree general conclusions can be drawn from our analyses:\nI. No consistent pattern of over- or underestimation can be predicted from the error in information weights. Generally, the incorrect information weighting function results in a lower information weight for 1992 mathematics assessment items, whereas, it results a higher information weight for 1992 reading assessment items.\n2. The difference between the correct and incorrect weights increases as item discrimination increases.\n3. The impact of the incorrect information weighting function on the cutscores is not consistent. The impact depends upon the location of the cutscore and the relative weight of the dichotomous items.\n778\n8 6 5\n\n\fFigure H-4 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions Using Hypothetical Item Parameters a=1.5, 6=0, dO=0, d1=2, d2.0, d3=-2,\nin Case of Four Response Categories\n\nDifference Correct Incorrect\n\n..1\n\n\\\n\n,.\n%.\n\n,...-...-.\n\n./\n\n5.\n\n.\n\n..*\n\n..\n\n.\n\nI\n\n.\n\n.\n\n%\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n./\n\ni % . s\n\n/\n!\n._, 1\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTheta\n\n866\n\n867 779\n\n\fVtgote\n\nat\n\nComparison Between tile incorreact,n1ad.5,CVo--rGtec.tt,\nUsing NypotrieticailniteCMasPearoattnfoeotetrsFkesponse a g\n\ntorrnon\n\nf(uIvnoct,ions\n\n6\n\n\fFigure H-6 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions Using Hypothetical Item Parameters a=1.5, b=1, d0=0, d1=2, d2=0, d3=-2,\nin Case of Four Response Categories .\nDifference Correct Incorrect\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTheta\n\n870\n\n871\n781\n\n\fFigure H-7 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions Using Hypothetical Itern Parameters a=1.5, 6=0, d0=0, d1=1, d2=0, d3=-1,\nin Case of Four Response Categories\nDifference Correct Incorrect\n\n872\n782\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nTheta\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\fFigure H-8 Comparison Between the Incorrect and Correct Information Functions Using Hypothetical Item Parameters a=1.5, b=0, d0=0, d1=0.52, d2=0, d3=-0.52,\nin Case of Four Response Categories\nDifference Correct Incorrect\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTheta\n\n874\n\n7S 75\n\n\fAppendix I CONSTRUCTED-RESPONSE ITEM SCORE STATISTICS\nThis appendix contains information about the constructed-response items included in the scaling of data from the 1996 main assessments of mathematics and science and the long-term trend assessments of reading, writing, and mathematics. There were no constructed-response items included in the scaling for the 1996 long-term trend assessment of science.\nThe information in the tables includes, for each subject area and grade (in the case of long-term trend, each age class), the NAEP item numbers for each of the constructed-response items included in scaling, and the block that contains the item. The tables also indicate the codes from the NAEP database that denote the range of responses and the correct responses where appropriate. A portion of the responses to the constructedresponse items were scored twice for the purpose of examining rater reliability. For each item, the number of papers with responses that were scored a second time is listed, along with the percent agreement between raters and an index of reliability based on those responses. Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1968) is the reliability estimate used for dichotomized items. For items that are not dichotomized (i.e., polytomous items), the intraclass correlation coefficient is used as the index of reliability. See Chapter 9 for more information about score reliability for constructed-response items.\n785\n876\n\n\fItem\nM019701 M019801 M019901 M020001 M020101 M020201 M020301 M020401 M020501 M020701 M039201 M039301 M040001 M040201 M040301 M040901 M043201 M043301 M043401 M043402 M043403 M046001 M046601 M046801 M046901 M047301 M061901 M061902 M061903 M061904 M061905 M061906 M074301 N277903\n\nTable I-1\nScore Range, Percent Agreement, and Cohen's Kappa' for the Dichotomously Scored Constructed-Response Mathematics Items\nUsed in Main Assessment Scaling, Grade 42\n\nBlock\nMF MF MF MF MF MF MF MF MF MF MC MC MC MC MI MI MM MM MM MM MM MK MK MK MK MK MJ MJ\nKJ\nMJ MJ MJ MO MF\n\nRange of Response\nCodes\n1-2 1-3 1-3 1-2 1-2 1-2 1-4 1-2 1-2 1-4 1-2 1-3 1-3 1-2 1-2 1-2 1-2 1-3 1-4 1-4 1-3 1-5 1-4 1-5 1-5 1-4 1-3 1-3 1-2 1-3 1-4 1-3 1-2 1-2\n\nCorrect Response\nCodes\n22-3 2-3 2224224233222234435455432-3 22-3 4322-\n\nSample Size\n1962 1956 1953 1952 1946 1947 1948 1926 1850 1672 1986 1977 65463 1660 1961 1955 1961 1967 1938 1914 1896 1973 1969 1967 1952 1876 1987 1971 1960 1945 1863 1758 1973 1800\n\nPercent Cohen's Agreement Kappa\n\n98\n\n0.967\n\n94\n\n0.877\n\n98\n\n0.963\n\n99\n\n0.989\n\n99\n\n0.980\n\n95\n\n0.917\n\n100\n\n0.993\n\n99\n\n0.985\n\n99\n\n0.980\n\n90\n\n0.758\n\n99\n\n0.985\n\n100\n\n0.997\n\n99\n\n0.980\n\n95\n\n0.800\n\n98\n\n0.970\n\n100\n\n1.000\n\n98\n\n0.961\n\n99\n\n0.980\n\n98\n\n0.964\n\n99\n\n0.978\n\n100\n\n0.978\n\n100\n\n0.991\n\n98\n\n0.970\n\n99\n\n0.986\n\n100\n\n0.999\n\n100\n\n0.992\n\n97\n\n0.941\n\n98\n\n0.966\n\n99\n\n0.974\n\n99\n\n0.962\n\n97\n\n0.937\n\n98\n\n0.845\n\n100\n\n0.992\n\n100\n\n0.986\n\nI Cohen's Kappa is a measure of reliability that is appropriate for items that are dichotomized.

PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION ERROR IN THE 1992 STATE MATHEMATICS RESULTS\nFrank Jenkins and Ed Ku lick Educational Testing Service\nIn April 1995, results from the 1994 Trial State Assessment in reading were released as part of the report 1994 NAEP Reading: A First Look (Williams, Reese, Campbell, Mazzeo, & Phillips, 1995). Subsequently, ETS/NAEP research scientists discovered an error in the documentation for the ETS version of the PARSCALE program, which is used to compute NAEP scale score results. The error affected how omitted responses were treated in the IRT scaling of the extended constructed-response items that received partial-credit scoring (i.e., could have several partially correct categories) in analyses of 1992 and 1994 assessment data. The error affected only polytomous items; omitted multiple-choice and omitted short constructed responses were treated appropriately.\nThe conventional treatment in NAEP subjects has been to treat omitted responses (blank responses to an item that are followed by valid responses to items that appear later in the test) as the lowest possible score category in the production of NAEP scale scores. In contrast, not-reached responses (blank responses that are not followed by any further student responses) are treated as missing data. As a result of the documentation error, for a number of the partial credit (or polytomous) constructed-response items and across several subject areas, all blank responses (both omitted and notreached responses) to affected items were treated as missinga reasonable model for treating omits but one that does not conform to the conventional practice in NAEP.\nThe error occurred because of a documentation error in the description of one of the PARSCALE control parameters, designated as POMIT. The program permits the analyst to choose two different ways of treating blank responses for partial credit items: (a) as missing data, and (b) as incorrect, i.e. a valid\nresponse falling in the lowest score category. The documentation indicates that by setting POMIT= 1,\nthe treatment in (a) occurs. By setting POMIT=0 or POMIT=1, the treatment in (b) is supposed to occur. The POMIT=1 setting is the program default. In reality, POMIT=1 and POMIT= 1 operate equivalently, treating blank responses as missing data.\nThe error appears to have been introduced in 1992 when the programs BILOG and PARSCALE were merged to form the ETS version of PARSCALE. Verification of the accuracy of existing documentation, modifications to internal program diagnostics, and more systematic testing procedures for any and all changes to NAEP-related programs were implemented immediately to reduce the likelihood of experiencing this kind of error in subsequent NAEP cycles.\nThe PARSCALE documentation error affected a number of the NAEP scales constructed since 1992. Specifically, the 1992 national and state mathematics results were affected by the error. Results from these two assessments have been released to the public in a number of NAEP publications. The data has also been available to the public through NCES's secondary-use data files.\n\n9 3\n\n813\n\n\fNCES and ETS felt that the most technically correct plan of action would be to recalculate all affected NAEP scales, no matter how slight the change, and to issue revised results. ETS was therefore instructed by NCES to recalculate all affected scales.\n\nIn recomputing the cutpoints for the achievement levels, an additional error (the information weighting error) was discovered in the procedures used by American College Testing (ACT) in 1992 to \"map\" the achievement-level cutpoints onto the NAEP scale. The procedures contained an incorrectly derived formula. Details can be found in Appendix I of the Technical Report of the NAEP 1994 Trial State Assessment in Reading (Mazzeo, Allen, & Kline, 1995). ACT used revised procedures with the correct formula to map the achievement-level cutpoints for the 1994 U.S. history and geography scales and the 1996 science scales. The error in the procedures affected achievement-level cutpoints for the 1990 mathematics national assessment at all grade levels (grades 4, 8, and 12) and the 1990 Trial State Assessment in mathematics, which was only at grade 8. This error also affected the 1992 mathematics results for the nation and the states. The information weighting error added a source of error to results in addition to the error associated problem with defining omits. Note that the proficiency estimates for 1990 mathematics are correct and did not have to be recalculated; only the cutpoints for the achievement levels were affected. For this reason, the achievement level almanac for 1990 state mathematics is not included in this appendix.\n\nThe information documenting the original analysis of the 1992 data that appears in the Technical Report of the NAEP 1992 Trial State Assessment Program in Mathematics (Johnson, Mazzeo, & Kline, 1993) is substantially in agreement with the revised 1994 analysis. The transformation constants for the revised analysis are provided in Table K-1. The information in the other sections of the technical report for the 1996 state mathematics assessment refer only to the revised analysis of the 1994 Trial State Assessment data.\n\nTable K-1 Transformation Constants for the 1992 Trial State Assessment in Mathematics\n\nGrade 4\n\nScale\n\nk2\n\nNumbers and Operations\n\n214.59 34.16\n\nMeasurement\n\n221.40 33.28\n\nGeometry\n\n220.55 28.59\n\nData Analysis, Statistics, and Probability 217.80 32.66\n\nAlgebra and Functions\n\n217.91 29.00\n\nEstimation\n\n205.41 35.52\n\nGrade 8\n\nk1\n268.76\n\nk2\n34.60\n\n262.82 43.95\n\n260.44 33.81\n\n264.58 39.93\n\n264.23 36.13\n\n267.14 28.14\n\nAs shown by Tables K-3 through K-5, all jurisdictions had average scores that were adjusted upward slightly as a result of the revision of results. For grade 4, Tables K-3 and K-4 indicate that average scores increased from .9 to 1.5 points on the proficiency scale. Accordingly, average scores in all the percentiles go up in a similar fashion. Since all jurisdictions were affected in a similar manner, there is little change in the ranking of the jurisdictions. With regard to achievement level results, Tables K-7 and K-8 indicate that although the average scale scores moved up when revised, the percent of students\n814\n9 u 4\n\n\fat or above the advanced, proficient and basic achievement levels went down slightly as a result of the two revisions. For the advanced level, percentages for the jurisdictions went down 0 to .8 percent, while for the below basic level, percentages went up .6 to 1.7 percent. Since the scale scores uniformly moved up, the shift in achievement level percentages must be due to the shift upward of the achievement level cutpoints as result of the information weighting error (see Table K-2). Similar results are evident for\ngrade 8.\nTables K-5 and K-6 indicate that average scores for jurisdictions went up from .6 to 1 point as a result of the revision of scale scores, with similar slight upward adjustments occurring at every listed percentile. This change is somewhat less than what was demonstrated for grade 4 and again the ranking of the jurisdictions did not show much change. Tables K-9 and K-10 list the original and revised eighthgrade results for the achievement-level percentages. These tables also list values for 1990, since the Trial State Assessment was administered only at grade 8 and not grade 4 that year. The effects of the revision of the 1992 results are similar to those for grade 4. Although revised means were greater for every jurisdiction, the percentage above the three achievement levels were slightly smaller while percentages below the basic achievement level were slightly larger. As with grade 4, this reflects the upward shift of the achievement-level cutpoints as a result of the information weighting error (see Table K-2).\n\nFor grade 8, there is the question of the effect of the revisions on the 1990 to 1992 trend. All of the 17 jurisdictions that had significant trends in average scale scores in the original analysis also had significant trends in the revised analysis. In addition, seven jurisdictions that did not have significant trends in the original analysis had significant trends in revision. A number of changes in the percent of students at or above the achievement levels occurred due to the combination of the revision of scale scores and achievement level cutpoints for the 1992 data. As a result, more differences across the two years were significant. For 15 jurisdictions, there was an increase in the percent of students at or above an achievement level from 1990 to 1992 that did not change when the analysis was redone. There were nine jurisdictions where there was a significant trend upward in the percent of students at or above an achievement level only after revision. For only one jurisdiction was a trend no longer significant after\nrevision (the percent at or above advanced for Michigan).\n\nTable K-2 Original and Revised ACT Achievement Level Cut Scores for\n1992 Mathematics\n\nGrade 4\nGrade 8\n\nOriginal Revised Original Revised\n\nBasic\n211 214 256 262\n\nProficient Advanced\n\n248\n\n280\n\n249\n\n282\n\n294\n\n331\n\n299\n\n333\n\nIn summary, while changes in average scale score, in percent of students at or above an achievement level, and in 1990 to 1992 trends in these statistics did occur, the meaning of the results\nwere constant for most jurisdictions. An exception was that seven jurisdictions had significant differences in mean scale score from 1990 to 1992 that did not appear in the 1992 state reports. Also, 10 jurisdictions had changes in the percent of students at or above at least one achievement level.\n\n9 5\n\n815\n\n\fAlabama Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut\nDelaware District
