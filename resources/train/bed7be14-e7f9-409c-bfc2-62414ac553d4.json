This industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the nation's agricultural economy, often experiencing growth and expansion even during recessionary periods.\nThe relationship between urban/community forestry and the Green Industry has become more widely recognized as urban forestry has become more acknowledged as an integral segment of the infrastructure of our communities. However, this relationship is still vastly unappreciated in terms of the degree of synergy that the two segments share. Not only is the Green Industry crucial for the support of urban forestry in providing quality plant material used in our cities, it also offers professional personnel with specialized expertise for growing, maintaining, and managing city trees. Both entities enjoy the benefi ts of this symbiotic relationship, and each would be diminished without the other. The importance of developing a mechanism by which this relationship can be measured, therefore, is crucial to understanding how to best plan for the future strengthening of each.\nIn spite of the magnitude and recent growth and interest in the Green Industry, there is surprisingly little information that has been developed on the national level regarding the economic impact of the Green Industry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts fl oriculture and nursery crop surveys to collect information at the grower level, but data are often incomplete for some states, do not include small growers, and cash receipts reported do not refl ect the further economic impacts generated from this production activity. The census of agriculture data, including the 10-year census of horticultural specialties, are subject to the same limitations and have historically had other mitigating problems, such as low response rate, that refl ect poorly on the data's accuracy. For fi rms downstream in the supply chain, such as landscapers, re-wholesalers, and retailers, there are economic statistics and employment data maintained by each state's offi ce of the comptroller. However, misclassifi cation errors and noncompliance on the part of industry participants have made some state data speculative at best. To date, no one source of data has proven historically to be instrumental in capturing the total economic importance of the Green Industry.\nRecognizing the limitations of existing data sources and also the critical need for this type of economic impact data, several state nursery and landscape associations have sponsored and developed their own economic impact studies for their respective Green Industries. Such states have found these studies to be useful in communicating the importance of the Green Industry to decision makers, and in combating"}, {"section_title": "Production", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "& Marketing Reports", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PRODUCTION & MARKETING REPORTS", "text": "proposed legislation that would have had severe negative impacts on urban or community forestry initiatives and the Green Industry (e.g., labor regulations, constraints on water usage, etc.). As useful as these state-specifi c studies have been, there have not been similar analyses conducted at the national level, which would provide similar benefi ts on a national scale. Additionally, these studies have used differing methodologies and included, in many cases, differing industry sectors. This has inhibited the direct comparison of these state studies across state lines. The objective of this study was to estimate the economic impacts of the Green Industry at the national level, reviewing the studies that have already been conducted by several states, and complementing those with data from other primary and secondary sources. In addition, this study evaluated the value and role of forest tree species (woody ornamental trees) as a Green Industry product.\nfor the wholesale trade sectors, impacts were estimated as:\nand for the retail trade sectors, impacts were estimated as:\nwhere I hij is total impact for measures (j) of output, employment, value added, labor income, or indirect business taxes, in each sector (i), and state (h); S hi is industry sales in sector i and state h; E hi is the proportion of industry sales exported or shipped outside the state, by sector i in state h; A hij is the direct effects multiplier for measure j in sector i and state h. B hij is the indirect effects multiplier for measure j in sector i and state h; C hij is the induced effects multiplier for measure j in sector i and state h; and G i is the gross margin on retail sales for sector i. The calculation for the producer, wholesale, and service sectors assumes that only the export portion of output is sold to fi nal demand, while the remainder of in-state sales represents intermediate demand from other business sectors. Therefore, export sales for the production and service sectors are subject to the indirect and induced effects multipliers in a fully closed I-O/ SAM model. Local sales do not represent fi nal demand for the production and service sectors, so they are subject only to the direct effects multipliers; however, local sales do represent fi nal demand for the retail sector. Data on exports were taken from the IMPLAN database for 2001 or 1999, except in the case of the nursery and greenhouse sector, where information for some states was taken from the 2003 S290 national nursery survey. For the wholesale and retail trade sectors, output was taken as the gross margin on sales according to national averages: 20.1% for fl ower and nursery stock wholesalers, 24.7% for general merchandise stores, 26.5% for lawn and garden equipment wholesalers, 28.5% for food and beverage stores, 29.5% for lawn and garden stores, 29.5% for building materials and supply stores, and 42.3% for fl orists (miscellaneous retailers) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004l-m) .\nAll results were stated in 2004 dollars by adjusting values using the gross domestic product (GDP) implicit price defl ator (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2005) ."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INDUSTRY SECTOR CLASSIFICATION.", "text": "The economic sectors associated with the Green Industry were identifi ed based on their primary product or service activity as described in the North American Industry Classifi cation System (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005a) as indicated in Table 1 . Production and manufacturing includes the sectors for nursery and greenhouse growers, lawn and garden equipment manufacturers, and greenhouse manufacturers (prefabricated metal buildings). The horticultural services sector includes lawn and landscape service fi rms and landscape architects. Wholesale and retail trade of horticultural goods includes sectors for fl ower, nursery stock, and fl orist supply wholesalers, lawn and garden stores, and fl orists. In addition, building material and supply dealers, food and beverage stores, general merchandise stores, and farm and garden equipment wholesalers all have signifi cant sales of horticultural merchandise as part of their overall business.\nINFORMATION SOURCES. Economic information on the Green Industry in the U.S. was compiled from a variety of sources. For the nursery and greenhouse sector, national and state information on number of farms and value of sales was taken from the census of agriculture for 2002 (USDA, 2004a) . For the various service and trade sectors, information on number of establishments, employment, and sales (receipts) were taken from the 2002 economic census industry report series (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004a Bureau, -j, 2005b , while state-level information on number of fi rms, employment, and payroll in 2002 were taken from county business patterns (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004k) . For the sectors whose primary business is not in horticulture (such as general merchandise stores), employment and payroll were estimated in proportion to horticulture merchandise or product line sales as a share of total sales, which ranged from 1% for food and beverage stores to 27% for garden equipment wholesalers. Also, state-level information on number of fi rms, employment and payroll were adjusted to match the U.S. totals. The census of agriculture and economic census were considered to be the most reliable information sources available, since they have well-established statistical methodologies, with adjustment for small or non-responding fi rms, and provide published confi dence parameters. For some states in which employment and wages were not disclosed because of a small number of fi rms reporting, employment was estimated at the midpoint of the range indicated, and payroll was estimated at the national average annual wages per employee.\nAccording to census data, the number of establishments, employment, payroll, and sales receipts for sectors of the Green Industry in the U.S. in 2002 are shown in Table 2 . There were a total of 255,389 business establishments involved in the industry, including 56,233 nursery producers or manufacturers, 82,683 horticultural services firms, and 116,473 wholesale/retail trade fi rms. Total reported employment was 1.085 million employees, and total payroll was $46 billion, excluding the nursery and greenhouse sector. Total sales receipts in 2002 were $147.1 billion, including $23 billion for producers, $38.8 billion The North American Industrial Classifi cation System (NAICS) replaced the Standard Industrial Classifi cation (SIC) coding system and uses a 6-digit hierarchical coding system to classify all economic activity into 20 industry sectors. Five sectors are mainly goods-producing sectors and 15 are entirely services-producing sectors. This 6-digit hierarchical structure allows greater coding fl exibility than the 4-digit structure of the SIC. NAICS allows for the identifi cation of 1170 industries compared to the 1004 found in the SIC system. y IMPLAN classifi es business according to 509 industrial sectors that are typically 5-digit NAICS in manufacturing and 2-4 digit NAICS for other sectors.\nx Businesses are classifi ed according to primary business activity. Thus, merchandise or product line sales of horticultural goods represents a portion of overall business of the sectors indicated.\nfor horticultural services, and $85.3 billion for wholesale/retail trade. Primary market research data regarding the structure and performance of the nursery industry were generated by the fourth national nursery industry survey conducted by the S290 multistate regional research committee, a group of agricultural economists and horticulturists from 24 land-grant institutions across the country (including the authors of this paper). A total of 44 states participated in this survey. It is through the S290 survey efforts conducted in early 2004 that detailed data regarding sales of urban forest tree species were collected. For the fi rst time in the survey's history, a standard methodology of obtaining a sample frame was used. The population lists for each state were assembled from the respective department of agriculture offi ces responsible for licensing nursery producers. A master fi le of all certifi ed/licensed nursery operations was compiled at the University of Florida. Two states that had recently completed nursery surveys were excluded (Alabama and Arizona) in addition to four other states that had extremely small nursery numbers (Arkansas, Kansas, Maryland, and Wisconsin). The remaining 44 states resulted in a combined listing of 38,269 certifi ed/ licensed nursery operations. Based on considerations of budget and statistical reliability, a sample of 15,888 fi rms was selected for the survey, with sampling in each state based on its proportion of the overall nursery population. Where information was available on nursery production area, inventory, or sales volume, sampling was stratifi ed for three size classes: small [less than 5 acres (1 acre = 0.4047 ha)], medium (5 to 19 acres), and large (20 or more acres). Sampling was weighted on larger fi rms, with 100% of the large nurseries, 60% of the medium nurseries, and 25% of the small nurseries. In several states, the nursery acreage values were not available, or not available for all certifi ed or licensed operations, and in these states 40% of the identifi ed fi rms were sampled. The fi nal sample included 3476 large nurseries, 3778 in the medium category, 5996 of the small fi rms, and 2338 of unknown size. There were a total of 2485 usable returned questionnaires returned, representing an overall response rate of 15.9%. The number of respondents from individual states ranged from as few as 10 in Nevada to 476 in Florida.\nECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS. To evaluate the broad regional economic impacts of the Green Industry in the U.S., regional economic models were developed for each state using the IM-PLAN software system and associated state datasets (Minnesota IMPLAN Group, 2004) . The IMPLAN system includes over 500 distinct industry sectors. The sectors pertinent to the Green Industry are indicated in Table  3 . The structure of the Green Industry is diagrammed in Fig. 1 , indicating the linkages giving rise to indirect and induced impacts. The information for these models was derived from the U.S. national income and product accounts, together with regional economic data collected by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. Input-output models represent the structure of a regional economy in terms of transactions between industries, employees, households, and government institutions (Miller and Blair, 1985) . The IMPLAN data used for this analysis was based on fi scal year 2001.\nAccording to the logic of inputoutput analysis, changes in local fi nal demand or exports cause a change in direct output or employment, which leads to a corresponding change in the activity of input supply fi rms (indirect effects), and to changes in employee The North American Industrial Classifi cation System (NAICS) replaced the Standard Industrial Classifi cation (SIC) coding system and uses a 6-digit hierarchical coding system to classify all economic activity into 20 industry sectors. Five sectors are mainly goods-producing sectors and 15 are entirely services-producing sectors. This 6-digit hierarchical structure allows greater coding fl exibility than the 4-digit structure of the SIC. NAICS allows for the identifi cation of 1170 industries compared to the 1004 found in the SIC system. Payroll and employment estimated in proportion to merchandise line sales as share of total sales: 6% for building material and supply dealers, 1% for food and beverage stores, 2% for general merchandise stores, 2% for prefabricated metal buildings, 27% for farm and garden equipment wholesalers.

The total economic impact is the sum of direct, indirect, and induced effects. Economic multipliers derived from the models were used to estimate these effects for the Green Industry in each state. Multipliers represent the multiple of economic activity generated by a unit change in direct output or employment. The regional IMPLAN models were constructed as fully closed models, with all household, government, and capital accounts treated as endogenous, to derive social accounting matrix (SAM)-type multipliers, which represent transfer payments as well as earned income. Separate multipliers are provided for output (sales), employment, value added, labor income, and business taxes. The multipliers for output, value added, labor income, and indirect business taxes are expressed in units of dollars per dollar output, while the employment multiplier is expressed in jobs per million dollars output. The total output multipliers generally ranged from 1.5 to 2.8. Differences in values of the multipliers refl ect the structural linkages of industry sectors, the regional mix of supplier industries, and the size of the regional economy. The multipliers were applied to estimated industry sales or output in order to estimate total economic impacts. For the producer and service sectors, total economic impacts were estimated as:"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "NATIONAL RESULTS.", "text": "Economic impact estimates for each group and sector of the U.S. Green Industry are summarized in Table 3 . Estimated impacts for all states were $147.8 billion in output, 1,964,339 jobs, $95.1 billion in value added, $64.3 billion in labor income, and $6.9 billion in indirect business taxes. Again, note that values for 2002 were stated in 2004 dollars, which were approximately 4.07% higher. The value added impact represents the net change in value of commodities and services after deducting the cost of inputs purchased from other businesses, and is a broad measure of income generated by the industry. The employment impact estimate includes all jobs, both full-time and part-time, with no adjustment for a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis. The labor or \"earned\" income impact includes employee wages and salaries and proprietor's income to business owners.\nFor the production and manufacturing sectors, including nurseries and greenhouses, lawn and garden equipment manufacturers, and greenhouse manufacturers, total output impacts were $34.6 billion, employment impacts were 300,677 jobs, and value added impacts were $20.8 billion. For the horticultural services sectors, including landscape services and landscape architects, total output impacts were $57.8 billion, employment impacts were 753,557 jobs, and value added impacts were $39.0 billion. For the wholesale/retail trade sectors, total output impacts were $55.5 billion, employment impacts were 910,104 jobs, and value added impacts were $35.3 billion.\nThe largest individual sectors in terms of output impact were landscaping services ($53.0 billion), nurseries and greenhouses ($26.1 billion), retail lawn and garden stores ($22.9 billion), building material supply stores ($10.0 billion), lawn and garden equipment manufacturers ($8.3 billion), and fl orists ($7.2 billion). In terms of employment impacts, the largest individual sectors were landscaping services (704,875 jobs), lawn and garden stores (347,916 jobs), nurseries and greenhouses (261,408 jobs), fl orists (200,451 jobs), and building material supply stores (123,591 jobs).\nValue added impacts by sectors were as follows: landscaping services ($35.6 billion); nurseries and greenhouses ($18.1 billion); lawn and garden stores ($14.8 billion); building material and supply stores ($6.5 billion); general merchandise stores ($4.0 billion); fl orists ($4.0 billion); landscape architects ($3.4 billion); lawn and garden equipment manufacturers ($2.6 billion); lawn and garden equipment wholesalers ($2.7 billion); wholesale fl ower, nursery stock, and fl orist supplies ($1.9 billion); and food and beverage stores ($1.4 billion). STATE AND REGIONAL RESULTS. Total output, employment, and value added impacts are summarized by state and region in Table 4 . The largest individual states in terms of output impacts, all exceeding $4 billion, were California ($20.4 billion), Florida ($9.9 billion), Texas ($9.7 billion), Illinois ($6.9 billion), Ohio ($5.9 billion), Pennsylvania ($5.6 billion), New York ($5.3 billion), North Carolina ($5.2 billion), Michigan ($4.8 billion), and Georgia ($4.2 billion). The largest individual states in terms of employment, all exceeding 60,000 employees, were California (253,977), Florida (147,795), Texas (140,295), Ohio (79,841), Pennsylvania (75,829), Illinois (75,110), North Carolina (67,472), Georgia (62,493), and New York (62,113). Total value added impacts were largest in the midwestern U.S. region ($19.2 billion), followed by the pacifi c U.S. region ($18.4 billion), the northeastern U.S. ($17.9 billion), and the southeastern U.S. ($13.5 billion). The largest individual states in terms of value added impacts, all exceeding $3 billion, were California ($13.7 billion), Florida ($7.1 billion), Texas ($6.1 billion), Illinois ($4.3 billion), Pennsylvania ($3.7 billion), New York ($3.5 billion), and Ohio ($3.5 billion). The Green Industry share of gross state product (GSP) is an important indicator of the relative importance of the industry in each state. In concept, GSP represents total value added of all industry sectors, and is equivalent to its gross output (sales or receipts and other operating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change) minus intermediate inputs purchased from other U.S. industries or imported. Thus, GSP is often considered the state counterpart of the nation's GDP-the broadest measure of the U.S. economy. In the U.S., the total value added of the Green Industry ($95.1 billion) represented slightly less than 1% of the GSP sum of all states ($10,830 billion). The top fi ve states with the highest percentage contribution of the Green Industry to GSP were Oregon (1.7%), Idaho (1.4%), South Carolina (1.4%), Florida (1.3%), and Wisconsin (1.2%).\nECONOMIC IMPACTS OF TREE SALES AND TREE CARE SERVICES. Economic impacts of the portion of urban forestry related to commercial tree production and tree care services are summarized in Table 5 . The estimates are based on tree production by the nursery and greenhouse sector, and tree care by the landscaping services sector. The total value of tree production suitable for urban forestry, including deciduous, evergreen, fruit, and Christmas trees, was $4.63 billion. This value represented 27.2% of total output by the nursery and greenhouse sector for the U.S. as a whole, but for individual states ranged from as high as 82% (Mississippi) to less than 1% (Hawaii). The value of tree care services was $9.92 billion, which represented 27.1% of the output of the landscaping services sector. The total output of tree production and care services was valued at $14.55 billion. This translated into $21.02 billion in total output impacts, 259,224 jobs, $14.12 billion in value added, $9.93 billion in labor income, and $516 million in indirect business tax impacts.\nIn the leading states of California and Florida, tree production represented 19% and 18%, respectively, of total nursery and greenhouse output. For California, output impacts of urban forestry were in excess of $3 billion, employment impacts were 37,769 jobs, and value added impacts were $2.11 billion; while in Florida, output impacts were $1.55 billion, employment impacts were 21,946 jobs, and value added impacts were $1.12 billion. Other states with large value added impacts for urban forestry included Texas ($757 million), Ohio ($633 million), Pennsylvania ($621 million), North Carolina ($602 million), Illinois ($568 million), Oregon ($537 million), New Jersey ($470 million), and Maryland ($445 million).\nCONCLUSIONS. Nationwide, the Green Industry generates a total of $147.8 billion in output or sales, 1.9 million jobs, and $95.1 billion in valueadded impacts, including $64.3 billion in labor income and $6.9 billion in indirect business taxes. Results of the study will be benefi cial in educating legislators, regulators, and the public at large as to the economic importance of the environmental horticulture industry and urban forestry. This research is the fi rst to evaluate the economic impacts of the Green Industry for the entire U.S., and it shows how the industry contributes to personal income and job growth in local and regional economies. Also, this work serves to establish a standard methodology for future economic studies of the Green Industry, in terms of the sectors to be considered, information sources, and input-output analysis procedures.
