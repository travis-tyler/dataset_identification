The ESRC and Leverhulme Trust provided research funding.\nHigh rates of divorce in western society have prompted much research on the repercussions for well-being and the economy. Yet little is known about the important topic of whether parental divorce has deleterious consequences upon adult children. By combining experimental and econometric survey-based evidence, this study attempts to provide an answer. Under controlled conditions, it measures university students' subjective well-being and productivity (in a standardized laboratory task). It finds no evidence that either of these is negatively associated with recent parental divorce. If anything, happiness and productivity appear to be slightly greater, particularly among males, if their parents have divorced. Using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey --to control for so-called fixed effects --we then cross-check this result, and confirm the same finding, on various random samples of young British adults.\n2"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "One of the noticeable social-science phenomena of the last 50 years has been the rise in the rate of divorce and marital dissolution. In the United States, about 50% of children now experience parental divorce (National Center for Health Statistics, 2008) . In the UK, over the period 1997-2007, parental From the economist's perspective, it is natural to be interested in whether:\n(i) parental divorce has a negative impact on children's ability to perform well in education,\n(ii) there are potential effects upon children's eventual productivity in the workplace, (iii) there are implications for those children's long-run earnings.\nAt the macroeconomic level, more speculatively, these translates into a desire to understand what high divorce rates might mean for economic growth through the potential effects upon the children of divorced parents.\nThere is a modern literature on the effects of divorce upon those adults who choose to dissolve their relationships (such as Pevalin and Ermisch 2004) and upon young dependent children (such as Amato 2001) . However, what remains to be understood are the effects on older, adult children -such as children of university age. The present paper is a study of divorce and its consequences for grown children. It builds on, and is complementary to, an emerging branch of modern work such as Collishaw et al (2007) that seems to be finding smaller negative effects than used to be believed within an earlier era, and on research such as Gardner and Oswald (2005) and Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) who examine the potential positive effects of divorce, albeit not directly linked to the children of divorcees.\nThe nature of the paper's analysis appears to be the first of its kind. The paper uses, in part, an experimental setup to try to understand the influence of parental divorce upon university students, and in part a survey-based econometric approach.\nWe provide evidence against the idea that an increase in single or stepparent families can account for trends in young individuals' problems. We construct a laboratory experiment in which we can directly observe performance in a paid task and relate this to each subject's recent experience (or not) of parental divorce. While our methodology differs from that of previous scholars, our results are in alignment with some recent econometric and psychological studies (discussed below) in indicating a less worrying impact, than might traditionally have been expected, of parental divorce upon children's outcomes.\nUsing a methodology developed in Oswald, Proto and Sgroi (2010) , we design and conduct a laboratory experiment in a UK university, where subjects --all of whom were students --were asked to reveal their level of happiness 2 at the very beginning of the experiment, and then to carry out a task designed to measure their productivity and their ability to concentrate. At the end, the subjects reveal if and when their parents are divorced."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The group chosen seem of particular interest given their age (almost all are 18-23) and thus proximity to full-time work, and because for many in the sample the experience of parental divorce is fairly recent (1-5 years).\nAs a complement to the laboratory test, a second form of econometric evidence is described.\nThis follows a group of young people longitudinally using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We examine the reported happiness levels of a sample of individuals of approximately the same age as the sample participating in our laboratory experiment (although the BHPS has no productivity data, unlike our experiment). The use of a panel allows us to control for individuals' and households' characteristics, which is not fully possible in the laboratory setting. We buttress this with an analysis of the answers to a life satisfaction question in the BHPS which has the advantage of being a finer (7-point) measure than the happiness measure (which is only a 4-point measure) but may reflect a longer-term view of wellbeing.\nContrary to our own expectations and to the fears of some parents and commentators, both forms of analysis --laboratory and survey (relating to both reported happiness and life satisfaction) --suggest that divorce has no detectable negative consequences. The data are consistent with, if anything, a slight positive effect of parental divorce on children's reported happiness. Nor does the laboratory experiment uncover negative effects on productivity. In fact, there is evidence consistent with a small positive impact on the productivity of males.\nIn the applied psychology literature, there exists some controversy --and also uncertainty --about the impact of divorce on children. An early literature was unambiguous in finding a correlation between lower academic achievement (and a reduced ability to internalize problems) and divorce -described in a literature such as Amato (2001) . However, the most recent contributions suggest a more complex picture, with an effect that is likely to be negative, but moderately small, and one generally less important for children of older age.\nMoreover, the need to control for socio-economic status suggests that the lack of controls may be overstating the negative tone of the conclusions prevalent in the psychology literature (see Lansford 2009 for a survey)."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "In recent years, some economists have added to the broader social-science literature --sometimes finding that divorce does not have the scale of impact indicated within much of the psychology literature. Gruber (2004) employs cross-country data to assess the impact of the change of US divorce regulation on children's long-term achievement, and Gonz\u00e1lez and Viitanen (2008) test the difference in regulation for EU countries. Both find some negative impact of divorce on young people. Sanz-de-Galdeano and Vuri (2007) draw upon data from the National Education Longitudinal Study. The authors control for the potential endogeneity of parental divorce by employing double and triple difference models that rely on observing teenagers from intact and divorced backgrounds before and after the occurrence of parental divorce. The authors conclude that parental divorce does not negatively affect teenagers'\n4 In this respect, as Stevenson and Wolfers (2007) notice: \"while children from divorced households fare worse along a range of outcomes than those from intact households, this observation does not speak to the policyrelevant question of whether those children would have been better off if their parents had not divorced. The conflict in these households may be so severe that children are actually better served by their parents divorcing.\nThus comparisons of the \"happily married\" with the \"unhappily divorced\" are likely irrelevant for those choosing between an unhappy marriage and an unhappy divorce\". cognitive skills. They also suggest that cross-sectional estimates overstate the detrimental effect of parental divorce. This conclusion is in line with our later analysis of the BHPS where controlling for family background actually leads the estimated effect of parental divorce on happiness to become moderately positive. Our later results are also broadly consistent with Liu (2007) and Piketty (2003) , who use individual data to test the relationship between divorce and children's education attainments; both conclude that it is not the divorce per se that generates lower attainments but rather the environment before the divorce. Similar conclusions are reached by Hoekstra (2009) .\nIn the next two sections, we describe the laboratory experiment and present its results; a later section describes the BHPS-based analysis; tables and questionnaires related to the laboratory experiment are provided in the supplementary online material."}, {"section_title": "Experimental Methodology", "text": "We designed and conducted a laboratory experiment in which subjects --all of whom were students at the University of Warwick --were asked to carry out a task designed to measure their productivity and their ability to concentrate. Afterwards, the subjects revealed if and when their parents were divorced.\nThe full set of experimental instructions is provided in the supplementary online material. To summarize the design of the experiment: we first asked subjects to enter their reported happiness using a seven-point scale into a spreadsheet (a copy of the precise question is found in the supplementary online material). It seems particularly important here to avoid 'priming', namely, to avoid reminding students of recent and significant positive or negative life shocks just prior to asking for reported happiness."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "The subjects were then asked to carry out two paid piece-rate tasks. They had 10 minutes to add as many sets of numbers together as they could. Each set of numbers consisted of 5 twodigit numbers; for example, one such problem might have been: 51 14 74 33 85\nThey were paid 25p (about one third of a US dollar) for each correct addition. Hence they had a monetary incentive to correctly do as many as they could within the 10 minutes. This task also allowed us potentially to distinguish between the raw number of attempts and the percentage that are calculated correctly (which will both matter in terms of payment). The second task was a short GMAT-style test designed to help control for intelligence, a copy of which is provided in the supplementary online material. Finally, subjects completed a long questionnaire, which included questions about parental divorce in the last 5 years, and gathered information on other useful variables (designed to generate socio-economic data, and further background data about each subject). A copy of the questionnaire is provided in the supplementary online material.\nWe carried out the experiment over 3 days, with 12 sessions and 269 subjects. No subject was allowed to participate more than once and no subject was allowed to have taken part in a similar experiment before. Data --among those with divorced parents --on the share of parental divorces in each year (from 0 to 5 years earlier) are presented in Table 1 . We aggregated these into the following dummies:"}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "\u2022 Divorce less than 3y ago if the divorce took place less than 3 years ago\n\u2022 Divorce less than 5y ago if the divorce took place in the last 5 years\n\u2022 Years since divorce, set to the year of the divorce if Divorce less than 5y ago = 1, and 6 otherwise. Note that there is overlap between Divorce less than 3y ago and Divorce less than 5y ago.\n\u2022 Happiness is the level of happiness reported by the subjects at the very beginning of the experiment (it lies on a 7-point scale). They declared this number prior to undertaking the piece-rate tasks or seeing the questionnaire.\n\u2022 High School Grades is the ratio of top grades to the total of school-level subjects studied, so is a control for overall ability.\n\u2022 Gmat is the result from a short GMAT-style test performed as the second task, and is a further control for innate ability.\n\u2022 Additions is the number of correct additions performed in 10 minutes during the piece-rate task.\nFinally, the variables Age and Year study are an individual's age and university year. Table 2 gives the first regression-equation results. 'Happiness' is the dependent variable and is measured on a 7-point scale; for the sake of simplicity, and to make our analysis more consistent with the second part of this paper, we estimate the model using a simple OLS estimator. However, a similar (unreported) exercise using an Ordered Probit estimator yielded very similar results; those findings are available from the authors upon request.\nAs is immediately visible in Table 2 , the association between parental divorce and subjects' happiness is not negative. The same finding was to emerge in a range of settings.\nFor example, if we consider in Table 2 the variable for parental divorce in the last 3 years, this variable enters with a coefficient that is positive and significantly different from zero at the 5% level in columns 1 and 2. The dummy for divorce in the last 5 years, in columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 , is positive but not statistically significant. And Years since divorce, in column 5 of Table 2 , is negative and non-significant. The value of the coefficient of Divorce less than 5y ago (where 5y stands for five years) in regression 1 is approximately half the value of the coefficient in Divorce less than 3y ago in regression 2. This is consistent with the (perhaps somewhat natural) hypothesis that any effects from parental divorce tend to fade away over time as the child ages. The further back the divorce, the smaller the measured consequences. Table 3 gives separate results for males (columns 1-3) and females (columns 4 and 5). For male subjects, there appears to be a fairly large and positive effect from parental divorce; the coefficient on Divorce less than 5y ago (in column 2 of Table 3 ) is about half in magnitude of the coefficient on Divorce less than 3y ago (in column 1). The estimated positive and declining effect of parental divorce with respect of the year of the divorce is consistent with the regression presented in column 3. Again, the Years since divorce coefficient, although not statistically significantly different from zero, has a negative sign. These results provide again some support for the idea of perhaps even a positive effect of parental divorce on self-reported happiness and one that diminishes over time. In the last two columns of In Figure 1 , we provide a graphical analysis of the effect of parental divorce on life satisfaction for male subjects (for whom we saw, in Table 2 , that parental divorce seems to have a positive effect in terms of happiness). From a comparison between the two Cumulative Distribution Functions, we note that the one for the sub-sample of subjects with divorced parent clearly dominates the CDF of the others. A key difference is that none of subjects with divorced parents reported a level of happiness below 5. Tables 2 and 3 include a variable for High School Grades. This is done partly to control for the possibility of an omitted variable linked to the personal qualities of divorced parents, which might also be reflected in their children.\nNevertheless, and necessarily, given the nature of these data, students from the divorced and non-divorced families might differ in subtle unobservable ways. In order to cope more formally with this potential problem --namely, the potential heterogeneity of individuals and family background --we show later in the paper that the positive statistical effect of parental divorce on happiness holds even when we base our analysis on data from the British Household Panel Survey. Panel data then allow us to introduce a control for individuals' characteristics, courtesy of the use of individual fixed effects. Table 4 examines the determinants of productivity in the laboratory. It sets out regression equations in which the number of correct additions under timed pressure in the laboratory,\nAdditions, is the dependent variable. The spirit of the results is similar to those in Tables 2 and   3 . Divorce seems to have no discernible deleterious effect on subjects and their ability to perform. Interestingly, the sign seems, if anything, positive, and --once again --the coefficient is slightly larger when the regressor is Divorce less than 3y ago (column 1) than when the regressor is Divorce less than 6y ago (column 2).\nFrom columns 3 and 4 of Table 4 , for the subsample of males, the key coefficient is not negative, even if, in this case, the coefficient of Divorce less than 5y ago now becomes larger than the coefficient of Divorce less than 3y ago. None of the coefficients are statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level. As in the happiness regression presented in Table 3 , the sign of the number of years elapsed since the divorce --the variable Years since divorce defined as above --is negative but not statistically significant. From columns 6 and 7 of Table 4 , female subjects' productivity is apparently untouched by parental divorce; this, once more, is broadly in line with the spirit of the happiness regressions of Table   3 .\nEvidence of a beneficial effect (though only at the 90% confidence level) on productivity associated with parental divorce for the male subjects can be observed in Figure 2 , where we perform an analysis analogous to Figure 1 . Here we plot the cumulative distributions of the correct additions for men who experienced a parental divorce in the last 5 years and those who did not. The cumulative distribution of correct additions for the Male subject with divorced parents (CDFPdiv) nearly first-order dominates the one with subjects whose parents have not recently divorced (CDVnonPdiv). Importantly, there is no almost difference between low and high performers: the medium performers with divorced parents are the ones doing better than the rest.\nWe conclude this section with one further observation. As can be seen from the paper's tables, the finding of no damaging effect from parental divorce is not simply because of Type II errors or any repeated failure to reject the null of zero on a negative coefficient. The estimated coefficients are typically positive rather than negative. It is not merely that there are large standard errors around negative coefficients."}, {"section_title": "A Cross-Check: Testing for the Effects of Parental Divorce on Happiness using the British Household Panel Survey", "text": "The paper's laboratory setting has the advantage of measuring student productivity in a controlled environment. But this procedure has two possible drawbacks: (i) that of us not being able to control fully for possible household effects. Divorce is not randomly assigned in the world. Hence the necessary maintained assumption in our experiment --as in Corak 2001 and much of the literature --is that what happens to the parent does not become innately Cumulative Distribution Functions of Males Subjects Performances passed on, through genes or some other mechanism, to the child's happiness and productivity;\n(ii) Warwick students are not representative of the whole of UK society so the analysis may suffer from a sample selection bias. For these reasons, we decided to complement the laboratory experiment presented above with an econometric study based on the British\nHousehold Panel Survey (BHPS henceforth), which is representative of Great Britain and allows us to control more fully for individuals' heterogeneity.\nWe introduce a control for individuals (and then households) through fixed effects estimation.\nBHPS data allow us to identify those young individuals who experience a parental divorce.\nWe construct a sample of individuals with an age equal to or below 30 who appear in the BHPS data with at least one parent. We then estimate the effect on those young people of a parental divorce in that year and in the years immediately prior --controlling for other factors such as income, age, employment, student status and disability.\nThe data come from the first 17 waves of the BHPS. This is a nationally representative sample of more than 5000 British households, containing over 10000 adult individuals, conducted Our first step is to ensure that young individuals who experienced a parental divorce present in the BHPS dataset have a similar reaction in terms of happiness than the ones in our laboratory experiment. Therefore, using the BHPS data, we perform a similar econometric exercise to the one performed in Table 2 with our laboratory sample. We consider the last wave in our dataset (wave 17, year 2007) that, as we observe from Table 7 , records the highest number of divorces. 9 In order to aid the comparability with the results from the laboratory analysis, we multiply the GHQ-happiness index by 7/4, so as to ensure that the highest value is 7 as in the happiness banding in the laboratory experiment. The main difference compared to Table 2 concerns the control variables. In the BHPS there is no record of students' performances and we substitute it instead with academic qualifications.\nThe results are presented in Table 8 . We note that the coefficients that indicate a divorce in the last 3 and 5 years are positive, and the one related to years since the divorce is negative as in the earlier Table 2 . The coefficients on divorce less than 3 years ago and years since the divorce are roughly similar in the two tables, while the coefficient of divorce less than 5 years ago appears to be larger for the BHPS sample.\nNext, we consider the entire panel in the BHPS dataset. Figure 2 provides the simplest form of longitudinal evidence. It plots the average level of GHQ-Happiness for young people aged between 18-30 --therefore the same age range as in our laboratory experiment --in the 2 years before their parents' divorce and then after the divorce (the divorce happens at time t). There is a spike in happiness in the year of the divorce. Afterwards, the GHQ-Happiness score reverts to approximately the level before divorce. Figures 3 and 4 repeat the exercise for females and males respectively. The same increase in happiness for males appears a period before. 10 Finally, in Figure 5 , we consider as an additional robustness check the subset of BHPS individuals who are students aged 18-30 (this is the same population used in our earlier laboratory experiment). Although the number of subject is now too low (30 in total) for statistically significant results, we again observe an increase in GHQ-Happiness in the period of the parental divorce.\n9 Similar analysis using previous waves generally produces comparable results 10 Recall that t is the year of the legal divorce, so a separation is likely to have taken place before. One objection to this (perhaps surprising) finding is that it might be driven by omitted variables. Therefore, we perform a further analysis that controls for other influences on young people's well-being. Table 9 reports a set of BHPS happiness regression equations with a number of control variables, again, to simplify the exposition and the comparability with the laboratory experiment, we multiply GHQ-Happiness index by 7/4 like in the regression in Table 8 . Table 9 provides the results from OLS estimation with individual (and wave) fixed effects. In order to enlarge our sample, we introduce also individuals aged 16 and 17; then, in Table 10 , we go on to report the same estimation for the subsample aged 18-30 years old.\nConsistently with our findings using laboratory data, from Table 9 we note that the divorce variable is estimated to have a positive effect on happiness in the year in which parents divorce (coefficient 0.165); this effect is not generally significantly different from zero in the second period, or in the year before the divorce. 11 Comparing columns 2 and 3 of Table 9 , the 'beneficial' consequences of the parental divorce are evident for both females (column 2) and males (column 3); but --as we can also observe in Figures 3 and 4 --for males the positive and significant effect appears with a slightly different lag than for females.\nColumn 4 of Table 9 provides a further specification check. The substantive findings are unchanged."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Finally, Table 10 restricts the sample to only the age range of the laboratory experiment and the one used to compute the averages plotted in Figures 2-5 . The findings are approximately the same: the only real difference is in column 1, where the coefficient of parental divorce at time period t loses its significance, although the coefficient is still negative. This is perhaps to be expected given the smaller sample of individuals. The results for male and female subjects are similar to those in Table 8 . 11 None of the preceding years are significant when we include them in the regression model. 12 In Tables 8 and 9 , the sign of the income variable upon happiness is sometimes positive for male subjects. The occasional occurrence of this counter-intuitive result is known to scholars who analyse the BHPS dataset. One possible explanation is that there are omitted variables that correlate with both mental distress and incomethings like long commutes and stress that comes with particular jobs (see Clark 2003 and Powdthavee (2009) for more details)."}, {"section_title": "Divorce and Life Satisfaction", "text": "Our questions on happiness and the GHQL-Happiness index are usually considered as measures of emotional and short-run well-being. The question \"How satisfied are with your whole life these days\" perhaps reflect a more considered longer-run measure of well-being.\nWe asked this question at the end of our experiment (coded from 1= low to 10= high), and a similar question is present in the BHPS survey (coded from 1 = low to 7 = high).\nIt seems instructive to consider the impact of parental divorce on answers to this question as well. In Table 11 we present the effect of divorce on life satisfaction for the subject of our laboratory experiment (columns 1 to 3) and for students aged between 18 and 30 in the wave 17 of the BHPS (columns 4 to 6). Although the signs of the three relevant variables are the expected ones (Divorce less than 3y ago and Divorce less than 5y ago are positive and Years since divorce are negative in both datasets), only the Divorce less than 5y ago in the BHPS sample is significant at 5 percent level.\nFurthermore, in Table 12 , where we present a regression based on the entire panel controlling for individual fixed effects, we find that variables concerning the divorce are all insignificant, which seems to suggest that the significant coefficients found in Table 11 might be due to some unobserved heterogeneity.\nTherefore the results of Tables 10 and 11 arguably lend some further support to the view that divorce has a non-negative impact on young individuals' subjective well-being. Furthermore, if we consider happiness to reflect a short-run, perhaps more emotional measure of well-being, and life satisfaction a longer-run, perhaps more considered, measure then comparing the results across both of these well-being indicators we might conclude that any small positive effect is more evident in the short-run."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The study has attempted to estimate the effects of parents' divorce upon grown children. This area of quantitative social science is a potentially emotive one, and one in which systematic evidence has been lacking. We began the study, which blends two kinds of analytical approaches, expecting to discover some harmful consequences from recent parental divorce.\nDespite those priors, we were unable to find such evidence.\nIn a laboratory setting with controlled conditions, university students' productivity and happiness levels appear to be approximately unaffected, and never negatively affected, by whether they have recently experienced a parental divorce. There is some evidence --as in column 1 of Table 3 --that reported happiness and productivity are actually greater among male students whose parents have divorced. Nevertheless, there is a potential objection to these laboratory findings. It is that, for some unobservable reason, those university students in our sample from families in which there has been a divorce may be intrinsically different from (perhaps more productive than) those students who come from families with no divorce. This is not an entirely persuasive objection --a critic who believed that divorce is bad for offspring would have to argue that the stay-together parents in our sample have children who are inherently less happy than others --but it deserves to be considered.\nThe paper therefore performs a further exercise, in which young people are followed longitudinally through time. This allows the same individuals to be observed before and after their parents split up. Fixed-effects models are estimated in which happiness --among a random sample of young British adults --is the dependent variable. No evidence is found for the existence of deleterious effects on young adults from the dissolution of parents' marriages when data drawing on replies to happiness and life satisfaction questions are considered.\nIndeed, as in the laboratory experiment, there is some evidence that grown children actually gain from a parental divorce (at least when we focus on reported happiness).\nAlthough consistent with the spirit of other important works, this paper's results should be treated with appropriate caution. The present paper is designed as a tentative contribution to an important but complex issue in which greater knowledge is needed. For example, our focus was on those with newly-divorced parents, and not on the longer-run lifetime impact of parental divorce, something beyond the scope of the present paper. Those long-term effects deserve to be studied in future research.
