California Brown Pelican Recovery Plan (1983) describes the importance of suitable roost sites to the well-being and survival of California brown pelicans, and recommends minimizing human disturbance at these sites. East Sand Island is the largest known roost for brown pelicans in the Pacific Northwest, and it is one of a few sites used as a night-roost in this region. It is important to understand the factors that could potentially negatively affect pelican use of this roost site or degrade its quality as a roost."}, {"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": "The California brown pelican is one of six subspecies of brown pelicans, and ranges from temperate North America to mid-South America along both coasts. The brown pelican has many of the distinctive traits of the family Pelecanidae, including large size; elongated bill; a large, distensible gular pouch; and totipalmate feet. It is the only pelican species, however, that primarily inhabits marine waters ), plunge-dives for food , Carl 1987, Johnsgard 1993, and has predominately brown plumage and a black and brown gular pouch ohnsgard 1993). The six subspecies of brown pelican differ slightly from each other in size, plumage, and bare skin coloration. The California brown pelican is the third largest in size (cu]men, tarsus, and wing length) and displays sexual size dimorphism (Palacios 2001. Sexual dimorphism differs among subspecies, with females larger than males in P. o. occidentalis and P. o. uiinator, and males larger than females by 38-44% in P. o. muipiyi and R o. ca4/omicus (Palacios 2001). The proximal end of the gular pouch of the California brown pelican is reddish orange in the nonbreeding season and poppy red during the breeding season, considerably different from other subspecies. In general, the plumages of the six subspecies are similar ). Brown pelicans are socially gregarious and travel and roost in large flocks year round. They breed in large colonies of up to several thousand pairs on offshore or estuarine islands free from mammalian predators. They are monogamous within a breeding season, typically lay 3-egg clutches (range 2-4 eggs), and begin breeding at 3-5 years of age . California brown pelicans nest on islands off the Pacific coast of Baja California (Everett and Anderson 1991) and the Channel Islands of southern California (Gress 1995). Many pelicans migrate north from these areas post-breeding in search of food along the coast of Oregon and Washington ; Ukich Wilson, pers. comm.), with smaller numbers migrating to the southern coast of British Columbia (Shepard 1999;Ulrich Wilson, pers. comm.). Most of these migrants return to southern California by December (Briggs et al. 1983, Shepard 1999, Tweit et al. 1999). The California brown pelican was designated as endangered by both the state (California State Endangered Species Act of 1970) and the federal government (35 Federal Register 16047, October 13, 1970) when the segment of the subspecies that nests on the Channel Islands, California experienced catastrophic reproductive failure in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The reproductive failure was primarily attributed to eggshell thinning (Keith et al. 1971, Risebrough et al. 1971,Jehl 1973, USFWS 1983). Considerable evidence has been gathered that indicates a strong relationship between body burdens of DDE, a metabolite of DDT, and the degree of eggshell thinning . The shells of most eggs, highly deficient in calcium carbonate, were crushed during incubation , USFWS 1983. Eggshells from Anacapa Island, the site of the largest breeding colony of California brown pelicans in the United States, averaged 53% thinner in 1969 compared to those collected prior to 1943. Of 1,272 nests observed on the Channel Islands in 1969, only two successfully fledged one young apiece (Risebrough Ct al. 1971). DDT input into the Pacific Ocean (via wastewater) along southern California dropped dramatically beginning in 1970 (USFWS 1983). Shortly thereafter, mean pelican eggshell thickness began to slowly increase and the nesting success of pelicans on Anacapa Island began increasing as well (USFWS 1983). The increase in reproductive rate began to level off in 1974 (Anderson et al. 1977), while the breeding population increased dramatically until 1980. Since then the population has increased slowly (D. Anderson, UC Davis, pers. comm.), allowing scientists to identify other factors Iiniiting population growth and recovery of California brown pelicans. Food availability has been identified as a primary factor limiting the reproductive success of California brown pelicans ([JSFWS 1983). Brown pelicans breeding in the Southern California Bight are highly dependent on northern anchovy (Engraulis morda.'c,  and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax, F. Gress, pers. comm., cited in Shields 2002) during the breeding season. Breeding adults are known to abandon nests and chicks in years of low food availability ) and migrate to areas of higher prey density (Anderson and Gress 1984). Human disturbance is another factor limiting the reproductive success of brown pelicans; disturbance at breeding colonies has been linked to lower productivity at the colony Keith 1980, Anderson 1988). The presence of humans on breeding colonies can cause panic flush events by parents, during which nestlings and eggs are crushed Risebrough 1972, Kushlan and, larger nestlings leave nests and became entangled in vegetation (Schreiber 1979, Anderson and, and eggs and nestlings are exposed to predators and weather . Repeated human disturbance at breeding colonies has caused complete colony abandonment for multiple years Keith 1980, Stiles 1984). The California Brown Pelican Recovery Plan (1983) not only describes the importance of protecting breeding colony sites, it also explains the need to designate major roost sites as 'critical habitat' throughout the entire range of the subspecies. Although most, if not all, of the breeding colony sites are now protected, very little has been done to monitor and protect roosting habitat for California brown pelicans. It is difficult to measure the effects of human disturbance on non-breeding pelicans. To determine sensitivity of non-breeding California brown pelicans and other birds to human disturbance, researchers have measured flush response rate and distance , Holmes et al. 1993, Stiedi and Anthony 1996.    . Boulder rip-rap was later added to the west end of East Sand Island to prevent further erosion, while the shoreline of the eastern end of the island is primarily sand. The inland areas of the island, including the Tidal Pond area, are vegetated mostly by grasses, small shrubs (Scotch broom, Cylisus scoparius; gorse, Ulex europaeus; twinberry, Lonicera involucrata), and lowlying deciduous trees (willow, Salix spp.; alder, Alnus spp.). Coastal estuaries have been identified as important foraging habitat for nonbreeding brown pelicans (IJSFWS 1983. Estuaries often support high concentrations of young, schooling fishes, and brackish waters seem to be preferred bathing areas for pelicans, possibly because freshwater reduces salt-water adapted parasites in the gular pouch and esophageal region . Islands are preferred by pelicans as roost sites because the deep water around the island provides a barrier for land-based predators (Briggs et al. 1981, USFWS 1983). Brown pelicans have wettable feathers that will become water-logged and hinder thermoregulation if they can not rest out of the water after feeding, when they dry and preen their plumage (Rijke 1970, Schreiber andSchreiber 1982). East Sand Island is also the site of the largest breeding colony of Caspian terns (Sterwa caspia) in the world, the largest breeding colony of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) on the west coast of North America (Roby et al. 1998, Collis et al. 1999, and a large breeding colony of western/glaucous-winged gulls (Larus occidentalis x L glaucescens; Ca. 6,000 pairs; D. Roby, USGS, unpubi. data). Researchers have monitored the double-crested cormorant and Caspian tern colonies from 1997 through 2004 to determine diet composition, consumption of sa]monid smolts, and the sire and productivity of these colonies. Resource managers seek information on foraging patterns, distribution, and habitat selection of double-crested cormorants and Caspian terns to develop sound management plans to help restore endangered and threatened runs of Columbia Basin salmonids (NPPC 1994, NMFS 1995, CRITFC 1995. Research activities have included night-time entry onto the cormorant colony to radio-tag adults and collect chick regurgitations, day-and nighttime monitoring of nesting cormorants and Caspian terns from blinds, experiments to measure cormorant energy expenditure rates, lethal collection of cormorants and Caspian terns for food habits analysis, and habitat management to maintain the Caspian tern colony site. An upland area (4-6 acres) of mixed herbaceous and woody vegetation on the east end of the island was scraped free of vegetation and woody debris in 1999 to provide nesting habitat for Caspian terns (Roby et al. 2002), and scarification is required annually to prevent encroaching vegetation from covering the site. When I conducted this study I attempted to record all pelican disturbances caused by my research activities in order to account for the effects of this study on pelican numbers and behavior on East Sand Island. I attempted to minimize the effects of my presence on pelicans by maintaining a distance of 150 m (or greater if pelicans began to 'startle' or fly) during boat-based censuses, accessing the observation tower (blinds) only within 2 hours of low tide (in order to put as much distance as possible between myself and roosting pelicans) using an aboveground tunnels to access the blinds, installing one-way glass in the observation blinds, padding the floor of the tower, and speaking in hushed tones while in the tunnels and blinds. In an effort to avoid anthropomorphic bias in the classification of pelican activities , I used detailed drawings from  to categorize activities. Although public access to East Sand Island is not permitted, sturgeon, salmon, and crab fishermen frequent the waters in close proximity to the island. Local residents gather driftwood from the shores of the island, windsurfers rest on the island, and boaters have been observed to feed birds close to East Sand Island. There are many potential natural causes of disturbance to California brown pelicans on East Sand Island. Bald eagles (Flaliaeetus leucocephalu.c) are common in the Columbia River estuary, with peak abundance during February-May (Isaacs et al. 1983, Garrett et al. 1988, Jenkins et al. 1999 (NPPC 1994, NMFS 1995, CRITFC 1995. Concern arose over the potential effects of these research activities on brown pelicans roosting on East Sand Island. Human disturbance to birds has led to decreased numbers of roosting and feeding birds at previously preferred sites (Batten 1977, Bell and Austin 1985, including roost sites frequented by California brown pelicans  "}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "East Sand Island (46\u00b015'45\"N, 123\u00b057'45\"W), located 8 km upriver of the mouth in the Columbia River estuary (Figure 2.1), was the focus of this study. The island is approximately 2 km long on an east-west axis, ranges from 10 to 300 m wide, and has an area of approximately 21 hectares (Figure 2.2). The shore of East Sand Island consists of either large boulders (i.e., West Jetty, North Spit, and South Shore), sandy beach (i.e., North, East, and West beaches), or wooden pilings (Figure 2.2).  (Figure 2.1).\nEast Sand Island (46\u00b015'45\"N, 123\u00b057'45\"W) is located 8 km east of the mouth of the Columbia River, in the Columbia River estuary (Figure 3.1). In the 1930s government engineers built pile dikes on the south side of the island to reduce shoreline erosion , and large boulder rip-rap was added later on the west end of East Sand Island to form a westward-pointing jetty (Figure 3.2). The island is approximately 2 km long on an east-west axis, ranges from 10 to 300 m wide, and has an area of approximately 21 hectares (Figure 3.2). We recorded the behavior of pelicans roosting on a study plot on the south  shore of the island that was heavily used by roosting pelicans and visible from a nearby 5-rn high, enclosed observation tower (Figure 3.2). The plot extended from directly to the south of the observation tower for 136 m along the shore to the west, where a large, clearly visible driftwood stump was lodged high on the beach. This long, narrow plot was bounded by the water's edge to the south and a grassy meadow to the north, which was not used by roostmg pelicans. The plot ranged from 10-20 m wide, depending on tide height. Pelicans on the water within 50 m of shore directly off the study plot were included in behavioral observations. The substrate of the study plot consisted of large piles of flotsam and jetsam (mostly wood) on rip-rap boulders. During inclement weather, when most pelicans were resting, we could not see from the tower as many as 10% of the pelicans on the study plot because they were obscured from view by driftwood, based on comparisons with boat-based censuses. The total number of pelicans on the study plot was more accurately determined by counting from a skiff about 150 m offshore of the plot using image-stabilizing binoculars (see Chapter 2). Consequently, boatbased counts of pelicans on the plot in the evening were used to assess seasonal trends in use of the plot by roo sting pelicans. We devised a method to access the blind on the observation tower without disturbing pelicans on the plot. Observers were dropped off by boat on the south shore beach near camp, walked across the island to the North Beach, then west along the North Beach as close to the water's edge as possible, and, using the sand dune as visual cover, approached the entrance to an above-ground tunnel system that led to the tower (Figure 3.2). We approached the tunnel entrance from the North Beach only within 2 hours of low tide, when the beach was widest, or at night in order to minimize the possibility of disturbance to pelicans roosting on the upland portions of the island. Bald eagles and peregrine falcons (Falcoperegrinus) are two large avian predators that nest in the Columbia River estuary and frequent East Sand Island J. Pagel, USFWS, pers. comm.). Both species kill and/or scavenge waterbirds nesting on East Sand Island. Although we know of no evidence that peregrine falcons prey on brown pelicans, we observed bald eagles stooping on brown pelicans that were roosting on East Sand Island, and bald eagles have been documented to kill incubating adult brown pelicans in Georgia (B. Winn, pers. comm., in Shields 2002). Both of these raptors can elicit flight responses from pelicans, although in the case of peregrine falcons, the pelicans may be reacting to gull alarm calls rather than a direct predator threat."}, {"section_title": "PACIFIC OCEAN", "text": "Aerial surveys were flown in a Cessna 205 at ca. 85 knots air speed and at an altitude of ca. 200 m, just offshore so we could inspect the shoreline and near-shore waters. We never observed pelicans react to the plane during our aerial censuses. The pilot circled offshore stacks as many times as necessary for the observer to obtain a count of any pelicans present. Each aerial survey began at the southern end of the survey route and progressed northward. We used either 10 x 50 mm Leica binoculars or 10 x 30 mm Canon image stabilizing binoculars to count pelicans from the aircraft."}, {"section_title": "Disturbance Rate", "text": "For the purposes of this study, disturbance was defmed as any stimulus that caused one or more pelicans to flush (to take flight). We monitored disturbances to pelicans roosting on East Sand Island from an observation tower near the west end of the island (Figure 2.2). From the elevated vantage of this converted U.S. Army Corps of Engineers range marker tower, most of the west end of the island could be easily viewed. Our view of the beaches at the eastern end of the island, however, was obscured by willows (Sa/& spp.) and alders (A/mis spp.) growing on upland areas near the center of the island. When disturbed into flight, pelicans leap up and fly away from the disturbance without losing altitude , so we were able to detect pelicans when flushed from most areas of the island from the observation tower. Pelicans often circled high above the source of disturbance before re-landing, or leaving the island, enhancing our ability to detect disturbance events throughout the island. Observation time blocks were categorized as either morning (04:00-13:00 PDT) or evening (13:00-22:00 PDT); duration of observation bouts was dictated by available light. We randomly selected three observation time blocks per week (alternating one morning and two evening time blocks per week with two morning and one evening time blocks per week) using a random numbers table. We began monitoring disturbance rates to pelicans as soon as daylight allowed, even if this was hours in advance of the selected evening observation time block. In addition, disturbance was monitored until we exited the observation tower, regardless of when the observation time block ended. Observation blocks that were missed due to stormy weather or precluded due to too many pelicans roosting along the access route to the observation tower were completed at the next available opportunity. We grouped known-cause disturbances into three main categories: "}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Within an observation block, all natural and non-research anthropogenic disturbances to pelicans, as defmed by 1 or more pelicans flushing, were recorded.

We calculated rates of disturbance to brown pelicans by dividing the total observed number of pelicans flushed by the total number of observation hours for each category of disturbance. We "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "We used multiple linear regression to examine factors that potentially influenced the number of pelicans roosting in various sections of East Sand Island. The factors included year (2001 or 2002), date, time of day (morning versus evening census), tide height, tide speed, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, and wind direction. We examined quadratic functions of these variables and interactions between the variables. Some of the independent variables were correlated, but none of the correlations exceeded 0.4. We used step-wise removal of non-significant (P-value> 0.05) variables to determine models that identified factors that explained a significant proportion of the variation in the number of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island. We also examined factors affecting numbers of pelicans in six sections of shoreline of East Sand Island where disturbances were concentrated (North Spit, Tip of Jetty, Camp to Dike, North Beach, East Beach, Dike to Gorse; see Figure 2.2). We sought to examine in more detail the potential effects of research-related disturbance on pelican numbers by comparing the proportional change in pelican numbers for paired evening or morning censuses recorded before and after a disturbance caused by research activities. These piired before and after censuses were taken either 24, 48, or 72 hours apart. The magnitude of diurnal researchrelated disturbance that occurred between the paired censuses was defmed as the number of pelicans flushed by research activities divided by the average number of pelicans counted in the two censuses. The interval between the paired censuses used to assess potential effects from diurnal research-related disturbance did not include nights when night-time research occurred on the west end of the island, which might have confounded the results. To determine potential effects of night-time research activities on pelican numbers, we analyzed paired censuses before and after each night-time research activity. We were concerned that the analysis might fail to detect small differences in pelican numbers caused by research-related disturbance, so we set the level of significance at c* = 0.10. In addition, we wanted to examine the potential effects of natural disturbances and anthropogenic disturbances (not related to research) on numbers of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island. We used the same paired, before and after census method used in analysis of potential effects of research-related disturbance. We calculated the proportional rate of disturbance by these two categories of disturbance (number of pelicans flushed per daylight hour/average number of pelicans on the island) and ran linear regression models with the response as the proportional change in the number of pelicans between the paired censuses.\nWe used multivariate linear regression to determine which variables influenced time-activity budgets and movements of pelicans on the study plot. We selected the two activity categories \"resting\" and \"attentive\" as the response variables in these analyses because they were common activities that clearly changed in response to disturbance. Attentive behavior was sometimes a precursor to flushing from the roost, whereas resting was the most inactive activity category that we used. We included the following variables in the analysis of factors influencing the proportions of resting and attentive pelicans, and the movement of pelicans to and from the study plot: year, date, time of day (Pacific Daylight Time), number of pelicans on the study plot, wind direction, wind speed, temperature, percent cloud cover, precipitation, tide height (meters of water from mean low tide), tide speed (tide data from the NOAA tide gauge at Tongue Point, OR, 46\u00b011'N, 123\u00b046'W, 17 km up-river from East Sand Island), disturbance variables (time elapsed since a disturbance when one or more pelicans were flushed from the study plot, and disturbance magnitude). Disturbance magnitude was defmed as the proportion of pelicans flushed from the study plot. In addition, we examined quadratic functions of these variables and interactions between these variables. Some of the variables were correlated; however, correlations among explanatory variables did not exceed the correlation coefficient of 0.4. We used step-wise removal of non-significant variables (P-value> 0.05) to identify variables that explained a significant proportion of the variation in the proportion of pelicans resting or attentive, and the rate of pelicans arriving or departing from the study plot. To meet the assumptions of parametric statistical tests, the response variables (proportions of pelicans on the plot) were logit transformed (log(Y/(l-Y))). Due to the many 0 values in the response variables, 0.5 times the minimum non-zero value was added to the response variable to avoid zero in the denominator or numerator of the logit transformed values. We removed from the analysis all scans and flux rate observations when less than 10 pelicans were present on the study plot in an effort to avoid undue influence from single birds on the results. We examined graphs of residuals to ensure that autocorrelation or a lack of independence in the data did not confound the results. Multiple linear regression models of logit transformed response variables tend to exaggerate predicted odds ratios greater than 2.5 or less than 0 5 . We present means from actual data (not accounting for other variables) to document changes in behavior when we thought this exaggeration might occur. The P-values presented are from the multiple linear regression models, unless stated otherwise. To determine if there were immediate effects of disturbance on pelican behavior we examined the difference in the proportion of resting or attentive pelicans in the half hour following a disturbance in the study plot compared to the overall mean proportion of pelicans engaged in resting or attentive behaviors. We examined the recovery times for each disturbance category separately to determine whether the three types of disturbance affected pelican behavior differently. We treated each disturbance to pelicans in the study plot as an independent event and examined pelican behavior over time following the disturbance by using the slope estimate of the linear trend-line fit to the scan data. Each event was weighted based on the number of scans we conducted following the disturbance. Disturbance events followed by less than 2 behavior scans were discarded from the analysis. We were concerned that the analysis might fail to detect small differences in pelican behavior caused by disturbance, so we set the level of significance at = 0.10."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Pelican Numbers", "text": "We completed 108 censuses of all brown pelicans roosting on East Sand      Although wind speed (r = -0.11, P = 0.12, n = 210) and wind direction (r = -0.06, P = 0.12, n = 210) did not significantly influence total number of pelicans occasions to retrieve the carcasses from the colony, and total number of pelicans on the island after the disturbance was 21 % lower than before the disturbance ( Figure   2.7A). The model predicted a 5% decrease in the total number of pelicans with a doubling in the magnitude of research-related disturbance, although the 95% confidence interval of the change in number of pelicans included zero. Other research-related disturbances caused less than I 5% of pelicans on the island to flush. After removal of the data point where 40% of the pelicans on the island were flushed,  Time of day was an important factor influencing the number of non-breeding brown pelicans at roost sites in California Anderson 1988, Jaques et al. 1996) and Florida . At night roosts in California, pelican numbers were greatest in the morning and evening and lowest at midday Anderson 1988, Jaques et al. 1996). At a diurnal roost near a fish-cleaning station in Florida, pelicans arrived during late morning, loafed in large numbers throughout the day, and departed in the evening . These observations indicate that pelicans leave night roosts in the morning for foraging areas and return to night roosts in the evening. Evening counts on East Sand Island averaged 6% higher than morning counts, suggesting that some pelicans had departed the roost before we could complete morning censuses. We began morning counts as soon as light would allow, but often the dim outlines of pelicans were detected leaving the roost in the semi-darkness before dawn, when counting pelicans on the island was not possible. Pelican census efforts at night roosts should include a second observer who monitors the number of pelicans arriving and departing the roost while the census is conducted to achieve a more accurate count. Our results also suggest that evening counts at pelican roost sites are more inclusive. Brown pelican numbers at night roosts in California varied seasonally and among years aques and . We expected pelican numbers  1988). The roost at East Sand Island has become the largest known aggregation of non-breeding California brown pelicans throughout the range of this subspecies , Palacios et al. 2003.

In 2003, pelican numbers on East Sand Island peaked twice; 6,708 pelicans counted on July and 6,541 pelicans counted on September 5 . In 2004 numbers peaked at 7,786 pelicans on August 13 and then rapidly declined .  (Table 2.1), and 52 pelicans flushed/hour in 2003 . Bald eagles were the primary source of natural disturbance in all three years; 83% in 2001, 89% in 2002 (Table 2.1), and 95% in 2003 . The number of bald eagle nests in the Columbia River estuary has not increased from 2001 to 2004 (R. Anthony, USGS, pers. comm.). The majority of bald eagles that flushed pelicans from East Sand Island, however, were nomadic sub-adults that do not maintain breeding territories. In 2002, 68.5% of the eagles that we were able to identify as adults or sub-adults after they caused a disturbance to pelicans were sub-adults. High attendance of East Sand disturbance.

Disturbance can increase energy expenditure, and thereby affect physiological condition and the allocation of resources toward reproduction , Stalrnaster 1983. Time-activity budgets have been used to identify vulnerable stages or limiting factors in both annual and life cycles of birds , Fischer and Griffin 2000. Some studies have used time-activity budgets to assess behavioral effects of potential disturbances, particularly as it relates to higher energy expenditure for activity , Steidl and Anthony 2000.

This study focused on the time-activity budgets of brown pelicans in an effort to determine those factors influencing behavior of pelicans roosting on East Sand "}, {"section_title": "Time-Activity Budgets", "text": "We collected time-activity data from June 1 to September 9 in 2001 and from June 4 to August 21 in 2002. We used scan sampling techniques   During each 8-hour time block, an activity scan was conducted of all the visible pelicans on the study plot every 30 minutes. Thirty minutes was selected as the sampling interval in an attempt to avoid serial autocorrelation among time-activity budget data . We used 10 x 50 mm binoculars to aid in classifying the activity of each pelican on the plot during scans, and pelican activity was assigned to one of the following six categories: (1) active; walking, agonistic behavior, stretching, picking up sticks, mounting, (2) attentive; standing and alert, neck extended, (3) preening; plumage maintenance, (4) resting; sitting or standing with neck not extended, not alert, (5) startled; standing, wings raised or flapping, flight intention movements, or (6) swimming; in water near shore, within 50 m of study plot. Sketches from  were used as a reference for these activity categories. Although scan samples are intended to be instantaneous , scans in this study required from 15 seconds to 13 minutes, depending on the number of pelicans roosting on the study plot. Before each scan, the following weather variables were recorded: temperature (\u00b0C), percent cloud cover (increments of 5%), wind direction (in degrees, converted to Cartesian coordinates), wind speed (Beaufort Scale), and precipitation (0-7, ranging from no rain to steady heavy rain). These variables were used as covariates in the analysis in order to account for variability in the data due to weather conditions. We were also interested in learning how weather conditions affected pelican behavior.\nThe time-activity data set included 522 scans of pelicans on the study plot during the summer of 2001, with 10 -197 pelicans/scan (mean = 68 pelicans); we recorded 455 scans during the summer of 2002, with 10 -273 pelicans/scan (mean = 118 pelicans). Time-activity budgets of pelicans roosting on the study plot were similar between 2001 and 2002 (Table 3.1), although the proportion of attentive pelicans was significantly greater in 2001. Resting and preening were the two most prevalent activities of pelicans roosting on the study plot in both 2001 and 2002 ( Figure 3.4). The activity category \"startled\" was recorded infrequently (Table 3.1), so we eliminated it from further analysis. Strong correlations existed between some activities, particularly the negative correlation between resting and preening (Table 3.2). These correlations make it difficult to separate effects of disturbance on time-activity budgets from a change in the proportion of pelicans engaged in other activities. Resting and attentive activity categories were not strongly correlated and clearly reflected whether pelicans were relaxed or agitated (Table 3.2), so these two activities were used as response variables    in further analyses of the effects of disturbance on time-activity budgets. Factors Affecting Time-Activity Budgets Brown pelicans roosting on the study plot at East Sand Island on average spent 44% (95% CI: 42.2% to 45.8%) of the day resting. Approximately 33% of the variation in proportion of resting pelicans was explained by time of day, number of pelicans on the plot, wind speed, precipitation, research activity disturbance, other anthropogenic disturbance, and natural disturbance to pelicans on the plot (F8,887 = 55.56, P < 0.0001). Date did not explain a significant amount of the variation in proportion of pelicans resting. The proportion of resting pelicans was positively associated with wind speed (Figure 3.5A) and increased by a factor of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.33) with each 10knot increase in wind speed. The proportion of resting pelicans was also positively associated with precipitation (Figure 3.5B) and increased by a factor of 1.51 (95% CI: 1.41 to 1.61) with each incremental increase in precipitation intensity. The positive associations between resting and these two weather variables indicate that pelicans spent more time resting during inclement weather. The temperatures in this study ranged from 7.2 \u00b0C to 28.9 \u00b0C with a mean of 16 \u00b0C; however, temperature did not affect the proportion of resting pelicans (P = 0.9689). The proportion of resting pelicans was negatively associated with number of pelicans on the plot and decreased by a factor of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.25) with an increase of 100 pelicans. The proportion of resting pelicans increased from early morning (05:30) to midday (11:30-13:00: P < 0.0001) and then decreased late in the evening (P < 0.0001:  Unlike the proportion of pelicans resting, the proportion of pelicans attentive was not related to any of the measured weather variables. The prevalence of attentive pelicans increased slightly with date. The proportion of attentive pelicans decreased from early morning (05:30) to midday (11:30-13:00; P < 0.0001), and then increased through the evening (P < 0.0001; Figure 3.6B). The proportion of attentive pelicans was positively influenced by the number of pelicans on the study plot. The proportion of attentive pelicans increased by a factor of 1.71 (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.01) with an increase of 100 pelicans on the study plot."}, {"section_title": "Movements To and From the Study Plot", "text": "Our objective was to measure potential differences in the flux rate (proportion of pelicans roosting in the study plot arriving or departing/minute) of pelicans on East Sand Island due to weather conditions and disturbance.

The average number of pelicans on the plot during June -August of 2002 was consistently higher than during the same period in 2001, regardless of time of day (Figure 3.3).

During behavioral observations, natural factors caused more disturbance events to pelicans roostmg on the study plot (17 events) than research-related disturbances (4 events) and anthropogenic disturbances not related to research (6 events). Research-related disturbances flushed an average of 9.9% (median) of the pelicans on the study plot per disturbance event (range = 2 56%: n = 4). disturbances compared to natural disturbances. Following a research disturbance in the study plot, the ratio of the proportion of attentive pelicans to non-attentive pelicans was 6.9 times greater (Tukey-Kramer; 95% CI: 1.1 to 45.4 times greater) than following a natural disturbance. Additionally, the ratio of the proportion of resting pelicans to non-resting pelicans following a research disturbance was less than following a natural disturbance by a factor of 1.1 (Tukey-Kramer; 95% CI: 0.99 to 2.7 times less).

Pelican departure rates ranged from 0 to 7.3% per minute with a median departure rate of 0.34%. The lower rates of departure indicate that during periods when the plot was not observed (i.e., nighttime) more pelican departures from the plot occurred than arrivals, probably due to an exodus of pelicans from the night roost in the early morning hours before our observations began. Date, time of day, wind direction, and wind speed accounted for 26% of the variation in the departure rate of pelicans from the study plot. Year, in addition to the four previous explanatory variables, accounted for 29% of the variation in the arrival rate of pelicans to the plot. However, the three types of disturbance (human activities not associated with research, research activities, and natural factors) did not significantly affect the arrival rate (P = 0.1308, 0.0833, and 0.4268, respectively) or the departure rate (P = 0.9428, 0.7301, and 0.4269, respectively) of pelicans to or from the study plot.

California brown pelicans roostmg on East Sand Island during the day spent 85% of the time either resting or preening. Nonbreeding American white pelicans (Pelecanus eythror/ynchos) in Mississippi and Louisiana spent 72 to 96% of daylight hours (06:00 to 17:30) loafmg and the remaining proportion of the day foraging . It may be necessary for pelicans to rest between feeding bouts to recover, particularly in brown pelicans, the only pelican species that plunge dives for food . Seabird plunge-diving is evidently costly, requiring at least 5 times the energy expenditure rate of flapping flight in one seabird species, the blacklegged kittiwake (Rissa tridac'yIa; . The daily patterns of pelican movements and time-activity budgets on the East Sand Island roost indicate higher activity in the early morning and late evening, with less activity around mid-day. The rates of pelicans arriving at the study plot were consistently highest early and late in the day. The proportion of resting pelicans was lowest in the morning and evening, and peaked in the middle of the day. Correspondingly, the proportion of attentive pelicans was highest in the morning and 80 evening and lowest in the middle of the day. A sub-adult California brown pelican fitted with a radio transmitter spent less than I O% of the time inactive (not flying) from 04:30 to 07:30 and from 16:30 to 19:30, while spending approximately equal time active and inactive from 07:30 to 16:30 . This is consistent with our hypothesis of early morning departure to foraging areas, periodic return to rest throughout the day, and a late evening increase in activity associated with the return of large numbers of pelicans to the roost.  observed that brown pelicans roosted at a Florida boat marina in large numbers during the middle of the day, but were present in only small numbers during the mornings and evenings. They concluded that pelicans foraged early in the morning and utilized the marina as a mid-day loafing area, spending the time sleeping and preening. Disturbances on East Sand Island could degrade the quality of the roost site for California brown pelicans and potentially result in less pelican use of the site. Flight is the most energetically-expensive activity for pelicans that we observed in response to disturbance (Norberg 1996, Jodice Ct al. 2003. Each time a pelican is flushed from a roost due to disturbance, an energetic cost is incurred that requires compensation. If the cost of disturbances is not compensated for through increased food intake or reduced energy expenditure, subsequent survival and/or productivity may be compromised. Another more subtle cost of disturbance is potentially reflected in changes in pelican time-activity budgets. Disturbances from research-related activity and natural sources led to significant declines in resting behavior and increases in attentive 82 behavior among pelicans on the plot. A change in activity from relaxed or resting to alert or attentive has been shown to double the energy expenditure rate of captive birds ) and increase the metabolic rate of free-living American black ducks (Anas rubripes) by a factor of 1.45 to 1.94 . Alert behavior in response to human presence can significantly increase avian heart rate above normal levels for walking, preening, and resting . In addition, wild birds may act normally in the presence of humans, but other physiological indicators, such as heart rate, may change dramatically Amlanger 1980, Culik et al. 1990). Changes in avian behavior due to human disturbance can lead to increased exposure to natural predators (Keller 1991) and reduced foraging time , Fleniniing et al. 1988, Burger and Gochfeld 1991, enhancing the fitness costs of disturbance. The four observed disturbance events caused by research activities that occurred in the study plot were land-based activities, and the six non-research anthropogenic disturbances that occurred were water-based activities. It appears that pelican behavior was more affected by human activities on the island than by human activities on the water near the island, based on the significant difference between research and natural disturbance, but no significant difference between non-research anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Also the median magnitude of non-research anthropogenic disturbances in the study plot (5.3% of pelicans in the study plot flushed) was smaller than the median magnitude for research disturbances (9.9% of pelicans in the study plot flushed) which potentially contributed to the smaller effect on pelican behavior from observed non-research anthropogenic disturbances. Conversely, the median magnitude of natural disturbances in the study plot (2O.5\u00b0/o of pelicans in the study plot flushed) was much higher than the two categories of human disturbance, yet had a smaller effect than research disturbance on pelican behavior in the half hour following disturbance. This suggests that natural disturbance events, although more frequent, did not influence the time-activity budgets of pelicans on the study plot as much as research (land-based human) activities. Additionally, following a natural disturbance resting behavior recovered to baseline (average) levels in much less time than following a research-related disturbance. It is difficult to determine the disturbance threshold above which California brown pelican fitness is negatively affected.  observed that waterfowl spent 1.4% of the time swimming, flying, and alert in response to human disturbance, and concluded that this energy investment was too low to have a significant effect on fitness. California brown pelicans are listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, however, and protected under law from any disturbance that causes them to flush. East Sand Island is the only suitable night-time roost for California brown pelicans in the Columbia River estuary and efforts to ensure that this roost is not degraded by human disturbance are warranted."}, {"section_title": "MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS", "text": "East Sand Island has become an important roost site for endangered California brown pelicans in part because it is closed to the public and free of mammalian predators, unlike other islands in the lower Columbia River estuary. These two features offer a relatively disturbance-free site where pelicans can rest between feeding bouts. Despite precautions taken by researchers to avoid disturbance to California brown pelicans roosting on East Sand Island in both 2001 and 2002, research-related disturbances did have a significant effect on time-activity budgets of pelicans on the study plot. The frequency, magnitude, and spatial-scale of research-related disturbances to pelicans on East Sand Island need to be limited in order to minimize potential effects on pelican fitness. The portion of East Sand Island west of the observation tower, which includes some of the highest densities of roosting pelicans (see Chapter 1), should be entirely off-limits to research activities from May 1 to November 15. Standard protocols to minimize disturbance to pelicans on the island should continue to be followed, including use of aboveground tunnels to conceal researcher access to the observation tower and accessing the tunnels from the North Beach only within two hours of low tide or at night to reduce disturbance to waterbirds from research activities. Researchers should be familiar with the protocol to minimize disturbance to pelicans developed in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as page 74 of the California Brown Pelican Recovery Plan (USFWS 1983), which outlines the importance of essential roosting habitat for recovery of this species. This information will assist researchers in understanding the necessity of precautions, and why it is important to follow these guidelines. The effect on roosting pelicans of unrestricted access to East Sand Island by researchers and the general public is not known, but it is likely that this increase in disturbance would eventually result in the abandonment of the island as a roost site."}, {"section_title": "85", "text": "Natural disturbance to brown pelicans on the study plot did not influence pelican time-activity budgets to the same extent as research-related disturbance, but increased use of East Sand Island by avian predators, particularly bald eagles, has the potential to greatly affect pelican behavior. Any human activities on East Sand Island that attract avian predators or coyotes (e.g., garbage, decoys, roost structures) should be closely monitored and regulated. Any coyotes or other terrestrial mammalian predators that manage to reach East Sand Island should be removed immediately. East Sand Island should be designated as critical roosting habitat for endangered California brown pelicans and monitored frequently during the months of highest pelican use Qune -October)."}, {"section_title": "92", "text": "The results of this study demonstrated significant effects of disturbance on the time-activity budgets, distribution, and number of California brown pelicans roostmg on East Sand Island in the Columbia River estuary. Year, date, and tide height accounted for 9O% of the variation in total numbers of California brown pelicans roosting on East Sand Island, indicating that these factors must be accounted for in order to detect effects of disturbance on pelican numbers. Research disturbance apparently had a negative effect on number of brown pelicans roosting on East Sand Island when the magnitude of disturbance caused at least 15% of the total number of roosting pelicans to fly from the roost. Investigation of the distribution of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island indicated that in the section of shoreline where the majority of pelicans were flushed due to research activities, pelican numbers were negatively associated with research activity. This suggests that pelicans moved away from this area of high researcher activity to roost on other parts of the island, or possibly left the island altogether. The marginally significant negative association between the magnitude of research disturbance and pelican numbers on East Sand Island was detected only in 2001, not in 2002. Additional precautions that were taken by researchers in 2002 to avoid flushing pelicans, including reduced number of researcher forays on parts of the island where pelicans tended to congregate, apparently reduced the magnitude of disturbance. Research can be conducted on East Sand Island in the presence of roosting California brown pelicans without causing significant declines in numbers of roosting pelicans, if researchers take certain precautions. These precautions include restricted researcher access to the west end of the island, use of aboveground tunnels 93 to access the observation tower, and curtailing research activities that could potentially cause large numbers of roosting pelicans (more than I 5%) to flush. Although anthropogenic disturbance not associated with research had no detectable effect on the number of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island, most of this type of disturbance event were not witnessed and the reactions of brown pelicans not recorded. Also, the magnitude of this source of disturbance was negatively associated with numbers of pelicans roosting on the western tip of the island, where recreational boats frequently passed within 150 m of the shoreline. The localized effect of non-research anthropogenic disturbance on pelican numbers suggests that pelicans were moving from an area of high human activity to a different part of the island. Pelican avoidance of areas with relatively high human activity indicates that the quality of this roost site can be compromised by human disturbance, and pelican use of East Sand Island would be greatly reduced if the public (e.g., beach combers, campers) were permitted access to the island. I did not detect a significant effect of natural disturbance on total numbers of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island or on numbers of pelicans using sections of the shoreline with frequent natural disturbances. As with non-research anthropogenic disturbance, however, most of this type of disturbance event were not witnessed and reactions of pelicans not documented. Although natural disturbances were responsible for flushing far more pelicans than anthropogenic disturbances, anthropogenic disturbances appear to have had a greater influence on the numbers, distribution, and time-activity budgets of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island. California brown pelicans may be more acclimated to natural disturbances than to anthropogenic disturbances, perhaps due to habituation to frequent natural disturbances as an adaptation to reduce energy expenditure. In addition, the main source of natural disturbance to pelicans on East Sand Island is bald eagles, which rarely attack pelicans; only two unsuccessful attacks (no contact made) by juvenile eagles on juvenile pelicans were observed in 657 hours of observation. Brown pelicans flushing from East Sand Island due to eagle disturbance appeared to be reacting more to the alarm response of other waterbirds nesting on the island, rather than the eagles per se. The presence of mammalian predators large enough to prey upon pelicans is more likely to cause roost abandonment by brown pelicans than the current levels of disturbance from avian predators. No coyotes were observed on East Sand Island during this study, although they have been sighted repeatedly on West Sand Island. Although the two islands are separated by a 600-rn open water channel, elk and deer are known to have reached East Sand Island in recent years. It is possible that coyotes will reach East Sand Island in the future. In order to maintain the high quality of the roost site on East Sand Island, the island should be monitored between April and December, and any coyotes or other large mammalian predators that are detected on the island should be removed immediately. The use of East Sand Island by California brown pelicans in future decades may change dramatically in response to global warming and increasing pelican population numbers. Northward range expansion by brown pelicans is occurring on both the East and West coasts of the United States. Although the breeding range of the eastern brown pelican (P. o. carolinensis) has expanded northward in recent years, the same has not yet been observed for California brown pelicans. We observed California brown pelicans on East Sand Island engage in courtship displays, nest building, copulations, and broodiness. These behaviors occurred at roost sites in southern California in the years prior to the roost becoming an active breeding colony. It is possible that with continued, consistent use of East Sand Island by pelicans during the breeding season, that breeding by California brown pelicans could occur at this site, a 1,500 1cm northward expansion of their current breeding range. All three categories of disturbance, natural, research-related, and non-research anthropogenic, influenced the time-activity budgets of pelicans roosting on East Sand Island Immediately following a disturbance that flushed pelicans from our study plot, the proportion of resting pelicans decreased, while the proportion of attentive pelicans increased. Switching from resting to attentive activity could lead to a significant increase in heart rate, and a doubling in resting metabolic rate of brown pelicans, two responses observed in other avian species. Based on immediate changes in pelican activity and average recovery times to baseline time-activity budgets, disturbance events related to research had a greater effect on pelican behavior compared to either non-research anthropogenic or natural disturbances. Larger natural predators (e.g., coyotes) and greater recreational disturbances (e.g., beach combers on the island) would have a much greater influence on the time-activity budgets of pelicans than observed during this study. This study sought to identify potential threats to the quality of the East Sand Island roost site for California brown pelicans and may be used by resource managers to control the potential impacts of disturbance at this and other pelican roosts. Research activity on East Sand Island can negatively affect the number and distribution of pelicans using the roost site, but precautions taken in 2002 to reduce research-related disturbance were shown to be effective. Research activities negatively influenced the time-activity budgets of roosting brown pelicans in both years. Researchers can minimize their effects on pelican behavior by reducing overall disturbance (e.g., use of aboveground tunnels to access blinds, fewer forays to the west end of East Sand Island) and restricting disturbances to small sections of the island's shoreline Studies of the physiological response (e.g., heart rate, baseline corticosterone levels, fitness response) of California brown pelicans to human disturbance would help to quantify the cost of the response. This information would validate the behavioral data presented here and allow me to extend my conclusions, but this type of invasive research is unlikely as long as California brown pelicans remain listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Humans continue to encroach on coastal wildlife habitat by building houses, beach combing, camping, and fishing. Pelicans are sensitive to human disturbance throughout their annual cycle and need undisturbed habitat for nesting and roosting. The restricted access status of East Sand Island will become increasingly important to the protection of California brown pelicans as the human population grows. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (or future managers of East Sand Island) should continue to keep East Sand Island closed to the public, at least during the period of the year when colonial waterbirds nest and pelicans roost on the island (April -November). Also, the island should be monitored for coyotes and other large predators, and any detected predators should be removed immediately to limit their impact on nesting and roosting seabirds."}]
