These groups differed significantly according to 3 known risk factors for cognitive decline-education level, apolipoprotein E-4 genotype, and type 2 diabetes mellitus-and a biomarker based on brain structure that has been linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Participants with consistently low relative levels of cognitive function over time and those whose relative performance over time declined to these levels tended to have poorer risk factor profiles.

An example of this is the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), which began in 1996 as annual clinic-based assessments for global cognitive function using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE).\n1,2 WHIMS was an ancillary study to the larger Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trials of postmenopausal hormone therapy. 3 In 2008, the WHI ceased clinic visits and shifted to follow-up conducted primarily by mail and telephone. This reorganization led to a change in the instrument used to assess global cognitive function. WHIMS transitioned to the WHIMS of the Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (ECHO), in which global cognitive function was assessed using the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICSm). 4, 5 A validation study that demonstrated that the 3MSE and TICS-m yielded scores that were highly correlated supported this change. 6 TICS-m scores have subsequently been used in WHIMS-ECHO to provide long-term assessments of global cognitive function. 7 Nevertheless, the question remains whether scores from the 2 measurement protocols can be bridged to describe meaningful patterns of cognitive changes over time and across protocols. The focus of this article is to address this question.\nOne approach to this is calibration of the data from different measurement tools (3MSE, TICS-m) to a common metric. 8, 9 Four approaches to this goal have been identified: using elements (e.g., items) that are common across protocols, standardizing individual test item scores according to cohort-wide means and standard deviations and summing cross-sectional measures to form a composite with which to assess trajectories, using confirmatory factor analysis to identify common factors in batteries and treating scores as continuous measures, and using confirmatory factor analysis treating scores as discrete measures. 9 These 4 approaches are focused on ordering participants with respect to their absolute level of cognitive function. We take an alternative approach, instead using the 2 tests to provide measures of participants' relative levels of cognitive function (how well they perform on tests compared with other study participants). In doing so, we assume that the 2 tests assess a common domain (global cognitive function) and that age-, race-, and ethnicity-adjusted participant rankings in the cohort provide a relative measure of cognitive functioning. The approach is most analogous to the second approach above, but instead of using a z-score to define a participant's performance relative to a cohort mean, we assign percentiles to reflect relative standing within the cohort providing assessments. This avoids the assumption that distributions can be homologized and that standard deviations for the 2 tests are commensurate.\nTo assess this approach's performance, we used trajectory analysis to group participants based on the longitudinal characteristics of their relative cognitive performance over time. We then examined the associations these groups have with known risk factors for cognitive decline. We used risk factors from the domains of socioeconomic status, metabolism, brain structure, and genetics to validate this approach. Our primary goal was to demonstrate that the longitudinal trajectories in relative global cognitive scores can be meaningfully estimated across the 2 protocols."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "Participants aged 65 to 80 at the time of enrollment who had volunteered and met eligibility criteria for a randomized controlled clinical trial of postmenopausal hormone therapies based on conjugated equine estrogens, as part of the WHI1 were recruited to join WHIMS between 1996 and 1998. To join WHIMS, participants consented to annual clinic-based cognitive assessments and adjudication of cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia). In 2005, after active WHI therapies had been discontinued for at least 2 years, participants were asked to consent to continue clinic-based follow-up.

AD-PS scores range from 0 to 1 and serve as an index, based on high-dimensional structural MRI measures of gray matter volumes, to order individuals according to how closely they conform to patterns seen in images from individuals with AD in ADNI. AD-PS scores capture the presence of spatial patterns of grey matter tissue atrophy that discriminate between individuals with clinical AD and cognitively normal controls in the ADNI cohort. In the WHIMS MRI cohort, they identify individuals at greater risk of cognitive decline and cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Methods", "text": "We analyzed cognitive function data collected within the 5.5 years before and after the transition from the clinicbased to telephone-based assessments (which occurred in 2008). We limited our analysis to participants who had at least 2 cognitive assessments both with the WHIMS and WHIMS-ECHO protocols during this time span. (This includes some participants who died after at least 2 WHIMS-ECHO assessments.) Separately for the 3MSE and TICS-m data, we generated residuals for these test scores from linear models with covariate adjustment for participant age at the time of the cognitive test and race and ethnicity. To control for any learning effects, we also adjusted for the number of prior 3MSE and TICS-m assessments. Within each follow-up year, we then ranked participants according to these residuals, calculating their percentile standing relative to others who were assessed during that year.\nWe used a group-based trajectory modeling approach to identify clusters of longitudinal patterns of percentiles over time. Models were fitted using PROC TRAJ in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). 17, 18 This approach treats cluster membership as a latent class and, for a specified number of assumed classes, estimates the probability of the membership of each participant in classes, assigning them to the cluster with the greatest probability. We chose to model trajectories using cubic splines. In modeling exercises, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) can guide selection of the number of clusters to include in models. 17 We prespecified 5 clusters and also examined the fit of models with additional clusters. Table 1 provides a description of the 2,561 participants included in our analysis. At the start of WHIMS-ECHO (mid-way through the span of time we used to assess trajectories), their mean6standard deviation age was 80.863.5 (range 75-92). Initial MRI obtained on a subset (N51,385) of participants occurred an average of 2.660.3 years before this; the second MRI (N5682) was obtained an average of 2.160.4 years after this. APOE-4 genotype was available for 1,800 participants: 21.3% had 1 4 allele, and 1.4% had 2 4 alleles. At enrollment in the WHI trial, 4.9% of participants met study criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. At the start of WHIMS-ECHO, type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence had increased to 8.0%. Table 2 provides raw means for 3MSE and TICS-m scores over time. These declined only slightly within the 2 timeframes. Few 3MSE administrations occurred in the year before the transition to WHIMS-ECHO. This is attributable to the time needed to develop subcontracts, obtain institutional review board approval, and obtain consent from participants for the new protocol. Figure 1 portrays the 5 trajectories fitted using the modeling approach. Participants were distributed fairly evenly among these clusters, with membership rates ranging from 17.5% to 24.8%. Two clusters included participants with fairly constant relative performance over time: consistently high (5), with mean scores ranging from the 70th to the 80th percentile over time, or consistently low (1), with mean scores ranging from the 20th to the 30th percentile over time. Two other clusters included participants whose relative cognitive performance declined over time from a relatively high initial level of performance (3) or from a more moderate initial level of performance (2) . A trajectory corresponding to relative improvement from around the 40th percentile to the 60th percentile described a final cluster of participants (4). This may correspond not to absolute improvement in scores but to relative improvement (having less decline than other participants)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The BIC value of fit for our 5-cluster model was 1,021.75. A 4-cluster model has a BIC of 806.51, indicating poorer fit. We examined the fit of models in which greater numbers of clusters were assumed (BIC51,211.71 for 6 groups; BIC51,291.70 for 7 groups). Given the large sample size, these additional clusters could be treated as distinct given the BIC, but we chose to pursue our 5-cluster model because it was prespecified and grouped participants who appeared to be relatively resilient to cognitive decline during follow-up. Our primary aim was to describe the feasibility of our methodological approach. Table 3 examines differences in risk factor profiles for the 5 clusters. There were significant differences between clusters for each. We did not fit a model in which all 4 risk factors were included because MRI and genotyping were included only in subsets of participants, but as noted in a footnote to Table 3 , including education and diabetes mellitus status (which were available for all participants) as covariates did not diminish the statistical significance of relationships between AD-PS and APOE-4 and trajectory clusters.\nTo portray these graphically and allow comparisons of risk factors, we defined cut-points to connote higher risk of each: lack of college, AD-PS score above the 75th percentile (AD-PS50.46) for the cohort, presence of an APOE-4 allele, and diabetes mellitus at WHI baseline. We then used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio for these risks defined using these cut-points for each trajectory cluster relative to Cluster 5 (consistently high global cognitive function). Figure 2 portrays the results. For each risk factor cut-point, the confidence interval for the odds ratio of Cluster 1 (consistently low global cognitive function) excluded 1. Although not fully consistent, there tended to be a rough ordering across the 4 trajectory clusters relative to the fifth."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This work suggests that transforming residual test scores into percentile ranks reflecting study participant performance relative to that of other study participants may offer a useful strategy for \"bridging\" pooled longitudinal data on global cognitive function when assessment tools or measurement strategies change within and between study protocols. Specifically, our findings suggest that the transformation of WHIMS and WHIMS-ECHO 3MSE and TICS-m data into relative percentile ranks fits nicely into an a priori planned 5-cluster model, that the resulting clusters were clinically coherent and distinct, and that groupbased trajectories of cognitive performance over the 10-year or longer observation period conformed to expectations regarding the presence and absence of known risk factors for age-related cognitive decline. An anonymous reviewer noted that the slopes over the interval spanning the conversion from 3MSE to TICS-m scores tended to be steeper (positively and negatively) than among other time intervals, which may reflect heterogeneity in how individuals responded to the 2 assessment modes. The revealed differences in AD-PS scores and APOE-4 frequencies between the 5 identified clusters (Table 3) may offer some insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of these observed cognitive function trajectories. For instance, if we considered Clusters 4 and 5 as 2 relatively resilient groups, the observed difference in AD-PS scores suggested that these 2 groups (with an average increase of 0.13) might have less progression of early neurodegeneration than the other groups (with an average increase of 0.17-0.18). These 2 groups also had the lowest genetic risk of AD according to APOE-4 allele, 19 which would predispose older women to less brain reserve at the start of our follow-up (e.g., Cluster 1) or at greater risk for cognitive decline (Clusters 2 and 3) due to multiple APOE4-associated changes in brain regions (e.g., continuing hippocampal atrophy, cortical thinning), structural networks (e.g., compromised white matter integrity, altered intrinsic network dynamics), and neural function (e.g., reduced cerebrovascular blood flow, reduced metabolic activities).\nAlthough our results are promising, they are not sufficient to determine the validity of the group trajectories described in Figure 1 . Specifically, our strategy converted individual performance on assessment instruments to relative scores that reflected individual participant performance level relative to the group at large. Using this strategy, one's relative percentile standing in the group will change as a function of variability in individual level performance (increase or decrease in cognitive functioning) and as a function of changes in group composition. For example, should proportionally more participants with poor cognitive performance be lost to follow-up in a group, the cognitive trajectories of some remaining participants may appear to \"decline\"-as the lower performing members leave the cohort during follow-up. Although our approach may benefit from the large size of the WHIMS sample, group-based trajectory models have been fitted successfully to much smaller samples 20 and to ordinal data. 21 Further confirmatory research is needed to determine the accuracy and clinical validity of the group based trajectories characterized in this study. Additional limitations include the observational design, which prohibits assumptions about causality in the observed associations between candidate risk factors and cluster membership or cognitive trajectory. Although the study cohort was large and diverse, it was not a population-based sample.\nIt is unclear how missing data (irregular patterns of observation over time that missed visits, lost follow-up, or death may affect) may have influenced our approach. Differential missingness can compromise all longitudinal analytical methods. By ranking individuals with respect to others at the same stage of follow-up (not lost or deceased), we are capturing relative, not absolute, cognitive function. Thus, missing data may influence an individual's ranking. A report of results from a simulation experiment to assess the effect of group-based trajectory modeling found that, although group membership was sensitive to missing data, the missing data mechanisms that modeled trajectories modeled did not materially influence the overall shape of the trajectories. 22 To assess the sensitivity of our findings to missing data, we restricted our analyses to the subset of individuals who had at least 3 cognitive assessments each for the 3MSE and TICS-m. This reduced the total sample size from 2,561 to 2,015 (82%). When this subset was analyzed in the same manner as the 2,561 women, there was little difference between the fitted trajectories and group memberships, and all risk factor relationships remained significant (p<.001). This provides some reassurance that, whatever the missing data mechanisms that defined the composition of this subset compared with our analysis cohort, these did not materially affect our results.\nIn conclusion, the strategy of transforming residual cognitive performance scores to percentile ranks to reflect relative performance may be useful for bridging data when assessment protocols change."}]
