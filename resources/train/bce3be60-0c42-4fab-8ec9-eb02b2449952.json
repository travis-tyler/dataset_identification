[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The empirical replicability of task-based fMRI as a function of sample size, NeuroImage (2020), doi: https:// Abstract Replicating results (i.e. obtaining consistent results using a new independent dataset) is an essential part of good science. As replicability has consequences for theories derived from empirical studies, it is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying mechanisms influencing it. A popular tool for non-invasive neuroimaging studies is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the effect of underpowered studies is well documented, the empirical assessment of the interplay between sample size and replicability of results for task-based fMRI studies remains limited. In this work, we extend existing work on this assessment in two ways. Firstly, we use a large database of 1400 subjects performing four types of tasks from the IMAGEN project to subsample a series of independent samples of increasing size.\nSecondly, replicability is evaluated using a multi-dimensional framework consisting of 3 different measures: (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability.\nWe demonstrate not only a positive effect of sample size, but also a trade-off between spatial resolution and replicability. When replicability is assessed voxelwise or when observing small areas of activation, a larger sample size than typically used in fMRI is required to replicate results. On the other hand, when focussing on clusters of voxels, we observe a higher replicability. In addition, we observe variability in the size of clusters of activation between experimental paradigms or contrasts of parameter estimates within these."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, challenges related to replicability and reproducibility of scientific findings have been heavily debated in the literature (see for example Baker & Penny, 2016; Begley & Ioannidis, 2015; Collins & Tabak, 2014; Munaf\u00f2 et al., 2017) . In this paper, we focus on replicability of results from an fMRI data-analysis. While several different definitions exist (Plesser, 2018) , we use the definition of replicability given by Patil, Peng & Leek (2016) . A successful replication of an experiment entails obtaining consistent results when repeating the exact same experimental procedure and data analysis plan, using a new (independent) dataset obtained by a different experimenter. The topic of replicating scientific results has been addressed in several fields such as psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015) , biomedical sciences (Baker, 2015) or neurosciences (Poldrack et al., 2017) . In general, there are many factors which can lead to scientific results that cannot be replicated . Examples include poor study designs, low power due to small sample sizes (Ioannidis, 2005) , questionable research practices (John, Loewenstein & Prelec, 2012 ) and, in the neurosciences, a low signal-to-noise ratio (Button et al., 2013; Poldrack et al., 2017) combined with substantial variability in the analysis pipelines and the reporting of results (Carp, 2012) . The inability to replicate experimental results has major consequences for theories derived from these results.\nIncreased awareness of these problems has led to new initiatives that have been put forward in neuroscience literature. These include pre-registration (see e.g. and incentives to share raw data instead of results summarized by (thresholded) statistical maps or coordinates of peaks of activation (Pernet and Poline, 2015; Poline et al., 2012) . In case of pre-registration, authors are requested to register the study design, proposed methods and data analysis before data collection takes place. The manuscript is then reviewed and either rejected or accepted in principle (for example see Cortex 1 which accepts registered reports).\nThis reduces analytical flexibility and prohibits questionable ad hoc research practices in the phase of data-analysis. Sharing data not only promotes open science but it also creates the opportunity for other researchers to use previous data as pilot 1 https://www.elsevier.com/editors-update/story/peer-review/cortexs-registered-reports data in an a priori power analysis (Durnez et al., 2016; Mumford and Nichols, 2008) or in a meta-analysis ( Costafreda, 2009; Wager, Lindquist & Kaplan, 2007) .\nAlthough the importance of replicability is widely recognized, insight into the effect of (low) statistical power on the replicability of fMRI results is limited (Mumford, 2012; Thirion et al., 2007; Turner et al., 2018) . The relation between underpowered studies and the prevalence of false positive effects is theoretically well documented (see for example Ioannidis, 2005) . However, an empirical assessment of the relation between sample size and replicability in neuroimaging studies remains challenging. We identify three main causes. First, an extensive number of individual subjects are needed to effectively study the effect of sample size. Previous studies relied on subsampling from databases with a relatively limited number of subjects. For instance, in Thirion et al. (2007) and Pajula & Tohka (2016) the sample size ( ) was equal to 81 and 130 subjects respectively. More recently, large collaborations have been set up and have gathered large amount of data. Examples include the Human Connectome Project (Van Essen et al., 2013) with \u2248 1200, the UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., 2015) with \u2248 500.000 and the IMAGEN consortium (Schumann et al., 2010) with \u2248 2000. Second, an empirical assessment of the relation between replicability and sample size based on a single database is not conclusive. Therefore, independent empirical assessments using different databases and different investigators are necessary. Finally, lack of agreement on an exact definition for replicability (Peng, 2011; Pernet and Poline, 2015; Plesser, 2018) complicates conceptualization on how to measure replicability of fMRI data.\nIn this paper, we aim to extend the empirical assessment of task-based fMRI replicability. To this end, we aim not only to replicate results obtained by Thirion et al. (2007) and Turner et al. (2018) who studied replicability of fMRI results and its relation to sample size (amongst other predictors) but also extend the sample sizes under consideration using a subsampling method. This approach consists of sampling at random independent sets of subjects from the entire database and then incrementally increase the sample size. These groups are subsequently compared to measure replicability of fMRI results. Thirion et al. (2007) collected data on 81 subjects and observed reasonable replicability for a simple left-right button press contrast. In their work, replicability was conceptualized twofold. The first measurement used was voxelwise coherence/concordance (Genovese, Noll & Eddy, 1997; Liou et al., 2003 Liou et al., , 2006 between the test-statistics of independent replications to measure unconditional reliability and a Jaccard index to measure conditional reliability. The latter is a measurement of spatial overlap between thresholded images. Interestingly, the authors observed only a low to modest degree of reliability. In this paper, we study how generalizable the set of findings regarding coherence and (un)conditional testretest reliability are. To do so, we use a different data set from the IMAGEN project (with = 1400). As this database contains more subjects than those previously used, we can assess replicability in larger sample sizes.\nSecond, we further extend the empirical assessment by studying an additional measure of replicability (i.e. stability) for task-based fMRI. This is needed as results of an fMRI data-analysis can be summarized by features such as peaks or clusters of activation. Furthermore, Roels, Bossier, Loeys & Moerkerke (2015) demonstrate the need to extend methodological research with measurements regarding the variability of the main characteristics of these features (see also Qiu, Xiao, Gordon & Yakovlev, 2006 for a similar argumentation in gene selection). Main characteristics could be the size or the number of the selected clusters of voxels. Methods where the results show high variability regarding these characteristics are less stable indicating a lower replicability. For example, a specific cluster could be selected in different replications though its size may vary substantial. To assess stability, we focus on clusters of voxels as the main feature of interest.\nTo summarize, we conceptualize replicability by measuring (un)conditional test-retest reliability, coherence and stability between independent replications created through a subsampling approach, using a large database."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To study the interplay between sample size and replicability, we repeatedly subsample subjects from a large database to create sets of independent groups with a given sample size. Results of the analysis of these groups are then compared to assess replicability.\nIn this section, we first describe the database and the various single-subject preprocessing steps that are performed to obtain the data from which to subsample. We use six contrasts based on the following experimental paradigms: perform a cognitive task, watch angry faces, participate in a monetary incentive delay task and in a Stop signal task. We then focus on the subsampling scheme which is used to create independent pairs of group analyses. Next, we discuss these analyses and finally describe our measurements to quantify the replicability of fMRI results. In order of discussion, these are test-retest reliability, coherence and stability. Within these, we distinguish between two categories of measurements. The first one is not conditional on any particular threshold chosen for statistical significance. We use the term \"unconditional\" here to stress that our measurement does not depend on a chosen criterion for thresholding. The second is a conditional assessment, during which thresholded images are used to measure replicability. In this case, results potentially depend on the criteria chosen to threshold the images. Within the latter, we also focus on both voxels and clusters.\nThe code of the sampling procedure, analysis and figures of this paper together with the processed results (as R objects) to reproduce figures are available at:\nhttps://github.com/NeuroStat/replicability_fmri.

For this paper, we used fMRI data of adolescents aged between 13 and 15 years, acquired across several research centers on 3 tesla scanners from multiple manufactures. The data are stored centrally at the Neurospin 2 center (Paris).\nPre-processing and single subject statistical analyses were performed by the consortium using SPM8 3 (Statistical Parametric Mapping: Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) for the cognitive task and SPM12 4 for the other tasks.\ni."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive task", "text": "For the first contrast, we use the same data and hence identical scanning protocol and pre-processing steps as those described in Bossier et al.

In this assessment, participants had to perform a series of cognitive tasks. The total series contained up to 10 type of tasks. We restrict our analysis to two tasks: reading sentences in silence (LANGUAGE) and solving math subtractions (MATH). In the latter, single digits (0-9) were presented and had to be subtracted from a double digit between 11-20. The design of the experiment was a fast-event related design where each of these two type of trials were presented for 10 times with a probabilistic inter-stimulus interval of on average 3 seconds (see .

As the total sample size per study will be up to 700 subjects (more details below), we assured the data quality via a qualitative visual check and a quantitative check on the number of voxels with a measured response value.\nSubjects who had no data in more than 4% of the median number of voxels over all subjects were excluded from further analysis. This resulted in 87 subjects being removed from the database for this contrast (the total number of available subjects is 1400)."}, {"section_title": "ii.

Monetary incentive delay (MID) task\nIn this task, participants were presented with sequences of cues, targets and a feedback phase. The cue indicated a possible amount of gain the subjects could win.\nThis could be a small, big or no win. They were instructed to respond when the target was presented (approx. 4 sec. after the cue) after which they received feedback (approx. 1.5 sec later) about the win or loss of the trial. The fMRI sequence of 300 volumes contained 144 trials with an inter-stimulus interval of 2.2 seconds. We have two contrasts of interest using this task. The first is the average effect of participants receiving feedback of a success without a gain (Hit No Gain Note that we do not assess the Stop process as is usually done by including a contrast with a successful Go (e.g. Stop Failure > Go Success).

Pre-processing.\nBOLD time series for each participant were recorded using echoplanar imaging with an isotropic voxel size of 3.4 mm and a repetition time of 2.2 seconds. For each participant, a number of volumes (depending on the task) were obtained, together with a T1-weighted structural image used for registration. The parameters of the latter were based on the ADNI-protocols 5 .\nThe pre-processing carried out at the Neurospin center included slice-timing correction, movement correction, coregistration of the functional images to the segmented T1-weighted structural images, non-linear warping of the images into MNI space using a custom EPI template and spatial smoothing of the signal with a 5 mm Gaussian kernel to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, reduce the effects of residual misalignment and meet the conditions for the use of parametric statistics such as those in SPM (Imagen fMRI data analysis methods, revision2, July 2010).\nSingle subject statistical analyses were performed at each voxel using univariate general linear models (GLM) with all experimental tasks (depending on the four paradigms). For the cognitive task, 18 estimated movement parameters were included as covariates in the design matrix (these correspond to 3 rotations, 3 regular, 3 quadratic and 3 cubic translations, 3 translations shifted 1 TR before, and 3 translations shifted 1 TR later). For the other three tasks, 21 additional columns (corresponding to short and long term movement effects) were added to account for estimated movements. A standard autoregressive [AR(1)] noise model was estimated to account for temporal correlation in the time series."}, {"section_title": "b. Sampling procedure and group analyses", "text": "We use two general sampling procedures to assess replicability: the first to measure test-retest reliability and stability and the second to measure coherence.\nThe first is obtained through pairwise comparisons of the results of group analyses.\nNote that results for group analyses are based on statistical parametric maps (SPMs) containing the test statistic (e.g. t-values) in each voxel. Thresholded SPMs are binary images where 1 corresponds to a voxel being statistically declared significant and 0 otherwise.\nTo obtain the independent replications, we start by sampling = 10 subjects at random from the entire database into set A. Next, we sample = 10 from the remaining (1400 \u2212 10) subjects at random into set B. We fit the group level models and perform statistical inference as described below. The resulting non-thresholded SPMs, together with the thresholded SPMs, are saved and this sampling process is repeated for a total of 50 times. In a next step, we repeat the sampling process, but increase the number of participants in each set by 10. This process continues until we reach a maximum of = 700 subjects per set. In total, we thus generate 3500"}, {"section_title": "comparisons between two independent replications (A & B).", "text": "To measure coherence, results for more than 2 group analyses are compared.\nTherefore, we obtain as many independent subsets of subjects as possible from the total database within each sample size.

This is the maximum sample size for this measurement as we need at least 3 subsets. We iterate the sampling procedure at each sample size 50 times.\nThe second level group analysis for each sampled group of subjects consists of fitting a linear mixed model in each voxel. This allows us to model within-and between-subject variability separately, and was performed using FLAME1 (Woolrich et al., 2009 ) from the FSL (RRID:SCR_002823) package (Smith et al., 2004) . After estimating the parameters of interest in the group model, we obtain the SPMs. These t-images are used for assessing unconditional replicability.\nTo measure conditional replicability, we threshold the image while apply a correction for multiple testing. The choice depends on our feature of selection. When focusing on voxels, we apply a voxelwise correction where the false discovery rate is controlled at level 0.05 using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) . When features of interest are clusters, we first define a cluster forming threshold at Z = 2.3, then use a 26-voxel neighbourhood search algorithm (default values) and finally control the family wise error rate at 0.05 using the Gaussian Random Field theory (Friston et al., 1994) . Note however that in prior work, Woo et al. (2014) argue to use more conservative cluster forming thresholds to ensure valid family-wise error rate control."}, {"section_title": "c. Measures for assessing replicability i. (Un)conditional test-retest reliability", "text": "To assess unconditional test-retest reliability, we measure the similarity between two non-thresholded SPMs using the Pearson product-moment coefficient ( ) for the correlation between the t-images of study A and study B.\nConditional test-retest reliability is measured using the percent overlap of activation (Maitra, 2010) . This measure is an adaptation of the Dice similarity index (Dice, 1945) or S\u00f8rensen similarity coefficient (S\u00f8rensen, 1948) . Let , represent the number of statistically significant voxels from the intersection between image A and B, the amount of statistically significant voxels in image A and the amount of statistically significant voxels in image B. The proportion of overlap , in two images is then defined as:\nThis measure focusses on the spatial pattern of activation in thresholded SPMs and ranges from 0 (no overlap of activation) to 1 (perfect overlap).\nNote that we require at least one voxel declared significant in either image A or B.\nFurthermore, , may be confounded by the proportion of voxels declared active in both images. In one extreme, if all voxels from both image A and B are declared statistically significant, then the overlap will be perfect. Hence, the effect of the sample size on , may be different depending the threshold for significance. A demonstration of this effect is given in a numerical simulation in the appendix. To deal with this possible confounding effect, we also apply different criteria to determine statistical significance of the voxels, using a FDR control at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2 for the cognitive contrast. Furthermore, we stress that results obtained by this measure are conditional on the chosen threshold for significance.\nIn addition, one can also expect the effect of sample size to be different depending on the amount of true activation. Furthermore, as increases, so does the proportion of voxels classified as statistically significant. To circumvent this issue, we run a second procedure for the cognitive contrast (as an additional check) to calculate , in which we condition on the proportion of voxels being classified as active as opposed to the chosen threshold for significance. This is referred to as adaptive thresholding. In this procedure, the total number of voxels to be classified as statistically significant is set a-priori, in this case as 20% of the total number of masked voxels. We then adapt the significance thresholding level for each group level analysis so that the percentage of significant voxels matches this target percentage. The variable of interest remains the overlap between images ( , ) while increasing the sample size. By adapting the level of threshold for significance within each group analysis, we can check whether we obtain similar response curves as the regular analysis. Although this is not a valid inference procedure (the type I error rate will be higher than 5%), this procedure allows us to remove the effect of the proportion of significant voxels (which increases with sample size). In other words, this strategy allows us to assess the effect of the sample size on the delineation of spatial activation in replication contexts, irrespective of the varying proportion of voxels classified as significant."}, {"section_title": "ii.

Stability", "text": "Our third measure of interest probes the stability of fMRI results (Roels et al., 2015) .\nIn this paper, we focus on clusters of voxels as the main feature of interest to describe the relation between sample size and stability. The latter is expressed in terms of variability of outcome metrics, where an increased variability indicates less stable results and is therefore an indication for lower replicability.\nWe describe and quantify stability using several metrics. First, we measure the size (in absolute number of voxels) of the clusters that are classified as significant. We do the same for the largest cluster in each study expressed as the proportion of total masked voxels. These metrics are obtained from the same sampling framework as described above (section 2.b).\nNext, we measure the count of total, unique and overlapping clusters when comparing two independent replications. We use two definitions of overlapping cluster: a lenient and a conservative one. In the first, a cluster is replicated as soon as one voxel from a given cluster overlaps with a voxel from a cluster in the corresponding replication. In the second, a cluster is replicated if at least 50% of the voxels in a given cluster overlaps with a cluster in the corresponding replication. To see how much overlap there is between clusters, we also calculate the proportion of overlapping clustered voxels in both replications. Finally, we measure the variability of the number of clusters that are declared significant as well as the variability of the cluster size (in number of connected voxels). Results are more stable when the variability is low.\nAn overview of all measurements, their category, and the corresponding feature selection for fMRI results, is given in Table 2 .

We observe better replicability for tasks such as solving math equations, watching angry faces and the monetary incentive delay task (at least for one contrast). A lower replicability is associated with the Stop signal contrasts. For the latter, a higher statistical power (i.e. sample size) is needed. It is therefore impossible to provide an absolute description of the replicability of fMRI results. The results presented here will inevitable depend on the experimental paradigm and contrast. Our results do demonstrate that replicability for any experimental paradigm/contrast generally increases with sample size.\nIn Figure 2 , we present the unconditional test-retest reliability of voxelwise inference of independent replications of fMRI results against increasing sample size for all paradigms. We observe a median (over all resampling iterations) between respectively suggesting asymptotically approaching 1 for these tasks. However, for both contrasts of the Stop signal task, we observe a maximum median value of the correlation of 0.86 = 700), suggesting a higher sample size is needed.\nIn Figure 3 (all contrasts) and 4 (only for the MATH > LANGUAGE contrast), we plot the test-retest reliability conditional on the chosen threshold for significance against increasing sample size. First, we fix the false discovery rate at 0.05 and retain that rate over all sample sizes ( Figure 3 ). As expected, the overlap increases with the sample size. However, we need at least = 200 to observe a range of Furthermore, since the overlap is conditional on the chosen threshold for significance, we also investigated the same measurement when controlling the FDR at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2 using the MATH > LANGUAGE contrast. We observe a main effect where liberal thresholds correspond to slightly higher values for the overlap over the entire range of . Figure A .7 in the appendix shows the effect of varying FDR thresholds, with the overall trends being very similar to those in of the cognitive task in Figure 3 . Figure 4 shows results for the adaptive thresholding strategy (focussing on the cognitive task), where the number of significant voxels in each test is restricted to 20% of the total number of masked voxels. As expected, the overlap at the lowest sample sizes is higher compared to the previous setting. For instance, the median omega equals 0.303 for = 20 (with a median uncorrected threshold of -\u2264 0.156).\nAgain, we observe a gradually increasing overlap with increasing sample size and a maximum median of = 0.794 at = 700 (median threshold -\u2264 0.00001). These results suggest that a high number of subjects is needed to replicate the voxelwise spatial shape of activation.\nThe final measurement to assess replicability of voxelwise inference is the coherence ( ) of fMRI results ( Figure 5 ). We compare results of different images that are all thresholded such that the FDR remains constant at 0.05. As with the previous measurements, increases with increasing sample size. We observe a median coherence \u2265 0.80 when = 180 for both the cognitive and faces task. The maximum median for the faces task, (Muggeo, 2003) . Fitting this model on the observed values for for the cognitive task yields a break-point at \u2248 60. Under 60, an increase of 10 subjects in the group analysis is associated with an average improvement of 0.129 , while above 60 this becomes 0.005 per 10 subjects. Note that for the cognitive, faces and MID (Hit No Win) task, the effect of sample size seems to reach a plateau below 1. Also, we observe a low variability between the different estimates of from all the resampling runs for each sample size.\nMoving from the voxelwise dimension to the cluster dimension, Figure 6 shows the stability of fMRI results for the MATH > LANGUAGE contrast. To condense the amount of results, we refer to the appendix for figures containing the results of the other contrasts. Generally, the sample size to response curves are similar.\nDifferences are mainly observed in the absolute values.\nFirst, we observe a convergence in the size and number of clusters as the sample size increases. This is shown in panel A and E of Figure 6 . The average size (in number of voxels) of the significant clusters in a given fMRI data-analysis stabilizes or increases only marginally with sample size. Furthermore, we observe on average 1.02 significant clusters at = 700 (in only two analyses out of 100, we found an additional small significant cluster). Moreover, this single cluster corresponds on average to 31% of the masked brain (panel B from Figure 6 ). Interestingly, in some analyses at = 100 it is already possible to observe these large clusters. This is reflected in the gap in panel A and B of Figure 6 . Second, the variability on the number of clusters and their corresponding size at first increases with the sample size (panel C and D of Figure 6 ). However, for \u2265 100 in case of the number of clusters and \u2265 200 in case of the size of clusters, the variability then decreases again, which corresponds to a higher stability. The same trend is observed in the other contrasts. Third, as sample size increases, the average number of clusters that are observed in both the replications increases at first. It then converges to the average total number of significant clusters as the latter decreases to 1 significant cluster per analysis. This is true for both definitions of replicated clusters. When comparing these definitions, we observe that a higher sample size is needed to replicate clusters if at least 50% of a cluster has to be observed at the same location in a given replication. Furthermore, only for \u2265 50 do we observe a higher number of replicated versus non-replicated clusters. This is not the case when using a lenient For panel E, we calculate the total number of clusters and then split between the number of overlapping versus non-overlapping clusters. We separate between two definitions of overlapping clusters: at least one voxel is overlapping between both clusters (A) or at least 50% of both clusters are overlapping (B). Counts are averaged over the two replications. The curves are obtained by fitting a generalized additive model with cubic splines. In panel F, we look at the proportion of overlapping voxels in a cluster. Clusters of voxels converge to the same spatial location and shape as the sample size increases."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The primary aim of this paper was to replicate and extend previous empirical assessments of replicability of fMRI results. We used data from 1400 subjects from the IMAGEN project in a subsampling approach to investigate the role of sample size (i.e. essential to obtain sufficient statistical power). Participants were involved in four types of experimental paradigms (i.e. a cognitive task, watching angry faces, a monetary incentive delay task and a Stop signal paradigm). We used independent replications to assess replicability in multidimensional quantify. Furthermore, we quantified replicability using three evaluation measurements: (un)conditional testretest reliability, coherence and stability of fMRI results.\nFirst we observe variability in terms of the degree of replicability depending on the experimental paradigms and chosen contrast. An fMRI task resulting in larger areas of activation is associated with higher values on our measurements of replicability.\nWe hypothesize that more subjects are needed to obtain replicable results for experimental paradigms associated with small effect sizes and/or small areas of activation. Interestingly, previous research on activation reliability in the MID paradigm showed higher values for test-retest reliability in a large win condition (Wu et al., 2014) . In our study however, we observe higher values for replicability in the condition where participants receive no gain. In addition for the Stop signal task, we observe higher values for replicability in the Stop Failure > Stop Success condition compared to its reverse contrast. As pointed out by a reviewer, this is a surprising observation as successful stopping is associated with a relatively circumscribed neural circuit, while failing to stop is probably not. Since participants could fail to stop for many reasons (e.g. subject wanted to stop but responded too late or did not pay attention), we would expect more diverse activation patterns.\nWith respect to our various measurements of replicability, we note the following key observations. First, we show that the correlation between two images containing the test-statistics from a test and independent replication can be relatively high even at small sample sizes (e.g. lower than 70 subjects). This is consistent with earlier results of Turner et al. (2018) who observed values in the same range. Note that Sochat, Gorgolewski, Koyejo, Durnez & Poldrack (2015) also demonstrate relatively high correlations between test-statistics of thresholded SPMs. In this work, we thus extend this observation to complete images.\nA high test-retest reliability between full (i.e. non-thresholded) images is important for several applications in neuroimaging. In decoding studies using for instance multivariate pattern classifiers (Haxby, Connolly & Guntupalli, 2014) , the goal is not only to achieve a high prediction accuracy but also to evaluate the spatial patterns underlying the classification accuracy (Conroy, Walz & Sajda, 2013; Poldrack, Halchenko & Hanson, 2009 ). Our results suggest that replicability of these spatial patterns is likely to be acceptable.\nInterestingly, the replicability of thresholded images, using only binary values (i.e. activated or not) can be poor at common fMRI sample sizes (N \u2248 30). This is Next, even though the overlap between thresholded images can be poor, we observe a better performance in terms of coherence between independent replications. This is expected as coherence is measured using more than 2 replications (i.e. from 3 to 140), while overlap is measured using only pairs of images. Furthermore, the coherence is measured using both active and inactive voxels. Note that we observe lower values for the coherence than Thirion et al. (2007) . For instance, at \u2248 30 the median value = 0.80 in the latter, while we observe only a median = 0.504 at best at the same sample size. This difference may be due to the difference in type of cognitive task, experimental paradigms or statistical analysis. For instance, show how the coherence declines with more conservative thresholding.\nIndeed, while Thirion et al. (2007) used an uncorrected -\u2264 0.001 level for statistical significance, we corrected for multiple comparison at a false discovery rate of 0.05.\nFor larger sample sizes, this is substantially more conservative than thresholding at an uncorrected -\u2264 0.001.\nFinally, while replicability of individual voxels can be low at typical sample sizes, we observe a better performance when looking at clusters of voxels. Although initially, the variability of the number and size of clusters increases with increasing sample sizes, we have shown that it stabilizes for higher sample sizes. As can be expected, the number of non-replicable clusters is low if one uses a lenient definition of nonreplicable clusters. That is when at least one voxel from the cluster overlaps with a cluster in a given replication. If one considers a cluster only replicated if at least half of it is observed in a given replication, then more subjects are needed. This is true for any experimental paradigm. Moreover, these results potentially depend on the number and size of selected clusters. Small clusters of activation (or highly variable cluster sizes) are more prone to be non-replicable. Furthermore, it has been shown that parametric statistical methods relying on cluster-wise inference are associated with an inflated false positive rate (Eklund, Nichols & Knutsson, 2016) . For this reason, Eklund, Nichols & Knutsson (2016) suggest using non-parametric methods such as permutation testing (Brammer et al., 1997; Bullmore et al., 1999; Nichols & Holmes, 2002; Winkler, Ridgway, Webster, Smith & Nichols, 2014) . We have not investigated the effect of using these methods.\nIn this paper, we focused on the relation between replicability and statistical power and demonstrate potentially low voxelwise replicability due to low statistical power.\nHowever, a lack of replicability is not the only problem associated with low statistical power. There is (1) an increased probability of a positive research claim being false (Ioannidis, 2005) , (2) an overestimation of the reported effect sizes compared to the true effect size (Cremers, Wager & Yarkoni, 2017) and (3) an increased risk of missed effects (i.e. false negatives) which potentially induces publication bias (Acar et al., 2018; Rosenthal, 1979; Sterling, 1959) . Note that the most optimistic rate of missing contrasts in the fMRI literature is estimated to be 6/100 (Samartsidis et al., 2017) . However, this estimate is (1) based on one database and (2) corresponds to missing studies where no single effect in the entire masked brain is observed.\nAnother consequence of underpowered studies is the detection of some but not all true positive voxels within a single fMRI study. In other words, even with low power one is likely to find at least one significant voxel (Cremers et al., 2017) which is not sufficient for fMRI studies to be replicable.\nSeveral solutions to increase the sample size have been suggested (Cremers et al., 2017; Poldrack et al., 2017) . To begin with, it is advised to run power analyses at the design phase of fMRI studies. Some tools exist to calculate either the power to detect a true effect in a region of interest (Mumford and Nichols, 2008) or when designing a whole brain analysis (Durnez et al., 2016) . Second, data sharing initiatives such as NeuroVault 7 create the opportunity to pool data into metaanalyses (see Salimi-Khorshidi, Smith, Keltner, Wager & Nichols, 2009; Wager et al., 2007) or mega-analyses. By sharing data, it might be possible to increase the power of subsequent studies. Finally, if increasing the sample size is infeasible, it is possible to complement statistical analyses with sensitivity analyses (Wilke, 2012) .\nThe idea here is to iterate the statistical analysis but systematically remove and replace r subjects. The sensitivity can then be calculated using the percent overlap of activation. Another approach presented by Liou et al. (2003) and Liou et al. (2006) is to create so called \"reproducibility maps\" using multiple sessions or runs of the same participants in an experiment. . Although these researchers could reliably detect most peaks of activation when compared to longer scanning sequences, improved measurements of replicability can be expected with longer scanning sequences. This has been demonstrated in recent work by Nee (2018) who reported an increase of replicability of fMRI results with the duration (i.e. number of time points ) of the scanning sequence. An important research question is therefore the interaction between number of time points in the scanning sequence and sample size on replicability of fMRI results. Furthermore, the replicability of fMRI results will also depend on other factors such as the studied population, type of (cognitive) task, etc.\nIt is not unlikely to observe even more different response curves between the sample size and our measurements of replicability. For instance, there may be a higher replicability when using college-aged participants rather than adolescents.\nPotentially, adolescents are associated with a greater variability in terms of brain development. This in turn could influence replicability between sets of participants from the same age. In addition, as we only use the pre-processed data, we are not able to investigate the effect of design choices or various pre-processing steps on fMRI replicability. For these reasons, we are unable to provide an absolute number as a required sample size for task-based fMRI replicability.\nSecond, as data are anonymized before the start of our analysis we are unable to investigate the proportion of between-site variability. In the literature, there are mixed results regarding the influence of the scanner/site. In some studies, substantial between-site variability is observed (Rath et al., 2016) while in others only marginal variability is observed (Costafreda et al., 2007) . Furthermore, it has been shown that between-site reliability increases as the number of sessions increases (Friedman et al., 2008) . It should be noted that the influence of inter-site variability will be averaged out in our study as we sample subjects over all scanning sites. Therefore, our measurements of replicability could also change depending on the effect of betweensite variability on the ability to replicate results.\nThird, our results are based on only four experimental paradigms for which we did not explore all possible contrasts representing these paradigms Turner et al., 2018) . For instance, in the Stop signal paradigm, we were not able to include a contrast with a Go condition. Given the vast literature on this contrast, we hypothesize results will be better when isolating a Stop process. Furthermore, Thirion et al. (2007) observe variability in their reliability analysis related to the statistical model used in the group analysis. However, we compared current results to those obtained using ordinary least squares and did not observe substantial differences (results not shown).\nIn conclusion, we observe over experimental paradigms and contrasts an effect of sample size and differences between voxel and cluster level analyses in the ability to replicate fMRI results. To our knowledge, the latter has not been demonstrated before. We hope these results further foster designing fMRI studies with appropriate sample sizes and ultimately lead to more replicable scientific findings.
