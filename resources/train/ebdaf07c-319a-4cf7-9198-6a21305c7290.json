[{"section_title": "Modeling No-Tillage Adoption by Corn and Soybean Producers:", "text": "A Binary-Panel Regression Approach \u2022 No-till acreage has increased in recent years but many farmers use the practice intermittently \u2022 Off-farm benefits: cleaner water, cleaner air, and improved carbon sequestration. \u2022 On-farm benefits: soil moisture conservation, reduced erosion, increase soil organic matter, improved soil aggregate size and stability, etc. \u2022 Many of these benefits are fully realized only when no-till is used continuously over a period of years (Johnson et al., 2005). \u2022 Cross-sectional data ignores important elements of adoption (Cameron, 1999;Doss, 2006). \u2022 Panel data are needed to better understand the factors that influence adoption. \uf071 Objective: Identify and estimate the factors that influence field-level tillage decisions both between fields and within a given field over time. \u2022 Economic studies examine the adoption of conservation technology and specific practices but these are static: \uf0d8 Prokopy et al. JSWC 2008\uf0d8 Meta analysis: Baumgart-Getz et al. JEM 2012\u2022 Few economic studies examine no-till over time but these use aggregated data: \uf0d8 Schoengold, Ding, & Headlee AJAE 2015\u2022 Other studies: \uf0d8 Wilman JARE 2011: uses a theoretical model of adoption over time. \uf071 This is the first national study that uses field-level panel data to investigate adopters' attributes. The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) provides a 4 year snapshot of field-level no-till decisions. Data are constructed from machine codes (in the survey year) and operator recollection of previous no-till use. We use the subset of fields that planted either corn or soybeans in each year. \uf0d8 Corn -2010*, 2009, 2008, 2007\uf0d8 Soybeans-2012*, 2011, 2010, 2009 The random effects logit model allows estimation of static variables such as highly erodible land and drainage, in addition to time-varying factors such as weather and fuel costs. Precipitation: A one millimeter increase in precipitation in the month prior to planting significantly decreases the odds of no-till use by 0.2%. No-till works best under dry conditions (Soule et al. 2000;Ogle et al. 2012). Temperature: A one degree increase in temperature during the month prior to planting significantly increases the odds of no-till use by 7.7%. No-till works best on warm soils (Soule et al. 2000;Ogle et al. 2012). Diesel: An additional dollar increase in fuel prices increases the odds of no-till use by 21.2%. No-till requires fewer machine runs and therefore uses less fuel. Higher diesel prices may make no-till more attractive. Previous year's crop: When soybeans were planted in the prior year the odds of no-till use decrease by 50.2%. About 80% of fields are in a corn-soybean rotation. If the previous crop is soybeans it is likely that corn is the current crop. No-till is more likely to be used on soybeans than on corn fields (Wade et al., 2015). Increasing no-till acreage requires a better understanding of the economic drivers of sustained use. \u2022 Temporal factors influence tillage decisions and tillage use literature fails to account for the dynamic nature of adoption decisions. \u2022 The 4-year panel provides a richer understanding of attributes affecting no-till use. \uf0d8 Static variables such as climate, highly erodible land, land capability class, and drainage play an important role in no-till use. \uf0d8 Dynamic variables such as diesel prices, immediate weather also play a significant role in yearly tillage choices. \u2022 Preliminary findings for increasing no-till acres: \uf0d8 Programs that encourage sustained adoption could consider factoring in the changes in input prices that farmers observe into multi-year contracts.
