Biological productivity in the summer Vietnam boundary upwelling system in the western South China Sea, as in many coastal upwelling systems, is strongly modulated by wind. However, the role of ocean circulation 15 and mesoscale eddies has not been elucidated. Here we show a close spatio-temporal covariability between primary production and kinetic energy. High productivity is associated with high kinetic energy, which accounts for ~15% of the production variability. Results from a physical-biological coupled model reveal that the elevated kinetic energy and intensified circulation can be explained by the separation of the upwelling current system. The separated current forms an eastward jet into the interior South China Sea, and the associated southern gyre traps nutrient and favors 20 productivity. When separation is absent, the model shows weakened circulation and eddy activity, with ~21% less nitrate inventory and ~16% weaker primary productivity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The South China Sea (SCS) is a large semi-enclosed marginal sea located in the western Pacific Ocean (Fig. 1a) . It 25 is bordered by extensive continental shelves along the southern coast of China and northeastern Vietnam, and the Sunda Shelf south of Vietnam (Fig.1 ). It has a deep interior basin which can be as deep as 5000 m (Liu et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2007) . The SCS is predominantly controlled by the East Asian Monsoon. The wind is southwesterly from June to September, and northeasterly from November to March (Liu et al., 2002) . Because of efficient biological production, the interior SCS has low nutrient concentration in the euphotic zone, displaying a oligotrophic 30 condition (Wong et al., 2007) .\nCoastal upwelling is one of the most important processes for ocean productivity and fishery (Gruber et al., 2011) .\nDuring southwesterly monsoon, upwelling-favorable wind prevails along the southern coast of Vietnam over the complex topography (Fig. 1b) . The offshore Ekman transport drives surface divergence, and results in coastal upwelling of cold and nutrient-rich subsurface water. We refer this as the Vietnam Boundary Upwelling System 35 (VBUS). The VBUS is centered near ~109\u00b0 E between 14\u00b0 N and 17\u00b0 N along the coast (Loisel et al., 2017) .\nUpwelling in VBUS was confirmed by cruise (Dippner et al., 2006) and remote sensing observations (Kuo et al., 2000) .\nIn VBUS, the upwelling intensity is governed by the strength of the alongshore monsoon wind, as in other coastal upwelling systems such as the coastal upwelling systems of California and mid-Atlantic Bight (Gruber et al., 40 2011) . The VBUS upwelling strength is intense, and can result in surface cooling of 3~5 \u00b0C and an associated cold filament length of ~500 km . The VBUS is modulated by different climatic variations, such as the El Ni\u00f1o and Southern Oscillation (Dippner et al., 2006; Hein et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2003) , the Indian Ocean Dipole (Liu et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2009) , and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (Isoguchi and Kawamura, 2006; Liu et al., 2012) . 45\nThe nutrient balance and ecosystem in the VBUS are controlled by the El Ni\u00f1o variability which modulates the summer monsoon . During post-El Ni\u00f1o summer, the weakened southwesterly wind weakens the upwelling and reduces the upward nutrient flux (Xie et al., 2003) . In addition, Hein et al. (2013) proposed instead that productivity is controlled by lateral transport of nitrate in the VBUS. Liu et al. (2002) also highlighted the role of coastal jet located to south of Vietnam coast. They mentioned that jet-induced upwelling was 50 responsible for the nutrient influx. These contradictory conclusions in previous works motivate us to examine the VBUS ecosystem and its connection with circulation.\nEarly hydrodynamic observations revealed a northeastward coastal current over the southern shelf of Vietnam (Wyrtki, 1961) . The current separates and flows offshore at about 11 o N (Xu et al., 1982) . Xie et al. (2003) ascribed the jet separation to the strong wind jet off Vietnam due to orographic steering of the north-south running mountains. 55\nUsing an idealized reduced gravity model, Wang et al. (2006) highlighted vorticity input by wind-stress curl and vorticity advection by the basin circulation. Gan and Qu (2008) found that the separation was associated with an adverse pressure gradient induced by the topographic effects.\nThe separated jet produces cooling and results in biannual SST variation in the SCS (Xie et al., 2003) . The offshore jet also appears to advect water with high chlorophyll (CHL) to the interior of the central SCS (Chen et al., 60 2014; Loisel et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2004) . While the importance of circulation to the VBUS biogeochemical system has been noted in some previous studies (Dippner et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2003) , the detailed processes are unclear. To what extent is the ecosystem in VBUS modulated by local circulation?\nHow does the coastal jet modulate productivity? How much does the local circulation contribute to production?\nStudying biological production and its coupling with physical processes in the VBUS will help to answer these 65 questions and further improve the understanding of boundary upwelling system. Such a study will also shed light on the ecosystem dynamic in the SCS as an oligotrophic marginal sea. Here we analyze the complex dynamics of the VBUS using a physical-biological coupled numerical model system, as well as remote sensing data and in situ observations. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, model configuration, numerical experiments, observed data, and 70 statistical method used in this study are described. In Sect. 3, we analyze the remote sensing data and validate the model. Model results from both the standard run and the sensitivity experiment are presented. In Sect. 4, the dynamical processes are analyzed.

The model is used in the operational Taiwan Strait Nowcast\\Forecast system (TFOR), which successfully provides multi-purpose ocean forecasts (Jiang et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2013) . In this study, the model grid is modified to cover the whole SCS domain and part of the North-Western Pacific with a grid resolution of 1/10 degree (Fig. 1a) .

In summer, the surface CHL has low concentration of <0.1 mg m -3 in the central SCS basin.\nBy contrast, the CHL is more than fivefold (>0.5 mg m -3\n) along the southern Vietnamese coast. The high CHL water 165 appears to extend offshore following the coastal jet to the interior SCS. The jet overshoots after separating from the coast and bifurcates into a northeastward current and a quasi-stationary anti-cyclonic eddy (Fig. 2a) . Centered at ~11\u00b0 N near the tip of Vietnamese coast, high KE (>1.0 m -2 s -2 ) appears near the coast. The high variability of CHL coincides with KE into the interior SCS, implying the contribution from the jet (Fig. 2b) .\nThe box-averaged (magenta box in Fig. 2b ) time-series of monthly UI, KE and NPP are shown in Fig. 3a -c; they 170 show seasonal and interannual variations. KE generally peaks in summer months, while NPP has a biannually signal, i.e., peaks in summer and winter, as well as complex non-seasonal signals. Unsurprisingly, UI dominates about half (R 2 =0.4548 for UI solely) of the total variability in NPP, which is consistent with studies in other wind-driven upwelling systems (Gruber et al., 2011) . There are clear positive contributions to the biological production from both UI and KE. When KE is considered, additional ~15% of variability in NPP is explained (R 2 =0.6046, p<0.01). 175\nFurther investigation with 8-day mean NPP, UI, and KE after 60-day high pass filter also shows a similar and significant relationship (despite the correlation is lower, R 2 =0.1873, p<0.01, not presented in figures), demonstrating that the co-variation is robust not only for seasonal and longer time scales, but also for synoptic scale.\nTo further illustrate the modulation in the ecosystem by circulation, the high-NPP-anomaly (HNA) and low-NPP-anomaly (LNA) periods of currents were composited according to a non-seasonal NPP anomaly. The 180 climatological signal was firstly removed from the summertime NPP, yielding the non-seasonal NPP anomaly. The thresholds for HNA and LNA are defined as (above) 75% and (below) 25% percentile of the NPP anomaly, respectively. The velocity and direction for LNA, HNA and the normal state (i.e., neither LNA nor HNA) are respectively depicted in Fig. 4a -c, as well as the ADT difference between HNA and LNA (Fig. 4d) . A student t-test suggests that the three circulation patterns are significantly (p<0.01) different. In contrast to the familiar separation 185 and offshore jet pattern (Fig. 2a and Fig. 4c ), the LNA circulation tends to flow along the coast without separation (Fig. 4a) . On the other hand, the HNA circulation (Fig.4b) shows a clear separated jet and anticyclonic recirculating pattern south of the jet near 8.5\u00b0 N, similar to the pattern seen during normal years (Fig. 4c) ; the flow speed is ~20% stronger than that of the normal state. Near the separation point, the HNA jet is more dissipated and slightly weakened compared with the LNA coastal jet. The KE averaged within the magenta box (Fig.2b) patterns is consistent with a dipolar ADT difference, by which a westward (inverse to the jet) pressure gradient force anomaly is imparted to the flow (Fig. 4d) , which is responsible for the jet separation process (Batchelor, 1967; Gan and Qu, 2008) .

This may in part be attributed to overestimation of retrieved NPP 200 near the coast (e.g. Loisel et al., 2017) . Off the coast, the model simulates well the crossshore gradient of productivity. The gradient is generally high in areas influenced by the jet.\nTime series of modeled SST, surface KE and NPP, averaged over the magenta box (Fig.2b) , are compared with observations in Fig. 6 . Due in part to the realistic surface forcing and high resolution used, our model can reproduce the physical and biological parameters in the VBUS. The biannual signals in all three quantities agree reasonably 205 well with the observations. At interannual time scales, during the 2010 El Ni\u00f1o event for example, monsoon was weaker (Fig. 3a) , SST was warmer, and the KE was reduced. These features are simulated well, although the production drawdown is slightly weaker than the observation and the simulated SST under-estimates amplitude of the observed SST annual cycle by ~1.0 \u00b0C. For the surface current and productivity, our model shows excessive KE and insufficient production during winter, but the model-observation discrepancy is less notable in other seasons. 210\nThe overestimated KE is partially contributed by the ageostrophic (e.g., Ekman) components in our modeled surface current. Nevertheless, we can conclude that our model reasonably reproduced the temporal variability in the VBUS.\nIn addition, vertical profiles of the simulated NO3 and CHL, as two fundamental components of marine ecosystem, are compared with observations (Fig. 7) . The modeled NO3 generally reflects the oligotrophic condition near the surface and the nutricline approximately at 50 m. Below the nutricline, the NO3 profile shows moderateour model well simulates the concentration, not only at surface but also in the deep layer. Subsurface CHL maxima appears at ~35 m, which is somewhat shallower than that in the observation. Both the modeled and observed CHL concentrations have large range from 0 to >1.0 mg m -3 in the subsurface CHL maxima. This reflects the large spatial variability in CHL. 220\nFollowing the analysis in Sect. 3.1, the multi-variable regression analysis on the model outputs were also conducted. The modeled NPP presents a phase lag with respect to the UI and KE variation. When NPP is lagged for one month, the correlation is 0.752 with a p-value of 0.0214, suggesting a significant regulation of the physical forcing to the productivity. Additionally, the composites of the HNA, LNA, and normal scenarios (Fig. 8) based on model outputs show contrasts among scenarios comparable to those in the observed cases in Fig. 4, further  225 suggesting the reasonability of the model simulation.\nIn summary, one could find that our model performs reasonably in reproducing the key spatio-temporal features in the hydrodynamics and ecosystem of VBUS. Inevitably, some discrepancies exist, which are less evident in the summer months. Possible reasons for these discrepancies include insufficient horizontal resolution, unrealistic parameterizations (e.g., turbulent mixing), inaccuracy in the atmospheric forcing, or uncertainties in the ecosystem 230 parameters. Nevertheless, considering current focus are to investigate the positive correlation between the productivity and the circulation, which was captured by the model (Fig. 8) , these shortcomings are accepted."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Model Results", "text": "Modeled circulation and potential density from the multi-summer average are presented in Fig. 9a-d , with sea surface height overlaid. Consistent with previous studies, the coastal current flows northward along the shelf (Hein 235 et al., 2013) . The current also dissipates freshwater from the Mekong River, while the water seldom spreads away from the coast. The coastal current veers at ~11\u00b0 N, directs offshore and then separates, forming the quasi-stationary anticyclone centered at ~110\u00b0 E, 9\u00b0 N. Near the core of the anticyclone, vigorous vertical motion near surface can be found, implying submesoscale processes in play. Near 108\u00b0 E, intensive onshore flow ascends on the slope. The high-density bottom water outcrops at 107 \u00b0 E, rejoining the coastal water and directing north, thus forming a circuit. 240\nThe biogeochemical variables reveal that the ecosystem is largely controlled by the circulation (Fig. 9e-h ).\nLateral nutrient gradient appears at the periphery of the anticyclone, which is characterized with depressed nitrate isosurface in the core and domed isosurface due to the upwelling and river injection near the coast (Fig. 9e) .\nStimulated by the river-injected and locally upwelled nutrient near the coast, primary production (PP) shows a surface maximum of >30 mg C m -3 d -1 (Fig. 9g ). The water with high production is then advected offshore by the jet 245 (Fig. 9h) , leading to an offshore bloom patch in curved shape which is familiar in the Vietnam coast (e.g., Fig. 5c ).\nThe jet also conveys the water with high particulate organic carbon (POC) offshore. The distribution of POC is somewhat deeper and more dissipated than that of high PP water, suggesting the vertical sinking and lateral transport processes (Nagai et al., 2015) . Remineralization of POC results in a subsurface ammonium maximum at ~50 m (Fig. 9f ) consistent with the study in SCS (Li et al., 2015) . Part of the ammonium could then fuel nitrification 250 and production, while the rest rejoins the circulation with the upwelling water in the bottom Ekman layer.

The contribution of the circulation is distinct from the major coastal upwelling systems, where the offshore transport by the mean current appears to suppress the production by reducing the nearshore nutrient inventory (Gruber et al., 2011; Nagai et al., 2015) . 260\nComparing the ecosystems in LNA and HNA (Fig. 10) , the following cycle can be deduced: (1) The upwelled and riverine input nutrient (majorly inorganic) stimulate high production near the Vietnam coast. (2) The produced organic matters are transported offshore by the jet; The water has high CHL (e.g., Fig. 2a ) and high organic matters in the euphotic zone; (3) A significant portion of the nutrient (majorly in organic form) is transported back to the south of VBUS by the westward recirculation. The quasi-stationary rotating anticyclone impedes further offshore 265 leakage of the nutrients (Fig. 10) . (4) The trapped organic matters are remineralized, forming the subsurface maxima of ammonium and replenishing the nitrate by nitrification. Afterwards, the nutrients are upwelled by bottom Ekman pumping and wind-induced upwelling, and finally rejoin in the local biogeochemical cycle. The speed of this cycle plays a significant role in controlling the productivity."}, {"section_title": "Dynamic Analysis 270", "text": "By controlling the available nutrients, the circulation largely determines the speed of the biogeochemical cycle. The influence of the circulation is further elucidated below. Table 1 summarizes the difference of the ecosystems in the standard run and NO_ADV experiment. The NO_ADV experiment can be regarded as an extreme case where the circulation shows very weak tendency of separation (also see Fig. S1 ). The horizontal and vertical fluxes of nitrate in three scenarios are also depicted in Fig. 11 . 275\nIn the VBUS, the availability of nutrients principally controls the productivity (Hein et al., 2013) . Considering a quasi-steady state of nutrient in a coastal region, river-injected and upward inputted nutrient should be counterbalanced by vertical export production and lateral exchanges. The lateral exchanges include both advection and diffusion, while it was pointed out that horizontal mixing is one or two order-of-magnitude lower than that of horizontal advection (Lu et al., 2015) . Hence, as a sink term, the lateral exchanges are determined mostly by the 280 advective fluxes normal to the boundary of the predefined box. Diagnostic also suggests a dominance role of advection process in the vertical over mixing. Given the fact the standard run and NO_ADV experiment has the same riverine input and similar export flux, one could infer that the difference between two model cases is largely due to the different lateral transports and upwelled fluxes of nutrients.\nIn the LNA (Fig. 4a and Fig. 8a ) and also in the NO_ADV experiment (Fig. S1) , the circulation pattern switches 285 to the along-isobath pattern, which modifies the local biogeochemical cycle. More nutrient is transported northward and offshore out of VBUS and never comes back, leading to a reduction of nutrient (Fig. 11) . This effect can be demonstrated by cross-section nutrient flux across 109\u00b0 E section. The more nutrient leakage, the less westward nutrient flux across this section. In NO_ADV run, the westward flux of nitrate is significantly reduced by 36.2% (Table 1 ). The reduction of nutrient is accompanied with suppressed the upward nutrient flux (-46.5 %) near the 290 shelf edge (~100 m). As a consequence of more leakage and less upwelling influx, the nitrate reservoir and new production are significantly reduced by 20.7 % and 21.9 %, significantly inhibiting the primary production process (15.7 %, Table 1 ). Other ecosystem constituents decrease to a limit degree, such as -2.6% for ammonium, and -3.0%\nfor DOC. This interpretation is further supported by the post-El Ni\u00f1o scenario. In 2010, more significant suppression occurs in the vertical nutrient flux (-99.6%), while the horizontal fluxes also respond to decrease. Due to the 295 drawdown in the wind-induced upwelling and recirculation (Table 1) , the production is extremely low in summer 2010 (Fig. 3c) .\nThe more intensive separation, the larger KE in VBUS, and vice versa. The accelerated coastal current is also associated with intensified cross-isobath transport by bottom Ekman effect (Gan et al., 2009 ). Hence, high KE is linked to accelerated biogeochemical cycle. Combining all the effects, the intensified circulation is a condition 300 favorable for the nutrient inventory, and hence the productivity, especially during relatively low KE scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Via analyzing the summertime remote sensing data in the VBUS, a tight spatio-temporal covariation between the ecosystem and near-surface circulation was revealed. The water with high kinetic energy appeared to coincide with high CHL variability. Statistical analysis suggested that high level of productivity was associated with high level of 305 circulation intensity, which accounted for ~15% of the variability in productivity. Elevated kinetic energy and intensified circulation were related with the separation of the upwelling current system. Especially, in the lowproductivity scenarios, the circulation pattern shifts from the intensive separation pattern to a moderate alongshore non-separated pattern.\nTo further investigate the linkage between the circulation and the ecosystem, a physical-biological coupled 310 model was configurated. Numerical experiment was designed to reproduce the non-separated circulation pattern, while maintaining the external monsoon forcing. The modeled results were validated favorably compared with the remote sensing and in situ observation data. In particular, model reproduced the positive contribution from the circulation intensity to the productivity. Inspection into the model results highlighted the circulation's role in local biogeochemical cycle. As the 315 schematic diagram in Fig. 12 , the separated circulation and resultant quasi-stationary anticyclone were favorable for the recirculation of nutrients. During non-separation scenarios, the nutrients northward transported by the alongshore current would never come back, leading to a nutrient leakage. The nutrient leakage further induced the feedback summarized in Fig. 12b , which could reduce the nitrate inventory by ~21% and the NPP by ~16% in the experiment representative for very weak separation. The weakened coastal current was also associated with reduced bottom 320\nEkman transport, hence further reducing the vertical flux of nutrient. As the KE increasing, the biogeochemical cycle was accelerated. This resulted in the positive correlation to the productivity.\nThis finding provides a new insight into the complex physical-biological coupling in the Vietnam coastal upwelling system. Moreover, this understanding could help to predict the future reaction of productivity in the SCS.\nAs revealed by Yang and Wu (2012) , the summertime near-surface circulation of SCS had experienced a long-term 325 trend of being more energetic, characterized with intensified separation and recirculation in the VBUS (see their figure 9 ). Whether this long-term trend of circulation will also induce potential trend in ecosystem in response to future climate changes is a topic of common interests, which merits further investigation.
