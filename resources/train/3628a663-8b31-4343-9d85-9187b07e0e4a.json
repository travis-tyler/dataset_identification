Doctorate recipients who report Hispanic or Latino heritage, regardless of racial designation, are counted as Hispanic or Latino, and as of 2013, those who do not answer the Hispanic or Latino ethnicity question are counted as \"ethnicity not reported.\" Respondents who indicate that they are not Hispanic or Latino and indicate a single race are reported in their respective racial groups, except for those indicating Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, who are included in \"other race or race not reported\" for confidentiality purposes. Beginning in 2001, respondents who are not Hispanic or Latino and who indicate more than one race are reported in the category \"more than one race.\" Data for this category were not collected before 2001. Before 2001, respondents who are not Hispanic or Latino and who indicate more than one race were categorized as \"other or unknown.\" For 2001 and later data, the \"other or unknown\" category includes doctorate recipients who indicated that they were not Hispanic or Latino and either did not respond to the race item or reported their race as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.
