From bioecological [1] and life course [2] perspectives, SE development is a neurodevelopmental process influenced by interacting biological, social, cultural, neighborhood, and other environmental factors beginning before conception, continuing during pregnancy, and developing throughout childhood. Well-developed SE capacities and early interventions that support their development [3] [4] [5] [6] facilitate school readiness, [7] ongoing learning and academic success, [8] longer term employment and income, and improved physical health, [9] mental health, [5] and social outcomes. [6] Similarly, SE problems in early childhood are associated with a wide range of poorer life outcomes such as disruptions in family life, [10] poorer mental health, [11] early initiation of sexual behaviors, [12] poorer academic [13] and employment outcomes, [14] and criminal behaviors. [6] From infancy through childhood, warm, nurturing, and secure relationships with parents or other caregivers are needed for optimal SE development. Interrelated factors interfering with or disrupting SE development include perinatal factors such as preterm birth, [15] maternal stressors and depression, maternal cognitive dysfunction associated with depression, [16] family poverty, [10, 17] family violence, [18] and a wide variety of adverse childhood experiences. [19] The prevalence of SE problems in minority children is higher than among majority children in some studies [20] ; however, poverty is a critical confounding variable also associated with SE problems. [21] Such disrupting factors create toxic stress [22] and increase biologic effects of adversity in the developing child. Underlying physiologic processes include dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [23] and neurological changes, particularly in the hippocampus and limbic system. [24] Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, abnormally reduced neurotropic factor levels, and monoaminergic system dysfunctions together seem to be associated with chronic stress exposure and major depression. Chronic stress and depressive symptoms are associated with structural brain changes (i.e., loss of dendritic spines and synapses, reduced dendritic arborization, and diminished glial cells of the hippocampus). [25] This study was designed to examine socio-demographic; maternal behavioral health, mental health, and intelligence; and child developmental and behavioral characteristics associated with maternal-reported child SE problems in 2-year-old children living in an urban-suburban community in the southern United States. We previously reported characteristics associated with SE problems in 1-year olds and noted different patterns in black and white children. However, in both races maternal psychological distress and parenting stress were associated with SE problems at 1 year of age. [26] We hypothesized that mother-reported socioemotional problems in 2-year olds are impacted by maternal socio-demographics, positively associated with maternal behavioral health and mental health problems, negatively associated with child neurocognitive development at 1 and 2 years of age, and negatively associated with child anthropometric measurements (birth to 1 year). We further postulated that the effect often attributed to race on child SE development is reduced when controlling for these factors. [27] 2. Methods"}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "This study uses data from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) study, a prospective cohort study that enrolled 1503 healthy pregnant women during their second trimester of pregnancy.

Women were excluded if they had chronic disease requiring medication (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell disease), known complications of pregnancy (e.g., complete placenta previa, oligohydramnios), or had plans to deliver at a hospital not participating in the study. A 2-stage recruitment process occurred between December 2006 and July 2011. [28] Data collection was completed in 2015.

The exception was race, which was forced into the model at each step of the iterative process, to examine its contribution while controlling for other factors.

Of the 1083 mother-infant dyads examined, 850 (78.5%) mothers did not rank their 2-year-olds in the possible SE problem range on the BITSEA while 230 (21.2%) reported a possible problem. Three dyads (0.3%) had missing outcome data. Table 2 displays unadjusted associations between motherreported SE problems in 2-year olds and maternal variables at enrollment and the 1-year child visit and child variables at birth, the 1-year child visit, and the 2-year child visit. Associations are shown as odds ratios. For continuous variables, the OR represents an increase in SE problem risk for 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in risk represented by each variable. For categorical variables, the OR represents SE problem risk of the specified category compared to the reference level. In these unadjusted analyses, maternal characteristics during gestation that were significantly associated with possible SE problems in 2-year-old children included marital status, Medicaid insurance, high school education or less, Black/African American race, and younger age (all P < .001). Mothers reporting possible child SE problems had higher cyclothymic (P < .001), dysthymic (P = .006), and irritable (P < .001) scores on the TEMPS. Mothers with higher hyperthymic scores were less likely to report SE problems in their child (P = .005). Possible SE problems at 2 years of age were associated with greater maternal psychological distress on the BSI, higher EPDS depression score, greater parenting stress, lower maternal IQ, and identified risk for child abuse on the CAPI (all P < .001) at 1 year of age.\nChild variables at birth (sex, gestational age) and at 1 year of age (Bayley-III Screener status for cognitive, receptive communication, expressive communication; and weight and length for age) were not significantly associated with reported SE problems at 2 years of age. However, at 2 years of age, child variables began to show associations with reported possible SE problems. Children with possible SE problems were more likely to fail the M-CHAT and have lower Bayley-III cognitive, receptive communication, and expressive communication scaled scores (all P < .001).\nA multivariable logistic regression model predicting likelihood of child SE problems at 2 years of age was developed as described earlier.\nResults for the final model are shown in Table 2 .

Maternal race, statistically significant in the bivariate analysis, was not significantly associated with reported possible child SE problems at 2 years of age when controlling for other socio-demographic, maternal, and child variables."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this representative sample of a southern urban-suburban community, mothers' report of SE problems in their 2-year-old children was common (21.2%). Not surprisingly, this prevalence is comparable to the BITSEA standardization sample which set the cutoff designation for SE problems based on a problem score of less than or equal to the 25th percentile. [39] The National Center for Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Health and Youth Development, using the Child Behavior Checklist/2-3, [40] showed mothers of 24-month-old children reported internalizing behavior problems in 11% and externalizing behaviors in 16% of a large sample. [41] Our study did not distinguish between internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, but comparable overall problem prevalence is suggested. Maternal temperament measured during gestation, socio-demographic variables, psychological distress, and parenting stress at 1 year were associated with reported SE problems in 2-year-old children. Two-year-olds with better expressive communication were less likely to have mother-reported SE problems. The findings did not support associations between communication and cognitive development at 1 year with SE problems at 2 years. Two-year-olds who failed the M-CHAT were more likely to have reported SE problems.\nMaternal mental health factors associated with child SE problems are well recognized. Maternal depression and anxiety are commonly associated with child SE problems [42] and may mediate the relationship between poverty and other environmental factors on child outcomes. In unadjusted analyses, measures of maternal depression, global psychological distress, and parenting stress when the child was 1 year of age were all associated with child SE problems at 2 years of age. Additionally, maternal child abuse potential at 1 year was associated with SE problem in 2-year-olds. In the final model, global psychological distress and parenting stress remained as the dominant mental health predictors. Although child abuse potential was not significantly associated with SE problems in the final model, the unadjusted association with SE problems highlights the potential increased risk for maltreatment and indicates that maternal report of SE problems should trigger efforts not only to address the apparent SE problems but also to assess maternal-child relationship and offer support as indicated.\nThe cyclothymic score, which was assessed during gestation, was associated with reported SE problems at 2 years of age in the final model. The same association of higher maternal cyclothymic score with report of child SE problems was seen in this cohort at age 1 year. [26] Maternal temperament measured during gestation is thought to be a behavioral disposition that is stable over time, irrespective of age and gender. [43] In a study of parents with bipolar disorder and their children, an association between unstructured, disorganized parenting in middle childhood, and altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal functioning in their adolescent children has been shown. [44] While few mothers in our study reached \"clinical levels\" or reported bipolar disorder Table 2 Associations between maternal and child characteristics for possible SE problems at 2 years of age."}, {"section_title": "Bivariate results", "text": "Multivariable results \u2020 For continuous variables, odds ratios represent increase in risk for 1 SD increase in risk factor; for categorical variables, the odds ratio compares risk compared to the reference category shown. \u2020 Race was forced into the model at each step of the stepwise model selection procedure."}, {"section_title": "Palmer et al. Medicine (2018) 97:28", "text": "Medicine diagnoses, the varying mood reflected in higher cyclothymic scores may interfere with mothers' abilities to provide structured, developmentally-appropriate and consistently responsive caregiving, thereby disrupting SE development. While maternal depression may disrupt SE development, maternal emotional and cognitive dysfunction and impairment may also disrupt SE development. Cognitive dysfunction during depression is complex and multilevel [16] and varies depending on the depressive disorder. [45] Further examination of maternal mental health (i.e., global psychological distress, parenting stress), intelligence, and cyclothymic temperament as predictors of child SE problems is needed.\nIt is notable that our measured child developmental variables were not associated with maternal report of child SE problems until 2 years of age. This is consistent with previously reported analyses in this cohort of factors associated with SE problems at 1 year of age which identified similar maternal socio-demographic, mental health, and temperament associations but no associated child factors. [26] Expressive and receptive communication and cognitive skills develop rapidly during the second year of life. The greater array of skills to measure at 2 years of age likely contributes to the emergence of differences at this age, differences not present at 1 year, or at least not measureable with the Bayley-III Screener. At 2 years of age, in unadjusted models, lower cognitive and expressive and receptive communication scores were associated with SE problems. In the final model, lower child expressive communication at 2 years of age remained highly associated with SE problem status. It is logical to suspect that 2-year-olds with more limited expressive communication skills are more likely to use nonverbal behaviors to communicate, behaviors that may be interpreted as problematic. Mothers from lower socioeconomic circumstances in this cohort, those with lower education and/or on Medicaid, reported more SE problems. This is also noted in the UK Millennium Cohort Study [46] and supports a family stress model where lower socioeconomic environment adversely impacts parental mental health which, in turn, influences parenting practices and subsequent child outcomes. This may be compounded by the association of lower socioeconomic status with lower child communication skills in other research. [47] It is not surprising that children failing the M-CHAT [38] were more likely to have reported SE problems. The M-CHAT screens for specific SE behaviors that are also captured by the BITSEA. Although child internalizing and externalizing behavior may have been associated with maternal report of child SE problems, variables measuring these behaviors were not included in this study. This limitation needs to be addressed in future work.\nIn the unadjusted analysis, Black/African American race was a strong predictor of reported SE problems (unadjusted OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.91-3.89; P < .001). However, black mothers in this cohort were more likely to be on Medicaid, younger, a single parent and have lower educational attainment. Race was not statistically significant after adjusting for education, maternal behavioral and mental health, and child development variables in the final model. This finding highlights the complex role of race as an independent variable. Social and psychological dimensions of race are equally if not more important than biological dimensions and may be the main drivers of interest in important health outcomes, such as early child SE development. [27] Understanding the interactions of race and other socio-demographic variables as they relate to child development is necessary if we are to develop and implement prevention and intervention strategies to improve child SE development in diverse communities. [48] This study benefits from a large sample of socio-demographically diverse mother-child pairs. An exceptionally wide range of independent maternal and child variables were objectively measured. The demography of the sample very closely matches the demography of Memphis/Shelby County and is similar to other urbansuburban communities in the southern United States. Although the current study's higher percentage of single mothers limits the extrapolation to the general US population, this percentage may be equivalent to other urban populations. The CANDLE retention rate is good for a comprehensive, longitudinal assessment of a community population and is comparable to that of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. [49] SE problems were based on parental report using the BITSEA. While the BITSEA validation sample included children from minority and majority backgrounds, [39] these backgrounds may differ from parents and children in Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee.\nThe enrolled mothers were medically low-risk. Therefore, generalizing these findings to medically high-risk mothers is unwarranted. This was a cross-sectional analysis of SE outcomes in 2-year-old children and cannot reflect the trajectory of SE development throughout early childhood. As the cohort ages, longitudinal analyses will assess factors predicting a trajectory of SE development through the preschool years. Finally, unmeasured variables are likely to be additional factors associated with child SE problems. These include experienced racism, family violence, neighborhood distress, and other environmental and genetic factors. Future research in this and other cohorts should examine the role of these variables, alone and in combination, in determining SE outcomes in very young children.\nWithin the bioecological and life course frameworks, our findings are consistent with models of poverty and related socio-demographic stressors that compromise the ability of parents to provide for optimal child SE development. [50] This compromise may be partially mediated by resulting parental psychological distress that interferes with parenting and thereby shapes neurodevelopmental underpinnings of SE development. [17, 46] Preventive and therapeutic approaches addressing parenting have been successful and offer promise at a system level. Nurse home visiting interventions to reduce parenting stress through parenting education and parent support have been shown to reduce child behavior problems in 2-to 3-year-olds. [51] Early childhood services, including quality child care and preschool services, are effective in fostering SE development. [3] Primary care settings provide opportunities for interventions designed to promote positive parenting and thereby improve child SE development. [52] A recent meta-analysis of primary care-based interventions demonstrates \"modest, but significant\" positive changes in parenting. [53] The Academic Pediatric Association Task Force on Poverty offers a roadmap for systematic redesign of primary care settings to support children and their families in poverty. [54] Expected benefits from such systems change should include enhanced child SE development among other important child health outcomes. This study examined select biological and social factors that are associated with SE development in young children. These factors represent aspects of mothers, their young children, and the prenatal and early childhood processes that contribute to SE development in a metropolitan community. Attention to the strongest maternal and child predictors of child SE development can alert professionals working with expectant and young families to identify individual children and families needing support, guide professionals to consider evidence-based interventions, and target public prevention/treatment programs in communities to improve child SE development."}]
