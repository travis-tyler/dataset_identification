Methods: Online databases were searched for peer-reviewed studies that met the a priori inclusion criteria: population (apparently healthy, 1 month to 4.99 years), intervention/exposure and comparator (durations, patterns, and types of SB), and outcome/health indicator (critical: adiposity, motor development, psychosocial health, cognitive development; important: bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, fitness, risks/harm). The quality of the evidence was assessed by study design and outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Sedentary behaviour is defined as any waking behaviour with an energy expenditure of \u22641.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture [1] . It is increasingly recognized that too much sedentary behaviour can have negative health effects across the lifespan [2] [3] [4] , which are distinct from those that result from low physical activity [5] . This may be of particular importance in the early years of life, given that these years are critical for growth and development, and that lifestyle behaviours established early in life tend to track over time [6] [7] [8] .\nIn this regard, the Canadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years (ages 0-4 years) [9] , and guidelines in other countries around the world (e.g., Australia [10] and USA [11] ), recommend that children <2 years of age have no exposure to screens, and that those aged 2 to 4 years have <1 h/day of screen time. In addition, guidelines (e.g., in Canada [9] , Australia [10] , and the United Kingdom [12] ) recommend that parents and caregivers minimize the time that children spend sitting or being restrained (e.g., in a stroller or high chair) while awake.\nIn contrast to these recommendations, \u2265 80% of young children are exposed to screens before the age of 2 years [13, 14] , only 22% of Canadian children aged 3 to 4 years are meeting the screen time guidelines of <1 h/day, and on average parent-reported screen time for this age group is 2.0 h/day [15] . Moreover, young children are spending a substantial proportion of their time sedentary, and no guidance regarding an \"appropriate\" amount of total sedentary time exists. This is a notable gap, given that a recent review including data from 10 countries reported that children aged 2 to 5 years were sedentary for 34% to 94% of the day [16] . For instance, objectively measured data from a large, nationally representative sample of Canadian children showed that, on average, 3-to 4-year-olds were sedentary for 436 min/ day (7 h, 16 min), which was roughly equivalent to 60% of their waking time [15] .\nThe Canadian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines were informed by a systematic review of the evidence that found that high levels of television (TV) time were associated with increased adiposity and reduced psychosocial health and cognitive development [2] . However, there was no evidence of benefits or harms for any other type of sedentary behaviour, for total sedentary time, or for patterns (e.g., frequency, interruptions) of sedentary time. This may be in part because only intervention and longitudinal studies were included in this earlier review [2] . This is a critical limitation because in recent years there has been a dramatic shift in the media landscape (e.g., evolving technologies including smartphones and tablets) [17] , and because different types of sedentary behaviour (e.g., reading, sitting, playing video games) [18, 19] and different patterns of sedentary behaviour [20] may have different health effects. Evidence from large cross-sectional studies (with samples representative of the general population), together with new studies published since the original review, may provide additional insight.\nIn the intervening years, new systematic reviews have been conducted to investigate the relationships between sedentary behaviour and particular health indicators. For instance, Hinkley et al. found that too little evidence existed to draw conclusions regarding associations between sedentary behaviours and psychosocial wellbeing [21] , and Carson et al. identified that different types of sedentary behaviour may have different effects on cognitive development in the early years of life (e.g., screen time may be detrimental, and reading beneficial) [18] . These recent reviews present focused summaries; however, no previous review has provided a balanced consideration of different types of sedentary behaviour and a range of holistic health indicators across study designs. Accordingly, a comprehensive review of the literature was needed in order to: 1) understand the health effects of sedentary behaviour in the early years, 2) inform and update population-level recommendations, and 3) identify research gaps and guide the design of future research and/or assist in the translation of current research to practice.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review that examined the relationships between sedentary behaviour and health indicators in children in their early years (0 to 4 years). An additional aim was to determine what doses of sedentary behaviour (i.e., duration, patterns [frequency, interruptions], and type) were associated with health indicators."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Protocol and registration", "text": "This systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; Registration no.

For infants, sedentary behaviour was operationally defined as any waking behaviour characterized by low energy expenditure (i.e., non-purposefully active) while restrained (e.g., in a stroller/pram, high chair, car seat/capsule), or when sedate (e.g., lying/sitting in a chair with little movement but not restrained). Time spent in the prone position (\"tummy time\") was not considered sedentary behaviour because this is deemed \"physical activity\" in this age group. For toddlers and preschoolers, sedentary behaviour was defined as any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure of \u22641.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture [1] . Studies defining sedentary behaviour as \"physical inactivity\" or \"failing to meet physical activity guidelines\" were excluded, because these definitions do not differentiate between sedentary behaviour and light-intensity physical activity. Studies of active video gaming exposures (e.g., Nintendo Wii\u2122, Microsoft Kinect\u2122, Sony's Playstation Move\u2122) were excluded because these games may elicit energy expenditure > 1.5 METs [24] , as were studies reporting background TV or screen access (e.g., TV is turned on, but not necessarily being watched by the child) because the child could be engaged in a non-sedentary behaviour. For experimental studies, interventions had to target sedentary behaviour exclusively and not multiple health behaviours (e.g., both sedentary behaviour and diet)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison", "text": "Various durations, patterns (frequencies, interruptions), and types of sedentary behavior were used for comparison where available.

Four health indicators were identified as important (secondary) by expert consensus: (1) bone and skeletal health (e.g., bone mineral density, bone mineral content, skeletal area); (2) cardiometabolic health (e.g., blood pressure, insulin resistance, blood lipids); (3) fitness (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal); and (4) risks (injury)/ harm (e.g., plagiocephaly, torticollis)."}, {"section_title": "Study designs", "text": "All study designs were considered.

All individual studies were assessed for the following potential sources of bias: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias (see Poitras et al. [25] for details).\nThe quality of evidence for each health indicator by each type of study design was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework [27] . The \"quality of evidence\" is the level of confidence in the estimate of effect. As such, the higher the quality of the evidence, the greater the confidence in the findings, and the lower the quality, the more likely it is that future research will change the level of confidence in the estimates and change the estimates themselves. According to GRADE, there are four levels of quality (\"high\", \"moderate\", \"low\", and \"very low\"); evidence quality ratings start at \"high\" for randomized studies and at \"low\" for all other studies. The quality of evidence is downgraded if there are limitations across studies due to serious risk of bias, inconsistency (e.g., unexplained heterogeneity in the direction of the effect), indirectness (e.g., differences between the population, intervention and/or outcomes in included studies and those of interest, such as a surrogate measure instead of a direct measure of an outcome), or imprecision (e.g., wide confidence intervals that lead to uncertainty about the true magnitude of the effect) [28] . If there is no reason to downgrade, the quality of evidence can be upgraded if there is a large effect size, there is a dose-response gradient, or an effect is detected in the presence of plausible confounders or other biases that would decrease an apparent treatment effect [29] .\nIn the present review, the overall quality of evidence for each study design within each health indicator was evaluated by two independent reviewers and verified by the larger review team. The review team decided a priori not to downgrade for risk of bias if the only potential sources of bias identified were use of a convenience sample or lack of exposure/outcome blinding, as in previous movement behaviour systematic reviews [25, 30] ."}, {"section_title": "Synthesis of results", "text": "Meta-analyses were planned if data were sufficiently homogeneous in terms of statistical, clinical, and methodological characteristics.

Indicators of adiposity (e.g., body mass index [BMI]) were measured objectively (e.g., measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) or assessed subjectively (e.g., parent-reported height and weight; see Table 1 for summary of measures). The quality of evidence ranged from \"very low\" to \"moderate\" across study designs (Table 1 ).\nIn the randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce screen time, screen time was significantly lower for preschoolers in the intervention versus control group at 2, 6, and 9 months post-intervention [34] . BMI z-scores were not different between the intervention and control groups at baseline or 9-month follow-up, but BMI z-scores increased in both groups [34] (Additional file 2: Table S1 ).\nAmong the 13 longitudinal studies, sedentary behaviour was assessed from age~9 months to 4.95 years as screenbased (i.e., computer time, frequency of playing computer games, time watching DVDs, TV time, and total screen time) or other sedentary behaviours (i.e., time spent in the car or in baby seats). Adiposity indicators were assessed between~1.25 and 12 years follow-up.\nFor screen-based sedentary behaviours, computer time [85] , and frequency of playing computer games [82] at age 4.8 years were not associated with total fat mass or lean mass, or weight status, at~6 and 12 years of follow-up respectively.

Total screen time in toddlers was unfavourably associated with weight status at preschool or school age in 2/3 studies [33, 84] .

The main findings are the following: 1) associations between objectively measured total sedentary time and health indicators (adiposity and motor development) were predominantly null; 2) associations between screen-based sedentary behaviours and health indicators (adiposity, motor or cognitive development, and psychosocial health) were largely unfavourable or null; 3) associations between reading or storytelling and cognitive development were favourable or null; and 4) associations between time spent seated (e.g., in baby seats, car seats, high chairs or strollers) or in the supine position and health indicators (adiposity, motor development) were primarily unfavourable or null. Few studies examined indicators of bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, or fitness, and no studies reported on risks or harms (e.g., torticollis, injuries) associated with sedentary behaviours. These findings suggest that, in the early years, total sedentary time may have a negligible impact on health, but the way that time is spent is important, with screen-based and seated/supine sedentary behaviours likely to have unfavourable or null health effects (unlikely to have favourable effects), and interactive nonscreen-based activities such as reading and storytelling likely to have favourable health effects. A summary of the findings is presented in Table 8 .\nThe finding that there are no associations between objectively measured total sedentary time and health indicators in the early years (0 to 4 years) is in contrast to the relationships in older age groups, in particular adults [4, 127] . While this suggests that in the early years a certain amount of sedentary behaviour may be innocuous and perhaps even necessary for healthy growth and development, these findings should be interpreted with caution. First, objectively measured total sedentary time was examined only in cross-sectional studies, and a plausible explanation for the perceived lack of association between total sedentary time and health indicators is that there had simply been insufficient time for those effects to manifest, rather than there being no effect. This hypothesis is supported by comparison of findings from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies for subsets of total sedentary behaviour. For instance, 9/10 (90%) longitudinal studies reported at least one unfavourable association between TV time and adiposity indicators, compared to only 11/22 (50%) cross-sectional studies. However, total sedentary time was examined only in relation to adiposity and motor development (and in one study each for indicators of psychosocial health, cognitive development, and bone and skeletal health); it remains possible that total sedentary time is associated with other health indicators, particularly those likely to be acutely affected in the early years, such as cognitive development. More well-designed studies with objective measures of sedentary behaviour are needed.\nSecond, in the present review, studies that utilized accelerometry measures applied a range of sampling intervals (epochs) and cut-points. Given that these measurement parameters influence the amount of sedentary behaviour captured [128, 129] , individual studies may have under-or overestimated the total amount of sedentary time and may therefore have resulted in an underestimation or overestimation of true effects. However, Byun et al. applied three different accelerometry cutpoints in two cross-sectional datasets to test whether this would influence the findings, and found no association between total sedentary time and BMI z-score, regardless of the cut-points used [38] . Nonetheless, the most appropriate way to objectively measure sedentary behaviour in the early years is still unknown and remains an important area for future work.\nLastly, total sedentary time was not objectively assessed in any studies in the infant age group; however, such measures may not be meaningful in nonambulatory infants. Although the associations between total sedentary time and health indicators were primarily null, the present data do not allow for recommendations regarding \"appropriate\" amounts or patterning (e.g., breaks) of total sedentary time.\nRegarding screen-based sedentary behaviours, the present findings support and extend those of the earlier systematic review [2] ; overall, screen time (namely TV time) was unfavourably associated with a range of health indicators. Notably, TV time was the predominant measure of screen-based behaviour, followed by total screen time, with only eight studies reporting relationships between computer use and any health indicator; two studies for each of DVDs/videos, electronic/total media exposure, and inactive video games; and one study for mobile phone and internet use. Findings for these other screen exposures were mixed (unfavourable or null), and suggest no benefits and some potential for harm. Although it seems intuitive that different types of screens may exert different effects (e.g., interacting on video-chat versus passive screen use), research on children's use of such technologies lags behind their adoption [130] ; this is a substantial research gap. Importantly, screen-based behaviours are used as a proxy for sedentary behaviour; however, it is uncertain whether children in this age group are actually sedentary while using screens, and there may be screen-related health effects that are independent of the \"lack of movement\" [131, 132] . Notwithstanding these limitations, the present findings indicate that less screen-based sedentary behaviour is better for optimal health in the early years of life.\nOther sedentary behaviour exposures were less frequently examined, and findings were mixed. In general, reading [110, 117, 121, 124] and storytelling [117, 124] were favourably associated with cognitive development, while various types of time spent seated (e.g., in a car seat, high chair, or stroller) had mixed unfavourable and null associations with indicators of adiposity and motor development [45, 81, 82, 91 ]. An age-dependent effect was observed in the only study that assessed time in the supine position; time spent supine before 6 months of age was not associated with gross motor performance, but greater time in the supine position after age 6 months was associated with worse gross motor performance [93] . Overall, there was a paucity of data regarding the relationships between other types of sedentary behaviours and health indicators. Research shows that children are spending~7 h of the day in sedentary pursuits [15] , and~2 h of these are occupied by screen time [15] ; this leaves an additional 5 h that are unaccounted for. Other types of sedentary behaviours are thus highly understudied, and this is an important research gap.\nMost studies examined the duration of sedentary behaviours in relation to health indicators, with only three studies specifically examining the impact of patterns of behaviour (i.e., breaks, frequency). Specifically, there was no association between accelerometer-derived sedentary time in 30-min bouts and indicators of adiposity and motor development [40] , or between the frequency of playing computer games and adiposity indicators [82] , but there were favourable associations between the frequency of parents reading or storytelling and child cognitive development [121] . These findings are consistent with those of studies that examined sedentary behaviour duration; however, it remains difficult to draw conclusions regarding patterns of sedentary behaviour for optimal health in the early years."}, {"section_title": "Strengths, limitations, and future directions", "text": "Strengths of this review include the use of a comprehensive search strategy that was developed and peerreviewed by librarians with expertise in systematic reviews, as well as inclusion of all study designs and a broad range of health indicators that represent various dimensions of health. Rigorous methodological standards were used in this review, including application of the GRADE framework to guide the review process and assess the quality of the evidence [27] . To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to synthesize the evidence regarding the relationships between objectively and subjectively measured sedentary behaviour across the most comprehensive range of health indicators in children in the early years of life.\nIn terms of limitations, sample size restrictions were imposed for feasibility reasons and to maximize generalizability, but it is possible that studies with smaller sample sizes might have provided additional insight. Further, because of heterogeneity in the measurement of sedentary behaviour and health indicators, meta-analyses were not possible and all studies were weighted equally in the narrative synthesis. The direction of associations (i.e., unfavourable, null, favourable) was based on statistical significance; clinical significance was not considered.\nAlthough an abundance of evidence was synthesized in this review, several limitations of this area of research were identified that remain to be addressed. As mentioned, data were limited regarding the relationships between sedentary behaviour and four relevant health indicators (two or fewer studies for each of bone and skeletal health, cardiometabolic health, fitness, and risks/ harms); TV time was the primary sedentary exposure, with few studies examining \"other\" types of screens (e.g., tablets, mobile phones) or sedentary behaviours (e.g., reading, puzzles); and objective measures of total sedentary time were employed only in cross-sectional studies. Although adiposity was the most commonly measured health indicator (60 studies), direct measures of adiposity were used in only two studies [78, 82] while the remainder used surrogate measures such as BMI. Only one randomized controlled study was included in the present review, and the quality of the evidence ranged from \"very low\" to \"moderate\" across the study designs and health indicators. There is a need for high-quality studies with strong designs to better establish the magnitude of effects and the nature of dose-response gradients (if applicable), to assess cause-and-effect relationships, and to examine potential subgroup differences (e.g., based on age, sex, or socio-economic status). When RCTs are not possible because of the inherent challenges of research in this age group, quasi-experimental or longitudinal designs that use validated sedentary behaviour measures and outcome measures that are sensitive enough to detect changes are recommended.\nAcross the health indicators, the most common reason for downgrading the quality of evidence was the serious risk of bias associated with sedentary behaviour measures with no known psychometric properties. Consequently, development and use of reliable and valid subjective measures of sedentary behaviour are needed. Defining and measuring sedentary behaviour in young children, particularly in nonambulatory infants, remains a challenge. For instance, infants in the supine position may be vigorously moving arms and legs, and thus being \"active\", but existing questionnaire-based measures do not capture this. Future research using inclinometers, which can more accurately capture postures [133] , as well as limb-worn devices, will help to address the challenges associated with quantifying sedentary behaviours in the early years. Finally, the question of whether different types of sedentary behaviour \"content\" (e.g., educational versus recreational TV programming) exert different health effects was beyond the scope of this review, and remains an important area for future work."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This systematic review synthesized findings from 96 studies with~200,000 participants in 33 countries around the world; the quality of the evidence ranged from \"very low\" to \"moderate\". In summary, the findings demonstrate that in the early years (0 to 4 years), total sedentary time may have a negligible impact on health, but the quality of that time is important, with screen-based and seated/supine sedentary behaviours likely to have no benefit and a potential for harm, and interactive non-screen-based activities such as reading with caregivers having favourable health effects. These findings continue to support the importance of minimizing screen time for disease prevention and health promotion in the early years [2, 9] , and also highlight the potential benefits of interactive non-screen-based sedentary behaviours such as reading and storytelling. There is a need for additional research using valid and reliable measures and high-quality study designs, to more definitively establish the relationships between sedentary behaviours and health indicators, and to provide insight into the appropriate dose (durations, patterns, type) of sedentary behaviour for optimal health in the early years.
