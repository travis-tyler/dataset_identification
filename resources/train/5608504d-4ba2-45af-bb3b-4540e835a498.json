[{"section_title": "", "text": "In Japan, there has been a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases detected among travelers and returnees at airport quarantine stations, despite the pandemic having subsided in parts of many countries. A nasopharyngeal specimen was collected from travelers and returnees arriving in Japan, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was performed in four airport quarantine stations (Narita, Hanada, Nagoya, and Kansai airports; Supplementary Table S1 All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiCoV database on September 10, 2020 ( Fig. 1) .\nOf the 129 genome sequences identified (Supplementary Table S2) The daily number of airport checks for COVID-19 would increase to approximately 20,000 following the recent relaxation of entry restrictions, and the partial reopening of Japan (on October 1, 2020) to foreign nationals (mainly business\ntravelers) planning to stay in Japan for at least 3 months. Interestingly, there is a potential risk of COVID-19 during air travel. 3 Being in close proximity to strangers with an unknown infection status for hours in an aircraft is a matter of concern, although physical distancing and use of face coverings or masks can reduce the risk during boarding. 4 The number of foreigners entering Japan remains to be determined, but the resumption of foreign air travel could trigger a resurgence of COVID-19.\nIn conclusion, evaluation of imported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences identified at quarantine stations in Japan until August 31, 2020, and haplotype network analysis demonstrated multiple genome lineages. To prevent the introduction of COVID-19, it is necessary to formulate an efficient strategy of testing and real-time genome sequencing to support quarantine monitoring based on the sentinel surveillance in travel medicine. 5"}, {"section_title": "Ethical statement", "text": "The study protocol was approved by National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan (Approval No. 1091).
