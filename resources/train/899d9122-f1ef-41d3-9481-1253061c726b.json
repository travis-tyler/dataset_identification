In the first stage, a national sample of local education agencies (LEAs) was selected. In the second stage, a sample of preschoolers with disabilities was selected from lists of eligible children provided by the participating LEAs. In all, 223 LEAs and 3,104 children and their families participated. From 2003From -2004From to 2008From -2009, five waves of data collection were conducted, including telephone interviews with participating children's parents/guardians; one-onone assessments of participating children; and mail surveys of the teachers or service providers of each child, principals/program directors in the schools/early childhood programs in which children were enrolled, and administrators in local and state education agencies."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Each participating family was asked to complete a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) in 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, and 2006-2007. Questions addressed the sampled child's health and disability, behavior, school programs and services, special education and related services, child care, and out-of-school activities. Respondents were also asked a series of questions about their household, its resources, and family background. Assessments in Waves 1 through 5 included one or more subtests of the following measures: \u2022 The preLAS 2000 measure of early childhood language proficiency (Duncan & De Avila, 1998) \u2022 Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III) (Dunn & Dunn, 1997) \u2022 Woodcock-Johnson III (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001) \u2022 Leiter-R Attention Sustained Scale (Roid & Miller, 1995 \u2022 Individual Growth and Development Indicators (ECRI MGD, 2001) \u2022 Test of Early Math Skills (US HHS, 2005) \u2022 PIAT-R Reading Comprehension (Markwardt, 1989) \u2022 DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency (Good & Kaminski, 2002) In Waves 1 through 4, teachers received a multipart questionnaire for each enrolled child they taught. Questionnaire items addressed classroom staffing and materials, interaction with nondisabled peers, teachers' philosophies of early childhood education, and children's transitions in and out of the current program. A pullout section addressed special education programs and related services. The teacher questionnaires also included one or more subtests of the following indirect assessments of children's functioning: the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II (Harrison & Oakland, 2003); the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Classroom Edition (Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti 1985); the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Merrell, 2002) or Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliott, 1990); and, for kindergarten and elementary teachers, an Academic Rating Scale previously used in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). In Waves 1 through 3, the administrator of each child's school or early childhood program was asked to complete a questionnaire in the year he or she initially had a child enrolled in PEELS. The Early Childhood Program Director Questionnaire, which was sent to early childhood program directors, asked about program characteristics, child and family characteristics, staffing, and administrator training and demographics. If one or more children attended an elementary school, the Elementary School Principal Questionnaire was sent to the principal. The content of the survey was very similar to that of the Early Childhood Program Director Questionnaire. It asked about school and community characteristics; student characteristics; staff, programs, and resources; preschool programs; special education programs and practices; and parent involvement. The State and Local Education Agency Policy and Practices Questionnaires, sent to state early childhood special education coordinators and local special education directors, respectively, asked about areas of programmatic strength and weakness, inclusion policy, and collaboration with early intervention providers."}, {"section_title": "Illustrative Findings", "text": "In this section, we provide illustrative findings for each of the major elements in the conceptual model presented in Figure P.13. A complete set of reports can be found at www.peels.org, and an online analysis tool can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/dasolv2/tables. Child and family characteristics (retrieved December 22, 2010, from the PEELS Wave 1 restricted use dataset and U.S. Census Bureau, 2004b). Preschoolers with disabilities differed from other preschoolers and older children with disabilities in some ways, but resembled them in others. Like children with disabilities in other age groups, preschoolers with disabilities were disproportionately male (70%). Sixty-two percent of preschoolers with disabilities were White, non-Hispanic; 21% were Hispanic; 10% were Black, non-Hispanic; and 6% were from other racial groups or of more than one race. This compares with general population figures for children ages 3 through 5 of 58% White, 20% Hispanic, and 15% Black. More than one fourth (26%) of PEELS children lived in households earning $20,000 or less compared with 20% of young children in general. At ages 3 through 5, 47% of preschoolers with disabilities were identified as having primarily a speech or language impairment, 27% had a developmental delay, 7% had autism, and 4% had mental retardation. Other disability groups accounted for fewer than 3% of children who received special education services in this age group. However, disability classifications are somewhat fluid in the early years. Between 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, 23% of children who continued to receive special education services had a change in their primary disability category (Carlson et al., 2008). In addition, many children initially served in preschool special education programs were later found ineligible or otherwise stopped receiving services (i.e., were declassified). These changes often occurred at a transition from preschool to kindergarten or from kindergarten to elementary school, although that was not always the case. In all, 15% of preschoolers with disabilities were declassified between 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 (S.E. = 1.0). Children who were declassified had higher mean scores on the Woodcock-Johnson III Letter-Word Identification subtest than those who remained eligible for services (104.5 vs. 99.2), and the same was true for the Woodcock-Johnson III Applied Problems subtest (101.3 vs. 90.1) and the PPVT-III (96.1 vs. 87.6; Carlson et al., 2008). Program/school context. Preschoolers with disabilities receive a variety of special education and related services. In PEELS, teachers and service providers indicated that 89% of children received speech or language therapy in the [2003][2004]   service. Occupational therapy (32%) and learning strategies/study skills assistance by a special educator (30%) also were commonly reported services (Carlson et al., 2008). From 2003From -2004From to 2004From -2005, there was a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of children receiving nine types of services. For example, service coordination/case management decreased from 25% to 9%; training, counseling, or other supports/services for the children's family decreased from 16% to 5%; and learning strategies/study skills assistance decreased from 30% to 20%. The one service showing a significant increase from 2003-2004 to 2004-2005 was help from a one-to-one paraeducator or assistant, which increased from 10% to 13%. The mean number of special education and related services provided to young children with disabilities decreased from 3.5 in 2003-2004to 2.8 in 2004-2005(Carlson et al., 2008. Transitions. Educational transitions, from home or early intervention to preschool, preschool to kindergarten, or kindergarten to elementary school can be a period of disruption for many children. Children with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable during this time (Rosenkoetter, Hains, & Dogaru 2007;Rous, Hallam, Harbin, McCormick, & Jung 2007;Wolery, 1999), and systems may be difficult for families to navigate. Of the children ages 3 through 5 with disabilities who had an individualized family service plan (IFSP) before age 3, 30% had a gap between the end of services received through IDEA, Part C, and the beginning of preschool services, and that gap averaged 4.6 months (Markowitz et al., 2006). Data on children's transitions from preschool to kindergarten were combined across 3 years to explore this transition period in depth. Teachers were asked to indicate which of 11 specific strategies were used to help facilitate the child's transition to kindergarten. Strategies that were used by more than 80% of teachers included receiving the child's records from his or her previous program (87%), encouraging parents and guardians to meet the child's new staff (86%), and receiving information about the child from his/her previous program (83%). Kindergarten teachers used, on average, 5.4 strategies to facilitate the child's transition to kindergarten. However, the number of strategies used by kindergarten teachers varied significantly by district size, metropolitan status, and district wealth. Forty percent of teachers who worked in very large districts used six or more strategies to facilitate transitions, compared with 58% of teachers who worked in medium districts. Thirty-two percent of teachers who worked in very low wealth districts used six or more strategies compared with 52% of teachers who worked in high wealth districts (Carlson et al., 2009). On the basis of teacher reports, there were no statistically significant differences in the ease with which children transitioned to kindergarten by child's gender, race/ethnicity, disability category, or family income. There were some statistically significant differences based on parent report, however. For example, parents of Hispanic children were more likely than parents of Black children or White children to report a somewhat hard or very hard transition to kindergarten (26%, 16%, and 13%, respectively) (Carlson et al., 2009). The transition across grades or schools also is a point at which declassification is more likely to occur. Twenty percent of children who transitioned from preschool to kindergarten were declassified between 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. In contrast, 5% of children who did not undergo a transition were declassified (Carlson et al., 2008). Child outcomes. As a group, children who received preschool special education services performed close to the average for their peers without disabilities on the Woodcock-Johnson III Letter-Word Identification subtest (Carlson et al., 2008). PEELS children had an overall mean performance of 98.2, compared with a mean of 100 for the general population. The direct assessment also included a measure of receptive or listening vocabulary, an adapted version of the PPVT-III, which is considered a strong predictor of language acquisition and cognitive development. In 2003-2004, children represented in PEELS had a mean score of 89.9, compared with a population mean of 100. On the Woodcock-Johnson III Applied Problems subtest, a measure of early math skills, the mean performance of children who received preschool special education services was 90.8 compared with a population mean of 100. The Social Skills scale of the PKBS-2 assesses age-appropriate personal and interpersonal behaviors of preschool and early elementary-age children. 1 A higher rating on the Social Skills composite index indicates a higher level of social adjustment. In 2003-2004, the mean teacher ratings for children with disabilities was 92.9 compared with a population mean of 100 (Carlson et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Commentary", "text": "The preschool years are a period of rapid change for children with disabilities, both in the knowledge, skills, and attributes they exhibit and the familial and educational systems in which they function. Because changes occur quickly and across a variety of domains, only a broad longitudinal study like PEELS can capture the dynamic experiences of these children. Data from PEELS provide a unique perspective on the evolving characteristics of young children with disabilities and their families; the services they receive; their transitions across service systems and education levels; and their academic, social, and functional skills over time."}]
