A total of 607 participants were assigned to three MCI groups (high learning-low retention; low learning-high retention; low learning-low retention) and one control group (high learning-high retention) based on scores above or below a 1.5 SD cutoff on learning and retention indices of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Our results demonstrated that MCI individuals with predominantly a learning deficit showed a widespread pattern of gray matter loss at baseline, whereas individuals with a retention deficit showed more focal gray matter loss. Moreover, either learning or retention measures provided good predictive value for longitudinal clinical outcome over two years, although impaired learning had modestly better predictive power than impaired retention. As expected, impairments in both measures provided the best predictive power. Thus, the conventional practice of relying solely on the use of delayed recall or retention measures in studies of amnestic MCI misses an important subset of older adults at risk of developing AD.

Information processing models provide evidence of three distinct processes involved in memory: encoding, retention, and retrieval of information (Lucas, 2005) . Encoding or learning is the process by which information is acquired and transformed into a stored mental representation. Retention refers to the process by which the encoded information is * Corresponding author. Tel.: +1 858 246 0942; fax: +1 858 534 1078.\nE-mail address: yuling@ucsd.edu (Y.-L.

Studies of learning and memory in AD have found deficits in both learning and retention (i.e., accelerated forgetting) of episodic material, although there is not consensus that both are impaired in the earliest stages of AD. Some researchers argue that prodromal AD is characterized predominantly by an acquisition deficit (Greene, Baddeley, & Hodges, 1996; Grober & Kawas, 1997; Weingartner et al., 1981) , whereas others put greater emphasis on a deficit in retention (Hart, Kwentus, Harkins, & Taylor, 1988; Moss, Albert, Butters, & Payne, 1986) .\nLesion and functional imaging studies have suggested that learning and retention processes often are correlated but also show some independence and reflect different underlying neural processes (Moulin, James, Freeman, & Jones, 2004) "}]
