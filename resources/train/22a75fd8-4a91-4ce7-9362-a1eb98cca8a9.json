Agriculture is the primary land use in the drainage basin. Ninety-one percent of water use in the drainage basin in 1995 was for irrigation purposes (R.L. Tortorelli, USGS, written commun., 2001). Lake Altus supplies water to the Lugert-Altus Irrigation District using a 270-mile system of canals downstream from the dam (Oklahoma Water Resources Board, 2000) . Lake Altus was built by the Bureau of Reclamation from 1941 to 1948 for flood control, water supply for the City of Altus, and irrigation of about 46,000 acres (A. Ensley, LugertAltus Irrigation District, oral commun., 2002). The LugertAltus Irrigation District annually supplies more than 85,000 acre-feet of water for agricultural purposes (Oklahoma Water Resources Board, 2000) . The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, investigated new techniques to improve water-use estimates for irrigation purposes in the Lake Altus drainage basin ( fig. 1 ). Empirical estimates of reference evapotranspiration, crop evapotranspiration, and crop irrigation water requirements for alfalfa, corn, cotton, hay, peanuts, sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, and wheat were calculated on a monthly and seasonal basis from September 1999 to October 2000 using an evapotranspiration model by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) . The model is commonly referred to as the radiation method and is accurate in arid and sub-humid areas and less accurate near the ocean in cooler climates (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1993) . These empirical estimates of irrigation water use were used with estimated irrigated acres to calculate irrigation water use in the Lake Altus drainage basin in Oklahoma and Texas."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "The purpose of this report is to present the techniques and results of an effort to map irrigated crop acres in the Lake Altus drainage basin using satellite imagery and remote sensing tech- Estimates of water use for irrigation provided in this report will facilitate better management of water resources in the Lake Altus drainage basin.

The irrigation water requirements presented in this report can be used with estimates of irrigated acres from anywhere in the drainage basin to calculate irrigation water use."}, {"section_title": "Description of Study Area", "text": "The study area consists of the Lake Altus drainage basin ( fig.1 ). Lake Altus is located on the border of Greer and Kiowa Counties in southwestern Oklahoma, approximately 20 miles north of the town of Altus. The drainage area for Lake Altus is approximately 2,515 square miles, 399 square miles of which are non-contributing (Blazs and others, 2001 ). Most of the drainage basin, includes parts of Beckham, Carson, Gray, and Wheeler Counties (table 1) .\nThe North Fork Red River is the major source of surfacewater inflow for Lake Altus. The North Fork Red River is one of five major tributaries of the Red River. U.S. Geological Survey streamflow-monitoring station 07301500, North Fork Red River Near Carter, Oklahoma, recorded a mean annual flow of 93,230 acre-feet from 1945 through 2000 (Blazs and others, 2001 ). Average annual precipitation in the study area ranges from about 18 inches in the west at the headwaters to 26 inches near Lake Altus in the east (Daly and others, 1994) .\nAgriculture is the major land use and is mainly supported by water from the High Plains Aquifer, also referred to as the Ogallala Aquifer, and alluvial and terrace deposits along the North Fork Red River.\nThe High Plains Aquifer is an unconsolidated and semiconsolidated aquifer of Tertiary age and associated alluvial and terrace deposits are of Quaternary age (Havens and others, 1985, p. 348) . The High Plains Aquifer consists mostly of fine sand and silts with lesser quantities of clay, gravel, and minor beds of limestone and caliche (Hart and others, 1976 ). Well yields range from 100 to 1,000 gallons per minute; with some yields exceeding 1,500 gallons per minute (Havens and others, 1985, p. 347) .\nThe North Fork Red River alluvial and Beckham and Tillman terrace deposits consist of silt, clay, and gravel grading downward into fine to coarse sand (Havens and others, 1985, p. 348 ). Well yields range from 100 -200 gallons per minute in the alluvium and 200 -500 gallons per minute in the Beckham and Tillman terrace (Havens and others, 1985, p. 348) .\nThe length of growing season for crops is closely related to temperature and has a substantial effect on the amount of water used by crops. There are two primary growing seasons in the Lake Altus drainage basin. Winter wheat is grown in the first growing season, which occurs from early October through early May (peak greenness), with harvesting in early June (McDaniels, 1960 , and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1998). Corn, cotton, peanuts, sorghum, soybeans, and sunflowers are grown in the second growing season, which occurs from midMarch through late July to mid-August (peak greenness) with harvesting in September or November (McDaniels, 1960, and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1998) . Heimes and Luckey (1982) describe a method for estimating historical irrigation water requirements for the High Plains Aquifer from 1949 though 1978. There were two primary components used to estimate irrigation water use; irrigated crop acres and crop irrigation requirements. The report by Heimes and Luckey (1982) acquired estimates of irrigated acres by county from the Census of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1949 Commerce, to 1978 . A modified version of the BlaneyCriddle formula was used to estimate irrigation water requirements for major crops growing above the High Plains Aquifer (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1970) . The Modified BlaneyCriddle differs from the original Blaney-Criddle in that two adjustment factors are used to better estimate crop evapotranspiration. A climate coefficient correlates monthly crop evapotranspiration with the mean monthly temperature, and a growthstage coefficient tracks crop growth development throughout the growing cycle. The Modified Blaney-Criddle method is "}, {"section_title": "Previous Study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Historical Freshwater Withdrawals", "text": "Freshwater withdrawal estimates for 1995 were obtained for 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 11120301 and 11120302 ( fig. 1 ) from the U.S. Geological Survey (R.L. Tortorelli, USGS, written commun., 2001). Total consumptive use from the Lake Altus drainage basin was estimated to be 120,983 acre-feet or 108.15 million gallons per day. Consumptive use for irrigation was estimated to be 109,781 acre-feet or 98.24 million gallons per day (table 2). Ground water supplies about 69 percent of total self-supplied water withdraws in the drainage basin; whereas, surface water accounts for the remaining 31 percent. The western half (11120301) of the study area accounted for 61 percent of the total self-supplied withdrawals in the drainage basin because of greater withdrawals from the High Plains Aquifer for irrigation. Withdrawals in the western half (11120301) are predominantly supplied by ground water (94 percent); whereas, withdrawals in the eastern half (11120302) are predominantly supplied by surface water (72 percent) (table 2).\nIrrigation accounts for 82 percent of total self-supplied water withdrawals in the drainage basin. However, the majority of surface-water withdrawals and irrigated acres in the eastern half are utilized downstream in the Altus-Lugert Irrigation District. The distribution of other less prevalent self-supplied withdrawals included 4.9 percent for public use, 4.5 percent for livestock use, 4.4 percent for industrial use, 3.6 percent for mining use, and 0.4 percent for domestic use (calculated from table 2). Detailed explanations of water use terms used in this section can be acquired at URL http://ok.water.usgs.gov/wateruse/definitions.html (table 3) . Ancillary information from the National Land Cover Dataset 1992 (NLCD) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2002b) and ground reference crop data from the FSA county offices were used to aid in the development of spectral signatures used to classify pixel classes. The NLCD is categorized into broad land-cover types and identifies three classes of agriculture: row crops, small grains, and hay/pasture. These classes were used as an ancillary data source to aid in the crop delineation.\nIrrigated crop acres were determined using a ratio vegetation index consisting of a near infrared band (band 4) divided by a visible red band (band 3) ratio to create the vegetation index (Qi and others, 2002) . The near infrared band and visible red band ratio enhances certain features such as greenness of vegetation not generally visible. The resulting images consisted of a single gray-scale band with bright white pixels representing irrigated crop acres ( fig. 2 ). Non-irrigated vegetation was displayed as ranges of gray. A threshold value was selected at which everything greater than that value was considered to be irrigated; everything less than that value was considered to be non-irrigated. Threshold values were selected for each Landsat scene based on the radiometric balancing applied to each Landsat scene. Some editing was required to remove riparian areas or to add known irrigated agriculture that was less than the threshold value. Appendices 1 through 10 provide county-specific information on the number of pixels and number of acres for 25 land use classes in parts of each county in the drainage basin determined from the mapping process. A null pixel class is listed in the appendices and represents the part of a county that is outside the portion of the drainage basin in the county.\nIdentification of crop types with Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery is a routine application of remote sensing technology. Image date selection is vital for successful identification of many vegetation covers, especially agricultural crops (Rundquist and others, 2002) . Identification of agricultural crops using satellite imagery requires knowledge of crop phenology, climate for the particular growing season, and ground reference information about specific agricultural practices in the drainage basin. The best date range to identify winter wheat is between late March through early May, when wheat is at peak greenness. To identify corn and other summer crops, the best date range is late July to mid-August.\nThe original study plan was to use the same imagery used in the generation of the NLCD and in the High Plains Aquifer study (Qi and others, 2002) because two dates were used, a winter leaf-off date and a summer leaf-on date. However, these dates were less than optimal for crop delineation. The dates for the selected imagery used for this report were selected to occur "}, {"section_title": "Preprocessing", "text": "The ETM+ is a multispectral scanning radiometer that is carried on the Landsat 7 satellite. The ETM+ radiometer provides data from eight spectral bands and can be ordered in varying levels of calibration. Systematic correction Level 1G images were used for this report. The Level 1G product incorporates both a radiometric and geometric correction to images. The images are rotated to north, aligned, coarsely georeferenced to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, and resampled to 28.5-meter pixel resolution using a nearest neighbor algorithm (Research Systems Incorporated, 2001 ). Two of the spectral bands are eliminated from processing: spectral band 1 because of data redundancy and thermal spectral band 6 because it measures transmitted energy (the other bands measure reflected energy).\nThe images were referenced to the UTM projection and projected to fit the Albers equal-area projection. Individual image scenes were merged and cropped to the basin boundary to speed and facilitate processing. The final classification images consisted of three composite images for the study area two in early spring to map winter wheat and one in summer to map the remaining crops. Mapping of land use and irrigated croplands was done in two stages. The first stage consisted of determining land use, the second stage consisted of determining specific irrigated crops.\nGround-reference data were compiled from FSA and NRCS county offices for each county in the basin using a ran- dom approach. A random selection of points was generated for areas known to be, or thought to be, irrigated in the drainage basin. Maps of these areas were sent to each FSA county office in the drainage basin. County offices were asked to identify the crop types and irrigation status. The data were generally provided as an annotated photocopy of the office aerial photograph of the particular field in question. The field boundaries were then digitized using the satellite image and annotated with the comments provided by the FSA office ( fig. 4) . Half of the returned ground-reference data were used in the generation of training signatures and the other half were used for accuracy assessment at the end of the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment", "text": "An accuracy assessment of the cell classifications was completed for the drainage basin using ground-reference data. Segments from four counties (Beckham, Carson, Gray, and Greer) were used for the assessment. Confusion matrices (probability matrices of land-use classes) were generated using the final classified image and the accuracy segments. An accuracy of 69.6960 percent with a kappa coefficient of 0.0007 was achieved. The low kappa coefficient was a result of the low number of accuracy segments and the lack of representation of all classes in the final classified image. In addition to the class confusion matrix, errors of commission/omission, producer and user accuracies also were examined."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions to Increase Accuracy", "text": "Two of the primary determinants of accuracy in defining irrigated crops are the dates of the Landsat images and number of the ground-reference data samples. To correlate the peak growth of individual crops with the best Landsat image date, there must be sufficient ground-truth data regarding the distribution of crop types and irrigation practices. Required information includes: (1) date of planting and harvest in order to interpolate the dates of peak growth and greenness, and (2) number of harvested acres for each crop by county to determine the number of ground-truth data to collect for each crop. With knowledge of peak greenness of each crop in a given season, the number of Landsat image dates can be better determined. For example, the peak greenness for corn during the 2000 growing season may have been in mid-June, but peak greenness for soybeans may have been in early June. In that case, two Landsat image dates would be required to achieve the greatest accuracy in determining irrigated crops."}, {"section_title": "Remotely Sensed Irrigated Crop Acres 11", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Landsat", "text": "Even with the correct date selection and ground-reference data, there are limitations to using Landsat multispectral satellite imagery because of limitations of spectral range and spatial resolution (5 multispectral bands at 30-meter spatial resolution).

Hyperspectral sensors with broader spectral ranges and higher spatial resolutions may enable greater distinction "}, {"section_title": "Remotely Sensed Irrigated Crop Acres", "text": "Remotely sensed irrigated crop acres were determined for portions of the following Oklahoma counties in the Lake Altus drainage basin: Beckham, Greer, Kiowa, Roger Mills, and Washita.

Alfalfa, peanuts, and wheat were the only crops determined to be irrigated in the five counties. Irrigated acres of alfalfa, peanuts, and wheat were greatest in Beckham County. A total of 70 percent of irrigated wheat, 68 percent of irrigated alfalfa, and 51 percent of irrigated peanuts in the Oklahoma counties occurred in Beckham County.\nRemotely sensed irrigated crop acres were determined for the following Texas counties: Carson, Donley, Gray, Potter, and Wheeler.

The TWDB collects water use and irrigation information for Texas using two survey compilation methods. The first survey reporting method collects information annually regarding the sum of irrigated acres in a county and by 8-digit HUC watershed, but not specific information about individual crops that are irrigated. The second survey is a detailed irrigation survey and is a cooperative effort between the NRCS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board, and the TWDB.

Climate conditions during the 2000 growing season were extremely dry and hot in most of the study area and were not representative of a typical growing season in the drainage basin.

During July and August, average monthly temperatures ranged from 80 degrees Fahrenheit in Roger Mills County to 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Kiowa County (Howard Johnson, Oklahoma Climatological Survey, written commun., 2001).

Irrigation water use for alfalfa calculated from the remotely sensed irrigated crop acres was 39,011 acre-feet (table 10) ; whereas, irrigation water use calculated from reported irrigated crop acres from the OWRB and TWDB was 5,635 acre-feet (table 11) , a 150 percent difference ( fig. 10) . Most of the large differences in irrigation water use for alfalfa (19,469 acre-feet) were due to irrigation water use estimates calculated from remotely sensed irrigated acres of alfalfa in Beckham County (table 4) . Difficulty in determining irrigated alfalfa probably was caused in part by a very wet spring and early summer in Oklahoma counties. Another possible reason for the differences could be caused by alfalfa being harvested every couple of months. Alfalfa could have been harvested prior to acquisition of imagery used to map irrigated alfalfa. Comparing irrigation water use for corn, sorghum, and wheat calculated from the remotely sensed irrigated crop acres with those calculated from irrigated crop acres reported by the OWRB and TWDB, there was a 60 percent difference for corn, a 129 percent difference for sorghum, and a 77 percent difference for soybeans ( fig. 10 ). Irrigation water use for cotton, hay, and sunflowers was calculated from the OWRB and TWDB reported acres (total of 20,192 acre-feet), but could not be calculated from the remotely sensed acres because they were not successfully identified during the mapping of irrigated acres from remote sensing techniques and Landsat imagery (tables 10 and 11).\nThis report provides two estimates of irrigation water use calculated using the same evapotranspiration model with identical model parameters. Differences between the two irrigation water use estimates result from differences between the remotely sensed irrigated acres and irrigated acres reported by OWRB and the TWDB. Image date selection is vital to accurately determine irrigated crops. Images are taken from the Landsat ETM+ satellite that rotate back to a specific geographic location every 16 days. By having to determine irrigated acres for a specific growing season and having to acquire imagery as close as possible to maximum greenness for individual crops on a cloud free day, few images were available that could be used to determine irrigated crops. For instance, in Carson County, some harvesting could have occurred just before the date of image acquisition, which would cause irrigated acres to be underestimated. Having several months of above average precipitation preceding the date of image acquisition could cause non-irrigated lands to be classified as irrigated, which would cause irrigated acres to be overestimated, as in Beckham County.\nEven with correct date selection, limitations to using Landsat multispectral satellite imagery include spectral range and spatial resolution. Some agricultural crops or vegetation species are too spectrally similar to be differentiated by Landsat. Hyperspectral sensors with broader spectral ranges and resolutions may enable greater distinction of vegetation classes. With multispectral sensors such as Landsat, there are only 5 broad spectral bands of recorded information; hyperspectral sensors can range from 36 to 224 spectral bands of recorded information. With an increased spectral range and resolution, it may be possible to better identify subtle changes in chlorophyll absorption that relate to different vegetation species and health of a vegetation species.

The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Bureau of Reclamation, investigated new techniques to improve estimates of irrigation water use in the Lake Altus drainage basin. Empirical estimates of reference evapotranspiration, crop evapotranspiration, and crop irrigation water requirements for nine major crops were calculated for the 2000 growing season, September 1999 to October 2000 using a solar radiation-based evapotranspiration model and estimates of irrigated crop acres.\nLandsat 7 ETM+ imagery was used to map land use and irrigated crop acres during the 2000 growing season. Land use was mapped using a supervised clustering algorithm based on statistical signatures for 25 pixel classes. Irrigated crop acres were determined using a ratio vegetation index that consisted of a near infrared band divided by a visible red band. A total of 78,612 acres were determined to be irrigated. Beckham County had the greatest number of irrigated crop acres in Oklahoma counties, followed by Roger Mills, Greer, Kiowa, and Washita. Carson County had the largest number of irrigated crop acres in Texas counties, followed by Gray, Wheeler, Potter, and Donley Counties. Seventy-four percent of the total irrigated crop acreage in the drainage basin occurred in Texas counties. One hundred percent of irrigated corn, sorghum, and soybeans in the drainage basin occurred in Texas. Eighty-nine percent or 38,677 acres of irrigated wheat occurred in Texas. Eighty-one percent or 13,768 acres of irrigated alfalfa and 71 percent or 1,583 acres of irrigated peanuts occurred in Oklahoma.\nReported estimates of irrigated crop acres were compiled and summarized for the 2000 growing season from the OWRB and TWDB. A total of 98,322 acres were determined to be irrigated. Beckham County had the greatest number of irrigated crop acres in Oklahoma counties, followed by Greer, Kiowa, and Roger Mills. Carson County had the greatest number of irrigated crop acres in Texas counties, followed by Gray, Wheeler, Potter, Donley, and Randall. Ninety-four percent of the total irrigated crop acres were in Texas counties. One hundred percent of irrigated sunflowers and soybeans, 99 percent of wheat, 98 percent of sorghum and corn, and 91 percent of irrigated cotton in the drainage basin occurred in Texas. Only irrigated alfalfa and irrigated peanuts had more acreage in Oklahoma than in Texas.\nAccording to irrigation water use calculated from the remotely sensed irrigated acres, there was an estimated 154,920 acre-feet of water used for irrigation in the Lake Altus drainage basin during the 2000 growing season. Seventy-four percent of the irrigation water use in the drainage basin occurred in Texas counties. Irrigation water use was greatest for wheat with an estimated 80,692 acre-feet, or 52 percent of the total irrigation water use in the drainage basin. Irrigation water use for alfalfa was 39,011 acre-feet, or 25 percent of the total irrigation water use. Irrigation water use for corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat was greatest in Carson County, Texas; whereas, most of the irrigation water use for alfalfa and peanuts occurred in Beckham County.\nAccording to irrigation water use calculated from the state reported irrigated acres, there was an estimated 196,026 acrefeet of water used for irrigation in the Lake Altus drainage basin during the 2000 growing season. Ninety-four percent of the total irrigation water use occurred in Texas. Irrigation water use was greatest for wheat with an estimated 90,955 acre-feet, or 46 percent of irrigation water use in the drainage basin. Irrigation water use for corn was 30,329 acre-feet, or 15 percent of the irrigation water use. Irrigation water use for alfalfa, corn, sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, and wheat was greatest in Carson County, Texas; whereas, irrigation water use for cotton and hay was greatest in Wheeler County, Texas. Irrigation water use for peanuts was greatest in Beckham County, Oklahoma.\nEstimates of irrigation water use calculated from remotely sensed irrigated acres were different than those determined from the state reported irrigated acres. The total volume of water used for irrigation calculated from remotely sensed acres was 154,920 acre-feet; whereas, irrigation water use calculated from the state reported irrigated acres was 196,026 acre-feet, a 23 percent difference. Irrigation water use for Carson County calculated from the remotely sensed acres was 58,555 acre-feet, whereas, irrigation water use calculated from irrigated crop acres reported from the state reported irrigated acres was 138,180 acre-feet, an 81 percent difference.
