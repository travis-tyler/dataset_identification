[{"section_title": "", "text": "agents. Attention is now being directed to Nrf2, a transcription factor that activates genes whose products are involved in deactivating electrophilic toxic compounds. Nrf2 can be activated by both natural and synthetic antioxidants (e.g. oltipraz, CDDO and its derivatives) [13] .\nSeveral cancers have been linked to inflammatory origin, as shown in Table 1 . Evidence now suggests that inflammation [15] may be associated with increased risk of the four 'big killers', i.e. prostate [16] , colon [17] , breast [18] and lung [19] cancer.\nIn the present article, we review epidemiological and clinical studies showing an association between use of antiinflammatory agents and risk reduction of these neoplasms."}, {"section_title": "prostate cancer", "text": "Proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), implicated in the multiple pathways that lead to carcinogenesis, is a result of inflammation and dietary influences [16] .\nPIA effects include increased cell death and regenerated cells with DNA damage. One pathway of prostate carcinogenesis involves the progression from normal epithelium to PIA to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and finally to cancer. PIA is also associated with glutathione S-transferase P1 and COX-2 expression. A PIA pathology consensus conference has completed a standardized classification system for PIA lesions, and the future publication of this system should enhance comparisons of PIA research results from different groups and advance the design of preventive interventions.\nWhile no large clinical trials have assessed the effect of aspirin or NSAIDs on prostate cancer risk, the epidemiological evidence is quite convincing. A Canadian nested case-control study in 2025 cases and 2150 controls showed that the exposure to NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors was associated with a reduced likelihood of prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.86] as was exposure to aspirin (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96) [20] .\nThese findings contradict the results of a similar study [21] in 1029 cases and 1029 controls that showed a lack of association between regular use of aspirin and prostate cancer risk (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89-1.25), regardless of frequency and duration of use.\nA lower risk of prostate cancer, due to long-term NSAID or aspirin use, has been found in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort [22] : 70 144 men have been screened and neither current aspirin use nor current use of NSAIDs (aspirin and other NSAIDs combined) was associated with prostate cancer risk, even at the highest usage level ( \u202160 pills per month). However, long-duration regular use ( \u202130 pills per month for \u20215 years) of NSAIDs was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.94]. Long-duration regular use of aspirin was also associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99).\nSimilar results came from a prospective study that reported for 1244 cases (all members of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) [23] . The RRs of prostate cancer comparing ever-with never-use were 0.76 (95% CI 0.54-1.07) for aspirin, 0.79 (95% CI 0.54-1.16) for non-aspirin NSAIDs and 0.71 (95% CI 0.49-1.02) for either medication. The association for ever-use of either aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs was more pronounced in men <70 years (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.27-1.03) than in men \u202170 years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.50-1.22)."}, {"section_title": "colorectal cancer", "text": "CRC is the second most common cancer in developed countries, with a lifetime risk of 5%, and about 1 million new cases worldwide every year. Most CRCs develop from adenomas and the most promising results for CRC prevention come from trials using aspirin and NSAIDs ( Table 2 ). The results of these randomized trials have clearly established a causal relationship between inflammation and colorectal carcinogenesis in humans. Both aspirin [5, [25] [26] [27] [28] and selective inhibitors of COX-2 [24, [29] [30] [31] reduce the risk of CRC and recurrent adenoma in healthy subjects as well as in high-risk patients.\nRecently, the effect of aspirin in two large randomized trials of CRC with reliable post-trial follow-up for >20 years was published [5] . There was a significant effect on cancer incidence [hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.87] after a latency of 10 years with a use of \u2021300 mg/day for 5 years, and was greatest 10-14 years after randomization (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.70). These results confirm data of 19 case-control studies (20 815 cases) and 11 cohort studies (1 136 110 individuals) [5] . The mechanism by which aspirin affects carcinogenesis in the colon is not yet clearly understood.\nIn a recent study Chan et al. [32] , investigated the expression of COX-2 in colorectal tumors, using tumor specimens from two large prospective studies (a total of 2 446 431 person-years of follow-up of 82 911 women and 47 363 men) in which an association was found between regular use of aspirin and reduced risk of CRC. They found a significant interaction effect with COX-2 overexpression: the protective effect of aspirin was strong with COX-2 overexpression (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.78), whereas it disappeared on tumors with weak or absent COX-2 overexpression (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73-1.26).\nThese trials and others found that the use of this class of drugs is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. In the APPROVe trial [29] , the use of rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19-3.11) and the effect became apparent after the first 18 months of treatment [33] . Similar results came from the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib Study [30] , where celecoxib use was associated with a dose-related increase in deaths from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarctions, strokes or heart failures (celecoxib 400 mg/day versus placebo: HR 2.3, 95% CI 0.9-5.5; celecoxib 800 mg/day [34] . Future studies using these agents will need to assess risk versus benefit ratio. Other anti-inflammatory agents have shown promise in preclinical studies and are being evaluated in clinical studies. NO-NSAIDs are particularly interesting in this regard. They are potent chemopreventive agents in mouse models and show low toxicity in clinical settings [35] . NF-jB is also a target for intervention with allopurinol. A population-based case-control study [36] showed that the use of allopurinol for at least 5 years was highly correlated with a diminished risk of CRC (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.71) after adjustment for other known risk factors. This safe anti-gout agent is being assessed in a 4-week preoperative phase IIa trial in subjects with large adenomas (data not published)."}, {"section_title": "breast cancer", "text": "Since different epidemiological studies on NSAIDs and breast cancer have produced mixed results, a direct relationship between breast cancer risk and use of NSAIDs cannot be demonstrated yet.\nIncident invasive cases of breast cancer from the Multiethnic Cohort of 98 920 women were identified from 1993 to 2002. Data on aspirin, acetaminophen, and other NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin) use were based on a self-administered questionnaire at baseline (1993-6). Using a Cox multivariate model, there was no association between breast cancer risk and duration of aspirin use for current or past users (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88-1.25 and HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.27 for \u20216 years of use, respectively) compared with non-users. However, duration of current use of other NSAID was protective [HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.95 for \u20216 years of use; P (trend) = 0.01] against the risk of breast cancer, while past use was not (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62-1.30 for \u20216 years of use). Analyses by ethnicity and hormone receptor status showed that the protective effect of current other NSAID use was limited to Caucasians and African Americans and to women with at least one positive hormone receptor [37] .\nThe Iowa Women's Health Study [38] found no associations between breast cancer risk and duration of aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID use for current or past users in a cohort of 22 507 women (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88-1.25 and HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.27 for \u20216 years of use, respectively) compared with nonusers.\nA prospective study, based on a cohort of 2292 early-stage breast cancer survivors, found an inverse association between current, regular ibuprofen use and breast cancer recurrence (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.98), but not with aspirin (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74-1.61) [39] . Annals of Oncology symposium article\nEvidence for an interaction of a genetic polymorphism of COX-2 (allele 8473) with NSAIDs to reduce the risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer has been found in a population-based case-control study, in which 1067 breast cancer cases and 1110 controls were genotyped [40] . Eight distinct haplotypes and 18 diplotypes were observed in the population. Overall, no significant associations between COX-2 haplotypes/diplotypes and breast cancer risk were observed. Among women who used aspirin or any NSAID there was little evidence for an interaction with the at-risk COX-2 genotypes, with one exception. Among women with hormone receptorpositive breast cancer, the reduced risk for any NSAID use was evident only among those who had at least one variant C allele of COX-2 8473 (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0; P for the interaction = 0.02).\nThe association of NSAID use with risk of breast cancer has been further investigated in the California Teachers' Study cohort, with special attention to risk of specific breast cancer subtypes and to type of NSAID used. Long-term daily use of NSAIDs was not associated with breast cancer risk overall. Ibuprofen use was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and long-term daily aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor/progesterone receptornegative breast cancer [41] ."}, {"section_title": "lung cancer", "text": "Substantial data suggest that inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and that various antiinflammatory compounds can prevent cancer development. Wattenberg and others showed that both systemic and inhaled steroids, which inhibit the generation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, inhibit the development of lung adenomas and carcinomas in mice [42] . Based on this rationale, Lam et al. [43] conducted a phase IIb randomized placebo-controlled trial of inhaled budesonide in persons with bronchial dysplasia. Although the 6-month treatment did not result in regression of the central airway dysplasias (the primary study end point), there was an increased rate of resolution of CT-detected peripheral nodules (a secondary end point).These human and animal data suggest that future prevention trials should focus on the peripheral lung. A randomized phase IIb trial of inhaled budesonide is underway at the EIO, Milan, in heavy smokers to assess the effect on CT-detected undetermined peripheral nodules.\nA prospective study did not found any relevant associations between aspirin use and risk of lung cancer in 109 348 women in the Nurses' Health Projects from 1980 to 2004. Risk of lung cancer was 16% lower, but non-significant for regular aspirin users of one or two tablets per week and a significant 55% higher for users of \u202115 tablets per week compared with women who never regularly used aspirin [44] .\nA case-control study of selective COX-2 blocking agents and lung cancer aimed to verify the relationship between aspirin and lung cancer risk in a cohort study of 492 women. Data regarding type, frequency and duration of use of selective COX-2 inhibitors (primarily celecoxib or rofecoxib) and non-selective NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and aspirin have been reported in a pooled analysis. ORs for selective COX-2 inhibitors were adjusted for past use of other NSAIDs. Use of any selective COX-2 inhibitor for >1 year produced a significant (60%) reduction in the risk of lung cancer (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.81). Observed risk reductions were consistent for men (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.62) and women (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24-1.13) and for individual COX-2 inhibitors (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.67, for celecoxib and OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19-1.56, for rofecoxib). Intake of ibuprofen or aspirin also produced significant risk reductions (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.73 and OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.82, respectively), whereas acetaminophen, an analgesic with negligible COX-2 activity, had no effect on the risk (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.53-3.37). These results suggest for the first time that selective COX-2 blocking agents have strong potential for the chemoprevention of human lung cancer [45] .\nTo further explore whether use of aspirin or other specific NSAIDs may protect against lung cancer, a case-control study nested in a cohort of subjects 40-84 years old in 1995-2004 was conducted. A random sample of 10 000 controls was frequencymatched to the cases for age, sex and calendar year. A total of 4336 cases were identified with primary incident lung cancer (incidence rate 7.6 per 10 000 person-years). Compared with subjects with no prescription of non-aspirin NSAID prior to the index date, the risk of lung cancer was 0.76 (95% CI 0.61-0.94) among those who received a prescription the previous year and had a treatment duration of at least 1 year. The corresponding RR was 1.15 (95% CI 0.99-1.34) for aspirin.\nIn conclusion, prescription of non-aspirin NSAIDs for at least 1 year might be associated with a slightly reduced risk of lung cancer [46] .\nThe American Health Foundation conducted a case-control study of 1038 patients and 1002 controls that suggests a possible chemoprotective benefit with the use of NSAIDs among individuals who are former or current smokers. The relative risk estimate of lung carcinoma associated with using NSAIDs three or more times a week for \u20211 or more years demonstrated an OR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.53-0.89). Results were similar when separated by lung histologic type. The association varied by smoking status: the OR was 1.28 (95% CI 0.73 to 2.25) in never-smokers and 0.60 (95% CI 0.45-0.80) in ever-smokers [47] .\nIn conclusion, the results from epidemiological studies point to a sound association between use of antiinflammatory agents and reduced cancer risk of the four major killers. In the clinical setting, the evidence for a protective effect of aspirin on CRC risk is already established, but the fear of side-effects, unclear knowledge on its optimal dose and duration, and lack of knowledge in the medical and lay communities as a result of scant commercial interest have limited its use so far. Future translational clinical trials may provide stronger mechanistic evidence for a role of aspirin and other NSAIDs, including low-dose COX-2 inhibitors, in the clinical prevention of several common cancers.
