[{"section_title": "31", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus 32 disease 2019 , was first reported in Wuhun, Hubei, China in late December 2019 [1, 2] . 33 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae [3] . It is the 34 seventh known coronavirus capable of infecting human, after HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV NL63, 35 HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. The former four typically cause non-lethal mild upper 36 respiratory diseases, while the latter two and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe lethal respiratory 37 illnesses [4, 5] . 38 39 On 30 January 2020, approximately one month after the first reported outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 40 China, the virus was found to spread to 19 countries, and the World Health Organization (WHO) 41 declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] . After the virus 42 was found to spread to 114 countries, the WHO recognised COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 43 2020, the first one to be caused by a coronavirus [7] . As of now (27 May 2020), the virus had spread 44 to 213 countries and territories around the world, infecting more than 5,700,000 people [8] , and this 45 rapid surge of patients had quickly overwhelmed hospitals in many countries. Although the case-46 fatality ratio of SARS-CoV-2 (~3-6% [8, 9] ) is lower than those of SARS-CoV (11%) [10, 11] and CoV (34-37%) [12] , due to the great number of infected cases, the number of deaths caused by 48 SARS-CoV-2 is much greater than those by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To date, at least 350,000 49 deaths had been reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [8] . 50 51 The incubation period for COVID-19 is ~4-5 days, with most cases (97.5%) develop symptoms within 52 11-12 days of infection [13] . However, studies have reported that 5-80% of infected cases might be 53 asymptomatic [14] . Several asymptomatic (and presymptomatic) transmissions have been reported 54 [15] , suggesting roles of asymptomatic infections in the transmission and spread of the disease. 55\nIndeed, it has been proposed that \"asymptomatic carriers is a challenge to containment\" [16] and 56 that \"asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the Achilles' heel of . To effectively combat with the spread of the disease, this is therefore important to understand 58 the COVID-19 pathogenesis, and its underlying factors. 59 60 Several host factors that are positively correlated with the COVID-19 severity have been identified, 61 including patient age [9, 18] , low level of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell counts, and the high levels of IL-6 and 62 . On the other hand, viral factors associated with the COVID-19 severity are still yet to be 63 determined. There are currently more than 30,000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from around 64 .

This enabled us to 66 examine viral genetic variations that might be correlated with the severity of COVID-19 on the global 67 scale. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 152 SARS-CoV-2 68 genomes to identify potential viral genetic variations that might be associated with the COVID-19 69 severity. 70 .

At the time of this study, 73 152 genome sequences were full-length (>29,000 nucleotides (nt)), generated from original clinical 74 samples, and had unambiguous patient status, which could be confidently determined either as 75 \"asymptomatic\" or \"symptomatic\" (see Materials and Methods). To allow for accurate identification 76 of viral genetic factors associated with COVID-19 severity, only these sequences were analysed. 77\nTogether with 500 randomly sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID, all which were full-length 78 and had a high sequencing coverage (but did not have clear patient information), we reconstructed a 79 maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny to examine how these 152 SARS-CoV-2 isolates are related to 80 one another and to other sequences. We found that they covered a wide diversity of SARS-CoV-2, 81 distributing across the entire tree (Figure 1 ). According to the classification scheme and method 82 described in [21] , these 152 genomes comprised 16 distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 1) . The 83 distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were different across lineages however 84 (\u03a7 2 test: score = 50.67, degree of freedom = 28, p-value = 0.005). While symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 85 were found across almost all 16 lineages, majority of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in this dataset were 86 predominantly found to be those of lineage B and B.5. Mirroring this observation, asymptomatic 87 viruses in this dataset were mostly isolated from patients exposed to the virus in Japan (60/72 = 88 83.33%) and India (6/72 = 8.33%), while symptomatic cases were found around the globe ( Table 2) "}, {"section_title": "97", "text": ".

The estimated ML tree ( Figure  106 1) was used for the population structure correction. Our analysis identified genetic variations at the 107 nucleotide position 11,083 (with respect to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, accession 108 number: NC_045512) to be significantly associated with the disease severity (Figure 2 ). By applying 109 this analysis to all bootstrap trees, we found that this genomic position was identified 751/1,000 = 110 75.1% of the times, suggesting that our result was robust to the population structure uncertainty. 111 112 Two genetic variations were observed at the nucleotide position 11,083, namely thymine (11083T, 113 75/152 = 49.34%) and guanine (11083G, 72/152 = 47.37%). 5 sequences (5/152 = 3.29%) had 114 undetermined nucleotides at this site. We found that asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 tended to have 115 11083T (N(11083T)/N(11083G) = 60/7), while viruses causing symptomatic cases tended to have 116 11083G (N(11083T)/N(11083G) = 15/65) (Figure 2) . The relative risk ratio of developing symptoms 117 given 11083G to 11083T is (65/72)/(15/75) = 4.51 times (95% confident interval = 2.85-7.14), and 118 the odd ratio was estimated to be 37.14 by the Wald method (95% confident interval = 14.17-119 97.33). A study of SARS-CoV-2 from a Shanghai cohort has indeed identified the 11083T variant to be 120 more prevalent in asymptomatic cases (9 in 91 cases = 9.89%) compared to symptomatic cases (1 in 121 21 cases = 4.76%), but the association was not significant [19] . This was likely due to their relatively 122 small data set (N = 112), and different groupings of the disease outcome (where mild symptomatic 123 .

Another study identified this 125 nucleotide position as being under a positive selection pressure [25] , consistent with our finding. The 126 closest relative of SAR-CoV-2 currently known is the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (GenBank accession 127 number: MN996532) [26] , and it has a G at this position, suggesting that G is the ancestral state. We 128 hence designated this mutation 11083G>T. This mutation locates in the coding region of non-129 structural protein 6 (nsp6, nt 10973-11842), coded by ORF1ab (nt 266-21,555). 11083G>T is a non- \nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 2, 2020. Interaction between host microRNAs (miRNAs) and viral transcripts has been implicated in 148 pathogenesis of viral diseases [27] . In this study, we examined whether the two virus variants have 149 different modes of binding to human miRNAs by querying their nucleotide sequences against the 150 miRNA database miRDB [28] . Although a coronavirus genome is a positive-sense RNA, negative-151 sense genomic RNAs are nonetheless generated during their replication, presenting a possibility that 152 it might also interact with human miRNAs. We therefore examined both positive-and negative-153 strands of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. 154 155 On the positive strand, two miRNAs were predicted to uniquely target the 11083G with the same 156 (highest) scores, namely miR-485-3p (5'-GUCAUACACGGCUCUCCUCUCU-3') and miR-539-3p (5'-157 AUCAUACAAGGACAAUUUCUUU-3'). These two miRNAs belong to the same miRNA cluster (chr14: 158 101,047,321-101,047,398, and chr14: 101,055,419-101,055,491, respectively), and share identical 159 seed sequences (5'-UCAUACA-3'), spanning the nt 11,083 (11,082-11,088) (Figure 3) . By using the 160 negative-sense sequence as a query, miR-3149 (5'-UUUGUAUGGAUAUGUGUGUGUAU-3') was 161 predicted to bind to the 11083G variant, and not the 11083T variant (nt c11087-11080). Our 162 analyses did not identify miRNAs that specifically target the 11083T variant but not the 11083G 163 variant. This suggested that the two variants might interact with these three miRNAs differently.

To date, there are more than 30,000 sequences 211 of SARS-CoV-2 genomes made publicly available on the GISAID database [20] , and many of these 212 sequences have patient information available. This allowed us to investigate viral genetic factors 213 that might be associated with the COVID-19 severity. 214\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 2, 2020. . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 Methods 233 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with patient status 234 Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with patient status were downloaded from the GISAID database 235\n[20] on 18/05/2020 with their metadata. To allow for accurate determination of genetic factors 236 associated with COVID-19 severity, we only analysed sequences whose patient status could be 237 unambiguously determined as either \"asymptomatic\" or \"symptomatic\". We designated a virus to 238 cause an asymptomatic infection if its patient status was either \"Asymptomatic/Released\" or 239 \"asymptomatic\". A virus was determined to cause a symptomatic infection if the patient status was 240 either \"Hospitalized in ICU\", \"Hospitalized/Deceased\", \"ICU; Serious\", \"Intensive Care Unit\", 241 \"pneumonia (chest X-ray)\", \"Severe/ICU\", or \"Symptomatic\". Sequences that were not generated 242 from original clinical samples were excluded. Those with ambiguous nucleotides greater than 5% of 243 the total sequence length, and whose total lengths were less than 29,500 nucleotides were also 244 excluded from downstream analyses. Although EPI_ISL_417919 was found to fit the inclusion 245 criteria, manual inspection revealed that it contained many unique nucleotide variants surrounding 246 its multiple undetermined regions of \"N\"s, likely due to sequencing and / or assembly errors, and 247 had about 4.28% of undetermined nucleotides. It was thus also excluded from our dataset. In total, 248 our dataset comprised 152 sequences. A table of acknowledgements for the sequences used in this 249 study can be found in Table S1 . (Table  258 S1), all of which were full-length and had a high sequencing coverage. Together with the 152 259 genomes with patient status, a manually-curated multiple sequence alignment of 652 SARS-CoV-2 260 genomes was constructed. Potential recombination within the alignment was checked by using RDP, 261 GENECONV, Chimera, MaxChi, and 3Seq, all implemented in Recombination Detection Program 4 262 [42] . Sites with more than 50% ambiguous nucleotides were excluded from recombination analysis. 263\nSites with the most common nucleotide present in more than 99% of the sequences were also 264 .

The estimated ML tree was used 275 for the population structure correction. The tree was rooted by assuming that lineage A and B of 276 SARS-CoV-2 are monophyletic, and was pruned to contain only those with patient status before the 277 analysis as recommended. Three tests of association were performed, including the \"terminal\", 278 \"simultaneous\", and \"subsequent\" tests. Sites with more than 50% ambiguous nucleotides were 279 removed. Sites with the most common nucleotide present in more than 95% of the sequences were 280 also removed. Only 15 variant loci remained after the filtering. Ancestral states of both genetic and 281 phenotypic data were inferred under a maximum likelihood framework as implemented in the 282 package. The number of sites simulated for estimating the null distribution was 1,000\u00d715 = 15,000 283 sites. The overall threshold of significance was set to 5%, and corrected to be 5%/15/3 = 0.11% in 284 each test under the Bonferonni multiple-testing correction criteria as recommended. An association 285 was considered significant if it was detected by at least one of the three tests aforementioned. We 286 also apply this analysis to all of the 1,000 trees in the bootstrap tree distribution obtained from the 287 phylogenetic analysis described above to examine the robustness of the result. Our analyses robustly 288 identified nucleotide variations at the genomic position 11,083 (with respect to the reference SARS-289\nCoV-2 genome, NC_045512) to be significantly associated with the disease severity. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
