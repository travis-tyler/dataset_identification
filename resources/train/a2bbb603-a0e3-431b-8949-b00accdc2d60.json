[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT\nBackground"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Modifiable vascular risk factors, such as systolic hypertension [1] , diabetes mellitus [2] , and smoking [3, 4] are associated with an increased incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia, likely due to effects on cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) contributing to abnormal cognitive aging [5] . Cerebral SVD exists in the majority of pathologically-confirmed dementia cases [6] and disrupts network connectivity [7, 8] , conferring cognitive impairment and decline [9] . Longitudinal data from large-scale multicenter collaborations (i.e., the Leukoaraiosis and Disability (LADIS) Study) are increasingly substantiating the role of cerebral SVD and white matter changes in contributing to cognitive and motor declines, depressive symptomatology, and reduction of functional autonomy with aging [10] , including clinical manifestation of vascularrelated dementia [11] .\nCerebral SVD is the most common pathology to co-occur with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [12, 13] , lowers the threshold for clinical expression of AD pathology [14] , and compromises the efficacy of anti-amyloid therapy [15] . Extant literature has yet to fully establish the extent to which AD and SVD confer disparate versus overlapping pathological cascades, constituting a critical knowledge gap with important implications for identifying effective prevention and treatment targets. Even if SVD and AD represent unique injury pathways, these two disease processes may exacerbate one another and compromise the aging brain in a synergistic manner [13] .\nCerebral white matter is particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury from SVD in advanced age [16] , but little is known about whether co-occurring AD pathology affects susceptibility to white matter damage, including axonal injury, in response to vascular risk factors. Animal models of compromised cerebrovascular function suggest ischemia promotes diffuse amyloid precursor protein expression [17] and increased A\uf062 deposition [18] . Given that A\uf062 clearance occurs through vascular-mediated pathways across the blood-brain barrier [19] and through interstitial fluid bulk flow between perivascular basement membranes [20, 21] , cerebral SVD may propagate A\uf062 deposition by interfering with the integrity of clearance pathways [22] , contributing to worse disease trajectory [23, 24] . Progressive degeneration of cholinergic cells in AD can also disrupt regional cerebral blood flow homeostasis [25, 26] , increasing susceptibility of the cerebral vasculature to damage [27, 28] . Overall, vascular risk likely drives cognitive and neurodegenerative changes through non-AD pathways [29] but concomitantly exacerbates AD-related damage once neural injury exists [30] .\nA current limitation in understanding the implications of SVD is that the cerebral microvasculature is too small to be clearly visualized in vivo, thus interfering with prompt diagnosis and intervention [31] . Accordingly, there is a pressing need to better characterize underlying physiological changes related to cerebrovascular disease burden and unhealthy brain aging [31] . Neurofilament light (NFL) is a protein polymer found in large-caliber myelinated axons. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of NFL are posited to reflect axonal injury [32] and correlate with white matter damage and clinical severity across neurodegenerative diseases [33] [34] [35] . Unlike the mechanistically heterogeneous nature of white matter hyperintensities observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), which correspond to multiple structural changes and pathological processes [36] , CSF concentrations of NFL allow for measurement of axonal injury. Accordingly, CSF NFL offers a means of measuring axonal damage in the aging brain. Given the high prevalence of vascular-related health problems among older adults at risk for AD [37] , more research is warranted to elucidate how burgeoning AD pathology influences the aging brain's vulnerability to vascular-related damage, including axonal injury. This research topic is especially clinically relevant given the modifiable nature of most vascular risk factors and paucity of promising prevention and treatment targets for AD.\nIn the current study, we assess how vascular risk burden as measured by the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) relates to axonal injury as measured by CSF NFL in the context of varying degrees of concomitant AD pathology. The FSRP is a composite measure of vascular risk burden. Originally designed to predict incidents of clinical stroke, FSRP scores also correspond to neuroimaging evidence of cerebral SVD, including white matter hyperintensities [38, 39] silent cerebral infarcts [40, 41] , and microbleeds [42] . We leveraged the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, which represents a spectrum from normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and clinical AD. In doing so, we are able to (a) test interactions between FSRP and cognitive diagnosis to determine whether FSRP and NFL associations depend on the presence of clinical symptoms and (b) test interactions between FSRP and AD CSF biomarkers (i.e., A\uf06242, total tau [t-tau], and phosphorylated tau [p-tau]) to determine how associations differ as a function of co-occurring evidence of AD. Since co-occurring cerebrovascular disease and AD synergistically confer worse clinical outcomes [43, 44] , we hypothesize that the association between FSRP and CSF NFL will be strongest with increased AD pathology defined as presence of abnormal concentrations of AD CSF biomarkers (i.e., A\uf06242, t-tau, and p-tau) and clinical evidence (i.e., stronger associations across cognitive spectrum from NC to clinical AD).

See "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We evaluated associations between FSRP, a comprehensive index of vascular risk, and axonal injury among community-dwelling older adults ranging from cognitively normal to clinical dementia, assessing for interactions with cognitive diagnosis and CSF measurements of AD pathology. Axonal injury was quantified using CSF NFL, a biomarker posited to reflect large-caliber axon damage [52] that is elevated in MCI [48] and clinical AD [32] and may explain unique variance in clinical manifestation of AD beyond core AD pathology [32] . Within the ADNI cohort, we found the association between vascular risk burden and axonal damage appears amplified by the presence of AD pathology. Specifically, FSRP interacted with both p-tau and t-tau in a manner suggesting that associations with axonal injury became stronger in participants commensurate with their extent of neurofibrillary tangle pathology (p-tau) and neurodegeneration (t-tau). A similar interaction also emerged for AD biomarker profile wherein compared to the referent 'normal' biomarker group, individuals with abnormal levels of both A\uf06242 (indicating cerebral amyloid deposition) and total tau (indicating neurodegeneration) showed stronger associations between vascular risk and axonal injury. While FSRP did not interact with A\uf06242 on NFL, stratified analyses indicated a modest association was present within the amyloid positive group. However, these stratified results should be interpreted with caution given the lack of a significant interaction effect.\nOlder adults may be more vulnerable to axonal injury in response to vascular risk burden when neural integrity is already compromised by the cumulative effects of mounting AD pathology. It is unlikely that tau pathology on its own directly accounts for the stronger association between vascular risk factors and axonal injury since prior work has not consistently supported a link between CSF tau and white matter damage [53] , including work from our group investigating white matter macrostructure [36] and microstructure damage [54] . Like NFL, tau is a cytoskeleton protein, but tau differs from NFL in that it promotes microtubule stability and is more abundant in smaller, unmyelinated axons localized predominantly in cortical tissue. In contrast, NFL primarily serves to increase diameter and conduction velocity of large-caliber, myelinated subcortical axons [55, 56] . Compared to tau, NFL appears to have more clinical staging and prognostic utility across brain diseases involving prominent degradation of white matter tracks. For example, CSF concentrations of NFL but not tau differentiate between relapsing-remitting and primary progressive types of multiple sclerosis [57] ."}, {"section_title": "CSF concentrations of NFL but not tau also distinguish clinical Huntington disease", "text": "patients from preclinical gene expansion carrier controls and correlate with 5-year probability of disease onset among the gene expansion carriers [58] . While NFL does not appear to have disease specificity as a marker of axonal injury, its utility in reflecting clinical staging across diseases may convey value as a concomitant biomarker to be studied in conjunction with more disease-specific markers of AD.\nThe dominant theory of AD pathophysiology posits that biomarkers become abnormal in an ordered but temporally overlapping manner. A long asymptomatic phase of amyloid aggregation eventually reaches a threshold with subsequent progressive neuronal dysfunction and death corresponding to CSF t-tau elevations [59] .
