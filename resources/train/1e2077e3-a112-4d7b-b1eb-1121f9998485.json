[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Nearshore morphology models predicting storm-scale erosion have been in use for the past several decades. These empirical tools typically focus on a single time-scale, which limits the utilization. For example, models developed to predict cross-shore storm erosion are poorly suited for longer-term simulations that include the beach recovery between events and gradients in longshore transport. Herein, the one-dimensional model CSHORE is extended to include shoreline change associated with alongshore variation in transport. A comparison of model predictions with long-term shoreline data from South Carolina demonstrate reasonable agreement with both erosion and accretion."}, {"section_title": "MODEL", "text": "The one-dimensional model CSHORE is a practical and accurate code that predicts beach profile evolution over the nearshore region (Kobayashi et al. 2009 ). The model accounts for wave and current interaction, bedload, suspended load, and wave-related sediment transport. The model, however, was developed for cases with alongshore uniformity where gradients in longshore directed transport are negligible. The present effort details the development of a new numerical model that incorporates the cross-shore profile evolution as well as the alongshore variation at two distinct time-scales. The new method assumes that frequent (seconds) bed-level updates due to cross-shore transport gradients are necessary, while the longshore sediment balance can be accumulated numerically over times of about a day before the resultant bottom evolution is imposed. The new model remains consistent for use in a single storm as well as predictions for evolution over several decades. Although the requirements for gradual alongshore variation limits applicability, the model is efficient enough to predict change over climate-relevant time periods and as accurate as a fully 3D morphology model. long-term WIS wave hindcast are used, while water levels are developed from the available NOAA tide gauge records. With a complete set of boundary and initial conditions, numerical model results constitute a complete 20 year history of transport and morphological evolution. The wave energy directional spectrum is nearly symmetric relative to the shore-normal transect, and although large sand transport is predicted to the North and to the South at times, a relatively small average residual longshore transport is computed. The measured and predicted morphological changes are provide in Fig 1 where the South exhibits 100 m of erosion and the North end has about 50 m of accretion. The modeled bathymetric changes are in general agreement with well-predicted erosion, and the accretional regions are predicted within a factor of two."}]
