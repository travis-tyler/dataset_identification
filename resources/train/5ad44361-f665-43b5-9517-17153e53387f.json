[1] - [5] Insights regarding the transmission and evolution of the virus during this first wave are essential to break the subsequent chain of infections. [6] , [7] Genomic data can provide some of these crucial insights which can help make upgraded public health policies. [8] , [9] Besides, genomic surveillance can deliver deep understandings about the virus and reduce fatality during any new wave of infection. [10] - [13] The onset of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December, 2019 [14] - [16] . Initially, clinicians diagnosed this disease as virus-induced pneumonia based on blood tests and chest radiographs. Later, the analysis of genomic data and phylogenetic tree led to the recognition of the pathogen as a member of the Coronaviridae family. [17] Coronaviridae family encompasses the largest known enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses with genome size ranging from 25-32 kilo base pairs (Kb) [18] , [19] . The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Toronavirinae. The subfamily Coronavirinae is further organized genotypically and serologically into 4 genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4-CoVs. [20] The betacoronavirus genus of SARS-Cov-2 has a 79.6% identity with SARS-CoV/ SARS-CoV-1 and 67.06% identity with MERS-CoV, indicating that they belong to the betacoronavirus genus. [21] All human coronaviruses are considered to be of zoonotic origin, with Chinese bats being the most likely host for SARS-CoV-2 [22] - [24] . Genetically, about 96% identity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13). [17] Conversely, since bat habitats remain distanced from human life, the virus may have involved an intermediate animal such as pangolins before transmitting to humans. [25] - [29] China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) primarily suggested the Huanan local seafood market as the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak. [30] Despite this, none of the animals in the area were tested positive for the virus. This suggests that the virus has already moved around Wuhan, long before its outbreak. Since then, the control of viral transmission through non-.

[31] However, the violation of these preventive measures and absence of proper antiviral therapeutics and vaccinations has led to an uncontrollable transmission of the disease. The virus spread rapidly both inside and outside of China. In March 2020, the disease was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). [32] Although, at the beginning of the pandemic, the intensity of the disease was higher in American and European countries but later it also spread to Asian and south-east Asian countries.\nBangladesh, as one of the most densely populated countries of the world, has been susceptible to the coronavirus disease 2019 . Today, it has been labelled as the second-most affected country in South Asia. [33] The country with limited finance, and scarce facilities experiences major challenges at combating this transmission. The first case of this virus was confirmed in two men coming from Italy and a female relative by the country's epidemiology institute, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) on March 7 th , 2020. Although many Bangladeshi citizens came from Wuhan beforehand, they were reported negative for SARS-CoV-2. As a response, Bangladesh government took a number of preventive measures including imposing restrictions on international flights, strengthening of screening procedures and shutting down of educational institutions and so on. [34] The first complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh was announced by Child Health Research Foundation on 12 th May, 2020. [35] Soon after, National Institute of Biotechnology announced the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome by Sanger sequencing method [36] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing effort in Bangladesh flourished afterwards and as a result, 323 genomes have been sequenced by October 1 st , 2020. The goal of this study is to probe all these sequences and find some crucial answers which will make it easier to comprehend the trajectory of this pandemic in Bangladesh."}, {"section_title": "Retrieval of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequences", "text": ".

The diversity and overall accumulation of mutation seemed to follow a downward trajectory since August. The variety of mutations was highest in May while the overall amount of mutations reached its peak in July.

Hence these three divisions can be considered as regions within Bangladesh with lesser diversity of SARS-CoV-2. The largest number of viruses found within Bangladesh belonged to GR clade (Fig 2b) . Among them, Dhaka division alone possessed 75 members of the GR clade. The smallest number of viruses pertained to O clade with only 3 members.

It has been found in the highest percentage is every division within the country and even was the only clade found in one of the divisions (Mymensing) (Fig 2a) . Overall it can be observed that the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 clades in Bangladesh is higher in southern parts of the country that the northern parts. A metadata analysis of 60,703 SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed GR clade to be the most predominant clade worldwide. [45] GR clade is defined by mutations at certain positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (A23403G, C14408T, C3037T, G28881A, G28882A, G28883C and C241T in the 5' UTR). [46] According to another study, G and GR clade of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly observed in Europe while S and GH is found in the Americas. The L clade is found mostly in Asia. [47] Spike_D614G, NSP12_P323L, N_G204R and N_R203K were the most widely found mutations found in Bangladesh (Fig 3a) .

However, the mutation D614G is found in the interface between the protomers that stabilize the mature spike trimer on the surface, instead of the RBD. [48] It has been observed that D614G mutant did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than its native counterpart. However, it has been found to decrease S1 shedding and make the Spike protein more stable than the native one.\nIt also elevates the incorporation of S-protein into the virion. Epidemiological studies have also revealed that the viruses with D614G transmit more efficiently. [49] NSP12_P323L has been observed to co-evolve with Spike_D614G across the world. SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 is an RNAdependent RNA polymerase. P323L has been found to enhance the interaction between NSP12 and NSP8 which is likely to increase the processivity of NSP12 and thus boost viral replication.\n[50] The third and fourth most commonly found mutations in Bangladesh namely, R203K and G204R in N were suggested to be favourable to SARS-CoV-2 adaptability and proliferation.\nModelling of N_R203K and N_G204R mutants suggested that these mutations could cause drastic alterations in the N protein structure.\n[51]\nWe calculated the number of mutations per sample in Bangladesh to be 6.88 (Table 3) . It happens to be lower than the global average which was reported to be 7.23 mutations per sample. [47] It was observed from our analysis that the type and the number of mutations in Bangladesh began to drop since August, 2020 (Fig 4) .\nWhen compared with countries that have significant amount of Bangladeshi diaspora, it can be seen that in almost all them the mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were most prominent (Fig 5a) .

However, their level varied widely between the countries. The rest of the mutations varied in even greater degree in between those countries. There was no significant correlation found between the percentage of each mutation in Bangladesh and the ones in countries with large Bangladeshi diaspora as well as countries with COVID-19 related mortality rates. The only thing that was found in common is the prominence of Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L and equal distribution of N_R203K and N_206R which can be regarded as almost universal. However, their .

The response to vaccines in the countries that share some degree of similarity with Bangladesh in terms of distribution of mutations should be monitored closely as the vaccine might have a similar impact in this country."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we have analyzed 323 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes sequenced in Bangladesh till October 1 st , 2020. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses detected in Bangladesh, the ones belonging to GH and GR clades originated in the UK, the ones in G and O clades in Italy and the ones in S and O clades originated in China. The most commonly found mutant SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh were Spike_D614G, NSP12_P323L, N_G204R and N_R203K. Therefore vaccines and drugs targeting these mutants are likely to work best in the country. The distribution of predominant mutations have been found to be similar in between Bangladesh and the countries with similar mortality rates due to COVID-19 and the countries with large Bangladeshi diaspora although their level varied greatly and so no concrete pattern could be drawn between Bangladesh and these countries. However, the distribution of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Bangladesh somewhat matches that in the UK, Oman, Italy, Greece, South Africa and Russia. Therefore, in the near future, close attention should be paid to vaccines working in those countries. If they work well there, there is a good chance they might work well also in Bangladesh. The good news for Bangladesh is that the number of mutations per sample in the country has turned out to be lower than the global average. The rate of mutation has been found to be decreasing in Bangladesh since August, 2020. These features are likely to make it easier for a vaccine or drug to be effective and sustainable in providing protection for the Bangladeshi population.\n.
