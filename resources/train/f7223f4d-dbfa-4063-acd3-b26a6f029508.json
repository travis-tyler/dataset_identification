Neuroimaging studies in Alzheimer disease (AD) have shown that higher CR is associated with exacerbated temporoparietal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET hypometabolism at a given level of cognitive performance, [2] [3] [4] suggesting that CR allows the patient to better cope with AD pathology. 1, 5 The neural mechanisms underlying CR, however, are largely unknown. Previous resting-state fMRI studies suggest that global functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex (LFC) might support CR because it is associated with IQ (CR proxy) and cognitive performance in young individuals. 6 As a major cortical hub within the cognitive control network, the LFC supports cognitive performance at a task-invariant level, 7 which sets it apart from other task-specific changes that may relate to CR. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Because the LFC is relatively spared in AD, Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

In a first step, we aimed to confirm previous findings of the ability of patients with AD with higher CR (education) to maintain cognitive performance relatively well despite parietal FDG-PET hypometabolism. 2, 14 Second, we examined whether gLFC connectivity underlies CR, i.e., the increased ability to tolerate FDG-PET hypometabolism. Therefore, we tested whether in patients with prodromal AD higher gLFC connectivity is associated with more years of education (criterion of face validity) and attenuates the association between FDG-PET hypometabolism and memory impairment (criterion of cognitive benefit).\nMETHODS Participants. All participants were recruited within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; recruitment phases GO and II) and were selected on the basis of the availability of AV45-PET scans to assess b-amyloid (Ab) levels, T1-weighted MRI, resting-state fMRI, FDG-PET, and cognitive testing. The final sample (see figure 1 for a flowchart) included 24 healthy controls (HC) and 44 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with elevated Ab levels meeting research criteria for prodromal AD. MCI was diagnosed according to the Petersen 15 criteria. With the use of pre-established cutoff values 16 applied to the global AV45-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), participants were characterized as having abnormally high amyloid deposition (SUVR $ 1.11, MCIAb1, n 5 44). HC showed normal cognitive performance and normal AV45-PET SUVR values (SUVR , 1.11, n 5 24). For details on PET acquisition, see appendix e-1 at Neurology.org.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Ethics approval was obtained by the ADNI investigators. All study participants provided written informed consent.\nNeuropsychological assessment and CR. Episodic memory was measured through a previously described episodic memory composite score (ADNI-MEM) composite score. 17 The ADNI-MEM score is a weighted factor score based on neuropsychological memory tests, including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, the Wechsler Logical Memory I and II, and the word recall of the Mini-Mental State Examination. We expanded our analysis of gLFC connectivity on secondary nonmemory domains, including language function (Boston Naming Test [BNT] ) and executive functions (TrailMaking Test B [TMT-B]). The TMT-B was chosen because we previously found this test to be affected early in AD. 18 Consistent with our previous study 2 and others (for a review, see reference 19), we used years of education as a CR proxy. Education is highly correlated with other CR proxies, including IQ 20 or occupational attainment, 21 and is to date the best established CR proxy."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "MRI acquisition. MRI scans were performed on Philips 3T MRI scanners using an 8-channel coil. T1-weighted images were acquired with a 3-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence, with whole-brain coverage at a voxel resolution of 1 Preprocessing of FDG-PET data. Preprocessing was conducted with SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London). Spatial normalization of FDG-PET images was performed with DARTEL, 22 a nonlinear registration algorithm implemented in SPM8 (for details, see appendix e-2). All FDG-PET images were subsequently smoothed (8-mm full-width half-maximum gaussian kernel) and adjusted to the individual mean signal of the pons and cerebellar vermis to address interindividual differences.\nPreprocessing of resting-state fMRI data. The first 10 EPI volumes were discarded because of equilibration effects of the magnetic field. The remaining 130 volumes were realigned to the first volume, motion-corrected, registered to T1-weighted images, and smoothed (6-mm full-width half-maximum gaussian kernel). The DARTEL flow fields and affine transformation matrix were combined and applied to the registered EPI volumes for normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute space. To remove noise, all spatially normalized EPI images were detrended and band-pass filtered (0.01-0.08 Hz). Additionally, we regressed out the 6 motion parameters and the blood oxygen leveldependent signal averaged across the white matter and CSF.\nAssessment of gLFC connectivity. gLFC connectivity was determined through seed-based functional connectivity following a previously described protocol. 6 The LFC seed (BA 6/44; Montreal Neurological Institute: x 5 242, y 5 6, z 5 28) was determined as the peak coordinate of meta-analytically detected brain activation associated with cognitive control (for further details, see appendix e-3). 23 We created an 8-mm sphere centered around the LFC coordinate (figure 2A), which was used as a seed for subsequent connectivity analyses. Using voxel-wise one-sample t tests, we explored the pattern of significant (p , 0.001) positive LFC functional connectivity in MCI-Ab1, which was found preferentially, although not exclusively, to frontoparietal brain areas belonging to the cognitive control network ( figure 2B ). For the assessment of gLFC connectivity, the LFC region of interest (ROI) was superimposed onto the preprocessed and gray matter (GM)-masked resting-state scans to extract the mean LFC time series. Next, we calculated the Pearson-moment correlations between the LFC time series and each GM voxel. The resulting voxel-based correlations were Fisher z-transformed, and all positive voxel values were averaged to yield gLFC connectivity for each participant."}, {"section_title": "6,24", "text": "The gLFC connectivity values were logtransformed and centered to achieve a gaussian distribution.

To test whether more years of education allow the patient to cope better with FDG-PET hypometabolism in MCIAb1, 2 we applied voxel-wise regression including FDG-PET as the dependent variable and years of education (CR proxy) as the independent variable, controlling for age, sex, and ADNI-MEM. The voxel-wise analysis was restricted to the group-specific GM mask, and the resulting t statistics map was thresholded at the voxel level at a 5 0.01 and corrected at the cluster level at a 5 0.01. The FDG-PET value averaged across voxels within clusters of significant effects of education (a single cluster within the left precuneus; see Results) was computed for each participant and used as a marker of FDG-PET hypometabolism in MCI-Ab1 in the subsequent analyses. In addition, the mean FDG-PET metabolism in the precuneus was extracted in HC. To test whether precuneus FDG-PET was decreased in MCI-Ab1, we conducted an analysis of covariance, with group (HC vs MCIAb1) as the predictor, controlling for age and sex. For testing our first hypothesis, i.e., that higher gLFC connectivity is associated with more years of education in MCI-Ab1, we used linear regression analysis including gLFC connectivity as the dependent variable and education, age, and sex as independent variables. For testing our second hypothesis, i.e., that higher gLFC connectivity attenuates the association between FDG-PET hypometabolism and episodic memory impairment, we tested in a linear regression analysis the interaction of gLFC connectivity 3 FDG-PET (precuneus cluster) on ADNI-MEM, controlled for age and sex in MCI-Ab1. Because our second hypothesis clearly specifies a directionality of the effects, i.e., detriments in memory performance associated with FDG-PET hypometabolism are worse at lower compared to higher levels of gLFC connectivity, we applied a one-tailed significance threshold to test this hypotheses (p , 0.05). Hypothesis 2 was also tested for secondary cognitive outcome measures, including BNT and TMT-B. To test the specificity of the gLFC connectivity as a substrate of CR, we conducted control analyses testing global connectivity of the OP and precuneus instead of the LFC. To this end, all regression analyses were repeated in an analogous way, this time replacing gLFC connectivity by global connectivity of the OP or precuneus. For each regression model, gaussianity of the distribution of the residuals was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test, where none of the models showed significant deviation (a 5 0.05). The variance inflation factor was ,10 for all models tested, indicating that there was no multicollinearity among predictors.\nVoxel-wise regression analyses were computed with SPM8. Further analyses were computed with the R statistical software package (r-project.org). 25 Regression parameters of log-transformed regressors were back-transformed to ensure interpretability.\nRESULTS Descriptive statistics for each group are displayed in the table. Two-sample t tests showed that HC performed significantly better than MCIAb1 on all cognitive measures. figure 3A) . The association between education and the average FDG-PET within the precuneus cluster is plotted in figure 3B .\nResults of the analysis of covariance showed that FDG-PET within the precuneus cluster was significantly Addressing our main hypothesis, we assessed whether higher gLFC connectivity is associated with an attenuated effect of precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism on memory in MCI-Ab1 (criterion of cognitive benefit). The interaction effect gLFC connectivity 3 precuneus FDG-PET on ADNI-MEM was significant (B 5 210.43, SE 5 2.62, t [38] 5 21.988, p 5 0.027, hypothesis-free 2-tailed p 5 0.054). Figure 4B shows that at low levels of gLFC connectivity, lower precuneus FDG-PET metabolism was associated with worse memory performance, whereas at higher levels of gLFC connectivity, the association between precuneus FDG-PET metabolism and ADNI-MEM was not observed. These results suggest that in the presence of higher gLFC connectivity, the detrimental effect of ADrelated precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism on memory is reduced. We detected no significant interaction effects on secondary cognitive measures, including BNT (p 5 0.78) and TMT-B (p 5 0.12). Control analyses including global connectivity of the OP or precuneus showed no significant associations with education (OP p 5 0.34; precuneus p 5 0.51) or precuneus FDG-PET metabolism (OP p 5 0.33; precuneus p 5 0.23). The interaction effect including ROI global connectivity 3 precuneus FDG-PET metabolism on ADNI-MEM was significant for none of the control ROIs (OP p 5 0.58; precuneus p 5 0.67).\nDISCUSSION Our major findings were that in prodromal AD, more years of education (CR proxy) allowed the patient to better cope with precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism, higher gLFC connectivity was associated with more years of education (CR proxy; criterion of face validity), and higher gLFC connectivity was associated with milder effects of precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism on memory performance (criterion of cognitive benefit). Together, these findings suggest that higher gLFC connectivity met major a priori defined criteria as a substrate of CR, including the association with a common CR proxy (education) and a beneficial effect that moderated the association between AD core pathology (precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism) and the level of memory impairment. No association with education was found for global functional connectivity of 2 control ROIs (OP and precuneus), suggesting that our findings are specific to gLFC connectivity. First, we showed that in MCI-Ab1 more years of education were associated with stronger precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism when controlling for memory performance. These findings are consistent with results of previous studies showing an association between higher CR proxies and lower parietal FDG-PET or perfusion in AD, 2, 5, 26, 27 providing indirect evidence for an enhanced ability in patients with AD with greater education to cope better with brain pathology than those patients with lower education.\nNext, we tested in a series of analyses whether gLFC connectivity may subserve protective effects in MCI-Ab1. First, we showed an association between years of education and gLFC connectivity (criterion of face validity). This is in agreement with previous studies in healthy individuals in which more years of education were associated with increased frontal lobe function, i.e., higher anterior cingulate FDG-PET metabolism and fMRI functional connectivity. 28 Similarly, more years of education are associated with higher frontal FDG-PET metabolism in prodromal AD. 3 We found that higher gLFC connectivity was associated with more years of education in MCI-Ab1 but not in HC. Higher LFC connectivity is most likely a functional difference associated with higher education that existed before the onset of MCI, in line with the idea of neural reserve. 29 Ceiling effects, reduced interindividual variability of gLFC connectivity in HC, and a small sample size of 24 may have reduced the power to detect an association between education and gLFC connectivity.

For illustrational purposes, groups of high and low gLFC connectivity (defined via median split) are plotted separately.\ncaution that the primary focus of the current study was on CR in MCI. gLFC connectivity as a putative substrate of CR in elderly HC participants should be assessed in larger future studies. For our second a priori defined criterion of CRrelated brain differences, we postulated that any putative brain substrate of CR should be associated with higher levels of cognitive performance in the face of brain pathology (criterion of cognitive benefit). 30, 31 Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that gLFC connectivity not only was associated with a CR proxy (education) but also was beneficial with regard to memory performance in the presence of brain pathology (precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism). Our finding is reminiscent of a previous study in AD showing that at higher levels of CR (as measured by IQ), the association between precuneus Ab deposition and memory impairment was attenuated. 32 Our results suggest that gLFC connectivity may underlie such compensatory effects. Here, we found an interaction between gLFC connectivity and precuneus FDG-PET only on memory but not on secondary cognitive measures, including BNT and TMT-B. A possible explanation is that deficits in BNT or TMT-B are related to frontal and temporal FDG-PET hypometabolism rather than precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism, as shown previously. 33, 34 Thus, it is possible that FDG-PET hypometabolism in areas other than the precuneus may have shown an interaction with gLFC connectivity on these nonmemory domains.\nIt is unclear how gLFC connectivity may support cognition in prodromal AD. One possibility is that because of its widespread connectedness, the LFC interacts with and regulates the activity of functional networks. According to the flexible-hub theory, the LFC shows adaptive functional connectivity to other brain regions during cognitive processes. 35 A recent fMRI study testing different cognitive tasks showed that the LFC dynamically shifts connectivity to different networks across cognitive tasks. 36 Previous resting-state fMRI studies reported that the LFC is characterized by a high participation coefficient with regard to its connectivity to major networks in the brain. 37 At the cognitive level, increased gLFC connectivity was shown to be associated with increased cognitive control, higher IQ, and higher cognitive performance in young individuals. 6 Together, these studies suggest that the LFC, possessing high global connectivity, may flexibly orchestrate the activation of specific networks during cognitive tasks and may thus enhance cognitive performance. Applied to the current findings, this means that high gLFC connectivity may be linked to greater flexibility in neural network activation to compensate for local neurodegeneration (i.e., precuneus FDG-PET hypometabolism) in patients with prodromal AD.\nAnother possibility is that the LFC exerts a beneficial effect on cognitive performance particularly through its association with the frontoparietal control network, also called the task-positive network. 38 Our spatial mapping of significant LFC connectivity supports particularly high functional connectivity with frontoparietal brain areas belonging to the control network, consistent with previous findings. 6, 7 In cognitively normal elderly with abnormal levels of amyloid PET, increased activation of the control network during memory encoding was associated with increased memory performance. 39 These results suggest that increased frontoparietal activation may play a compensatory and beneficial role during memory performance in the early stage of AD. Future studies may investigate whether, in patients with AD with high CR, increased gLFC connectivity may support such increased frontoparietal activation and thus support cognitive function. While the exact compensatory mechanism of the LFC needs to be confirmed in future studies, the current results suggest that the LFC is associated with CR and may moderate the association between AD pathology and cognitive impairment.\nFor the interpretation of the current results, several caveats should be considered. First, we examined gLFC connectivity during resting-state fMRI, which may not necessarily translate into increased connectivity or activation during cognitive tasks because the association between connectivity and taskrelated brain activation can be complex. 40 However, a previous study showed that during working memory task fMRI, the LFC connectivity increased in a task-related manner, suggesting a direct role of LFC connectivity during task performance. 7 We specifically chose resting-state gLFC connectivity as a candidate neural marker of CR that can be readily assessed in patients with cognitive deficits and does not depend on a particular cognitive task. However, future studies should assess to what extent gLFC connectivity supports compensatory task-related brain activation in AD. Second, we examined only MCIAb1 patients in the stage of prodromal AD. Thus, the generalization to other stages of AD and cognitive functions remains open. Because in AD the frontal lobe function is relatively spared until a late stage, the gLFC connectivity may be a prime candidate to show a generalized cognitive performance-enhancing function in AD. Overall, gLFC connectivity is a promising candidate marker of CR in AD that may play a compensatory and cognitively beneficial role when AD pathology emerges. The identification of the locus of functional brain mechanisms related to CR opens up the possibility to specifically train and stimulate such brain mechanisms through neurofeedback, transcranial direct current stimulation, or drugs to enhance compensatory brain mechanisms and to slow down the cognitive decline in AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "N.
