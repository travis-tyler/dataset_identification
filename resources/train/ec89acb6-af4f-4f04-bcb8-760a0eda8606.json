[{"section_title": "", "text": "T he total number of postdoctoral appointees (postdocs) in science, engineering, and health (SEH) in U.S. academic institutions held steady at nearly 64,000 in 2015. While the majority of the postdocs still worked in biological sciences and in clinical medicine, the share of postdocs in these two fields has declined over the past five years. From 2010 to 2015, biological sciences' share of postdocs fell from 34.2% to 30.2% while clinical medicine dropped from 26.0% to 24.8%. The total number of science and engineering (S&E) graduate students in 2015 increased to 618,008, up 2.7% from 2014. Much of this growth stems from the continued rise, now for 10 straight years, in graduate students on temporary visas. Among the U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Hispanic or Latino S&E graduate students showed the largest increase from 2014 to 2015 at 7.6%. "}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Appointees in SEH", "text": "In 2015, there were 63,861 SEH postdocs at U.S. academic institutions (and their affiliates, such as research centers and hospitals) with SEH graduate programs. The total number increased by only 0.4% (268) from the previous year (table 1). Between 2010 and 2015, the number of postdocs in biological sciences and in clinical medicine declined while postdocs in most other science fields and in engineering grew. In biological sciences, there was a 13.7% decline in postdocs from 2010 to 2014, followed by a 1.3% decline in 2015 (table 1). 2 In clinical medicine the decline was 2.1% from 2010 to 2014, with a further 2.3% drop in 2015. Declines in biological sciences (-2,422) and health (-553) from 2010 to 2015 were offset by increases in the number of postdocs in neuroscience (1,119); engineering (687); social sciences (468); earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (389); and agricultural sciences (335) (figure 1). The number of SEH postdocs declined at a similar rate among U.S. citizens and permanent residents and among temporary visa holders between 2010 and 2014 (1.7% and 1.6%, respectively) (table 1). However, these rates diverged in 2015 when the number of U.S. citizen and permanent resident SEH postdocs fell 4.5%, while the number of temporary visa holders rose 4.9%. The share of SEH postdocs on temporary visas grew from 52.5% in 2010 to 55.0% in 2015. Among the U.S. citizens and permanent residents, Hispanics or Latinos and Blacks or African Americans slightly increased their shares of SEH postdoctoral appointments between 2010 and 2015 (from 4.2% and 3.2% to 5.3% and 3.7%, respectively). By contrast, the share of Asian postdocs declined from 19.7% to 17.8% over the same period. About 40% of the SEH postdocs in 2015 were women. The proportion of female U.S. citizen and permanent resident postdocs increased from 43.9% in 2010 to 46.3% in 2015, while the share of female postdocs on temporary visas remained the same at around 34%.
