[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents initial findings about the employment and educational experiences of bachelor's degree recipients 1 year after they completed their degrees. These findings are based on data from the first follow-up of the 2016/17 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:16/17), a nationally representative longitudinal study of students who completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree during the 2015-16 academic year. The study addresses questions related to bachelor's degree recipients' education and employment experiences. The first follow-up, which was conducted in 2017, one year after their graduation, explored both undergraduate education experiences and early postbaccalaureate employment and enrollment. The Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) series of data collections allows researchers to address questions regarding bachelor's degree recipients' undergraduate experiences, including their participation in various financial aid programs, undergraduate debt, and repayment of that debt; entrance into and progress through postbaccalaureate education; and employment, particularly for graduates who became elementary or secondary teachers. B&B includes items specifically for teachers to help researchers better understand the teacher pipeline and experiences and outcomes of teachers. B&B:16/17 is unique from previous B&B studies in that prekindergarten teachers were also asked about their teaching experiences, and all respondents were asked to provide a complete employment history beginning with the date they completed their bachelor's degree requirements. This First Look focuses on a subset of topics that can be examined with the B&B:16/17 data: undergraduate time to degree and student loan borrowing, postbaccalaureate enrollment, employment outcomes, and steps toward a teaching career. The purpose of this report is to illustrate the range of information available in B&B:16/17. The selected findings present examples of the estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not intended to emphasize any particular issue. Readers are cautioned not to make causal inferences about the data presented here. Many of the variables presented are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. 1"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Among the approximately 122,030 students who were sampled for the 2015-16 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:16), about 26,500 students were eventually determined to be eligible for B&B:16/17. Eligible students were those who had enrolled at an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs and was located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; had completed requirements for a bachelor's degree between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016; and were awarded a bachelor's degree by the institution from which they were sampled no later than June 30, 2017. These students represent approximately 2.0 million students who completed the requirements for a bachelor's degree between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016. The first section of this report presents findings from the detailed tables that follow. Table 1 provides information on the demographic and undergraduate enrollment characteristics of all 2015-16 bachelor's degree recipients and of the subset of firsttime bachelor's degree recipients. The remaining tables focus exclusively on first-time bachelor's degree recipients. Tables 2 and 3 examine the undergraduate experiences of first-time 2015-16 bachelor's degree recipients, focusing on time to degree and student loan borrowing, respectively. Table 4 describes graduates' highest postbaccalaureate degree enrollment, and table 5 presents graduates' employment and enrollment status. Table 6 examines the characteristics of graduates' jobs 12 months after degree completion, and table 7 describes graduates' preparation, if any, to become teachers.

The design of the B&B:16/17 sample is described in detail in the B&B:16/17 Data File Documentation (Wine et al. forthcoming). "}, {"section_title": "Weighting and Imputation", "text": "Weight variables were computed to ensure that estimates generated from the B&B:16/17 sample data represent the target population described in the Target Population and Sample Design section. The weights adjust for unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:16 sample. The weights also adjust for multiplicity 8 at the student level and unknown student eligibility for NPSAS:16 as well as for subsampling of potential B&B:16/17-eligible students. Finally, the weights adjust for nonresponse and population coverage in B&B:16/17. A single weight was created for use in analyzing B&B:16/17 data. All B&B:16/17 interview respondents have a weight (WTA000). Because NPSAS:16 non-study members were not given a chance to respond to the B&B:16/17 interview, this weight can serve as a cross-sectional weight and a panel weight. Missing data were imputed for all variables used in this report and all variables included in the related PowerStats and QuickStats applications. The imputation procedure included a weighted sequential hot deck process (Cox 1980), 9 followed by a cyclic n-partition hot deck process (Marker, Judkins, and Winglee 2002). Additional details regarding the creation and use of weights and imputation procedures are available in the B&B:16/17 Data File Documentation (Wine et al. forthcoming)."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates and Nonresponse Biases", "text": "As shown in table B-3, the B&B:16/17 weighted interview response rate was 70.5 percent overall and ranged from 67.6 percent for private for-profit institutions to 71.9 percent for private nonprofit institutions. Because the response rates are below 85 percent, a student-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted overall and within each category of institution control, as required by NCES Statistical Standards (Seastrom 2014). Bias due to interview nonresponse was estimated for characteristics known for most respondents and nonrespondents. These characteristics include institution-and 8 Students who attended more than one institution during the NPSAS year had multiple chances of selection. If it was determined from the student interview or the student loan files that a student had attended more than one institution, then the student's weight was adjusted to account for multiple chances of selection. 9 The term hot deck refers to the fact that the set of potential donors comes from the same dataset. In contrast, cold deck refers to the fact that the donors come from an external dataset or source. student-level variables available from CPS and NPSAS:16, as well as updated NSLDS information. Bias was estimated before and after nonresponse weight adjustment in order to examine the impact of the nonresponse adjustment. The bias was estimated for each category of the institution-or student-level variables as the weighted difference between the means (proportions) of the respondents and the means of the full sample. The analyses found little evidence of nonresponse bias and that most statistically significant differences between the respondent mean and the full sample mean were eliminated by the nonresponse adjustment. Prior to the nonresponse weight adjustment, the median percent relative bias across characteristics ranged from 5 to 6 percent, and median effect size from .06 to .07. After the nonresponse weight adjustment, the median percent relative bias across characteristics ranged from 1 to 4 percent, and median effect size from .01 to .06. For more information on the student interview nonresponse bias analysis, refer to the B&B:16/17 Data File Documentation (Wine et al. forthcoming). Of the 26 variables used in this report, nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for nine items that had a weighted response rate below 85 percent, following procedures similar to the unit bias analysis. The lowest response rate for the sample overall was 75.6 percent for Family status 12 months after BA completion (B1MARCHB), which is shown in table B-4. Response rates for all items were similar for public and private institutions. The analyses found little evidence of bias. Before imputation, the median percent relative bias across characteristics for these items ranged from 2 to 18 percent, and median effect size from .02 to .20. Although bias after imputation is not directly measurable, differences in estimates before and after imputation generally indicate a reduction in bias after imputation, whereas no change suggests that bias was not reduced or was not present. Eight out of nine variables had a statistically significant difference or at least one category-level significant difference between pre-and postimputation means. For more information on the item-level nonresponse bias analysis, refer to the B&B:16/17 Data File Documentation (Wine et al. forthcoming). B&B:16/17 statisticians produced the replicate weights using a methodology combining approaches developed by Flyer (1987) and Kott (1988). The B&B:16/17 application of the method incorporated the finite population correction factor at the first stage (NPSAS:16 institution sampling) only."}, {"section_title": "Cautions for Analysts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sources of Error", "text": "The estimates in this report are subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors exist in all sample-based datasets, including B&B:16/17. Estimates calculated from one sample will differ from estimates calculated from other samples even if all the samples were selected using the same sample design and methods. The standard error is a measure of the precision of the estimate accounting for sampling error. For this report, analysts calculated standard errors using bootstrap replication procedures in PowerStats. Tables C-1 through C-7 in appendix C provide the standard errors for the estimates presented in tables 1-7. Nonsampling errors are due to a number of issues, including but not limited to nonresponse, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations. A study like B&B:16/17 includes multiple sources of data for some variables (CPS, institutional records, student interviews, NSC, etc.), and reporting differences can occur among data sources. To protect study members' confidentiality, data swapping and other forms of perturbation were implemented, which can also lead to inconsistencies."}, {"section_title": "Comparing B&B:16/17 Estimates to Prior B&B Estimates", "text": "Changes in the NPSAS sample over time should be considered when comparing B&B:16/17 results with those for prior cohorts of B&B. For details on these NPSAS sample changes, see Wine, Siegel, and Stollberg (2018). B&B:16/17 differs from previous administrations of B&B in three ways. First, in B&B:16/17, prekindergarten teachers were asked teaching-related questions in the student interview, whereas in previous B&B studies such questions were only asked of kindergarten through 12th-grade teachers. As a result, data in teacher-related variables from B&B:16/17 pertain to a different set of teachers than data in such variables for previous cohorts. Therefore, analyses comparing estimates from these variables across time should be conducted with prekindergarten teachers excluded. Second, B&B:16/17 collected a detailed full employment history, which included detailed information about every employer and every job at which respondents worked between earning their 2015-16 bachelor's degree and June 2017. This full employment history also includes detailed information on all teaching jobs between the 2015-16 bachelor's degree and June 2017. Previous B&B studies did not collect a detailed full employment history or detailed information about all past teaching jobs. Lastly, the timeframe that the B&B:16/17 variables cover varies from previous B&B studies. Because the amount of time elapsed between when respondents completed the requirements for their 2015-16 bachelor's degrees and when they responded to the B&B interview varied across respondents, B&B:16/17 anchored most interview items to June 2017 (that is, most interview items asked respondents to only include information through June 2017). Although anchoring interview items to June 2017 eliminated the variation due to interview timing (interview data collection occurred between July 31, 2017, and June 30, 2018), there is still variation in when respondents completed the requirements for their bachelor's degree (they could have completed anytime between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016). Given the variation in how much time had elapsed between completion of the requirements for the 2015-16 bachelor's degree and June 2017, whenever possible, the set of derived variables created for B&B:16/17 focused only on outcomes that occurred within the first 12 months after completion of the bachelor's degree. Derived variables from previous B&B cohorts have described outcomes between completion of the requirements for the bachelor's degree and either the date of the interview or a date anchored in the interview, but they have never previously been limited to the first 12 months after the bachelor's degree was completed. This means that many outcomes in B&B:16/17 were measured over a shorter time horizon than equivalent variables in previous studies."}, {"section_title": "PowerStats", "text": "The estimates in this report were produced using PowerStats, a web-based software application that enables users to generate tables of estimates for most of the surveys conducted by NCES. PowerStats can use replicate weights produced with balanced repeated replication, jackknifing, or bootstrapping to generate the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences in the estimates. PowerStats also describes how each variable was created and includes question wording for variables based on specific survey items. With PowerStats, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. The output from PowerStats includes the table estimates (e.g., percentages or means), their design-adjusted standard errors, and their weighted sample sizes. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (i.e., fewer than 30 cases, unweighted), PowerStats produces a double dagger symbol ( \u2021) instead of the estimate. To alert users to unstable estimates, PowerStats will flag an estimate with a single exclamation point (!) when the standard error is between 30 and 50 percent of the estimate and a double exclamation point (!!) when the standard error is greater than 50 percent of the estimate. In addition to producing percentages or means, PowerStats users can conduct linear or logistic regressions. Many options for output of regression results are available.
