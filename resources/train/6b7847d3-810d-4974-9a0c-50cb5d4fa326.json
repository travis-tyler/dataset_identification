A number of approaches are compared. First, we use the PP at the same visit as the PWV in a linear regression model. An approach for using the longitudinal PP data is to obtain a measure of cumulative burden, the area under the PP curve (AUC). This AUC is used as an explanatory variable to model PWV. Next, a two-stage process is applied. The longitudinal PP is modeled using a linear mixed-effects model. Then the PP and rate of change in PP at the visit where the PWV is measured are estimated from the model and used in the regression model to describe PWV. Finally, a joint Bayesian model is constructed similar to the two-stage model."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In this paper we discuss different methodologies to approach the problem of modeling a response variable that is available at a single time point while the explanatory variable is available at multiple time points. In particular, we wish to model pulse wave velocity (PWV) as a function of pulse pressure (PP = systolic blood pressure -diastolic blood pressure). PWV data is available at only the most recent visit while PP values are available at the same and previous visits. PP and PWV are both indexes of arterial stiffness and both have been shown to be predictors of mortality.\nMethods like panel data analysis, econometric modeling, and time series cross-sectional regressions are some approaches that handle similar situations but the data has to be either balanced or equally spaced. None of these criteria fit our data.\nA class of econometric models called dynamic models explores the relationship when the independent variable is a time series and the dependent variable is measured at a certain time t. i.e. when there is a lagged relationship between the Y and the X's. These are called dynamic models because the effect of a unit change in the value of the explanatory variable is felt over a number of time periods. The equation for this kind of model has the following form (Gujrati, 1999) :\nY t = A + 0 X t + 1 X t-1 + 2 X t-2 + U t .\nThe time series cross-sectional regression analysis (TSCSREG) procedure analyzes a class of linear econometric models that commonly arise when time series and cross-sectional data are combined. The TSCSREG procedure analyzes panel data sets that consist of multiple time series observations on each of several individuals or cross-sectional units. The performance of any estimation procedure for the model regression parameters depends on the statistical characteristics of the error components in the model. The TSCSREG procedure estimates the regression parameters in the preceding model under several common error structures, including one and two-way fixed and random effects (SAS/ETS, 1999) .\nPanel data analysis is basically a regression analysis involving two dimensions namely, spatial and temporal. The spatial dimension pertains to the cross-sectional unit of observation. The temporal dimension pertains to the periodic observation of a set of variables. The crosssectional component is generally of categorical nature. In our case the cross-sectional component PWV is continuous and the measurements for the covariates are not done periodically. The panel analysis equation is as follows (Hsiao, 2003) : Y it =A i + 1 X 1it + 2 X 2it + it . Each of the methods described above require balanced data (the same number of observations and common time points). Given the nature of our study, the data are unequally spaced and subjects have varying numbers of repeated measurements. Consequently these approaches cannot be applied in this case.\nIn section 2 we describe the data to be used in this study. In section 3 we list the approaches to be used to estimate the effect of PP on PWV. In section 4 we present the results of the study and section 5 presents a simulation study to investigate the relative merits of the approaches used. We present our conclusions in section 6."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data consists of 183 male participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)."}, {"section_title": "Section on Statistics in Epidemiology", "text": "Participants in the BLSA are volunteers who return approximately every 2 years for approximately two and a half days of clinical examination. In addition to the other variables measured on these participants, pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness was measured on these subjects at some point in time. Earlier, arterial stiffness was roughly estimated by using pulse pressure (PP). Pulse pressure is the difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. We wish to model the cross-sectional PWV based on longitudinal pulse pressure (PP) values."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We use a number of approaches to address this problem. The approaches are based on classical methods like linear regression, linear mixed-effects models, and area under the curve (AUC) to analyze this data. We have also used a Bayesian approach and we compare the results obtained from the Bayesian approach with the linear mixed effects model approach. In addition to PP, all the models include age as a covariate as PWV is related to age."}, {"section_title": "Linear Regression", "text": "This is the most naive approach where we model PWV using multiple regression. Here we use PP values at the same visit as PWV and ignore the PP measurements at all previous visits. The linear regression model is:\nPWV i = 0 + 1 \u00d7PP i + 2 \u00d7LAge i + where LAge is the last age, the age at which PWV is measured. Stanek et al. (1999) point out that it is often beneficial to use best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) in place of the actual value of a variable, especially when the variable is measured with error. Morrell et al. (2003) use this approach to obtain improved parameter estimates in a logistic regression model. Here we apply their two-step approach to this situation. In the first step, a better estimate of PP is obtained by modeling all available PP data using a linear mixed effects (LME) model. Next, using this LME model, PP is predicted at the time point at which PWV is available. In the second step, PWV is modeled using the predicted PP from the first step along with last age. The models used in the two-step approach are: 1. PP LME = 0 +b i0 + 1 \u00d7LAge + 2 \u00d7LAge\u00b2 + ( 3 +b i1 )\u00d7Time + 4 \u00d7Time\u00b2 + 5 \u00d7LAge\u00d7Time + 2.

Then the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated from the fitted model for each subject. These AUCs are used as the explanatory variables in the regression model. The area is calculated by integrating the LME model equation. This calculation is done for the entire time-span as well as for a fixed time period (2 yrs). In the second stage, pulse wave velocity is modeled using the AUC from stage 1 along with last age. For this approach, the AUC estimate of PP and the regression model used in this two-step approach are: 1.

In Table 1 we note that the estimates range from 1.8 m/s for simple linear regression method to 5.54 m/s for mixed models approach. For the AUC approach, when we use the entire follow up period, the estimate is 4.08 m/s while for a fixed time period of 2 years the estimate is 4.73 m/s. It is not clear from these results whether simple linear regression is underestimating the results or mixed models are overestimating the results. The R 2 for all models are similar. To enable us to evaluate which approach is best, we decided to conduct a simulation study. "}, {"section_title": "Results of Bayesian Approach", "text": "WinBUGS was used to fit the Bayesian model to the data. We used 5 chains and thinned the results by 5. After omitting 1000 iterations for burn-in, the next 5000 values are used to obtain the posterior distributions and parameter estimates. To check for convergence of the chains to a stable posterior distribution, we examined the history plots, autocorrelations, posterior densities, Brooks-Gelman-Rubin plots, quantile plots, as well as the impact of the priors on the posterior distributions. Tables  2 and 3 present the means and standard deviations of the MCMC values and compare them to the LME/regression estimates and standard errors. For the longitudinal pulse pressure model, the estimates/mean of posterior distributions and standard errors/posterior standard deviations are almost identical except for some slight differences with the components of the random-effects covariance matrix (Table 2) . For the regression model, the values are also very similar except for the intercept (Table 3 ). However in both models the intercept exhibits high variability, has a wide confidence/credibility interval, and does not differ significantly from zero. "}, {"section_title": "Simulation Study", "text": "To assess which of the methods provides the best approach to estimating the regression parameters a simulation study was conducted. For the purpose of the simulation, the regression model was simplified to contain only the pulse pressure variable and the longitudinal model contains only a linear time term. The simulation study used 150 subjects with an average of 4 observations per subjects (with 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 observations). To generate the data we used the following procedure: The regression parameters are estimated in a number of ways. First, the true PP 0 values and the \"observed\" pulse pressures (with error) at the PWV visit are used in the regression models. Next, predicted values from the mixed effects model are used and finally AUC value from the subject's entire follow-up and restricted to a two-year period is used. The results of the simulation are presented in Table 4 . It is not surprising that using the true PP 0 values leads to the smallest bias and mean squared errors (MSE) for both the intercept and slope. The LME/Regression approach is the best among the methods where error is added to the PP values in terms of both bias and MSE. The AUC over a fixed time frame is only slightly worse than the LME/Regression approach. Interestingly, using the \"observed\" PP at the PWV visit leads to very biased parameter estimates. In particular the slope estimate is severely biased towards 0 and these estimates have by far the largest MSE's. Consequently, when additional data is available one can obtain improved regression parameter estimates using the LME/Regression approach as this removes some of the measurement error that may be present in the data.\nA number of approaches have been proposed to deal with measurement error in the context of logistic regression models. For example, Rosner and colleagues (1989 Rosner and colleagues ( , 1990 Rosner and colleagues ( , 1992 examined the problem of the underestimation of risk for logistic regression models by developing methods to correct for measurement error. Their approaches often require additional data from a validation sample or reproducibility substudy that can then be used to reduce the biases due to measurement errors. Carroll et al. (1995) discuss measurement errors in nonlinear models and develop a variety of methods for addressing the problem. Carroll and Stefanski (1990) provide a general formulation for measurement error models. Morrell at al. (2003) use a procedure similar to the one presented here where a LME model is used to obtain improved estimates of the logistic regression parameters by reducing or eliminating the measurement error in the covariate."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "With the help of a simulation study we are able to draw some conclusions about which approach leads to the best estimates of the parameter in the regression model. The analyses suggest that it is not advisable to use a single time point. Among the different methods that were used to model the pulse pressure data, mixed models provided the best estimates. Area under the curve could also be used as a reasonable approach as long as the AUC is computed from a common time frame. The Bayesian analysis produced similar results to the LME/regression approach. "}]
