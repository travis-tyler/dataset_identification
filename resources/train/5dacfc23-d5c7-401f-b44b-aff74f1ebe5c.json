Long-term national investments in basic and applied research and development (R&D) play an important role in the flow of market-based innovations through a complex system that leverages the combined talents of scientists and engineers, entrepreneurs, business managers and industrialists. These funds have led to everything from small entrepreneurial initiatives to growth in high technology industries with the concomitant employment of millions of workers. The large impact on employment results from innovation impacts not only in high tech enterprises, but also other industries that benefit from increased capabilities and productivity. Mutually reinforcing and complementary investments in R&D by both private and public sectors work in concert to support the development, production, and commercialization of new products and processes. Between 2008 and 2009, business R&D investment in the U.S. declined from $259 to $247 billion ( Figure  1). That decline, coupled with increased hiring of R&D workers outside the U.S. by U.S.-based multinational corporations ( Figure 2), 1 represent unfavorable indicators for business sector participation in U.S R&D. Since business investment fosters innovation in high growth, high salaried, high technology industries, these shifts in business R&D participation could have profound implications for the vitality of the U.S. national \"innovation ecosystem.\" 2 Investment in R&D is not the only factor that affects the rate of and capacity for innovation. Public policies, including monetary policy, tax policy, standards, procurement, regulatory policy, the availability of a skilled technical workforce, and market access are also important in establishing an environment that fosters innovation. Given this critical time in our Nation's economic trajectory, careful consideration of our portfolio of innovation policies-including R&D investment practices and public policy-is needed to foster national prosperity and to increase national access to the global economy. In this policy companion to Science and Engineering Indicators 2012 we discuss the innovation ecosystem and the role of R&D in fostering innovation; explore the complementary roles of the private and public sectors; and offer key findings for stakeholders to consider. This ecosystem is nurtured by not only R&D but also includes education and the ability to build/implement technology. Although the connection is strong among R&D investment, innovation, economic growth and job creation, it is also complex."}, {"section_title": "HOW R&D FOSTERS INNOVATION", "text": "America leads the world because of our system of private enterprise and a system that encourages innovation.

Bush, April 2004", "text": "Innovation has long been recognized as an important driver of economic growth. Empirical research and surveys of business activities show that innovation leads to new and improved products and services, higher productivity, and lower prices. As a result, economies that have consistently high levels of innovation also tend to have high levels of growth (Atkinson and McKay 2007). Total national investment in R&D includes investments by the Federal Government, states, colleges and universities, and the business and non-profit sectors. In 2009, the U.S. proportion of R&D to gross domestic product (GDP) was about 2.9%. This ratio has ranged from 1.4% in 1953 to a high of nearly 2.9% in 1964 and has fluctuated in the range of 2.1% to 2.8% in the subsequent years. 3 The business sector's predominant role in funding R&D began in the early 1980s, when its support began to exceed 50% of all U.S. R&D funding. The business sector share of R&D steadily increased over the next 20 years, reaching a high of 69% in 2000. Since 2000, however, this decades-long trend of increasing private sector R&D was interrupted as the relative share of private investment declined following the 2001-2002 recession, and again after the 2008-2009 recession. The 2009 business R&D share of the U.S. total was 62%."}, {"section_title": "The Many InTerdependencIes of a naTIonal InnovaTIon sysTeM", "text": "Adapted from: OECD. Managing National Innovation Systems, 1999. National investment in basic and applied research and development importantly contributes to the flow of market-based innovations in ways that can be characterized as an \"innovation ecosystem.\" Innovation is defined as the introduction of new or significantly improved products (goods or services), processes, organizational methods, and marketing methods in internal business practices or in the open marketplace (OECD/Eurostat 2005). R&D and other intangible investments such as investments in software, higher education, and worker training are key inputs driving innovation. The term \"ecosystem\" emphasizes complexity of the innovation process -one that is highly dynamic, has many interdependencies, and is always evolving. Business sector investment focuses largely on development, directing almost 80% of its R&D resources toward development, compared to only 13.9% toward applied research and an estimated 5% towards basic research in 2009. 4 Development funding generally supports incremental rather than transformative innovation. Transformative innovation is more likely when basic research leads to quantum steps in expanding knowledge or through synergies when progress in multiple areas of science or technology complement each other to provide new composite capabilities. Here the Federal Government plays a critical role, accounting for 53% of all U.S. basic research funding, compared to 22% for the business sector. These investments in basic research create the building blocks for innovation by creating a transformative knowledge base upon which the private sector can draw. The Federal Government also spurs innovation by making direct and indirect investments throughout the innovation ecosystem and enacting policies that foster pre-competitive collaboration between the various stakeholders, including businesses, universities, and other public and private entities, 5 such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, and the recently established National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program. These collaborations are critical not only to increased innovation but also to national economic growth and job creation. In our increasingly interconnected and globally competitive world economy, unleashing innovation is an essential component of a comprehensive economic strategy. As global competition erodes the return to traditional practices, the key to developing more jobs and more prosperity will be to create and deploy new products and processes. Executive Office of the President, A Strategy for American Innovation, 2009. Investment in R&D is not synonymous with innovation. Many firms introduce new products without R&D. 6 However, it is possible to demonstrate the relationship between the amount of investment in R&D and product and process innovation for a broad cross-section of industries. Figure 3 compares an index of industry innovation rates with industry R&D intensities 7 for several key industries 8 between 2003 and 2007. The index is created by adding the number of product and process innovations for each industry in a National Science Foundation (NSF) database and plotting this index against the R&D intensity for each industry. 9 A positive correlation is evident, underscoring the importance of R&D intensity as a major policy variable. The vertical dashed red line indicates the minimum ratio of R&D to sales that typically qualifies an industry as R&D intensive. Ten of the seventeen industries fall below this minimum. Over time, these industries may become increasingly less competitive and provide fewer jobs and lower rates of pay (Tassey 2011). The relationship between R&D and innovation is highly complex. Figure 4 illustrates a simplified linear model of the interplay of R&D investment strategies using a series of iterative steps linked by learning and feedback -steps that flow both \"downstream\" from research to design and development, and \"upstream\" from the development and design to research. As shown, innovation does not necessarily require progression through all steps in a successive, linear fashion, but rather there are multiple \"entry points\" to this process. Overlap and redundancy increase the chances that an innovative idea will be funded to bring the idea from the invention stage to release as a new product or process in the marketplace.

With the rise of a technology-based approach to the production of new goods and services, the organization of high-tech business in the U.S and globally has changed. Today, innovation within the U.S. involves a complex network of firms -large and small -often working collaboratively and sustained in part by Federal, state, and local government efforts to encourage innovation and economic development. The results of the recent Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS) sponsored by NSF suggest that companies that perform or fund R&D have a far higher incidence of innovation than companies without R&D activity. However, only a small number of U.S. businesses perform R&D (47,000 or about 3%). 10 Businesses vary across industry and size in \"R&D intensity\"-that is, the ratio of domestic R&D performed and paid for by the company to domestic net sales. In 2008, the ratio across all businesses within the scope of BRDIS was 3.0% overall, 3.5% for manufacturers, and 2.2% for companies in nonmanufacturing industries. 11"}, {"section_title": "U.s. BUsIness r&d and InnovaTIon sUrvey", "text": "To better understand and measure how R&D is conducted in today's innovation-and global-based economy (NRC 2005), NSF and the U.S. Census Bureau launched a new Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). BRDIS expands on R&D data collected by its predecessor, the Survey of Industrial Research and Development, to cover (among other areas) global R&D funding or expenses by U.S.-located businesses, and introduces preliminary innovation and intellectual property questions. Business views about investing and performing basic research involve considerations about the appropriability of successful S&T results, commercialization risks, and uncertain longer-term investment returns. As noted above, businesses allocated the overwhelming majority of their R&D funding to applied research (13.9%) and development (79.4%) in 2009. 12 However, involvement in basic research can help boost human capital generally, attract and retain expert talent, absorb external knowledge, and strengthen innovation capacity. Businesses that invest most heavily in basic research are those whose new products are most directly dependent upon ongoing scientific and technological advances, such as pharmaceuticals and the scientific R&D service sectors. 13 Leading companies in highly competitive industries typically see R&D as essential for retaining and sustaining their leadership. The need for R&D may not be seen as critical to companies in less competitive industries. 14 There are, of course, many reasons why a firm might underinvest in R&D. For example, there may be a concern over a lengthy interval between R&D investment and the appearance of a commercial product in the market; the outcomes of a firm's previous R&D investments might not have proven to be technically sufficient; or the capital requirements for R&D investment are excessive (Link and Scott 2011). As central research budgets are reduced, many firms use their researchers to assimilate generic technologies from external sources, that is, they create inward spillovers from other company, government, or university sources, as opposed to conducting breakthrough research (Tassey 2005). Even in highly competitive industries, some companies may focus their efforts on reducing costs or targeting niche markets while taking advantage of the innovations that emerge from the R&D of others."}, {"section_title": "The role of prIvaTe eqUITy and relaTed fUndIng", "text": "Private equity (PE) refers to the holding of stock in private companies that are not quoted on a stock exchange (PrivCo 2011).

PE growth is defined as \"minority equity investments in later-stage to mature companies made by private equity funds\" and does not include venture capital funding (Pitchbook 2011). PE investment is likely to occur after a business has already demonstrated success in the market, and primarily allows the firm to raise capital for expansion (PrivCo 2011). As Figure 5 indicates, PE growth was about 21% of total PE investment in 2000, but dropped to 4% in 2005, probably due to the \"dot-com\" bust.

Most important, however, may be the relationship between angel investment and the growth of innovative companies. A recent study showed that firms that received angel funding are somewhat more likely to survive for at least 4 years, and that angel funding is positively related to the likelihood of subsequent external investment (Kerr, Lerner and Schoar 2010). Because angels like to be heavily involved in the company, the majority of angels have been found to be within 50 -100 miles of their investment (OECD 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Venture Capital Investment", "text": "Venture capital is defined as equity or equity-linked investments in young, privately held companies.

Defense-related funding emphasizes advanced technology and major weapon systems development (Figure 7), while funding by nondefense agencies largely supports basic and applied research.

The decline in private sector funding during the most recent economic downturn, coupled with the observed increase in hiring of R&D workers in other countries by U.S. based multinational corporations, underscores the need for continued and enhanced active involvement by government in nurturing S&T-based innovation in the private sector -and thereby also increasing employment in relatively well paid high technology industries in this country. The National Science Board found the following: 1. Businesses and industries that perform R&D exhibit a greater likelihood of innovation. Though very few businesses conduct R&D (3%), the private sector accounts for the majority of R&D performed in the U.S. (71% in 2009). 2. Basic and applied R&D that the private sector is unlikely to support sufficiently requires sustained, direct funding by the Federal Government to create a knowledge base of potentially transformative ideas that are critical building blocks of innovation. 3. Investments in R&D by the private sector may decrease during times of economic distress. The Federal Government has increased its own R&D investments during the last two economic downturns, whichthough not directed for that purpose -countervailed industry declines in the early and late 2000s. 4. Public funding is essential to sustaining the excellence of public research institutions that play a significant role in the U.S. innovation system. However, state funding for public research universities decreased between 2001 and 2009 while enrollment and university costs increased. As a result, funding per student declined significantly and the cost of education that must be covered by other funding sources has increased substantially."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": "Federally funded academic R&D is instrumental in creating and sustaining a world-class higher education system that prepares the next generation of American scientists and engineers and also attracts and trains high ability international students, researchers, and faculty. 6. Appropriate visa policies enable the attraction and retention of the best and brightest foreign born students, faculty, researchers and S&E workers. R&D-based innovation has long been a pillar of the U.S. economy, contributing importantly to the Nation's wealth, employment, security, and general quality of life. Federal policies have been and will continue to be critical to a strong innovation ecosystem. With growing international competition in high technology industries, the need for continued and enhanced public efforts to strengthen national R&D-based innovation is clear."}]
