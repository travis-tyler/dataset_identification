However, diagnosis patterns over time in early and middle childhood and whether confounding factors explain these disparities are not currently well understood.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Racial/ethnic disparities in attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis occur by kindergarten and continue until eighth grade. Racial/ethnic disparities among diagnosed children in medication use occur in both fifth and eighth grades. These disparities are not attributable to confounding factors. abstract OBJECTIVE: Whether and to what extent racial/ethnic disparities in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis occur across early and middle childhood is currently unknown. We examined the over-time dynamics of race/ethnic disparities in diagnosis from kindergarten to eighth grade and disparities in treatment in fifth and eighth grade.\nLongitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (N = 17 100) using discrete-time hazard modeling.\nRESULTS: Minority children were less likely than white children to receive an ADHD diagnosis. With time-invariant and -varying confounding factors statistically controlled the odds of ADHD diagnosis for African Americans, Hispanics, and children of other races/ethnicities were 69% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60%-76%), 50% (95% CI: 34%-62%), and 46% (95% CI: 26%-61%) lower, respectively, than for whites. Factors increasing children' s risk of an ADHD diagnosis included being a boy, being raised by an older mother, being raised in an English-speaking household, and engaging in externalizing problem behaviors. Factors decreasing children' s risk of an ADHD diagnosis included engaging in learning-related behaviors (eg, being attentive), displaying greater academic achievement, and not having health insurance. Among children diagnosed with ADHD, racial/ethnic minorities were less likely than whites to be taking prescription medication for the disorder.\nCONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis occur by kindergarten and continue until at least the end of eighth grade. Measured confounding factors do not explain racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Culturally sensitive monitoring should be intensified to ensure that all children are appropriately screened, diagnosed, and treated for ADHD.

[1] [2] [3] An ADHD diagnosis allows eligible children to receive specialized, adaptive educational programming in school, as well as medication that can help mitigate the disorder' s negative impact on learning and behavior. [4] [5] [6] Yet, not all groups of children are equally likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Racial/ethnic minorities in particular have been reported to be diagnosed with ADHD at lower rates than white children, 7 and therefore may have unmet treatment needs. 8 Children who are African American are diagnosed with ADHD at only two-thirds the rate of white children despite displaying greater ADHD symptomatology, 9 and Hispanic children have also been reported to be underdiagnosed. 1 Less is known about diagnosis disparities for children of other races/ ethnicities. 9 In addition, racial/ethnic minorities who are diagnosed with ADHD have been reported to be less likely to use prescription medication. 2, 10 Hypothesized mechanisms for ADHD diagnosis and treatment disparities include less frequent access to health professionals and service utilization [11] [12] [13] [14] and, when seen, less frequent solicitation by professionals of developmental concerns. 15 Additional hypothesized mechanisms include a lower likelihood of referral by school professionals, limited ability to pay for health care, and negative attitudes toward disability identification and treatment in some racial/ethnic subcultures. 16, 17 Research investigating ADHD diagnosis and treatment has typically used crosssectional designs or convenience samples 2, 18 or focused on limited time frames. 7 The onset and over-time dynamics of racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis throughout early and middle childhood are unknown. Yet, early diagnosis and treatment are important because ADHD symptomatology persists by early childhood. [19] [20] [21] In addition, the extent to which other factors confound reported racial/ ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment is unclear. Minority children are more likely to be exposed to risk markers for ADHD, including low birth weight, low maternal education, low household income, greater frequency of classroom problem behaviors, and lower academic achievement. 1, [22] [23] [24] The inclusion of confounding factors is therefore necessary to obtain estimates uniquely attributable to children' s status as racial/ethnic minorities. Identifying risks attributable to these confounding factors should also inform efforts to target ADHD screening, diagnostic, and treatment practices, as well as to clarify potential causes of reported racial/ethnic disparities. Identification and treatment at ages when ADHD symptomatology is still newly emergent, and so more amenable to adaptive services and treatment, should help maximize their effectiveness.\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the onset and over-time dynamics of race/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis across early and middle childhood in the United States. We extend previous work by modeling these disparities over children' s early life course rather than only at a particular time point, by extensively adjusting for plausible confounding factors (eg, lower socioeconomic status [SES] and lower behavioral and academic functioning), and by analyzing a nationally representative cohort of US schoolchildren (ie, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 [ECLS-K]). Our longitudinal modeling of ADHD diagnosis in the United States capitalizes on the richness of the ECLS-K data set, which includes the timing of ADHD diagnosis as well as detailed information about family sociodemographic characteristics and other potential confounders. We also use this detailed information to examine racial/ethnic disparities in prescription medication use."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample Description", "text": "The ECLS-K is a nationally representative cohort of US children who entered kindergarten in the fall of 1998. This database is maintained by the National Center for Education Statistics (http:// nces.ed.gov/ecls/kindergarten.asp). Data were subsequently collected from children, parents, and teachers in spring of 1999, fall of 1999, spring of 2000, spring of 2002, spring of 2004, and spring of 2007. Our initial analytical sample consisted of 17 100 kindergarten children with information on race/ethnicity and who were (1) followed until eighth grade and had not been diagnosed with ADHD before that time point or (2) censored from the study either because they were diagnosed with ADHD before eighth grade or their data were missing before this time point. We used this sample in our initial (ie, model 1) analysis, which included only race/ ethnicity and time as predictors of an ADHD diagnosis. Our second analysis (model 2) included additional childand family-level predictors measured in kindergarten, as well as timevarying measures of children' s behavioral and academic functioning. Missing data on these variables reduced the analytical sample size to 15 100. Table 1 shows the means of the criterion and predictor variables for each of these analyses. The similarities of these distributions across the analytical samples suggest that sample attrition had relatively little effect on our estimates.

Specifically, we identified children as having an ADHD diagnosis on the basis of a parent' s response of \"yes\" to each of 3 separate survey questions (ie, \"yes\" to the child being evaluated by a professional in response to a problem in paying attention, learning, behaving, or in activity level; \"yes\" to receiving a diagnosis by this professional; and \"yes\" to the diagnosis being for ADHD, ADD, or hyperactivity). Although medical record documentation of the presence or absence of ADHD is preferable, parents have been repeatedly found to be valid and reliable reporters of ADHD diagnosis, symptoms, and receipt of treatment. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Supplementary analyses (not shown but available from the study' s first author) of special education teacher-rather than parent-reported ADHD diagnosis were consistent with this study' s findings.

If the child' s mother was #17 years of age at her child' s birth, she was classified as being a younger mother (\u223c6%). If the mother was $39 years old, she was classified as an older mother (4%). Parents reported whether the child was born with low birth weight (4% of children weighed ,5 lb) 32 and whether health insurance was available for the child (9% of children did not have health insurance). Whether the interview was conducted in English (\u223c92% of the sample) was used as a measure of whether the parents spoke English. ECLS-K staff combined reports of the mother' s and father' s education and occupation, along with family income, to create a scale measuring the family' s SES. Dummy variables for SES quintiles were used in our analyses.

The Externalizing Problem Behaviors subscale items measure acting-out behaviors (eg, argues with a teacher, fights, shows anger, acts impulsively, disturbs the classroom). The scale's reliabilities at each wave ranged from 0.86 to 0.89. The Approaches to Learning subscale items measure learning-related behaviors (ie, pays attention, keeps belongings organized, works independently, shows eagerness to learn new things, easily adapts to changes in routine, and persists in completing tasks). This scale's reliabilities ranged from 0.89 to 0.91. We used the average if 2 teachers provided ratings of the student in a given year. These survey items were not collected in the eighth grade, so we estimated children's eighth grade behavioral functioning by using ratings obtained from the previous (ie, fifth grade) survey wave.

These models are advantageous over analyses predicting ADHD diagnosis at a particular time point because they situate the diagnoses in time, appropriately handle the censoring of children who are lost to attrition or who were not diagnosed with ADHD by the end of the observation period, and allow for time-varying covariates (eg, externalizing problem behaviors, learning-related behaviors, academic achievement). Hazard models have been used to investigate racial/ ethnic disparities in conditions and disorders other than ADHD. 34- 36 We also used logistic regression modeling to estimate racial/ethnic disparities in prescription medication use. Table 3 shows these estimates, without and with adjustment for confounding factors. (Fig 1) increased through third grade and declined thereafter. This hazard (ie, the instantaneous probability of diagnosis) in kindergarten, first grade, third grade, fifth grade, and eighth grade was highest for white children, holding the other variables in Table 2 ' s model 2 constant at their means. These same probabilities of diagnosis were lower for Hispanics, and children of other races/ethnicities, and lowest for African Americans. Figure 2 shows the survival function, or the cumulative proportion of children not diagnosed with ADHD, at each survey wave by race/ethnicity, again holding model 2' s other variables constant at their sample means. By the spring of eighth grade, \u223c7% of white children received an ADHD diagnosis sometime between kindergarten and eighth grade. The comparable rates for African American, Hispanics, and children of other races/ethnicities were \u223c3%, 4.4%, and 3.5%, respectively. Table 3 shows logistic regression (odds ratios) estimates of racial/ethnic disparities in prescription medication use among children diagnosed with ADHD in the fifth grade. The odds ratios shown in model 1 were unadjusted, whereas model 2 included a full set of controls. Before and after covariate adjustment, Hispanic, African American, and children of other races/ethnicities diagnosed with ADHD were much less likely to be using medication than white children diagnosed with ADHD.

Being raised by an English-speaking parent also increased the likelihood of diagnosis. In addition, and again after extensive statistical control, children diagnosed with ADHD were much less likely to use prescription medication for the disorder if they were Hispanic, African American, or of other races/ethnicities.\nPrevious research has reported racial/ ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment, particularly for African Americans. 9 However, whether and to what extent these disparities also occur among Hispanics and children of other races/ethnicities has not been systematically examined. 37, 38 Our study extends previous work by establishing that children who are African-American, Hispanic, or of other races/ethnicities are less likely than whites to be diagnosed with ADHD. These racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis occur as early as kindergarten and continue at least until the end of middle school. Racial/ethnic minorities are also less likely to be using medication to treat the disorder by the end of elementary and middle school. These racial/ethnic disparities are not attributable to many potential confounding factors that also strongly predict children' s receipt of an ADHD diagnosis or medication use.\nOur analyses relied on multi-item parent response to identify children as being diagnosed with ADHD. Although previous work has repeatedly found that parents are valid and reliable reporters of their children's ADHD symptomology, diagnosis, and treatment response, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] and has relied on the same type of parent survey items used here, 7 we were unable to independently verify to what extent children identified by their parents also met formal ADHD diagnostic criteria. Although we controlled for many potential confounding factors, including changing levels of behavioral functioning and academic achievement, it is possible that unmeasured variables may have contributed to the lower risk we attribute to children' s status as racial/ethnic minorities. Our study analyzed a single cohort of children, whose experiences (eg, health insurance coverage) may have resulted from period-specific events and conditions. Consistent with previous work, 7,9,13 we interpreted the directionality of the disparities as indicating underdiagnosis for racial/ethnic minorities. Another possibility is that children who are white are comparatively overdiagnosed. Additional research is needed to determine the extent to which such under-and overdiagnosis occurs. Our study examines over-time diagnosis until the end of eighth grade, which constituted the final survey wave of the ECLS-K. We may have observed other diagnosis patterns had the ECLS-K' s data collection continued into high school.\nOur study provides clinic-and schoolbased professionals with risk estimates that are more rigorously derived than those currently available, particularly regarding over-time diagnosis rates for ADHD. Underdiagnosis for African Americans, Hispanics, and children of other races/ethnicities may occur because clinicians are disproportionately responsive to white parents who are more likely to solicit ADHD diagnosis and treatment of their children. 39, 40 Clinical practice and policy may need to be redirected to ensure that children from minority families are appropriately evaluated, diagnosed, and treated for ADHD.\nOur study should inform efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and pharmacologic treatment. We found that disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment occur for children who are Hispanic and of other races/ethnicities as well as for African Americans. To date, clinicians and policy-makers have had very little information about disparities in diagnoses and treatment of non-African American minority groups. Medical and school-based professionals should ensure that their efforts to reduce racial/ ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment also extend to groups other than African Americans. Our findings provide additional support to calls for increasing solicitations by pediatricians, school psychologists, teachers, and other clinicians of concerns by minority parents for their children' s learning and behavior, 15, 41 ensuring sensitivity to differing cultural values about disability during well-child visits and referrals, 42 and encouraging symptom recognition and help-seeking behaviors by these parents, 43 and suggest that these efforts by clinicians should be made throughout minority children' s early life course. 44 "}]
