[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mapping the human brain is one of the great scientific challenges of the 21st century. Brain network analysis is an effective technique based on graph theory that is widely used to investigate network patterns in the human brain. Currently, mapping an individual brain network using a single image has been a hotspot in the field of brain science; techniques, such as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) method, have applications in structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. However, maintaining an image's intensity, shape, texture and gradient information during feature extraction is very challenging. In this study, we propose a novel method for individual-level network construction based on the high-resolution Brainnetome Atlas, which shows 246 brain regions. Principal components (PCs) were obtained for each brain region using principal component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. Individual brain networks were followed and used to construct the PC similarity measurement based on the mutual information (MI) method. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, three independent experiments were carried out. In the first, 34 healthy subjects underwent two Carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B Positron emission tomography (11C-PiB PET) scans; in the second, 32 healthy subjects underwent two structural MRI scans; and in the last, 10\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) subjects and 10Healthy Control (HC) subjects underwent 11C-PiB PET scans. For each subject, network metrics including clustering coefficient, path length, small-world coefficient, efficiency and node betweenness centrality were calculated. The results suggested that both the individual PET and structural MRI networks exhibited a good small-word property, and the variances within subjects was also quite small in all metrics, The average value of Coefficient of variation (CV) map was 0.33 and 0.32 for PiB PET and MR images respectively, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) range from approximately 0.4 to 0.7, indicating that the new method was well adapted to the subjects. The results of intra-class correlation coefficients from the test-retest experiment were consistent with previous research employing KL divergence, but with low computational complexity. Further, differences between AD subjects and HC subjects can be observed in network metrics. The method proposed herein provides a new perspective for investigating individual brain connectivity; it would enable neuroscientists to further understand the functions of the human brain."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The human brain is one of the most complicated network systems in the world. Its complexity lies in both structure and function; it is an organic whole composed of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and depression etc. For example, several studies used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the inter-regional functional connectivity between healthy and AD populations and found significantly lower clustering coefficients and path lengths in AD patients [4, 5] . A recent study from our lab employed Carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B Positron emission tomography (11C-PiB PET), one of the latest clinical technologies that detects \u03b2-amyloid plaque deposition, to reveal significant changes in the left cuneus, right caudate nucleus and left superior frontal gyrus in AD patients [6] . In addition, direct evidence from structural MRI data suggested that the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology are widely altered in AD patients [7] .\nAlthough graph theory analytical method has been successfully used to analyze various neural images, there are clear limitations of existing analytical methods.\nOne specific limitation is that existing constructing methods, such as Pearson correlations and partial correlations, rely heavily on time series data. Networks made in this fashion are efficient for imaging data with a full time series, from scans such as EEG and fMRI. However, they are not efficient for imaging data with only one time point, such as structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and PET data, etc. As a result, brain networks based on structural MRI and PET data are often constructed with a set of subjects rather than one single subject [6, 8, 9, 10] , which cannot explore individual brain topological organization and investigate its brain alterations or abnormalities.\nMore recently, in order to map an individual brain network, several investigations have been proposed. For example, Tijms et al. proposed a method to construct individual morphological networks for structural MR images. They divided the whole brain morphological networks into about 7000 nodes. Each node was composed of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 (27) voxels. Then the correlation between each two nodes was investigated [11] . Although this method realized network construction for an individual brain, the shortcoming of this method is obvious: the rigid extraction of those nodes might not optimally correspond to functionally/anatomically homogeneous regions of the brain, especially when one node was across different brain regions. To overcome above shortcoming, Kong and Wang et al. proposed construction, KL method took long time in calculating the connection matrix, which cannot meet clinical requirements [12, 13] . Therefore, to overcome above limitations of KL method, we propose a novel method for constructing individual brain networks by combining principal components analysis (PCA) with mutual information (MI), named PCAMI method. In this method, PCA technique was used to extract deeper features of each node. Brain network was constructed by analyzing mutual information between principal components (PC) amongst different brain regions. This article therefore is focused on two main objectives: (1) investigating whether PCAMI method is useful and robust for imaging data with only one time point, including structural MRI and PET data; and (2) validating whether PCAMI method can decrease computational complexity. To achieve above objectives, KL method was chosen and compared with PCAMI method."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "To validate the new method, three independent datasets selected from the ADNI database (https://ida.loni.usc.edu) were used.

The spatial resolution of the PET scanner is 168 \u00d7 168 \u00d7 148 matrices with a size of 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 1.5 mm.\nThe second dataset included 32 structural MRI images from health control subjects, with two structural MRI scans from each participant taken about 1 month apart.

The L is as a measure of the efficiency of the information or the mass transport of a network [8] . A small-world network should meet the following criteria: gamma >> 1, lambda\u2248 1 and sigma > 1 [24, 25] . The globalE and localE are as the measure of how efficiently it exchanges information in entire network and local network, respectively [26] . BC is typically used to determine the number of candidate hubs in a network [27] . According to previous studies, nodes with bi (equal to BC/averaged BC) values greater than the averaged betweenness value are considered as candidate hubs of the network.\nThe comparison of ICCs between the present method and KL divergence method is shown in Fig. 10 . Overall, the ICC results from the present method were similar to the results that were obtained using KL divergence method. For the PiB PET network, the present method demonstrated better ICC values in path length and global efficiency. For the structural MRI network, the present method demonstrated a better ICC values in path length, gamma, sigma, global efficiency and local efficiency.\nIn summary, the new method proposed in this study exhibited an acceptable robustness when compared with the KL method, suggesting its potential to serve as a method for brain network construction at an individual level.\nFurthermore, the time requirements for the present method and KL method were recorded and compared. Using the KL method, it took 61 minutes for individual network construction per participant. However, in the same operating environment, only 23 minutes were needed for each participant using the present method, which suggests lower computational complexity compared to the KL method. This time efficiency is mainly due to PCA reducing the dimension of the original image data."}, {"section_title": "The workflow of PCAMI method", "text": "In PCAMI method for constructing individual-level networks, there are a total of five steps: image preprocessing, extraction of the brain regions by priori atlas, feature extraction based on principal components analysis, and individual-level brain network construction based on mutual information and network analysis.

Six detailed steps of this process can be explained as follows:\n(a) The brain regions of all subjects were organized into matrix X, with n rows and m columns, where n represents the number of the subjects, m represents the number of the brain regions.

The mathematical models of PCA showed that the number of principal components in each brain region was equal to the number of subjects minus 1 [17] . As a result, from PCA of the PiB PET data, 33 principal components (PCs) were obtained for each brain region, representing the most relevant image information (intensity, texture, and shape).

Mathematically, the relationship between I(x) and p(x) has been strictly defined as follows:\nThe marginal entropy and joint entropy were defined as follows, represent the mathematical expectation ofI x \u00f0 \u00de:\nThen, the mutual information of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, mutual information is used to measure the amount of information obtained about one random variable through the other random variable, which can be defined as follows:\nTo calculate the probability density functions p(x), kernel density estimate (KDE) with a normal kernel was performed; this is a nonparametric method for estimating probability densities [18] .\nIn this step, similarity measurement for mutual information between PCs was performed, giving definitive connection strength between the brain regions. Three sub-steps were used. In the first, PCs of each two different regions were denoted as x and y; then probability density functions p (x) and p (y) were calculated based on PCs x and y respectively; and finally MI(x,y) was calculated by definition formula.
