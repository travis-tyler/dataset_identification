We assessed measures of plasma testosterone levels as a biomarker of AD in male participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Baseline testosterone levels were significantly different between clinical diagnosis groups [cognitively normal controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD], with the lowest testosterone levels in men with AD.

Change in testosterone levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up varied by diagnosis; MCI had the greatest decreases in testosterone levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up. Despite differences by clinical diagnosis, there was no association between plasma testosterone and CSF biomarkers of AD pathology. We also tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AR for association with AD risk in a separate cohort from ADNI and found 26 SNPs associated with risk for AD. The top associated SNP is predicted to be an expression quantitative trait locus for AR in multiple tissues, including brain, with the AD-associated risk allele predicted to confer lower AR expression.

The major AD risk factor is age, and sex steroid levels decline with increasing age, precipitously for women with menopause and more gradually for men.\nWhile the effects of sex hormones on AD risk have been wellstudied in women (Paganini-Hill and Henderson, 1994; Espeland et al., 2004) , fewer studies on sex steroids and cognitive function and/or AD risk exist in men.\nTestosterone is the predominant androgen in men and binds to the androgen receptor (AR), regulating expression of multiple genes with diverse biological roles. AR is expressed in many brain regions, including hippocampus (Simerly et al., 1990) , a region responsible for learning and memory that is heavily impacted in AD. Previous studies implicate low testosterone levels with cognitive impairment in healthy men, and higher testosterone associates with better performance in cognitive tests (Yaffe et al., 2002) . Men diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD have lower testosterone levels compared to controls (Hogervorst et al., 2001; Paoletti et al., 2004) . Low testosterone levels are also associated with greater risk of AD (Lv et al., 2016) , and precede AD diagnosis by 5-10 years (Moffat et al., 2004) . Interestingly, brains of cognitively normal men with early AD neuropathology at autopsy have lower testosterone, suggesting lower testosterone may precede onset of clinical AD (Rosario, 2004) . Low testosterone levels have also been associated with higher brain amyloid levels in MCI patients (Verdile et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the prolonged use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer is associated with risk of both cognitive impairment (Gonzalez et al., 2015) and AD (Nead et al., 2015 (Nead et al., , 2016 .\nGenetic variation within AR has also been implicated in cognitive decline and risk for AD. AR contains a CAG repeat expansion that correlates inversely with AR transcriptional activity (Chamberlain et al., 1994) . Previous studies provide conflicting results on the relationship between repeat length and cognitive decline; one found longer CAG repeats (indicating less AR activity) associated with poorer cognitive performance (Yaffe et al., 2003) , another found that shorter alleles associated with increased risk of AD (Lehmann et al., 2003) , and a third found no relationship between repeat length and AD risk (Ferrari et al., 2013) . Exploration of genetic variation in AR as a risk factor for cognitive decline and/or AD requires further study. This study's goals were to assess whether plasma testosterone levels differ by clinical diagnosis and are correlated with imaging and protein biomarkers of AD pathology in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and to assess variants in AR as risk factors for AD."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is a public dataset from multiple clinical sites that includes participants with normal cognition, MCI, and AD (Weiner and Veitch, 2015) .

We next tested whether baseline testosterone levels predict diagnosis (i.e., testosterone as a risk factor for AD) in an ordinal logistic regression framework. Similarly, we assessed testosterone as a predictor of AD biomarkers [structural imaging volumetrics, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels] and clinical severity (CDR-SB) via linear regression.

We compared the MAF of 43 common SNPs across AR in 111 AD cases versus 98 cognitively normal, Europeandescent men (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S3) . Twenty-six non-coding SNPs were associated with AD risk (p Adjusted,Bonferroni < 0.05), with the top two SNPs found exclusively in AD cases (Figure 2A) . Twenty-four of these SNPs are in LD with the top hit, rs4446868 ( Figure 2B ). All 43 SNPs (A) . Analysis of the APOE * E4 negative (APOE * E4-) subset of AD cases (n = 34) and cognitively normal controls (n = 68) confirmed that the top SNP, rs4446868, remained associated with AD risk independent of APOE * E4 status [last column in (A)].

The top SNP from the full cohort analysis, rs4446868, remained associated with AD risk in APOE * E4 non-carriers (p Adjusted,Bonferroni = 0.017).\nSince rs4446868 is intronic to AR, we consulted GTEx 2 and Braineac 3 (Ramasamy et al., 2014) databases to examine putative functional consequences on AR. The rs4446868 AD risk allele is associated with lower AR expression in several human brain regions, including frontal and temporal cortex (Supplementary Figure S4) . This suggests genetic variants in AR may contribute to AD risk in men possibly through reducing AR expression, and is consistent with our findings that men clinically diagnosed with AD have lower plasma testosterone levels than other diagnostic groups."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We analyzed the relationship between measures of plasma testosterone levels and clinical diagnoses in men in the ADNI cohort. Consistent with previous studies (Hogervorst et al., 2001 (Hogervorst et al., , 2002 (Hogervorst et al., , 2004 Moffat et al., 2004; Paoletti et al., 2004; Watanabe et al., 2004; Lv et al., 2016) , measures of baseline testosterone levels differed by clinical diagnosis, with the lowest levels in men with AD. Similarly, lower baseline testosterone measures were associated with worse clinical severity. A novel finding of our analysis is that change in testosterone levels between baseline and 12-month visit was significantly larger in MCI compared with AD patients. While we were only able to analyze testosterone levels over 1 year, our results are consistent with previous studies showing testosterone decreases precede AD diagnosis (Moffat et al., 2004; Rosario, 2004) . The effect of testosterone decreases may therefore be most pronounced during conversion from MCI to AD, with testosterone levels \"bottomed out\" in AD cases. Interestingly, we did not detect a relationship between testosterone and AD biomarkers, including CSF A\u03b2 and tau, even though previous studies found androgen levels inversely correlated with plasma A\u03b2 (Gillett et al., 2003) , and brain amyloid levels as measured by PiB retention in MCI patients (Verdile et al., 2014) . Though we are limited to clinical diagnoses of MCI and AD in ADNI based on cognitive assessments without molecular imaging or neuropathological confirmation, we observed the expected decrease in CSF A\u03b2 and increase in CSF tau in MCI and AD versus controls (ANOVA p-values = 2.68 \u00d7 10 \u221214 for A\u03b2 and 0.00083 for tau; data not shown). This provides support for the underlying pathological status of our diagnostic groups and suggests that androgen dysregulation may contribute to AD clinical severity through mechanisms beyond neuropathology.\nOne limitation of our study is that raw, clinical testosterone levels were unavailable, making it impossible to back-interpolate what a given group-level difference corresponds to in specific plasma testosterone concentration values (e.g., ng/dl). Thus, we can only make relative group-level comparisons between clinical diagnostic categories. Further, cross-sectional baseline testosterone measures did not decrease with age as expected. Future studies including men across a broader age range may help elucidate testosterone's effect on AD risk by age (Hogervorst et al., 2004; Rosario et al., 2011) .\nOur genetic analyses identified SNPs in AR associated with AD risk, and the risk allele of the top SNP associated with lower AR expression. Interestingly, this SNP retains significance in APOE * E4 non-carriers, suggesting that increased risk of AD is independent of the effects of APOE. This supports the hypothesis that decreased androgen signaling, whether through genetic variants that decrease AR expression or low plasma testosterone levels, is a risk factor for AD, and that the androgen pathway may contribute to some of the missing heritability of AD risk. This hypothesis suggests that testosterone supplementation may be a viable therapeutic intervention for populations at elevated risk for cognitive decline associated with deficits in androgen signaling. We have a unique opportunity to examine these hypotheses in humans due to the purposeful suppression of androgen levels via ADT as a treatment for prostate cancer. A recent prospective study found that ADT exposure was associated with a significant increase in cognitive impairment by 12 months when compared to men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT and healthy controls (Gonzalez et al., 2015) . Other studies suggest up to 47\u221269% of men on ADT experience cognitive dysfunction (Nelson et al., 2008) . Additionally, two recent population-based studies suggest that risk of AD and dementia increases with duration of exposure to ADT (Nead et al., 2015 (Nead et al., , 2016 , underscoring the link between androgen deprivation and cognitive decline. The AR SNPs identified here may help identify men at higher risk of cognitive impairment on ADT.\nTwo randomized studies have directly assessed the role of testosterone augmentation in AD/MCI. One placebocontrolled trial of 32 AD/MCI patients showed that increasing testosterone levels was associated with improved spatial memory, constructional abilities, and verbal memory (Cherrier et al., 2005) . Another randomized study of 10 hypogonadal AD patients showed cognitive improvement in patients treated with testosterone (Tan and Pu, 2003) . However, a separate large randomized trial did not show a significant effect on cognition over 1 year of testosterone gel application in men with low testosterone and subjective memory complaints (Resnick et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, our findings are in agreement with the two studies directly assessing the role of testosterone in AD/MCI, suggesting that the androgen pathway may play a role in cognitive function specifically related to AD."}, {"section_title": "ETHICS STATEMENT", "text": "This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review Board (IRB).
