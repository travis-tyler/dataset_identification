Results: The plasma levels of Ab40 and Ab42, and Ab40/42 ratio were found to significantly increase with aging. The age-dependent increase in Ab42 level was significantly suppressed by APOE-e4. Renal function was an associated factor for the plasma Ab40 level. The plasma Ab42 level and Ab40/42 ratio correlated with cognitive function.

The latest research suggests that it is possible to prevent pathological processes in AD by developing disease-modifying therapies, such as anti-Ab antibodies and BACE-1 inhibitors, against Ab amyloidosis, which act on pathological cascades, including tauopathy. Prospective cohort studies have reported that the ratio of Ab40/42 is significantly associated with late-life cognitive decline, 1 and risk of developing MCI and AD. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also suggested that the plasma Ab40/42 ratio can predict the development of AD and dementia. 7 However, these findings indicated significant heterogeneity, 7 and plasma levels of Ab40 and Ab42 alone were not significantly associated. 8, 9 The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) have confirmed the efficacy of neuropsychiatric tests and neuroimaging using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including amyloid PET, demonstrating that signatures of brain Ab amyloidosis can be found approximately 30 years before the onset of dementia.\nRecent studies have clarified that the plasma Ab42/40 ratio is inversely correlated with cortical amyloid burden in AD, which can be converted into MCI, 12, 13 and that the plasma Ab42/40 ratio is a useful screening marker for brain Ab amyloidosis in normal individuals. 14, 15 Approximately 30-50% of Ab in the plasma originates from the brain. 15 Age, APOE-e4, and AD pathology are specific determinants of Ab turnover kinetics from the brain to CSF, and finally to plasma. 15, 16 We therefore focused on determinant factors of plasma Ab levels. As Ab amyloidosis initiates midlife, it is necessary to analyze these factors in large communitybased studies on young adolescent to elderly subjects. Age and APOE-e4 are two major factors accelerating CNS amyloidosis leading to the onset of AD dementia. 17 The gene dose of APOE-e4 may decrease plasma Ab42 levels with natural aging, or long-term preclinical stage of AD dementia. 10, 17 For this reason, basic information on how plasma Ab levels are regulated over time by blood biochemical factors, cognitive function, and lifestyle remains to be clarified in order to adjust plasma Ab levels for CNS amyloidosis-specific markers. 18, 19 Here, we analyzed definite factors of plasma Ab of participants in The Iwaki Health Promotion Project (IHPP) in 2014, a community-based annual health checkup study designed to prevent and improve lifestyle-related diseases and quality of life."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "A total of 1109 participants with complete data sets out of 1167 enrolled participants were analyzed.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our results demonstrated the following: (1) Fasting plasma levels of Ab40 and Ab42, and the Ab40/42 ratio age-dependently increased from 20 years old. (2) The presence of APOE-e4 suppressed these age-dependent increases in plasma Ab42 levels. (3) Age and APOE-e4 were most significant factors for plasma Ab42 levels and Ab40/42 ratios after adjusting for previously indicated and newly examined factors, including blood chemistry, life style, and activity. (4) Only renal function was a definitive factor for plasma Ab40 levels. (5) Plasma Ab42 levels and Ab40/42 ratios were correlated with lower MMSE scores in subjects aged over 60 years.\nWith a longer follow-up, repeated measurement of plasma Ab may be useful as a simple and minimally invasive screening procedure to detect brain Ab amyloidosis. [14] [15] [16] Ab in plasma does not only originate in the brain because it is also involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism in peripheral organs, it binds to several proteins and lipoproteins, is partially released from activated platelets, and is metabolized in the liver and cleared through the kidneys. 19 However, a recent study suggested that 30-50% of plasma Ab originates from the CNS. 15 APOE-e4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic late onset AD, and markedly accelerates Ab amyloid deposition in the brain and the onset age of dementia by approximately 10 years. 10, 17 Recent studies have revealed that CNS-derived Ab is cleared into the CSF 28 and peripheral blood, 29 and that the clearance rate is decreased in late onset AD, 30 and is differently regulated by age and presence of Ab amyloidosis. 15, 31 Association of plasma Ab levels and cortical amyloid burden is also modulated by APOE isoforms. 32 Together with these data, our findings that aging and APOE-e4 are critical factors for plasma Ab42 levels from 20 years of age are consistent with Ab42 clearance from the brain to peripheral plasma. For this reason, adjustments of the plasma Ab42 level and Ab40/42 ratio for age, and APOE-e4 allele at any age are essential for evaluating plasma Ab levels as biomarkers of the progress of brain Ab amyloidosis or clinical trials of disease modifying drugs.\nTechnical problems, including storage tubes, temperature, periods, buffers, and pipetting, during the assay procedure affect plasma Ab levels. 27 Sleep-wake cycles of Ab production and clearance also affect CNS Ab levels. 33 We carefully managed fasting morning blood sampling, storage, and assay procedures, and obtained intra-and interassay coefficients with a variation of less than 10% in both Ab40 and Ab42 assays. We then analyzed the correlations among plasma Ab and other blood factors. In the ADNI cohort, platelet count, creatinine, and total protein affected plasma Ab levels. 18, 19 However, the IHPP cohort comprising a wide range of age did not report similar findings. Creatinine levels were correlated with plasma Ab40 and Ab42 as well as previous study. 18, 34 The present study demonstrated a strong correlation between plasma Ab40 and cystatin C levels. Cystatin C may respond to plasma Ab and renal function more sensitively than creatinine. Higher LDL-C and Lower HDL-C levels were both associated with cerebral amyloidosis 35 but not with late life cholesterol or AD neuropathology. 36 Our results suggested that serum cholesterol levels are not directly corrected with plasma Ab levels. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a well-known risk factor for AD. Type 2 diabetes is positively associated with CSF Ab42, but negatively associated with cerebral cortical Ab burden. 37 Although a few large scale-studies have reported an association between glucose metabolism and plasma Ab by strict sampling of morning fasting blood, we found no correlation among plasma Ab levels, FPG, hemoglobin A1c, and glycoalbumin, indicating no direct relationship between plasma Ab and blood glucose levels. In conclusion, there were no strong determinant factors directly related with plasma Ab levels, except Cystatin C for Ab40 level, in the IHPP cohort.\nRegarding the relationship between plasma Ab and lifestyle, no direct association was found with systolic or diastolic blood pressure, 38, 39 nor with alcohol intake, hours of sleep or smoking amount by questionnaire survey. Physical and motor activity, including 10MWT, RDT, TUG, and WBRT as candidates for integrated cognitive processes that require attention, planning, visuospatial, and motor processes, demonstrated linear associations with the plasma Ab40/42 ratio. However, these correlation coefficients were weak, suggesting that plasma Ab40/42 is not a predictor for complex motor activity related with cognitive function. 40 Prior major cohort studies have reported that plasma Ab is a risk factor or predictive marker for AD onset in healthy older community members aged at least 55 years. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In contrast, after analyzing fasting blood samples from healthy individuals of a wide age range, we observed the natural course of and factors affecting plasma Ab40 and Ab42. The period from mid-life to elderly is critical for preclinical progression of Ab amyloidosis. Consistent with other reports, we found that decreased plasma Ab42 levels and increased Ab40/42 ratio were associated with low cognitive ability in participants aged over 60 years. Furthermore, plasma Ab42 levels were stably regulated mainly by age and APOE-e4. As this study was cross-sectional, we were unable to validate plasma Ab42 and Ab40/42 ratio as a predictive biomarker for the onset of AD. This is one limitation of our study. Furthermore, we were also unable to analyze the association between Ab and vascular factors by MRI. To resolve these limitations, longitudinal confirmation is necessary. To confirm this basic data from the 2014 study, we are repeating the same annual surveys from 2015 to 2017, to clarify the factors of plasma Ab and evaluate plasma Ab40 and Ab42 as biomarkers of onset of Ab amyloidosis in the brain."}, {"section_title": "Supporting Information", "text": "Additional supporting information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of the article.
