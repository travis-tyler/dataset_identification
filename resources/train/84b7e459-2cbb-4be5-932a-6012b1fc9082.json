Programs such as the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) and Early Reading First (ERF) grants expand that focus to preschool curricula that support cognitive development including emergent literacy. Literacy researchers are connecting theories about the acquisition of reading and emergent literacy skills and experiences.\nThe emergent literacy model embodies more than reading readiness and is used to describe the acquisition of literacy on a developmental continuum. The model provides a picture of the acquisition of literacy that occurs from early childhood rather than beginning at kindergarten and further suggests literacy skills develop concurrently and interdependently. Whitehurst and Lonigan (1998) listed vocabulary, conventions of print, emergent writing, knowledge of graphemes, graphemephoneme correspondence, and phonological\nStephanie Wehry is the Associate Director for Research at the Florida Institute of Education, University of North Florida.

They further suggested emergent literacy consists of outside-in processes that include the context in which reading and writing occurs and inside-out processes that include the knowledge and skills associated with the alphabetic principle, emergent writing, and cognitive processes. Specific examples of outsidein processes include oral language, conceptual skills, and concepts of print. The inside-out processes are letter knowledge, phonological processing skills, and syntax awareness. A study by of 4-year-old Head Start children indicated inside-out processes were much stronger influences on first-and secondgrade reading outcomes than outside-in processes.\nHistorically, reading has been defined in two ways; code breaking and meaning making (Riley, 1996) or as decoding and comprehension (Gough, Juel, & Griffin, 1992; Mason, 1980; Perfetti, 1984) . Two stages of reading acquisition relative to the code breaking definition were originally proposed and those models were often refined to include three stages (Frith, 1985; Gough & Hillinger, 1980; Gough, Juel, & Griffith, 1992; Mason, 1980; Sulzby, 1992) .\nThe first stage involves the association of a spoken word with some visual feature of the corresponding printed word. The second stage involves cryptanalysis of printed words or phonological processing involving the correspondence of graphemes and phonemes, and the third stage involves orthographic processing involving the correspondence of spelling patterns and printed words. Baker, Torgeson, and Wagner (1992) studied the role of phonological and orthographic processing and determined that orthographic skills make an independent contribution to reading achievement. Goswami (1993) saw these stages as cyclical where orthographic skills enhance phonological skills, which in turn enhance orthographic skills. Mason (1980) suggested alphabet knowledge initiates the first level of reading acquisition by facilitating the breaking down of words into letters. Later, in a critique of five studies of children's alphabet knowledge, Ehri (1983) went further and suggested children's knowledge of the alphabet is the main skill that enables them to move from the first stage to the alphabetic or phonological stage of reading acquisition and that it is difficult to separate children's letter-sound knowledge from other emergent literacy skills. Chall (1983) summarized 17 studies of the relationship between knowledge of the alphabet and future reading achievement. Although causation was not claimed, knowledge of the letters of the alphabet was seen as an important predictor of reading achievement. Sulzby (1983) suggested children's lettername ability is integrated into a more complex set of early literacy skills and that children attempt to use some mechanism as they learn to associate letter names with their visual forms. Children learn these skills from exposure to books, songs, blocks, and learning to write their names. Sulzby (1992) further suggested alphabet letter knowledge precedes understanding the concept of word and comprehension; however, these stages reinforce each other. Bialystok (1991) suggested that children who can identify letters in non-alphabetic order and understand that letters symbolize sounds are on their way to code breaking. Riley (1996) proposed the link between alphabet letter knowledge and concepts of print is the key to why alphabet letter knowledge is such a powerful predictor of reading achievement.\nMoreover, recent studies of emergent literacy have focused on the relationships between phonological awareness and later reading. But children's letter knowledge is associated in some manner with their phonological sensitivity (Bowley, 1994; Stahl & Murray, 1994) . Stahl and Murray suggested children's letter knowledge enables them to manipulate initial sounds -a skill that leads to word recognition.\nResearchers have also found measures of phonological awareness independently predicted measures of word recognition and decoding (McGuiness, McGuiness, & Donohue, 1995) , and that among preschool children from low-income families, measures of phonological sensitivity were associated with measures of letter knowledge (Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, & Barker, 1998) . found that reading ability in early elementary school was strongly related to measures of preschool children's skills that included items requiring them to name a pictured letter and to identify initial letters and sounds of pictured and named objects -tasks that measure grapheme-phoneme relationships. Lonigan, Burgess, and Anthony (2000) , in a longitudinal study, found letter knowledge was independent of phonological sensitivity, environmental print, and decoding, and that 54% of the variation in kindergarten and first grade children's reading skills was accounted for by preschool phonological sensitivity and letter knowledge.\nAs Adams (1990) suggested, a child's level of phonological processing is irrelevant if the child cannot identify the letters of the alphabet. If a beginning reader cannot identify the letters then the reader cannot associate sounds with letters (Bond & Dykstra, 1967; Chall, 1967; Mason, 1980) . Moreover, orthographic competency depends on the ability to visually identify and discriminate the individual letters of the alphabet. How children acquire this ability falls in the domain of perceptual learning theory.\nThere are two prevalent theories (Adams, 1990; Gibson & Levin, 1975) ; the template and the feature theories. In the template theory, the brain stores templates of the most typical representation of the letters and stimuli are compared to the stored templates. In the feature theory, the letters of the alphabet are considered a group of symbols that share common distinct features. The brain stores the common features of different letters and matches features of stimuli to the stored list. Both theories involve search and comparison.\nStudies of children's alphabet letter knowledge span more than four decades, involve preschool to third-grade children from low-and middle-income families, and use either all or a sample of the letters. Sulzby (1983) suggested knowledge of the alphabet measured in kindergarten, not later, is the predictor of reading achievement.\nHowever, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten researchers reported 66% of children entering kindergarten for the first time recognized most of the letters of the alphabet (Zill & West, 2001) .\nIn recent studies of children's alphabet knowledge, studied Head Start children and used a sample of letters embedded as items in another measure; Lonigan et al. (1998) studied preschool children from lowincome families and used all uppercase letters; Lonigan et al. (2000) studied preschool children from middle-to upper-income families and used all uppercase letters; and Roberts (2003) studied preschool children whose primary language was not English and used a sample of letters.\nStudies of children from low-income families are especially important because one third of American children experience reading difficulties in school (Adams, 1990) , and children from low-income families have comparatively lower levels of emergent literacy (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998) . Because individual differences in emergent literacy at entry into kindergarten are stable or increase over school years (Baydar, Brooks-Gunn, & Furstenberg, 1993; Juel, 1988; Stevenson & Newman, 1986) , the impact of lower levels of emergent literacy follows preschool children through school. For these reasons, this study analyzed responses from rising kindergarten children from low-income families using all upper-and lowercase letters of the alphabet and other items measuring emergent literacy abilities.\nMoreover, the children studied were nested in classrooms nested in locations. Head Start researchers (Westat, 1998) found significant variation in program quality across Head Start programs, centers, and classrooms with the largest variation occurring at the classroom level. also found the performance of Head Start children differed across centers. Violating the assumption of independent observations across experimental units is a major concern with the use of nested data. In most cases, correlations between observations nested in groups are positive resulting in inflated Type I error rates in significance testing.\nFurther research is needed to estimate the magnitudes of intraclass correlations in preschool achievement data. In this study, classrooms were studied because of the large number of singleclassroom locations in the data and because Head Start researchers found most of the variance in program quality occurred at the classroom-level. A two-level model was used to estimate the size of the intraclass correlations; however, a two-level study confounds the effects classrooms and sites for sites with more than one classroom."}, {"section_title": "Purposes Of This Study", "text": "The primary purpose of this study was to analyze the alphabet letter recognition ability of rising kindergarten children from low-income families and determine if the ability was unitary or if it divided along the perceptual learning or instructional features (Adams, 1990; Gibson & Levin, 1975) . A second purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between recognition of the letters of the alphabet and other measures of emergent literacy using methodology that developed an interval measurement scale and acknowledged the nested nature of the data. The three research questions about responses from rising kindergarten children from low-income families are 1. Is the ability to recognize upper-and lowercase letters of the alphabet unitary or multidimensional? 2. Does a latent trait model of children's responses on the three Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA-3) subtests confirm the test publisher's three-factor structure? 3.

All children in the study experienced at least one semester of an intensive early literacy curriculum. Classroom teachers explicitly taught the inside-out early literacy skills in classroom contexts that provided outside-in early literacy experiences (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998) . Agencies funding participation in the literacy curriculum provided materials, teaching strategies, and weekly coaching for preschool teachers as they explicitly taught children alphabet letter knowledge, phonemic awareness, and print concepts. Teachers also used dialogic reading (Valdez-Menchara, & Whitehurst, 1992; Whitehurst, Arnold, Epstein, Angell, Smith, & Fischel, 1994) and provided opportunities for emergent writing, reading, and comprehension.

In contrast, measurement modeling within the latent variable context permits a distinction between observed item scores and the underlying construct, and the continuous latent variables are free from measurement error.\nCategorical confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted using the item responses from the alphabet letter recognition and the three TERA-3 subtests. The analyses produced twoparameter normal ogive item response theory (IRT) models. The CFAs resulted in error free continuous latent variables; however, Mplus does not have the capability to use these results directly in multilevel models.

Adams (1990) suggested alphabet letter recognition instruction begins with the uppercase letters for preschool children, and the mean scores indicated rising kindergarten children recognized more uppercase than lowercase letters and more than 22% of the children recognized all uppercase letters. Calfee, Cullenbine, DePorcel, and Royston (cited in Mason, 1980) found the distribution of children's uppercase letter recognition ability was bimodal with most children either recognizing less than eight or more than 20 letters.

These eigenvalues suggested the presence of one central factor with possibly up to three additional minor or difficulty factors."}, {"section_title": "Dimensionality of Alphabet Letter Recognition: Item Response Theory", "text": "Latent variable modeling permits a measurement model of data that is error free, weighs the relative importance of each item, and places measurement on an interval scale. Several theoretical measurement models of alphabet letter recognition ability were evaluated using categorical CFA.\nAlphabet letter recognition often begins with the uppercase letters as they are more visually distinct than the lowercase letters (Tinker, 1931) . Therefore, Model I was a two-factor model with one factor representing the uppercase letters and one representing the lowercase letters. Model I was based on instructional strategy.\nPerceptual learning theory suggests other models. One theory suggests children holistically perceive the letters and form templates in their memories for each letter learned. Another theory suggests children recognize letters by a set of distinctive visual features stored in their memories. The feature theory is more mentally efficient than the template theory.\nGibson and Levin (1975) reported that both children and adults sorted the uppercase letters of the alphabet by whether or not they have only straight-line features or have curved features in possible combination with straight-line segments. The secondary sort was by whether or not the letters with curved features have places of intersections such as B and P, or look round such as O and Q. The tertiary sort was by whether letters with straight-line features have diagonal segments such as M and Z, or not such as E and F. Several models involving the distinct features of the letters were investigated. Model II was a two-factor model with one factor representing letters whose visual representation is composed of diagonal line segments with no curved features (AKMNVWXYZkvwxyz) and a factor representing the remaining letters (BCDEFGHIJLOPQRSTUabcdefghijlmnopqrstu). Model III was a two-factor model with one factor representing letters whose visual representation is composed only of line segments (AEFHIKLMNTVWXYZikltvwxyz) and one representing the remaining letters (BCDGJOPQRSUabcdefghjmnopqrsu). Model IV was a two-factor model with one factor representing letters whose visual representation exhibits line symmetry (ABCDEHIMOTUVWXYZclotvwxz) and one representing the remaining letters (FGJKLNPQRSabdefghijkmnpqrsuy). Roberts (2003) used explicit instruction to teach alphabet letter recognition to preschool children and suggested there are 44 distinct abstract symbols children must learn. She reasoned the upper-and lowercase forms for C, O, S, U, V, W, X, and Z are the same. Model V was a two-factor model with one factor representing these eight pairs (COSUVWXZcosuvwxz) and one factor representing the remaining letters (ABDEFGHIJKLMNPQRTYabdefghijklmnpqrty).\nRotated exploratory factor analysis of the data suggested four highly correlated factors with one primary factor. Therefore, a unitary model, Model VI, was fit. Additionally there are at least seven letters whose upper-and lowercase visual forms are identical (C, O, S, V, W, X, and Z) and four more whose upper-and lowercase visual forms are nearly identical (K, P, U, and Y); therefore, another unitary model with errors for these eleven pairs of letters freed to correlate was also fit, Model VII. Categorical confirmatory factor analysis of the seven models was conducted using Mplus. A matrix of 1,299 observations, each observation having 52 binary items, was analyzed. Weighted least squares estimation (WLSM) was used to estimate model parameters. Five fit statistics are available for WLSM estimation: the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), root mean square error approximation (RMSEA), weighted room mean square residual (WRMR), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Guidelines for good fit of categorical models suggested CFI >.95, TLI >.95, RMSEA < .06, WRMR <. 90, and SRMR <. 08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Yu & Muth\u00e9n, 2002) .

Both Bialystok (1991) and Sulzby (1992) suggested the influence of alphabet letter knowledge is linked to concept of word. The relationship between the alphabet letter recognition variable and the Conventions subtest scores may reflect the influence of letter recognition ability on those Conventions items requiring children to use their concept of word to respond to items that required them to follow pictured text as it was read to them or to point to various words."}, {"section_title": "Classroom-Level Path Analysis", "text": "The classroom-level model used four variables, the Letters, Alphabet, Conventions, Meaning variables aggregated at the classroom level. The classroom mean of the Letters variable predicted the classroom means of the Alphabet, Conventions, and Meaning subtest scores. The intraclass correlations for Letters, Alphabet, Conventions, and Meaning were .19, .21, .15, and .17, respectively. These intraclass correlations are relatively large for a homogeneous population. For instance, in heterogeneous populations, Bryk and Raudenbush (1992) estimated 18% of the variance in math achievement scores of children in the 1982 High School and Beyond Survey was betweenschools and Goldstein (1987) estimated 9% and 13% of the variance in reading achievement of elementary school children was between-schools and between-classes, respectively.\nA possible explanation for these relatively large intraclass correlations is instruction of some of the subtest constructs is more readily adapted to the use of explicit instruction to enhance child learning. In fact, historical evaluation of the literacy curriculum used with preschool children indicated the greatest increases in mean TERA-3 subtest scores occurred with the Alphabet subtest scores. Additionally, the percent of available subtest items used in this study (items with means greater than .05) were 76, 57 and 33 percent for the Alphabet, Conventions, and Meaning subtests, respectively, and 88 and 60 percent of the classroom-level variance in the Alphabet and Conventions subtest means was accounted for by the classroom mean ability of the children to recognize the letters of the alphabet. The children in this study could correctly respond to a much greater percent of the Alphabet and Conventions than Meaning items which suggests higher ability in those areas. That ability was directly related to their classrooms' combined ability to identify the upper-and lowercase letters of the alphabet.\nBecause of this evidence and the explicit teaching of letter knowledge among other skills, classroom mean letter knowledge is seen as a measure of the implementation of the literacy curriculum, especially because participation was not uniformly implemented across sites in terms of the length of involvement during the school year or in terms of previous literacy curriculum experience of classroom teachers. Some teachers were new to the curriculum having worked with it less than a semester and other teachers had worked with it for several years. Supporting this implementation explanation is the fact that of the classrooms with the 16 lowest mean Letters scores, 12 were new sites with teachers new to the curriculum and with participation beginning after the winter holidays. The remaining four classrooms were early intervention special education classrooms. The implications of this explanation suggest mean classroom letter recognition ability may be simple measure of the quality of emergent literacy curricula and experiences.\nPerceptual Learning Theory of Alphabet Letter Recognition Inspection of Table 1 indicates the most frequently recognized letters were uppercase A, B, and C and upper-and lowercase X and O. This coupled with the alphabet letter summed scores depicted in Figure 1 suggests rising kindergarten children recognized more of the uppercase letters; however, it cannot be determined from this study whether this is because the uppercase letters are more visually distinct and therefore more easily recognized (Tinker, 1931) or whether the uppercase letters are taught first to preschool children (Adams, 1990) . The path analysis also indicated boys' ability to recognize letters of the alphabet was lower than girls and older children's ability was higher than younger children.\nThese findings are limited by the lack of experimental design, but the size of the sample indicates these are areas for further research. The fact that alphabet letter knowledge is an integral part of a broader set of emergent literacy skills and is frequently learned in conjunction with broader skills enhances Sulzby's (1983) call for a better understanding of how children learn letter names and the processes they use to recognize the letter forms. If children, in fact, recognize letters of the alphabet by their distinctive features, a more controlled study is needed in which data are collected earlier in the learning process and at several time points with instructional strategy modeled into the design. Perhaps as children actively engage in learning to recognize the letters of the alphabet, the construct changes from a multidimensional to a unitary one."}]
