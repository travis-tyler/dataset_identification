[{"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "As the ongoing national indicator of what American students know and can do, the Na tional Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in Reading regularly collects achievement information on representative samples of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. Through the \"Nation's Report Card,\" the NAEP Reading Assessment reports how well students perform in reading various texts and responding to those texts by answering multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. The information NAEP provides about student achievement helps the public, educators, and policymakers understand strengths and weaknesses in student performance and make informed decisions about education. The 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment will measure national, regional, state, and sub group achievement in reading but is not designed to report individual student or school performance. The assessment will measure students' reading comprehension and their ability to apply vocabulary knowledge to assist them in comprehending what they read. The public will have access to performance results and released questions through NAEP reports and websites. This document, the Reading Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress, presents the conceptual base for, and discusses the content of, the assessment. It is intended for a broad audience. A more detailed technical document, the Reading Assessment and Item Specifications for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress, will also be published. The Specifications will provide information to guide passage se lection, item development, and other aspects of test development. Both the framework and the specifications documents will be available to the public following their approval by the National Assessment Governing Board. The recommended 2009 NAEP Reading Framework is consistent with current No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation. In accordance with NCLB, the NAEP Reading Assess ment will be administered every 2 years at grades 4 and 8 and the resulting data will be widely reported in a timely fashion. In addition, NAEP will assess and report grade 12 reading results every 4 years. Since the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment will start a new trendline, the Governing Board decided to delay implementation of the new framework from 2007 to 2009. This will enable states to obtain 3 years of NAEP reading data at grades 4 and 8 under NLCB (2003, 2005, and 2007) and the old framework. The Governing Board, the policymaking body for NAEP, has stated that the NAEP Read ing Assessment will measure reading comprehension by asking students to read passages written in English and to answer questions about what they have read. The framework \"shall not endorse or advocate a particular pedagogical approach, \u2026but shall focus on important, measurable indicators of student achievement\" (NAGB 2002). Although broad implications for instruction may be inferred from the assessment, NAEP does not specify NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK how reading should be taught nor does it prescribe a particular curricular approach to teaching reading. The 2009 NAEP Reading Framework recommendations result from the work of many individuals and organizations involved in reading and reading education, including re searchers, policymakers, educators, and other members of the public. Their work was guided by scientifically based literacy research that conceptualizes reading as a dynamic cognitive process as reflected in the following definition of reading. Reading is an active and complex process that involves: \u2022 Understanding written text. \u2022 Developing and interpreting meaning. \u2022 Using meaning as appropriate to type of text, purpose, and situation. This definition applies to the assessment of reading achievement on NAEP and is not in tended to be an inclusive definition of reading or of reading instruction."}, {"section_title": "TEXT TYPES", "text": "This framework recognizes that reading behaviors such as recognizing and using features of text, making sense of sentences and paragraphs, and comprehending vocabulary occur regardless of text type. However, other reading behaviors vary with the type of text en countered by a reader. Thus, the 2009 NAEP Reading Framework recommends that two types of texts be included on the assessment: literary texts, which include fiction, literary nonfiction, and poetry; and informational texts, which include exposition, argumentation and persuasive text, and procedural text and documents."}, {"section_title": "MEANING VOCABULARY ASSESSMENT", "text": "The 2009 NAEP Reading Framework recommends a more systematic approach to vo cabulary assessment than previous frameworks. Vocabulary assessment will occur in the context of a passage; that is, vocabulary items will function both as a measure of passage comprehension and as a test of readers' specific knowledge of the word's meaning as in tended by the passage author. A sufficient number of vocabulary items at each grade will provide reliable and valid information about students' vocabulary knowledge."}, {"section_title": "ITEM DESIGN", "text": "The 2009 framework recommends the following cognitive targets, or behaviors and skills, for items from both literary and information texts: locate/recall, integrate/interpret, and critique/valuate. These cognitive targets illustrate the complex nature of the reading process whereas the corresponding behaviors highlight the different behaviors elicited by different text types. To measure these cognitive skills, students will respond to both NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK multiple-choice and constructed-response items with varying distributions of question type by grade level. Students in grade 4 will spend approximately half of the assessment time responding to multiple-choice items and half responding to constructed-response items. Students in grades 8 and 12 will spend a greater amount of time on constructedresponse items."}, {"section_title": "REPORTING RESULTS", "text": "Results are reported in two ways: as average scores for groups of students on the NAEP 0-500 scale and as percentages of students who attain each of the three achievement lev els (Basic, Proficient, and Advanced, according to definitions adopted by the Governing Board). NAEP scores are always reported at the aggregate level; scores are not produced for individual schools or students."}, {"section_title": "12TH GRADE NAEP", "text": "In May 2005, the Governing Board adopted a policy statement regarding NAEP and 12th-grade preparedness. The policy states that NAEP will pursue assessment and report ing on 12th-grade student achievement as it relates to preparedness for postsecondary education and training. This policy resulted from recommendations of the Board's Na tional Commission on NAEP 12th Grade Assessment and Reporting in March 2004. Sub sequent studies and deliberations by the Board took place during 2004 and 2005. In reading, the Board adopted minor modifications to the 2009 NAEP Reading Frame work at grade 12 based on a comprehensive analysis of the framework conducted by Achieve, Inc. The current version of the reading framework incorporates these modifica tions at grade 12 to enable NAEP to measure and report on preparedness for postsecond ary endeavors."}, {"section_title": "PREFACE BY THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT GOVERNING BOARD", "text": "In a modern society, the ability to read well is the cornerstone of a child's education. In a modern economy, literacy is a prerequisite for a successful life. In their early years of schooling, children learn to draw meaning and pleasure from the words on a page, which gives them a sense of accomplishment. Throughout the remainder of their school ing, reading is the critical skill they use for learning in all parts of the curriculum. For adults, reading is a key means to learn and do our jobs; it is also a source of enjoyment and an essential way we connect with family, friends, and the world around us. The ability to read critically and analytically is crucial for effective participation in America's democratic society. Reading Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress sets forth the design of a test of reading comprehension. The exam requires students to read passages of written Eng lish text-either literary or informational-and to answer questions about what they have read. In some cases, the questions deal with facts in the text or vocabulary. In other cases, a complete answer requires a clear analysis or coherent argument supported by sound evidence from the text. This is the second reading framework approved by the National Assessment Governing Board. It will replace the framework that has been used in the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) since 1992 and will start a new trend. This new reading framework is the result of ex traordinary effort and commitment by hundreds of people across the country, including some of the nation's leading figures in reading research, assessment, and instruction. The new framework incorporates the following key features: \u2022 Its design is based on current scientific research in reading. In keeping with Governing Board policy, it does not advocate a particular approach to instruction, but rather focuses on important, measurable indicators of student achievement. \u2022 The framework is consistent with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. It will enable NAEP to carry out its important role in that law as a uniform, independent measure of reading achievement in each state at grades 4 and 8. \u2022 The framework's content and preliminary achievement standards at grade 12 embody reading and analytical skills the project committees believe are needed for rigorous col lege-level courses and other productive postsecondary endeavors. \u2022 In preparing the framework, extensive use was made of international reading assessments and exemplary state standards. NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK vii \u2022 For the first time in NAEP, vocabulary is measured explicitly. Word meanings will be tested in context and enough vocabulary items will be included to report useful informa tion on the extent of vocabulary knowledge. \u2022 Poetry is assessed in grade 4 as well as in grades 8 and 12. Previously, NAEP assessed poetry in grades 8 and 12 only. Poetry is a form of text that is rich in meaning and in volves a high level of abstraction in language and ideas. \u2022 Multiple-choice and constructed-response items (both short and extended) are included at all grades. In grades 8 and 12, students will be expected to spend about 60 percent of as sessment time on constructed-response questions; at grade 4, about 50 percent. \u2022 Descriptions of reading material to be used in the assessment and target skills to be tested are delineated in a series of charts that provide clear guidance to those developing the as sessment and clear information to the public. \u2022 Achievement will be reported on an overall cross-grade scale, allowing NAEP to show the development of reading skills throughout years of schooling as well as the wide varia tions in particular grades. Clear standards for grade-level expectations will be established. \u2022 Separate subscales will be reported for literary and informational text as has been done on international reading assessments. The Governing Board would like to thank the hundreds of individuals and organizations whose time and talents contributed to this reading framework. The framework process was conducted through a contract with American Institutes for Research (AIR). Both AIR and another organiza tion, the Education Leaders Council, prepared literature reviews and issues papers, which pro vided different perspectives and served as the basis for extensive discussions by the Reading Framework Steering and Planning Committees. These committees, working over a period of 14 months, included teachers, reading researchers, local and state policymakers, testing experts, and business and public representatives. Many of these individuals have played important roles in other major projects, including the National Reading Panel, international reading assessments, the RAND Reading Study Group, and the American Diploma Project. In addition, the Board convened an independent external review panel comprised of eminent reading scholars, authors, and curriculum specialists. Their charge was to conduct an indepth analysis of the framework draft, including its research base and design. These individuals played an important role in shaping the framework adopted by the Board. The board also received wide comments on the draft framework through Internet reviews, a public forum held in Washington, D.C., and numerous meetings with state and local educators and policymakers across the country. We believe the framework will provide a rich and accurate measure of the reading comprehen sion and analytical skills that students need both for their schooling and for their lives. Develop ment of these reading skills is the responsibility of all teachers-not only English teachers but teachers across the curriculum-and also involves the expectations of parents and society. NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK viii The Board hopes that this reading framework will serve not only as a significant national meas ure of how well students read, but also as a catalyst to improve reading achievement for the benefit of students themselves and for our nation. NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK ix"}, {"section_title": "EXTERNAL REVIEW PANEL", "text": "To obtain an independent review of the draft 2009 NAEP Reading Framework, The Na tional Assessment Governing Board com missioned a panel of prominent reading re searchers and scholars to examine the draft document. After a 3-month review period, the panel reported to the Board on issues such as whether the framework is supported by scientific research; whether the document reflects what students should know and be able to do in grades 4, 8, and 12; the appro priateness of proposed reading materials; and the clarity and organization of the draft. Members of the Reading External Panel follow."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER ONE OVERVIEW", "text": "Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been an ongo ing national indicator of what American students know and can do in major academic subjects, including reading in English. NAEP reading assessments have been adminis tered on a regular schedule to students in grades 4, 8, and 12. Under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), NAEP will assess reading in grades 4 and 8 every 2 years. NAEP will also measure reading in grade 12 every 4 years. Reading Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress is one of two documents that describe the assessment; it is intended for a general audience and presents the conceptual base and content of the assessment. The second document is the Reading Assessment and Item Specifications for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress and is intended for a more technical audience, including the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the contractor that will develop the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment. The Specifications provide the \"test blueprint;\" that is, information about passage selection, item development, and other aspects of test development."}, {"section_title": "NAEP OVERVIEW", "text": "The National Assessment Governing Board-the policymaking body for NAEP-has defined several parameters for the reading assessment. First, the NAEP assessment will measure reading comprehension in English. On the assessment, students will be asked to read passages written in English and to answer questions about what they have read. Second, because this is an assessment of reading comprehension and not listening com prehension, NAEP does not allow passages to be read aloud to students as a test accom modation. Third, under Board policy, the framework \"shall not endorse or advocate a particular pedagogical approach, \u2026but shall focus on important, measurable indicators of student achievement\" (NAGB 2002). Although broad implications for instruction may be inferred from the assessment, NAEP does not specify how reading should be taught nor does it prescribe a particular curricular approach to teaching reading. Reading passages are selected to be interesting to students nationwide, to represent highquality literary and informational material, and to be free from bias. Students respond to both multiple-choice and constructed-response items. In total, the NAEP assessments at grades 4, 8, and 12 are extensive enough to ensure that results can be reported validly, but no single student participates in the entire assessment. Instead, each student reads approximately two passages and responds to questions about what he or she has read. NAEP assessments are administered to random samples of students designed to be representative of the nation, different regions of the country, states, and large urban districts. As discussed in chapter three, NAEP results are reported for groups of students; NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK no data are reported for individual students. Since 1992, states have been able to obtain state-level data on students' reading achievement. In 2002 and 2003, large urban school districts were able to obtain data about their students' reading achievement. Results are reported in documents such as the NAEP Reading Highlights and the NAEP Reading Report Cards issued following each administration of the reading assessment; through special, focused reports; and through electronic means. Data are also collected that allow comparison of students' reading achievement over ex tended periods of time in a separate Long-Term Trend NAEP. These assessments, given at the national level only, have been administered in the same form since 1971 and pro vide the only available measure of extended long-term trends in reading achievement."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSE OF NAEP UNDER NCLB LEGISLATION", "text": "The 2009 NAEP Reading Framework is consistent with current NCLB legislation. The NAEP legislation, as amended under NCLB and the later National Assessment of Educa tional Progress Reauthorization Act (NAEPRA) of 2002, specifies that NAEP's purpose is \"to provide, in a timely manner, a fair and accurate measurement of student academic achievement and reporting of trends in such achievement in reading, mathematics, and other subjects[s]\u2026\" (section 303(b)(1), National Assessment of Educational Progress Reauthorization Act, P.L. 107-279). The NAEP reading data will measure national, re gional, and subgroup trends in reading achievement but will not target the performance of individual students or schools. In further accordance with NCLB, the NAEP Reading As sessment will be administered every 2 years at grades 4 and 8 and the resulting data will be widely reported in a timely fashion. Finally, NAEPRA specifies that although the pub lic will have full access to NAEP results and released test questions, NAEP will not seek to influence the curriculum or assessments of any state."}, {"section_title": "DEFINITION OF READING FOR 2009 NAEP READING ASSESSMENT", "text": "The recommended 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment is guided by a definition of reading that reflects scientific research, draws on multiple sources, and conceptualizes reading as a dynamic cognitive process. This definition applies to the assessment of reading achievement on NAEP and states that reading is an active and complex process that involves: \u2022 Understanding written text. \u2022 Developing and interpreting meaning. \u2022 Using meaning as appropriate to type of text, purpose, and situation. Terms used in the definition can be further explained as follows: Understanding written text: Readers attend to ideas and content in a text by locating and recalling information and by making inferences needed for literal comprehension of the NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK text. In doing so, readers draw on their fundamental skills for decoding printed words and accessing their vocabulary knowledge. Developing and interpreting meaning: Readers integrate the sense they have made of the text with their knowledge of other texts and with their outside experience. They use in creasingly more complex inferencing skills to comprehend information implied by a text. As appropriate, readers revise their sense of the text as they encounter additional informa tion or ideas. Using meaning: Readers draw on the ideas and information they have acquired from text to meet a particular purpose or situational need. The use of text may be as straightforward as knowing the time when a train will leave a particular station or may involve more complex behaviors such as analyzing how an author developed a character's motivation or evaluating the quality of evidence presented in an argument. Text: As used in the assessment, the term reflects the breadth of components in typical reading materials. Thus, text on the assessment will include literary and informational passages and may contain noncontinuous print material such as charts. Texts selected for inclusion on the assessment represent practical, academic, and other contexts and are drawn from grade-appropriate sources spanning the content areas. Purpose: Students' purpose for reading the passages presented on NAEP is determined by the assessment context; thus, the influence of purpose on readers' comprehension is somewhat limited."}, {"section_title": "Situation:", "text": "The situation for reading often determines the way that readers prepare for and approach their task. They consider why they are reading (e.g., to study, to relax), how much they know about the topic, and other concerns that shape the time they will spend reading."}, {"section_title": "FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE READING PERFORMANCE", "text": "Factors related to the text being read and to readers' backgrounds and experiences influ ence reading performance. For example, understanding the vocabulary, concepts, and structural elements of the text contributes to readers' successful comprehension. Com prehension is also affected by readers' background knowledge and by the context of the reading experience. The background knowledge that students bring to the NAEP Reading Assessment differs widely. To accommodate these differences, passages will span diverse areas and topics and will be as engaging as possible to the full range of students in the grades assessed. The purpose for reading also influences performance. In the case of the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment, purpose is determined by the assessment context; thus, the influ ence of purpose on readers' comprehension is somewhat limited. For this reason, the definition of reading presented earlier should be considered as a guide for the NAEP NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK Reading Assessment, not as an inclusive definition of reading. The definition pertains to how NAEP defines reading for the purpose of this assessment. It does not address the is sue of how students should be taught to read. Text comprehension is influenced by readers' ability to apply the essential components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics knowledge, fluency, and understanding of word meanings or vocabulary. Without these foundational skills, comprehension will not oc cur. By grade 4, when the NAEP Reading Assessment is first administered, students should have a well-developed understanding of how sounds are represented alphabeti cally and should have had sufficient practice in reading to achieve fluency with different kinds of texts (National Research Council 1998). Because NAEP tests at grades 4, 8, and 12, the assessment focuses on students' reading comprehension, not their foundational skills related to alphabetic knowledge. 1 As discussed further in chapter two, the association between vocabulary knowledge and comprehension is strong; students who know the meanings of many words and who also can use the context of what they read to figure out the meanings of unfamiliar words are better comprehenders than those who lack these attributes (National Reading Panel 2000a). In the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment, vocabulary will be assessed systemati cally through carefully developed items that measure students' ability to derive the mean ings of words within the context of the passages they read."}, {"section_title": "NATURE OF READING BEHAVIORS", "text": "Reading is an active and complex process that involves multiple different behaviors. Readers often begin by forming an overview of text and then search for information to which they must pay particular attention. Following this initial overview, readers pro gress with different levels of interaction with text, including interpreting and evaluating what they read. By drawing on previous reading experiences and prior knowledge, they form hypotheses about what the text will communicate and revise their initial ideas and their knowledge base as their reading continues. Readers continuously acquire new un derstandings and integrate these into their ongoing process of building comprehension. Good readers monitor their understanding of text, recognize when text is not making sense, and employ a range of strategies to enhance their comprehension. Good readers also evaluate the qualities of text, and these evaluations can affect whether a text is re membered or has an impact on readers' knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors (Pressley and Afflerbach 1995;Ruddell and Unrau 1994). Depending on the situation and purpose for reading, good readers can use the ideas and information they acquire from text to, for ex ample, expand their thinking about a topic, perform a specific task, or draw conclusions or make generalizations about what they have read."}, {"section_title": "DEFINITIONS OF READING THAT HAVE INFORMED FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT", "text": "The definition of reading for the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment is derived from sev eral sources and grounded in scientific research on reading. Among the sources are NCLB, several important research reports on reading, and the definitions of reading that guide the development of international reading tests. Each source has contributed impor tant ideas to the definition of reading used for the NAEP Reading Assessment. NCLB posits that reading has five essential components: phonemic awareness, knowl edge of phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The NAEP Reading Assessment, first administered at grade 4, measures students' meaning vocabulary and comprehension. To demonstrate comprehension of what they read, students use their phonemic awareness and knowledge of phonics. Their ability to read the passages and test questions with minimal effort reflects their fluency. Students draw on their vocabu lary knowledge throughout the assessment and specific items ask about carefully selected target words in each reading passage. The National Reading Panel (NRP) (National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel opment 2000), a congressionally mandated commission, conducted an extensive, evi dence-based study of research literature on reading acquisition, reading growth, and other relevant topics. The NRP report was an important foundation for NCLB, highlighting the importance of alphabetics (phonemic awareness and phonics), fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Reading comprehension [is] the process of simultaneously extracting and constructing meaning through interaction and involvement with written language. It consists of three elements: the reader, the text, and the activity or purpose for reading (p. 11). The second important definition was the foundation for item development for the Pro gress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) (Campbell et al. 2001). PIRLS was first administered to 9-year-old students in 35 countries in 2001. PIRLS defines reading literacy as: \"The ability to understand and use those written forms required by society and/or valued by the individual. Young readers can construct meaning from a variety of texts. They read to learn, to participate in communities of readers, and for enjoyment. (p. 3).\" The Programme for Student Assessment (PISA) (OECD 2000) represents an international collaborative effort to assess what 15-year-old students know and can do in reading, mathematics, and science. PISA defines reading literacy as: \"Understanding, using, and reflecting on written texts, in order to achieve one's goals, to develop one's knowledge and potential, and to participate in society (p. 18).\" The RAND Report, PIRLS, and PISA offer support to the definition for reading advocated in the 2009 NAEP Reading Framework. All three stress that reading is an active, com plex, and multidimensional process undertaken for many different purposes."}, {"section_title": "OVERVIEW OF 2009 NAEP READING ASSESSMENT", "text": "The 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment will include two distinct types of text at grades 4, 8, and 12. Doing so will allow the development of items that measure students' compre hension of the different kinds of text they encounter in their school and out-of-school reading experiences. The reasons for including literary and informational text are pre sented next, followed by explanations of the characteristics of each text type included on the assessment. The 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment will also include items that meas ure students' ability to apply their knowledge of vocabulary as an aid in their comprehen sion process. Neither computer-based electronic text nor drama will be included on the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment. NAEP is committed to presenting authentic texts as stimulus mate rial on its reading assessments and it is difficult to include these kinds of text in ways that reflect how students actually read them in and out of school. The paper-and-pencil format most commonly used in NAEP reading assessments precludes students' navigating through different components of text as they do when they read electronic text. Further more, dramatic selections are usually too long to fit within the word-length parameters for passages included on the assessment. NAEP assesses reading skills that students use in all subject areas and in their out-of school and recreational reading. By design, many NAEP passages require interpretive and critical skills usually taught as part of the English curriculum. However, NAEP is an assessment of varied reading skills, not a comprehensive assessment of literary study. The development of the broad range of skills that the nation's students need to read suc cessfully in both literary and informational texts is the responsibility of teachers across the curriculum, as well as of parents and the community."}, {"section_title": "COMMONALITIES IN READING BEHAVIOR ACROSS TEXT TYPES", "text": "The framework recognizes that even though there are substantial differences in reading behaviors for different text types, there are also great similarities. Regardless of the type of text, the reader must access the words in the text, recognize and use the structure of the NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK text, make sense of sentences and paragraphs, and comprehend what has been read. Equally, vocabulary is a critical element in comprehending any kind of text."}, {"section_title": "TEXT CHARACTERISTICS: LITERARY AND INFORMATIONAL TEXTS", "text": "Research on the nature of text and on reading processes has suggested that the character istics of literary and informational text differ dramatically. For the most part, the research literature suggests that readers pay attention to different aspects of text as they seek to comprehend different text types (Pearson and Camperell 1994;Pressley 2000;Purves 1973). Additionally, the PIRLS report shows that students in the United States scored higher on the Literary Subscale (at 550) than on the Informational Subscale (at 533), fur ther substantiating the difference in the strategies needed for the two text types (OECD 2000). An earlier international study reported that patterns of student responses to litera ture were influenced by the nature of the selections they were given to read. Different lit erary samples elicited different responses from students with some consistency across cultures and school systems (Purves 1973). Drawing on this extensive research base, the 2009 Reading Framework includes two major types of text: literary and informational. Well-crafted nonfiction work with strong literary characteristics will be classified as lit erary text and documents such as tables, graphs, or charts will be included in the informa tional category. Literary and informational texts for the NAEP Reading Assessment are separated for two primary reasons: the structural differences that mark the text types and the purposes for which students read different texts. Exhibits 3 and 4 in chapter two present details about the kinds of literary and informational texts to be included on the NAEP Reading As sessment and about the features of these texts for which items will be written."}, {"section_title": "STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN TEXT", "text": "Literary and informational texts are marked by distinct structural characteristics that readers rely on as they seek to understand what they read (Goldman and Rakestraw 2000). For example, research on literary text (Graesser, Golding, and Long 1991) has pointed out that stories and novels are characterized by a coherent text structure known as \"story grammars.\" Research on informational or expository text (Kobayashi 2002) has indicated that such texts possess distinct organizational patterns, such as sequence or comparison and contrast, designed to help readers organize their emerging sense of what the text is communicating. These structures are distinct from story grammars. The nature of texts affects comprehension and different text types must be read in different ways (Pearson and Camperell 1994). Good readers adjust their reading behaviors to accommo date the kinds of text they are reading."}, {"section_title": "PURPOSES FOR READING", "text": "A second reason for separating text types is that readers often read literary and informa tional texts for different purposes. The definition of reading that guides the NAEP Reading Assessment specifically states that readers read for different purposes, which are often reflected in their selection of literary or informational texts. The purpose set for reading a text often determines how a student reads that text. Literary texts, such as sto ries, drama, essays, or poetry, are frequently read for pleasure or for new perspectives on time, place, human nature, or feelings; they are often read from beginning to end. The ultimate utility of informational text is determined by how well it conveys information or ideas. These differences in reading purpose are, of course, permeable. For example, wellcrafted informational text is often read for appreciation and enjoyment, in addition to the information that the text can provide."}, {"section_title": "FEATURES THAT DISTINGUISH TEXT TYPES", "text": "Several features distinguish literary and informational texts. Skilled writers understand that different kinds of text need different structural patterns, and good readers are able to use these specific text features as aids in comprehension."}, {"section_title": "LITERARY TEXTS", "text": "The 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment will present reading passages (i.e., stimulus mate rial) drawn from three categories of literary text: \u2022 Fiction. \u2022 Literary nonfiction, such as essays, speeches, and autobiographies or biographies. \u2022 Poetry. The structural patterns of fiction (i.e., short stories and novels) have been studied exten sively. Although many researchers have suggested different ways to name the elements of a story (Stein and Glenn 1979), there is general agreement that a story consists of the following components: the setting or settings; a simple or complex plot consisting of a series of episodes and delineating a problem to be solved; the problem or conflict, which requires characters to change, revise plans, or face challenges as they move toward reso lution; and a reaction that expresses the protagonist's feelings about his or her goal at tainment or relates to the broader consequences of the conclusion of the story. This struc ture is often referred to as a story grammar. Characters populate each story, in major or minor roles; themes or major ideas are stated either implicitly or explicitly. Works of literary nonfiction such as biographies, essays, and speeches employ distinct, varied structural patterns and literary features to reflect their purpose and audience. These works may not only present information and ideas but also employ distinctly literary elements and devices to communicate their message and to make their content more ac cessible to readers. Biographies and autobiographies, for example, usually follow a struc ture that in many ways mirrors the story structure of fictional works and they may em ploy literary devices, but they also present information. Literary essays and speeches may be structured differently but also draw on literary devices. The Gettysburg Address, for example, might be viewed simply as an argumentative text or as a dedication or a eulogy, NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK but it is more appropriately viewed as a sophisticated literary text. Readers approach texts of this type not only to gain enjoyment and information, but also to learn and to appreci ate the specific craft behind authors' choices of words, phrases, and structural elements. Like fiction and literary nonfiction, poetry demonstrates specific text characteristics, but these characteristics are different from those found in continuous prose (Hanauer forth coming). Some poetry possesses very rhythmic or metrical patterns and some is written as \"free verse\" without a regular line pattern. Poetry is a highly imaginative form of communication in that poets try to compress their thoughts in fewer words than would be used in ordinary discourse or in prose (Frye 1964). Because the language is often brief and concise, poems employ picturesque and evocative words as well as similes, meta phors, personification, imagery, and other devices that convey the symbolic nature of the ideas, emotions, and actions being expressed. Poetry often involves a high level of ab straction in language and ideas, and requires specific critical thinking skills not found in other types of literary works. For these reasons, it is important that NAEP include poetry on the assessment at grades 4, 8, and 12."}, {"section_title": "INFORMATIONAL TEXTS", "text": "For the NAEP Reading Assessment, informational texts will be classified into three broad categories: \u2022 Exposition. \u2022 Argumentation and persuasive text. \u2022 Procedural text and documents. Informational text, specifically exposition, argumentation, and persuasive text, does not have a single, identifiable structure. Rather, different types of informational text exhibit distinct structural features. The most common structural patterns for continuous exposi tory, argumentative, and persuasive text can be summarized as follows (Bovair and Kieras 1991;Meyer 1975;Goldman and Rakestraw 2000;Kobayashi 2002): Description: A descriptive text structure presents a topic with attributes, specifics, or set ting information that describes that topic. Sequence: Ideas grouped on the basis of order or time. Causation: The text presents causal or cause-and-effect relationships between the ideas presented in the text. Problem/Solution: The main ideas are organized into two parts: a problem and a subse quent solution that responds to the problem, or a question and an answer that responds to the question."}, {"section_title": "NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK", "text": "Comparison: Ideas are related to one another on the basis of similarities and differences. The text presents ideas organized to compare, to contrast, or to provide an alternative per spective. Expository text, argumentation, and persuasive text often contain pictures, charts, tables, and other graphic elements that augment text and contribute to its meaning. Ancillary aids such as headings, bolded text, or bulleted lists emphasize specific components of the text to reinforce authors' messages. Literary texts differ in that illustrations, pictures, or other nonprint elements (when present) may aid readers in understanding the text but are not usually critical for comprehension. The first kind of informational text on the NAEP Reading Assessment, exposition, pre sents information, provides explanations and definitions, and compares and contrasts. Textbooks, news stories, and informational trade books are examples of expository text. Texts classified as argumentation or persuasive text accomplish many of these same goals but can be distinguished by their particular purpose and by the features that authors select to accomplish their goals for writing. The second category of informational text includes argumentation and persuasive text (Driver, Newton, and Osborne 2000;Osborne 2002;Wineburg 1991). Argumentation seeks to influence through appeals that direct readers to specific goals or try to win them to specific beliefs. Authors of persuasive writing must establish their credibility and au thority if their writing is to be successful. Examples of persuasive text are political speeches, editorials, and advertisements. The third type of informational text is often categorized as procedural text or documents (Kirsch and Mosenthal 1990;Mosenthal 1996;Mosenthal 1998). Procedural texts convey information in the form of directions for accomplishing a task. A distinguishing charac teristic of such text is that it is composed of discrete steps to be performed in a strict se quence with an implicit end product or goal. After reading the text, the reader should be able to reach a goal or complete a product. Examples include (but are not limited to) manuals and product support materials, directions for art activities and hobbies, and so on. Procedural texts may include information arranged in graphs, charts, or maps, in addi tion to prose. Document texts in a variety of forms will also be represented on the NAEP Reading As sessment. Documents include graphical representations, often as multimedia elements that require readers to draw on information presented as short continuous prose and also as columns, matrices, or other formats. Document structures can be simple or complex and can present information in a straightforward way as in a simple list or pie graph with clearly delineated elements or embed or \"nest\" information within a document's struc ture. Documents are used frequently in schools and in society. Textbooks often include graphs, tables, and illustrations to accompany and expand on traditional text. Forms are also common (such as applications) as are procedural texts (such as manuals and direc tions). Documents have implicit procedures embedded within them. Often, readers must \"cycle\" through the document or the set of procedures to gain needed information or to NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK answer specific questions. For example, instructions suggest the manner in which an ap plication is to be completed. Informational text will be included at all levels of the NAEP Reading Assessment. Documents embedded in text will be used at grades 4 and 8; stand-alone documents that provide enough information to support item development may be used at grade 12. Chapter two describes the criteria for evaluating examples and noncontinuous text and documents for inclusion.\n\nText structures and features define the organization and elements within the text. The organization and elements refer to the ways ideas are arranged and connected to one another. Features refer to visual and structural elements that support and enhance the reader's ability to understand the text. Author's craft pertains to the specific techniques that an author chooses to relay an intended message. Entries listed within each cell of the matrices should be construed as neither definitive nor inclusive of all text structures and features or techniques of author's craft. However, it is important to delineate the type of text to be used in reading comprehension tests (Kobayashi 2002;Wixson and Peters 1987). Understanding the range of text types for inclusion in the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment illuminates the complex nature of read ing comprehension passages and the accompanying questions. Items will assess students' application of knowledge about text types, text features and structures, and author's craft not their recognition of specific terminology in isolation. The designation of entries in the matrices by grade level reflects the levels at which these components of text are presented in state English language arts standards. They have further been confirmed by experi enced teachers and teacher educators.\n\nExhibit 6 summarizes the considerations for selecting passages and documents. The first two columns present considerations for literary and informational continuous text. The third column presents considerations that must be made in selecting noncontinuous text that is embedded within continuous text or documents that will be used as stand-alone stimulus material at grade 12. Certain considerations are considered essential for each kind of stimulus material and represent the fundamental characteristics that make a text or document appropriate for inclusion. All potential stimulus material must also be grade-appropriate to ensure that students will be able to understand the concepts pre sented and are familiar with the material's stylistic features. Finally, balance must be considered so that the assessment as a whole reflects the full range of print and non continuous text that students encounter in their in-school and out-of-school reading. \n\n\n\nComparison: Text structure in which ideas are related to one another on the basis of simi larities and differences. The text presents ideas organized to compare, to contrast, or to provide an alternative perspective. Conflict: Struggle or clash between opposing characters, forces, or emotions. Connotation: Implicit rather than explicit meaning of a word. It consists of the sugges tions, associations, and emotional overtones attached to a word. Description: Text structure that presents a topic, along with the attributes, specifics, or setting information that describe that topic. Denotation: Exact, literal definition of a word independent of any emotional association or secondary meaning. Detail: Fact revealed by the author or speaker that supports the attitude or tone in a piece of poetry or prose. In informational text, details provide information to support the au thor's main point. Diction: Word choice intended to convey a certain effect. Elegy: Poem that mourns the death of a person or laments something lost. Epic: Long narrative poem that relates the great deeds of a hero who embodies the values of a particular society. Exaggeration or hyperbole: Deliberate, extravagant, and often outrageous overstatement. It may be used for either serious or comic effect. Exposition: One of the classifications of discourse whose function is to inform or to in struct or to present ideas and general truths objectively. Exposition presents information, provides explanations and definitions, and compares and contrasts. Fable: Brief story that teaches a moral or practical lesson about life. Fantasy: Story employing imaginary characters living in fictional settings where the rules of the real world are altered for effect. Fiction: Imaginative literary works representing invented rather than actual persons, places, and events. Lyrical poetry: Poems that focus on expressing emotions or thoughts. Meaning vocabulary: Application of one's understanding of word meanings to passage comprehension. Memoir: Type of autobiography that usually focuses on a single time period or historical event. Metaphor: Comparison of two unlike things without the use of \"like\" or \"as\". Mixed text: Text that employs literary techniques usually associated with narrative or poetry while also presenting information or factual material, with the dual purpose of in forming and offering reading satisfaction; requires readers to discern bias from fact. Monologue: Long, formal speech made by a character. Mood: Atmosphere or predominant emotion in a literary work. Motivation: Circumstance or set of circumstances that prompts a character to act a cer tain way or that determines the outcome of a situation or work. Myth: Traditional story accepted as history, which serves to explain the world view of a people. Narration: Telling of a story in writing. Narrative poetry: Poems that tell a story in verse, often focusing on a single incident. Ode: Long lyric poem on a serious subject often for ceremonial or public occasions. Onomatopoeia: Use of words that mimic the sounds they describe; imitative harmony. Parody: Imitation of a work of literature, art, or music for amusement or instruction. Parallel structure: Repetition of words, phrases, or sentences that have the same gram matical structure or that restate a similar idea. Personification: Metaphor that gives inanimate objects or abstract ideas human character istics. Perspective: Position, stance, or viewpoint from which something is considered or evalu ated. NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK measure of vocabulary. All vocabulary items will function both as a measure of compre hension of the passage in which the word is included and as a test of readers' specific knowledge of the word's meaning as intended by the passage author. NAEP will include a sufficient number of items to provide reliable and valid data for analysis and interpreta tion. A description of the criteria for word selection and number of items appears in chap ter two of the 2009 NAEP Reading Framework and will be elaborated in the Specifica tions document.\nDix spent the next few years systematically studying conditions and getting legislation passed in other states. Her health did not keep her from putting in long hours of hard work and travel. First, she studied the psychological and legal views of mental illness and its treatment. Before she went into a state, she examined local laws and previous propos als for change. Then she visited every institution, small or large, and met with administra tors, politicians, and private citizens. She put all this information together in a memorial that was presented to the legislature. She also wrote newspaper articles to inform the pub lic of her findings. By this time, she knew what kind of opposition to expect, and she could help deflect it by appealing to the citizens' sense of pride or desire for economy. She also met privately with small groups of politicians to answer their questions and try to persuade them to come around to her point of view. She was usually successful, and public institutions to house and treat people with mental illness were established. Unfortunately, that success did not carry over to her next goal: national legislation to im prove the living conditions for people with mental illness. In the l850s, Congress passed a bill setting aside land for the establishment of national hospitals for those with mental illness, but President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill on constitutional grounds. Dix was shattered. Her health, which had been surprisingly good during her struggles, took a turn for the worse, and doctors recommended she take a long voyage. Dix was un able to relax, however, and her vacation turned into a marathon journey through Europe, as she examined the living conditions of mentally ill people in each place she visited. She spoke with doctors, government officials, and even the pope, pleading for humanitarian treatment for those who were mentally ill. She went as far east as Constantinople (now Istanbul) in Turkey and as far north as St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) in Russia. She was greeted respectfully everywhere she went, and many of her recommendations were fol lowed. She returned to the United States in 1857 and was appointed superintendent of women nurses during the Civil War. Dix was the only woman to hold an official position in the U.S. government during the war. After the war, Dix continued her work on behalf of mentally ill people both in the United States and abroad. She died in 1887 at the age of eighty-five. Between 1841, when she began her crusade, and the year she died, thirty-two new hospitals for those who were mentally ill were built, most of them directly because she had brought the problem to the attention of people in power. Several other institutions in Canada and Europe, and even two in Japan, were established because of her influence. She also left a legacy of con cern: No longer was mental illness treated as a crime, and her enlightened and tireless work led to more humane living conditions for people with mental illness.

NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK \u2026Your industry possesses the most powerful voice in America. It has an inescapable duty to make that voice ring with intelligence and with leadership. In a few years this ex citing industry has grown from a novelty to an instrument of overwhelming impact on the American people. It should be making ready for the kind of leadership that newspapers and magazines assumed years ago, to make our people aware of their world. Ours has been called the jet age, the atomic age, the space age. It is also, I submit, the television age. And just as history will decide whether the leaders of today's world em ployed the atom to destroy the world or rebuild it for mankind's benefit, so will history decide whether today's broadcasters employed their powerful voice to enrich the people or debase them\u2026. Like everybody, I wear more than one hat. I am the chairman of the FCC. I am also a television viewer and the husband and father of other television viewers. I have seen a great many television programs that seemed to me eminently worthwhile, and I am not talking about the much-bemoaned good old days of \"Playhouse 90\" and \"Studio One.\" I am talking about this past season. Some were wonderfully entertaining, such as \"The Fabulous Fifties,\" the \"Fred Astaire Show\" and the \"Bing Crosby Special;\" some were dramatic and moving, such as Conrad's \"Victory and \"Twilight Zone;\" some were mar velously informative, such as \"The Nation's Future,\" \"CBS Reports,\" and \"The Valiant Years.\" I could list many more-programs that I am sure everyone here felt enriched his own life and that of his family. When television is good, nothing-not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers-nothing is better. But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the air and stay there without a book, magazine, newspaper, profit-and-loss sheet, or rat ing book to distract you-and keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland. You will see a procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, for mula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western badmen, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more vio lence and cartoons. And, endlessly, commercials-many screaming, cajoling, and of fending. And, most of all, boredom. True, you will see a few things you will enjoy. But they will be very, very few. And if you think I exaggerate, try it. Is there one person in this room who claims that broadcasting can't do better?\u2026 Why is so much of television so bad? I have heard many answers: demands of your ad vertisers; competition for ever higher ratings; the need always to attract a mass audience; the high cost of television programs; the insatiable appetite for programming materialthese are some of them. Unquestionably these are tough problems not susceptible to easy answers. But I am not convinced that you have tried hard enough to solve them. I do not accept the idea that the present overall programming is aimed accurately at the public taste. The rat ings tell us only that some people have their television sets turned on, and, of that num ber, so many are tuned to one channel and so many to another. They don't tell us what the NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK public might watch if they were offered half a dozen additional choices. A rating, at best, is an indication of how many people saw what you gave them. Unfortunately it does not reveal the depth of the penetration or the intensity of reaction, and it never reveals what the acceptance would have been if what you gave them had been better-if all the forces of art and creativity and daring and imagination had been unleashed. I believe in the peo ple's good sense and good taste, and I am not convinced that the people's taste is as low as some of you assume\u2026. Certainly I hope you will agree that ratings should have little influence where children are concerned. The best estimates indicate that during the hours of 5 to 6 p.m., 60 percent of your audience is composed of children under twelve. And most young children today, believe it or not, spend as much time watching television as they do in the schoolroom. I repeat-let that sink in-most young children today spend as much time watching televi sion as they do in the schoolroom. It used to be said that there were three great influences on a child: home, school and church. Today there is a fourth great influence, and you la dies and gentlemen control it. If parents, teachers, and ministers conducted their responsibilities by following the rat ings, children would have a steady diet of ice cream, school holidays, and no Sunday school. What about your responsibilities? Is there no room on television to teach, to in form, to uplift, to stretch, to enlarge the capacities of our children? Is there no room for programs deepening their understanding of children in other lands? Is there no room for a children's news show explaining something about the world to them at their level of un derstanding? Is there no room for reading the great literature of the past, teaching them the great traditions of freedom? There are some fine children's shows, but they are drowned out in the massive doses of cartoons, violence, and more violence. Must these be your trademarks? Search your consciences and see if you cannot offer more to your young beneficiaries whose future you guide so many hours each and every day. What about adult programming and ratings? You know, newspaper publishers take popu larity ratings too. The answers are pretty clear; it is almost always the comics, followed by the advice-to-the-lovelorn columns. But, ladies and gentlemen, the news is still on the front page of all newspapers, the editorials are not replaced by more comics, the newspa pers have not become one long collection of advice to the lovelorn. Yet newspapers do not need a license from the government to be in business-they do not use public prop erty. But in television-where your responsibilities as public trustees are so plain-the moment that the ratings indicate that Westerns are popular, there are new imitations of Westerns on the air faster than the old coaxial cable could take us from Hollywood to New York\u2026. Let me make clear that what I am talking about is balance. I believe that the public inter est is made up of many interests. There are many people in this great country, and you must serve all of us. You will get no argument from me if you say that, given a choice between a Western and a symphony, more people will watch the Western. I like Westerns and private eyes too-but a steady diet for the whole country is obviously not in the pub lic interest. We all know that people would more often prefer to be entertained than NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK stimulated or informed. But your obligations are not satisfied if you look only to popu larity as a test of what to broadcast. You are not only in show business; you are free to communicate ideas as well as relaxation. You must provide a wider range of choices, more diversity, more alternatives. It is not enough to cater to the nation's whims-you must also serve the nation's needs\u2026. Let me address myself now to my role, not as a viewer but as chairman of the FCC\u2026I want to make clear some of the fundamental principles which guide me. First, the people own the air. They own it as much in prime evening time as they do at 6 o'clock Sunday morning. For every hour that the people give you, you owe them some thing. I intend to see that your debt is paid with service. Second, I think it would be foolish and wasteful for us to continue any worn-out wrangle over the problems of payola, rigged quiz shows, and other mistakes of the past\u2026. Third, I believe in the free enterprise system. I want to see broadcasting improved and I want you to do the job\u2026. Fourth, I will do all I can to help educational television. There are still not enough educa tional stations, and major centers of the country still lack usable educational channels\u2026. Fifth, I am unalterably opposed to governmental censorship. There will be no suppression of programming which does not meet with bureaucratic tastes. Censorship strikes at the taproot of our free society. Sixth, I did not come to Washington to idly observe the squandering of the public's air waves. The squandering of our airwaves is no less important than the lavish waste of any precious natural resource\u2026. What you gentlemen broadcast through the people's air affects the people's taste, their knowledge, their opinions, their understanding of themselves and of their world. And their future. The power of instantaneous sight and sound is without precedent in man kind's history. This is an awesome power. It has limitless capabilities for good-and for evil. And it carries with it awesome responsibilities-responsibilities which you and I cannot escape\u2026. Reprinted from the NAEP website.

The solution is to use other NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK texts to find additional information. In consulting multiple texts, readers must engage in all the processes to read individual texts and they must also engage in other processes to compare those texts on multiple dimensions and decide on their accuracy, bias, and credibility. These skills need to be assessed to see how well students can read and com prehend texts that contain different information, reach different conclusions about the same material, or have different levels of credibility.

These texts are representative of the developing conceptual understandings formed by students during this period. At grades 8 and 12, more complex genres of fiction are common including satires, parodies, science fiction, and allegories. For purposes of the NAEP Reading Assessment, these genres may be either intact passages or passages excerpted from longer genres such as NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK novels. Material excerpted from longer pieces will be carefully analyzed to ensure that it has the structural integrity and cohesion necessary to sustain item development. The matrix also shows the aspects of text structures and features and author's craft that may be assessed. These components, as well as the purposes for reading, become increas ingly complex and sophisticated as students move through the elementary, middle, and high school grades. For example, themes may be more abstract; plots may involve inter nal or external conflicts; characterization may develop with antagonists, protagonists, and narrators with intertwined motives, beliefs, traits, and attitudes; the theme and setting may be more integral to each other; the plot may consist of a series of rising and falling actions within episodes; and the point of view or vantage point chosen by the author to reveal ideas, characters, or actions becomes more sophisticated, often including a shifting point of view or multiple points of view. Authors select from a range of stylistic devices to enhance their presentation. In the ma trix, these are referred to as author's craft. "}, {"section_title": "LITERARY NONFICTION", "text": "The second type of literary text is literary nonfiction, which may include elements of nar ration and exposition and is often referred to as mixed text (Alexander and Jetton 2000). Literary nonfiction is an example of mixed text because it uses literary techniques usually associated with fiction or poetry and also presents information or factual material. Stylis tically, it frequently blends literary elements and devices with factual information with the dual purpose of informing and offering reading satisfaction. Text types for literary nonfiction at grade 4 include autobiographical and biographical sketches, and personal essays. At grade 8, additional forms of literary nonfiction used include character sketches, memoirs, and speeches. Classical essays are introduced as literary nonfiction at grade 12. Unlike texts that can be categorized as informational because of their sequen tial, chronological, or causal structure, literary nonfiction uses a storylike structure. Clas sical essays may interweave personal examples and ideas with factual information to at tain their purpose of explaining, presenting a perspective, or describing a situation or event. Literary nonfiction selected for inclusion on NAEP will conform to the highest standards of literary quality. lyrical, and humorous poems and free verse. Additionally at grade 8, odes, songs, and epics are included in the matrix for possible item development. More complex poetic forms are included at grade 12, such as sonnets and elegies. It is possible that two poems may be used together in intertextual item sets to allow students to perform complex read ing tasks, such as comparing thematic treatment in two poems or contrasting two poets' choices of literary devices. Readers use the structure of poetry to aid in comprehension. Poetic structures range from simple to complex. Students at grade 4 can be expected to be familiar with simple organ izational patterns such as verse and stanza along with the basic elements of rhyme scheme, rhythm, mood, and themes and intent. At grades 8 and 12, increasingly complex poetic organizational patterns and elements will be included. Students will also be ex pected to understand the use of \"white space\" as a structural feature of poetry. Understanding a poet's choices also aids in understanding poetry. Language choice is of particular importance because the meaning in poetry is distilled in as few words as possi ble. Poets choose from among a range of rhetorical structures and figurative language, using, for example, repetition, dialogue, line organization and shape, patterns, and many forms of figurative language. Increasingly complex application of figurative language, rhetorical devices, and complex poetry arrangements are included at grades 8 and 12."}, {"section_title": "INFORMATIONAL TEXT", "text": "As stated in chapter one, informational text on the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment will be of three types: exposition, argumentation or persuasive text, and procedural text or documents. Exhibit 4 presents the ways informational text will be assessed at grades 4, 8, and 12. The matrix consists of three parts, each of which is accompanied by explanatory text. "}, {"section_title": "EXPOSITION", "text": "As they progress beyond the early grades, students read expository text with increasing frequency both in and out of school (Broer, Aarnoutse, Kieviet, and Van Leeuwe 2002). The primary goals of expository text for school-age readers are to communicate informa tion and to advance learning. Forms that may be assessed at grade 4 are informational trade books, textbook passages, news stories, feature stories, and encyclopedia entries. At grade 8, expository text genres include historical documents, various grade-appropriate essays, and research reports. More complex essay formats will be included for assessment at grade 12 such as political, social, historical, or scientific essays that primarily commu nicate information. Expository texts are characterized by internal sets of \"grammars\" similar in function to the story grammars discussed in chapter one. These grammars are designed to move the exposition forward and to help the reader comprehend the text. As shown in the matrix, the major organizational structures of exposition are description, sequence, cause and ef fect, problem and solution, and comparison and contrast (Meyer 1975). As mentioned in chapter one, exposition may also include lists as a structural component with lists of de scriptions, causes, problems, solutions, and views presented within other structures. Commonly, exposition does not contain just one structural format, but rather combines several structures embedded in the text. Specific elements within these organization structures signal meaning to the reader. Se quence, point of view, topics or central ideas, and supporting ideas and evidence are listed at grade 4; at grade 8 and grade 12, the structural organization and elements will be assessed at increasingly complex levels and with increasingly sophisticated texts. Some surface-level or graphic features support the text structures of exposition and guide the reader through the text. Other textual features can be categorized as reflecting author's craft; these features guide the reader through the use of transitional words, signal words, voice, figurative language, and rhetorical structures. At grades 8 and 12, increasingly complex use of these features and of the author's craft will be included for assessment. "}, {"section_title": "ARGUMENTATION AND PERSUASIVE TEXT", "text": "Many forms of informational text pose an argument or attempt to persuade readers to ward a particular viewpoint. These texts present information to support or prove a point, to express an opinion, and to try to convince readers that a specific viewpoint is correct or justifiable. Various logical fallacies and forms of bias may be found in argumentation and persuasive text. As the matrix shows, there is considerable similarity in structure, literary features, and elements among exposition, argumentation, and persuasive text. The real distinction lies in the purpose for which an author writes these particular kinds of infor mational text; as stated, exposition seeks to inform and educate, whereas argumentation and persuasive text seek to influence their readers' thinking in other, often subtle but sig nificant ways. At grade 4, argumentation and persuasive texts listed in the matrix are informational trade books that specifically argue a position or persuade the reader toward a stance, journals, speeches, and simple persuasive essays. However, in 2009 NAEP will not assess argu mentation and persuasive texts at grade 4 due to difficulty in locating high-quality texts appropriate for this grade level. At grade 8, there are more complex forms of argumenta tion and persuasive texts: letters to the editor and editorials and argumentative and gradeappropriate persuasive essays. At grade 12, argumentation and persuasive texts become increasingly more complex with a variety of types of essays such as political and social commentary essays, historical accounts, and position papers such as persuasive bro chures, campaign literature, and advertisements. Particular organization techniques and elements are used to create a clear argument or to form a persuasive stand. The differences between exposition and argumentation and persuasive text lie not in the structural organization, but rather in the way the texts are elaborated through the use of contrasting viewpoints, shaping of arguments, appeals to NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK emotions, and other manipulations of the elements of text and language. The organiza tional structures at all levels are the same as in exposition: description, sequence, cause and effect, problem and solution, and comparison and contrast; they are represented in grades 8 and 12 with increasing complexity. Elements within these organizational structures include the author's perspective, topics or central ideas, supporting ideas, contrasting viewpoints or perspectives, and the presenta tion of the argument (e.g., issue definition, issue choice, stance, and relevance). These elements appear at all grade levels with complexity increasing at higher grade levels. In addition, at grade 12 students may be asked about the structure of a given argument; con nections among evidence, inferences, and claims; and the structure of a deductive versus inductive argument. Twelfth-grade students may also be asked questions about the range and quality of evidence, and logical fallacies, false assumptions/ premises, loaded terms, caricature, leading questions, and faulty reasoning in argumentation and persuasive texts."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit 4 (continued).

Docu ments and procedural texts are indeed common in our society; for example, we interpret bus schedules, assemble simple devices, order goods from a catalog, or follow directions to set the VCR clock. Such texts are used frequently in elementary and secondary schools, where students encounter textbooks replete with graphs, tables, and illustrations to accompany and expand traditional continuous text. Procedural text may be primarily prose arranged to show specific steps toward accom plishing a goal or it may combine both textual and graphic elements to communicate with the user. Documents, in contrast, use text sparingly, in a telescopic way that minimizes the continuous prose that readers must process to gain the information they need. As the matrix shows, document texts on the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment may in clude, but are not limited to, tables and charts. Stand-alone procedural text or documents will not be included at grades 4 and 8; such text will be embedded in or ancillary to con tinuous text. They may appear as stand-alone stimuli at grade 12 but their use will ac count for only a small amount of the stimuli in the entire assessment. It is likely that many of the documents may be used as part of intertextual item sets. For example, a stu dent might encounter a bar graph and a timeline with items that relate to both texts. Documents and procedural text features act as necessary clues to the organization of the text. As textual supports, these features guide the reader through the text. For the pur poses of the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment, graphic features include titles, labels, headings, subheadings, sidebars, photos and illustrations, charts and graphs, and legends at grades 4, 8, and 12. More complex examples of these will be included at each succes sive grade."}, {"section_title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF TEXTS SELECTED FOR INCLUSION", "text": "Passages selected as stimulus material for the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment must meet rigorous criteria. They will all be authentic texts of the highest quality, evidencing characteristics of good writing, coherence, and appropriateness for each grade level. Pas sages will be drawn from a variety of contexts familiar to students nationwide. Stimulus material must be engaging to students at each grade level. Furthermore, material must reflect our literary heritage by including recognized works from varied historical periods (Ravitch 2003). It is true that children's experience differs from that of adults, and therefore the application of standards should be consonant with child life. Nevertheless, one must keep in mind the emotional maturity of the children for whom the book or books are intended. This does not NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK mean that the works must be watered down so as to meet the reading ability levels of young children. On the contrary, some books of last ing value outstrip their vocabulary lists and connect with children on emotional-maturity levels so that they can be understood and enjoyed by the young themselves\u2026. [T]he standards basic to good writing in adult literature are also basic to good writing for children (Georgiou 1988).

To gain the most valid information about students' reading, stimulus material should be as similar as possible to what students actually encounter in their in-school and out-of-school reading. Unlike many common reading tests that use short passages, NAEP will present longer material that challenges students to use their strategic reading skills in ways that reflect the kinds of reading they do in nontest situations (Paris, Wasik, and Turner 1991). Furthermore, short passages usually will not yield approximately 10 distinct items, the required mini mum number for each NAEP item set. Longer passages, with clear structural patterns, can support the development of multiple, distinct, nontrivial items that cover the range of content included in the literary and informational text matrices. These items will also al low broad coverage of the cognitive targets discussed later in this chapter. It is expected that in some cases, two poems will be used together to assess students' abil ity to compare them in terms of their themes and stylistic features. Prose passages used in intertextual item sets will also be fairly short. Likewise, it is possible that two documents might be included as intertextual stimuli at grade 12."}, {"section_title": "SELECTION OF LITERARY AND INFORMATIONAL PASSAGES", "text": "Several methods of evaluating passages will be used to ensure that the best possible stimulus material is included. Authentic material must be of the highest quality and it must come from authentic sources such as those students would encounter in their inschool and out-of school reading. Material must be coherent and allow items that assess domain-specific knowledge (Kobayashi 2002). Additionally, systematic efforts will be made to ensure that texts selected for inclusion will of interest to the widest number of students. Readers become more engaged in text and consequently comprehend a selection better when they find the material interesting (Bauman 1986;Wade, Buxton, and Kelly 1993;Wade and Moje 2000;Wade et al. 1993). Texts will reflect literary heritage by rep resenting varied historical periods. Passages selected for inclusion on the assessment will be well written, interesting to read, and considerate; that is, easily comprehensible because they are well organized, have ap propriate vocabulary, and, where needed, have useful supplemental explanatory features such as definitions of technical terms or topographical features. Ideas marked by graphic features such as italics, bold print, and signal words and phrases tend to be processed more easily and recalled longer than unmarked information. In selecting passages, atten tion will be paid to written clues within text that can help readers understand structure, guide the development of main ideas, and influence the recall of information. For exam ple, readers tend to organize and remember emphasized information better when authors lead them with signal words indicating main ideas (for example, the most important point here), with phrases indicating sequencing (such as words like first, second, third), and with statements cross-referencing disparate parts of text (Armbruster 1984). Especially in the selection of informational text, the degree of content elaboration will be an important criterion for passage selection. Sufficient elaboration of new concepts is needed if students are to gain sufficient information to respond to questions. Tersely writ ten informational text tends to be more difficult for students to comprehend compared with text written with more elaborated explanations. Whether text is tersely written or presents fully elaborated content is particularly important with topics that may be beyond the background knowledge of some students. An inviting writing style can also enhance interest and thereby increase comprehension. Material may be interesting not because of what is said but because of how it is said. For example, writers can increase interest by using active rather than passive verbs, by in cluding examples that make the writing less abstract, and by using vivid and unusual words. An inviting writing style also influences voice. Voice, the qualities that help a reader view text as communication between an author and a reader, can have a positive effect on recall (Beck, McKeown, and Worthy 1995). Expert judgment will be the primary method for evaluating and selecting passages for inclusion on the assessment. Additional methods include the use of story and concept mapping and vocabulary mapping. At least two research-based readability formulas will also be used to gather additional information about passage difficulty (Klare 1984;White NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK and Clement 2001). Passages will be thoroughly reviewed for potential bias and sensitiv ity issues. Story and concept mapping procedures have been used to identify appropriate passages for previous assessments (Wixson and Peters 1987). These procedures result in a graphic representation of a possible stimulus selection that clearly highlights the hierarchical structure and the interrelatedness of the passage components. Story mapping, for exam ple, will show how the setting of a story is related, and contributes to, the development of plot and theme. Concept mapping shows the structure of informational text along with the concepts presented and the relational links among concepts. Organizing information hier archically within a passage allows the identification of various levels of information within a text so that items can target the most important aspects of what students read. As NAEP begins to assess vocabulary in a systematic way, the story and concept map ping procedures will be modified to ensure that appropriate words are selected for item development."}, {"section_title": "SELECTION OF POETRY", "text": "In selecting poetry for the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment, it will be important to de termine that potential poems present a theme instead of stressing primarily the melodic or stylistic aspects of language use. Especially at grades 4 and 8, the theme should be im plicitly presented in terms that are not so abstract that they are beyond students' compre hension. Words and phrases should be used with economy to support and amplify the meaning inherent in the text; the style should be distinguished by author's craft and pro ject the poet's feelings about his or her topic or theme. The ideas presented must be ac cessible to students and it must be clear that poetry, rather than prose, is the better mode for presenting these ideas. A good question to ask in selecting poetry is: Does the poetry, through its expression of theme and ideas, carry children beyond their immediate experiential level to extensions where language and imagination meet?

Equally, stand-alone documents must be rich with appropriate information about which questions can be asked.

Vocabulary knowledge is considered to be one of the five essential compo nents of reading as defined by the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation. In this con text, vocabulary is construed not as isolated word meanings but as real knowledge of vo cabulary that can advance comprehension. NAEP will not test definitions in isolation from surrounding text; that is, students will not be assessed on their prior knowledge of definitions. The definition of meaning vocabu lary will guide the development: Meaning vocabulary is the application of one's understanding of word meanings to passage comprehension."}, {"section_title": "IMPORTANCE OF VOCABULARY FOR READING COMPREHENSION", "text": "The associations between vocabulary and learning to read and then between vocabulary and reading comprehension are well documented in research (Hart and Risley 1995). 3 Studies have repeatedly shown that students' vocabulary is a fundamental factor in their ability to comprehend what they read. Not knowing the meaning of words as used in a given text may result in decreased comprehension of that text. Comprehending any read ing passage requires knowing the meaning of the important content-bearing words of that passage, but often, the meaning of many key words in a passage depends on an interac tion of word meaning and passage meaning (Bauman, Kame'enui, and Ash 2002;Lan dauer, Foltz, and Laham 1998). Because of this interaction, measurement of word mean ing by NAEP should be integrated with the measurement of passage comprehension. Several major factors are known to affect readers' comprehension of what they read and can highlight the connection between word meaning and passage meaning; these include: \u2022 The context for reading (e.g., for study, for skimming, for leisure). \u2022 Fluency in identifying the words of the text. \u2022 Background or domain knowledge of the content of the text. \u2022 Knowledge of \"the sense of the meaning\" of the words the author uses to convey important content (Miller 1991). \u2022 Comprehension monitoring."}, {"section_title": "REASONS FOR ASSESSING VOCABULARY ON NAEP READING", "text": "The growing body of research documenting the link between vocabulary and reading comprehension provides a strong rationale for the inclusion of a systematic measure of vocabulary. Past assessments have included a few vocabulary test items, all of which measured vocabulary in context; however, the number of items was scant and there were no specific vocabulary-related criteria for selecting the items or distractors. Furthermore, NAEP reports provided no information about performance on those items or how vocabu lary performance might be related to reading comprehension. This change for 2009, then, is significant. All vocabulary items will function both as a measure of passage compre hension and as a test of readers' specific knowledge of the word's meaning as intended by the passage author."}, {"section_title": "MEASUREMENT OF MEANING VOCABULARY", "text": "Vocabulary items will be developed about the meaning of words as they are used in the context of the passages that students read. Students will not be asked to draw on their prior knowledge by providing a written definition of each word on a list or in a set of words. There are two reasons for this approach. First, knowledge as explicit as a written definition of a word is not the specific ability required for passage comprehension. In re ality, readers may not be able to provide a complete definition of a word they encounter but do have enough of the sense of the word's meaning as used in text that their compre hension is not impeded. A second argument against demanding specific definitions is that word meaning often depends on the context in which the word appears. Finding out whether readers know one specific definition of a word will not indicate whether they understand that word as it is used in a given text. Indeed, there is evidence that readers who know one definition of a word but not the meaning in a given text try to alter the sense of the text in keeping with their known definition: leading, of course, to misunder standing the text (Deegan 1995). In addition, writers often use words in a manner that goes beyond concrete, familiar definitions, but do so in ways that skilled readers can in terpret effectively. Jacques Barzun describes this: Language is not an algebra; that is, the symbols do not stay put, nor can they be carried from place to place with an assurance that their value will not change. If language were like an algebra there could be no poetry or other fiction, no diplomacy or intimate correspondence, no persuasion or religious literature. If language were like an algebra, uncomfortable would mean not able to be comforted, and a myriad other nuances of human feel ings would have to remain unrecorded and unshared (Barzun 1975)."}, {"section_title": "CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTING VOCABULARY", "text": "In selecting passages, test developers must create a \"map\" of the story or expository se lection to identify a passage's key features. This procedure has included identifying can didates for vocabulary items, but the process will be enhanced to ensure that passages contain enough candidate words or terms for item development. The intent of the vocabulary assessment is to determine whether readers know and under stand the meanings of the words that writers use to convey new information or meaning, not to measure readers' ability to learn new terms or words. Hence, the assessment will NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK focus on words that characterize the vocabulary of mature language users and character ize written rather than oral language. The words selected for item development will convey concepts, ideas, actions, or feelings that the readers most likely know. In general, the words selected as targets for item development characterize the language of mature readers and are used in texts from a variety of content domains (Beck, McKeown, and Kucan 2002). 4 Considerations for selecting words for item development are summarized in exhibit 7."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit 7.

Words that are appropriate for inclusion denote concepts or things that readers already know. That is, the word denotes an object, idea, feeling, or action that has been experi enced or has been seen by the readers. However, the test item is not designed to deter mine whether readers know the thing, but rather whether readers are able to link this knowledge (object, idea, feeling, action) to the word the author uses to convey this mean ing. NAEP presumes that most readers will likely have the background knowledge of the object, idea, feeling, or action in a passage, but because the words are difficult and un common, readers may not readily link that knowledge to the specific word the author uses to convey that meaning. If readers do not connect a meaning with the author's word, their comprehension will suffer. NAEP vocabulary items are designed to test readers' ability to connect an appropriate meaning to the candidate words to gain comprehension. Thus, test items will not target technical terms or words identifying the central idea(s) of the passage because those words often represent new knowledge, concepts, or conceptu alizations for readers. Passage comprehension items will measure readers' learning from text; vocabulary items will measure readers' knowledge of certain important words the author uses to impart this meaning. Clearly, some students (probably highly able readers) will know and understand some test words before taking the assessment. This is unavoidable. Furthermore, we anticipate that some readers will not have the background to link to the author's words and thus will either choose an incorrect response for the item because of their background knowledge or identify the meaning of the word from context and mark the correct response. These are again probably advanced readers. Recognizing this possibility, NAEP will ensure that the vocabulary test items represent a continuum of difficulty across readers at a given grade (as will reading passages and comprehension items). The intent is to identify words that the majority of grade-level students do not generally use in speaking or writing, but have seen or heard at least a few times."}, {"section_title": "COGNITIVE TARGETS", "text": "Items will be developed to assess students' comprehension of literary and informational text. The term cognitive targets refers to the mental processes or kinds of thinking that underlie reading comprehension. Test questions will be aligned to cognitive dimensions applicable to literary and informational texts and also to cognitive dimensions specific to each text type. The remainder of the chapter presents those cognitive dimensions targeted by the items (hence the term cognitive targets) and discusses the item types included on the assessment. Inclusion of specific cognitive targets reflects the intent of the definition of reading that guides the assessment. The definition, explained in chapter one, follows. Reading is an active and complex process that involves: \u2022 Understanding written text. \u2022 Developing and interpreting meaning. \u2022 Using meaning as appropriate to type of text, purpose, and situation."}, {"section_title": "READING PROCESSES INCLUDED IN COGNITIVE TARGET MATRICES", "text": "The reading processes included in the three sections of the cognitive target matrix, exhibit 8, illustrate the complex nature of reading. The research literature contains numerous NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK studies that show how students use different reading processes when reading various types of text (see chapter one). Hence, the sections of the matrix representing literary and informational text emphasize that different texts elicit different kinds of reading behav iors. The reading processes presented in the matrix are also grounded in the research lit erature on comprehension, most specifically the literature that uses protocol analysis (\"think-alouds\") as its research methodology (Garner 1982;Guthrie, Britten, and Barker 1991;Norris and Phillips 1987;Pressley and Afflerbach 1995;Olvshavsky 1976-77). Furthermore, they reflect the cognitive processes assessed on international reading as sessments such the Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study (PIRLS) (Campbell et al. 2001) "}, {"section_title": "Locate and Recall", "text": "The first cognitive behaviors are locate and recall. As students locate or recall informa tion from what they read, they may identify clearly stated main ideas or supporting de tails or they may find essential elements of a story, such as characters, time, or setting. Their process in answering assessment items often involves matching information given in the item to either literal or synonymous information in the text before they can then use the textual information to develop a response. As readers engage in these behaviors, they monitor their reading in order to understand when they are comprehending and when they are not. When they realize that the text is not making sense, they employ specific strate gies to ensure that they begin to comprehend again. A salient activity [in reading] is to find the main ideas in the text and make certain that these ideas are remembered-or at least can be found again if needed. The big ideas, of course, are always relative to the goals of the reading with respect to the text. That is, very different ideas may be con sidered main ideas if a reader is reading for one purpose versus another (Pressley and Afflerbach 1995. p. 44). Items assessing this component of reading usually focus on information contained in rela tively small amounts of text: a sentence, a paragraph, or two or more adjacent paragraphs. These items provide information about the most basic comprehension skills, those that ultimately form the foundation for a more elaborate understanding of what is read. At the same time, these items address the kinds of reading that occur routinely in school and in out-of-school reading activities. Regardless of a reader's goal-whether reading is done in preparation for a test, in anticipation of a writing assignment, with the expectation of sharing it in a conversation, to determine an author's perspective, or as part of staying abreast in an area of interest-it is necessary to identify the important information in a text (Pressley and Afflerbach 1995, p. 31)."}, {"section_title": "Integrate and Interpret", "text": "The next set of reading behaviors refers to what readers do as they integrate new informa tion into their initial sense of what a passage says, often interpreting what they read in the process. When readers engage in behaviors involving integrating and interpreting, they make comparisons and contrasts of information or character actions, examine relations across aspects of text, or consider alternatives to what is presented in text. This aspect of the reading is critical to comprehension and can be considered the stage in which readers really move beyond the discrete information, ideas, details, themes, and so forth pre sented in text and extend their initial impressions by processing information logically and completely. As readers integrate information and interpret what they read, they frequently form questions, use mental images, and make connections that draw on larger sections of text, often at an abstract level. They also draw on their knowledge of the structure and elements of literary and informational text. In applying these behaviors, readers invariably think across large portions of text, across the text as a whole, or even across multiple texts; they relate textual information to knowledge from other sources such as their previous content learning or to internalized criteria and logic. Thus, readers might ask themselves whether something they are read ing makes sense to them within the realm of their own experiences or when considered against what they have read in other sources. They examine the text in terms of their spe cific reading goals or the needs they have for the information that the text can provide. In certain reading situations, readers may apply what they know to what they are reading, for example, determining a real-world application of suggestions in a text on bicycle safety. They also apply information gained from reading, for example in following in structions for repairing a bicycle or reading a map to determine where bike routes have been designated in a city. Readers are aware of many different aspects of text and the reading task they are performing from the outset of reading. Their perceptions of the text and how it relates to their task/reading goals does much to shape the processing of text, with readers processing some parts of the text superfi cially and others very carefully. . . . Good readers not only know what they are doing but also why they are doing it, ever aware of the characteristics of text they are confronting and their own reading goals (Pressley and Af flerbach 1995, p. 68). Items assessing these behaviors might ask students to form generalizations about a piece of informational text or make statements about how the setting of a story contributes to the creation of theme. Other items might require interpretation, for example, of a charac ter's motivations or of an author's reasons for attempting to persuade readers about an issue. Other questions might ask for alternative actions that a character might have taken or an interpretation of an implied message or moral from a story."}, {"section_title": "Critique and Evaluate", "text": "The final set of reading behaviors, critiquing and evaluating text, requires readers to stand back from what they read and view the text objectively. The focus remains on the text itself but the reader's purpose is to consider the text critically by assessing it from nu merous perspectives and synthesizing what is read with other texts and other experiences. Items may ask students to evaluate the quality of the text as a whole, to determine what is most significant in a passage, or to judge the effectiveness of specific textual features to accomplish the purpose of the text (e.g., the effectiveness of details selected to support a persuasive argument). Items might ask for the likelihood that an event could actually have taken place, the plausibility of an argument, or the adequacy of an explanation for an event. Items can ask students to focus at the level of language choices (for example, nuances expressed in a metaphor) or at the broader level of the entire text (for example, evaluating the effectiveness of an author's craft to accomplish his or her overall goals). To answer these questions, students draw on what they know about text, language, and the ways authors manipulate language and ideas to achieve their goals. Sometimes readers recognize from the very start that they are likely to be evaluative with respect to a text, and likely to react to it affectively. . . . Although some readers evidence great consistency in their evaluative stances as they read some texts, evaluations are often much more dis criminated. Regardless of whether a reader is globally positive, globally negative, or a mixture of both, evaluations occur with respect to the style and context of text (Pressley and Afflerbach 1995, p. 76)."}, {"section_title": "Assessing Cognitive Targets", "text": "Exhibit 8 presents the cognitive target matrix for the development of items to be used on the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment. 5 The term cognitive targets is used to refer to the mental processes or kinds of thinking that underlie reading comprehension; the cognitive targets serve to guide the test development process in that item writers \"target\" these processes or kinds of thinking as they write items. The cognitive targets remain the same across all three grades on the assessment but the passages and documents about which items are developed will be of increasing sophistication at each grade. Items will be developed to assess all cognitive targets at each grade level but the distribu tion of cognitive targets will vary across grades. In determining the distribution across grade levels, careful thought was given to the kinds of texts that students encounter at NAEP 2009 READING FRAMEWORK each level. Reference was also made to the distribution across reading processes in the two international reading assessments, PISA and PIRLS (Campbell et al. 2001;OECD 2000).

Both item types yield valuable information about students' reading and allow a rich, full description of how the nation's students approach different kinds of text. The inclusion of both types of items affirms the complex nature of the reading process because it recognizes that different kinds of information can be gained from each item type. It also acknowledges the real-world skill of being able to write about what one has read. Multiple-choice items will include four options: the right response and three incorrect responses. It is assumed that a multiple-choice item will take students approximately 1 minute to complete. Short constructed-response items can be answered by one or two phrases or by one or two sentences; they should take students approximately 2 to 3 min utes to complete. Extended constructed-response items should elicit longer, more elabo rated answers of a paragraph or two. They should take students approximately 5 minutes to complete. Scoring rubrics for short and extended constructed-response items will focus on the content included in answers, not on spelling or grammatical considerations. How ever, students must answer constructed-response questions by using information from the text to receive credit. Details regarding the scoring and short and extended constructedresponse items appear in the Specifications for the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment. 6 The distribution of multiple-choice and constructed-response items will vary across the grades assessed by the 2009 NAEP Reading Assessment. The percentages in exhibit 10 refer to the amount of assessment time that students will spend responding to these par ticular kinds of items. Hence, grade 4 students will spend approximately 50 percent of the assessment time responding to multiple-choice items and 50 percent of the assessment time preparing written responses. Students at grades 8 and 12 will spend more time pre paring written responses. Approximately two items per passage will assess vocabulary knowledge. These items may be either multiple choice or short constructed response in format. Exhibit 10 shows the distribution of time to be spent on each kind of item. Exhibit 10.

Reading achievement levels specific to the 2009 NAEP Reading Framework will be developed to elaborate on the generic definitions. New readingspecific achievement-level descriptors will replace those aligned to the previous frame work (NAGB 2003). Preliminary achievement level descriptors have been developed for the assessment as a whole and for the vocabulary component of the assessment. These preliminary achievement levels will be used to guide item development and initial stages The preliminary achievement level statements describe important reading skills that stu dents should have mastered at grades 4, 8, and 12 at the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced levels. At each grade, the proficient level reflects competency in various literacy skills, including vocabulary, when reading a range of literary and informational texts. In addi tion, the framework committees believe that 12th-grade students performing at the profi cient level possess the reading and analytical skills needed for rigorous college-level courses and other productive postsecondary endeavors. Exhibit 13 presents the preliminary achievement level descriptions for vocabulary. The descriptions are not presented by grade level but instead refer to achievement at the Ba sic, Proficient, and Advanced levels when students encounter grade-appropriate text.

These students are not necessarily nonreaders; many can complete some tasks on the assessment but are not able to attain the minimum score required for Basic. Data are reported on subgroups of students by gender, race/ethnicity, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch, region of the country, type of community, public or nonpublic school, and other variables of interest. Data are never provided for individual students or schools. Subscores should be provided for literary and informational texts. Results will also be provided about students' responses to the vocabulary items. It is recommended that the 2009 results continue to use a 0-500 cross-grade scale. Use of such a scale affirms that reading is a development process and that students' reading skills mature throughout their school years as they read increasingly diverse and sophisti cated texts. The primary vehicles for reporting NAEP reading results are the Reading Highlights and Reading Report Cards issued after each assessment administration. These reports provide detailed information on the assessments, the students who participated, and the assess ment results. Results are disaggregated by specific groups and are also presented for states that participate in the NAEP state assessment. Among the focal groups are males and females, students from various racial/ethnic backgrounds, and students who took the assessment with and without accommodations.

Passages and accompanying test items administered as part of the long-term trend assessments have remained unchanged from their initial administration in 1971. The 2009 NAEP Reading Framework represents several important changes from the framework that has guided the assessment since 1992 (see exhibit 2). These changes are significant enough that the reading trendline from the 1992 assessment will be broken; a new trendline will be instituted to reflect the revised framework. NAEP reports are useful in providing trend results over time to inform decisions and al locations of resources and framing of policy about reading. The questions that NAEP ad dresses include these: \u2022 Are students improving in reading achievement over time? \u2022 Are percentages of students at the upper achievement levels increasing, decreas ing, or remaining the same? \u2022 Are the gaps in achievement among various groups narrowing?

To satisfy the goal of enriching reports on student achievement in reading, background variables are selected to be of topical interest, timely, and directly related to academic achievement. The selection of variables about which questions will be developed may reflect current trends in the field, such as the use of technology in reading instruction or the extent to which students use the Internet as a reference tool.

The big gray rat laughed long and loud until his gaunt gray sides were shaking. \"Why, you talk just as if you thought you had a chance to win the race,\" he said, when he could speak. The bright green and gold parrot set the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff as the goal of the race. He gave the signal to start and then he flew away to the royal palm tree to watch for the end of the race. The big gray rat ran as fast as he could. Then he thought how very tired he was getting. \"What's the use of hurrying?\" he said to himself. \"The little brown beetle cannot possibly win. If I were racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different.\" Then he started to run more slowly, but every time his heart beat it said, \"Hurry up!

Dorothea Dix was so shy and quiet that it is hard to believe she had such a tremendous impact on nineteenth-century America. Yet almost single-handedly, she transformed the way people with mental illness were treated. Dorothea was born in Maine in 1802 to a neglectful father and a mother who had trouble coping with daily activities. She ran away at the age of twelve to live with her grand mother, a cold, inflexible woman who nevertheless taught her the importance of doing her duty, as well as the organizational skills to help her do it. Dorothea grew into an attractive woman, with blue-gray eyes, wavy brown hair, and a rich, low speaking voice. As a young adult, she spent her time teaching, writing books for children, and fighting the effects of tuberculosis. Despite her poor health, by age thirtynine, she had saved enough money so that she had no financial worries. Afraid that her health was too poor for her to continue teaching, she looked forward to a lonely, unfulfil ling life. Then a friend suggested that she teach a Sunday school class for women in a Massachu setts jail. It would be useful without overtaxing her. On her first day, she discovered that among the inmates were several mentally ill women. They were anxious to hear what she had to say, but she found it impossible to teach them because the room was unheated. Dix, angry at this neglect on the part of the authorities, asked noted humanitarian Samuel Howe for his help in taking the case to court. The court ordered the authorities to install a wood stove. This sparked Dix's interest in the ways mentally ill people were treated. Encouraged by Howe and education reformer Horace Mann, she spent two years visiting every asylum, almshouse, and jail in Massachusetts, quietly taking notes on the conditions. Her grand mother had trained her to be thorough and the training paid off. Dix put her findings into a memorial (a report) that Howe presented to the Massachusetts legislature: \"I tell what I have seen. . . . [I]nsane persons confined . . . in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens; chained, naked, beaten with rods and lashed into obedience.\" The memorial caused an uproar: What kind of woman would be interested in such a sub ject and insist on discussing it in public? Gradually, the personal attacks abated, primar ily because Dix's research had been so thorough and her results were so complete that no one could argue with them. Howe was able to push a bill through the Massachusetts leg islature to enlarge the state asylum."}, {"section_title": "SPECIAL STUDY: ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS PURPOSE", "text": "This special study will examine the patterns of achievement among English language learner (ELL) students and the link between NAEP scores and other indicators of stu dents' ability and achievement as well as the effects of the accommodations afforded stu dents in these groups."}, {"section_title": "RATIONALE", "text": "In today's schools, the number of ELL students is on the rise. This population trend has implications for reading instruction and assessment as educators seek better ways to teach and evaluate. Clearly, they need more information about language and its relationship to reading comprehension and meaning vocabulary, a link indicated by past studies. Although past NAEP reports have provided scores by ethnicity, they have not provided information about the link between language minority students and reading ability.

Girls generally have higher secondary school graduation rates, college admission rates, and enrollment in Advanced Placement courses in the humanities, whereas boys have a higher incidence of diagnosed reading disorders. Although boys generally have higher mathematics and science achievement, the gender gap in the language arts favors girls. Results from the 2002 NAEP Reading Assessment indicate the following: \u2022 The score gap between male and female grade 4 students in 2002 was smaller than in 2000, but it was not found to be significantly different from that in 1992. \u2022 The score gap between boys and girls at grade 8 was smaller in 2002 than in all prior assessment years. \u2022 The score gap between grade 12 boys and girls in 2002 is greater than it was in 1992. \u2022 Girls outperformed boys at all three grades in 2002. As educators continue to grapple with the gender gap's implications for instruction and assessment, this special study will examine variables in NAEP's assessment design and their relationship to the gender gap in reading.
