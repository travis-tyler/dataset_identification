Walking speed has been shown to predict mortality, disability, cognitive decline, dementia and health care utilization (Artaud et al., 2015; Best et al., 2016; Dumurgier et al., 2016; Perera et al., 2016; Studenski et al., 2011; Studenski et al., 2003; White et al., 2013) . A meaningful decline in walking speed has been defined and shown to independently predict mortality (Kwon et al., 2009; Perera et al., 2005) . Walking speed has also been shown to have shared underlying neurological processes with cognitive function, especially with executive function (Tian et al., 2016) . Walking speed is thought to capture abnormalities in multiple organ systems (Ferrucci et al., 2000; Ferrucci et al., 2016) and is sensitive to changes in brain structure and function (Rosso et al., 2016; Callisaya et al., 2013; Holtzer et al., 2016) . However, the specific mechanisms underlying neural contributions to walking speed are presently unknown. Mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an extracellular signaling protein with neuroprotective and neuroregenerative functions that is well known for its prominent roles in nervous system development (Murray and Holmes, 2011) , learning and memory (Bekinschtein et al., 2008) and neuronal stress resistance (Marosi and Mattson, 2014) . Additionally, BDNF increases with aerobic exercise and its increase has been implicated in neurocognitive and physical performance improvements that involve balance, coordination, flexibility and agility (Szuhany et al., 2015; Cotman and Berchtold, 2002; Zoladz and Pilc, 2010; Vaughan et al., 2014) . Exercise interventions have also been associated with improvements in walking speed (Hortobagyi et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2017) . It is currently unknown whether changes in BDNF signaling are involved in walking speed decline.\nBDNF is produced from a precursor protein (proBDNF) by proteolytic cleavage at amino acid 128 (Koshimizu et al., 2009) . BDNF and proBDNF often have opposing actions, with BDNF promoting synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and stress resistance, and proBDNF enhancing long-term depression (LTD) and endangering neurons (Pang et al., 2004; Teng et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2005) . While BDNF and proBDNF can be distinguished by their molecular weights on immunoblots, the distinction between, and quantification of BDNF and proBDNF in higher throughput quantitative assays can be problematic because of potential cross-reactivity of BDNF antibodies with proBDNF.\nThere have been hundreds of studies in which levels of presumptive BDNF have been measured in plasma or serum samples from human subjects. Findings of these studies have often been inconsistent, in terms of differences in BDNF levels, in diseased versus control subjects, in response to environmental challenges such as exercise, or in observational studies versus clinical trials Driscoll et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2015; Leckie et al., 2014; Golden et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2014) . However, very few studies have quantified levels of both BDNF and proBDNF in the same samples. Moreover, because proBDNF and BDNF are produced not only by neurons, but also by many other cell types including lymphocytes, megakaryocytes, and skeletal and vascular smooth muscle cells (Chacon-Fernandez et al., 2016; Donovan et al., 1995; Griesbeck et al., 1995; Yoshimura et al., 2010) , the contribution of different cell types to levels of circulating BDNF and proBDNF are unknown.\nHarvesting EVs enriched for neuronal origin from peripheral blood provides a novel platform for biomarker discovery and may allow us to follow biochemical and cellular changes occurring in neurons in a dynamic way. Our methodology for isolating EVs enriched for neuronal origin involves isolating total EVs from plasma or serum samples, followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) using antibodies against the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1CAM to isolate a sub-population of L1CAM + EVs (Mustapic et al., 2017) . In a series of case-control studies, we showed that a priori selected proteins in plasma L1CAM + EVs can be used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) Goetzl et al., 2015a; Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2016a; Goetzl et al., 2016b; Goetzl et al., 2015b) . Neuronal origin EV-derived BDNF and proBDNF measures may better reflect neuronal neurotrophin production than circulating soluble levels and offer a tool for exploring neural mechanisms implicated in walking speed decline.\nIn this study we validated immunoassays that distinguish BDNF and proBDNF, and used the assays to quantify BDNF and proBDNF levels in plasma, total EVs and EVs of neuronal origin in samples from elderly subjects in the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging (BLSA) who either did or did not exhibit a decline in walking speed as they aged. We found that levels of BDNF and proBDNF are higher in EVs of neuronal origin compared to plasma and total EVs, and that proBDNF levels in EVs of neuronal origin are higher in subjects with walking speed decline compared to those without walking speed decline."}, {"section_title": "Design and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and sample collection", "text": "We identified 150 participants from the BLSA, a longitudinal study of normative aging, age 65-97 years.

Decliners were more likely to be male, with greater height, higher lean mass, lower fat mass, and faster baseline walking speed. There were no other significant differences between decliners and non-decliners.\nParticipant characteristics at time 2 are detailed in Table 2 . All of the differences observed at time 1 were present at time 2. Additionally, at time 2 decliners had fewer comorbidities. There were no other significant differences between decliners and non-decliners.\nWithin subject differences in measures between time 2 and time 1 show that non-decliners at time 2 had a decline in proBDNF from L1CAM + EVs, were older, shorter, had a higher BMI, more comorbidities, and less percent lean mass (Supplemental Table 1 ). Decliners at time 2 were also older and shorter, and additionally had a slower gait speed, less ALM, less grip strength, less knee extension strength at 180\u00b0/s, and less isometric strength at 120\u00b0. The only measure that displayed a significantly different change between decliners and non-decliners was gait speed.\nWe performed logistic regression analyses to assess the association between BDNF and proBDNF measures and walking speed decline. The significant differences in lean mass measures and height between decliners and non-decliners were fully attenuated upon sex adjustment; therefore, these covariates were not included in further regression analyses. Percent fat mass showed a greater difference between decliners and non-decliners than total fat mass, therefore it was included as a covariate in the final regression analyses. We included comorbidity index even though it did not differ significantly between decliners and nondecliners because comorbidity has a strong influence on multiple aspects of aging and health.\nTo evaluate potential correlations among key factors, we additionally examined the associations between the multiple strength measures and BDNF and proBDNF levels, adjusting for age and height. At time 1, isokinetic peak torque during knee flexion at 30\u00b0/s was significantly associated with BDNF in L1CAM + EVs and isometric peak torque at 140\u00b0was significantly associated with the ratio of BDNF/ proBDNF from total EVs (both p-values < 0.05).

All of the strength measures were significantly correlated with walking speed at times 1 and 2 (p-values < 0.01), except for isokinetic peak torque during knee flexion at 180\u00b0/s, which supports walking speed as a marker for motor function. Full regression models were adjusted for age, sex, plate number, percent fat mass, baseline walking speed, and the comorbidity index. Results with and without adjustment for covariates did not affect the magnitude of the associations between BDNF and proBDNF measures and walking speed decline.\nIn the logistical regression analyses, only proBDNF levels from the L1CAM + EVs are associated with an increased risk of being a walking speed decliner at both time points (Table 3 ).

Our team has pioneered a new approach in biomarker discovery for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases by measuring candidate biomarkers in plasma L1CAM + EVs, including pathogenic molecules (Fiandaca et al., 2015) , markers of metabolic and lysosomal dysfunction Goetzl et al., 2015a) , but also intracellular signaling molecules that promote cellular resistance to various stressors (Mustapic et al., 2017; Goetzl et al., 2015b) . The concentration of some of these molecules (e.g. tau) can be many-fold higher in L1CAM+ EVs compared to plasma (Mustapic et al., 2017) . Therefore, our findings of higher BDNF and proBDNF in L1CAM + EVs compared to plasma and total plasma EVs are not surprising. Importantly, biomarker levels in this enriched EV sub-population may more closely reflect brain changes compared to plasma, especially when the biomarker of interest is produced by the brain as well as by peripheral cells, as is the case for BDNF. The latter findings suggest that neuronal alterations contribute to walking speed decline during aging, and further suggest a potential value for analyses based on plasma EV subpopulations in elucidating underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms in their cells of origin. Our finding that proBDNF levels are elevated in plasma EVs of neuronal cell origin suggests a role for perturbed BDNF signaling in age-related decline in walking speed. More broadly, our findings suggest that molecular interrogation of L1CAM+ EVs may serve as a platform for investigating a wide range of aging related processes and diseases. Further developments in isolation of cell-origin specific EVs is warranted to increase our ability to study diseases and age related alterations in humans in a minimally invasive manner.\nBDNF plays important roles in learning and memory, and motor functions. Experiments in both rodents and humans have found that exercise increases BDNF levels, and can reverse the effects of a high-fat diet through BDNF signaling (Griffin et al., 2011; Hopkins et al., 2011 ; Lee et al., 2002; Molteni et al., 2004; Winter et al., 2007) . Associations between motor function and BDNF were reported in a previous study (Lista and Sorrentino, 2010) . In addition, serum levels of BDNF are correlated with poor motor function in Parkinson's disease patients (Scalzo et al., 2010) . Moreover, mice with BDNF haploinsufficiency exhibit a decline of motor performance and in synaptic markers in their motor cortex, but no differences in learning and memory or hippocampal synaptic markers (Carreton et al., 2012) . Clinical studies of exercise using plasma or serum BDNF measures have reported contrasting findings in that clinical trials suggest that BDNF increases with exercise while observational studies have found an inverse relationship . Our analysis of plasma and plasma-derived EVs revealed no associations of plasma BDNF or proBDNF levels on motor decline, whereas proBDNF in L1CAM+ EVs uniquely discriminated between decliners and nondecliners. Given that L1CAM + EVs more closely reflect brain processes, the association of elevated L1CAM + EV proBDNF levels with motor decline suggests that a neural contributor may be a prominent factor in walking speed decline. BDNF is cleaved from proBDNF by different proteases and in response to stimulation (Cao et al., 2014; Je et al., 2012) . Though proBDNF has been shown to have opposite effects of BDNF in learning and memory, and despite the plethora of information tying BDNF to motor function, many articles investigating motor function and BDNF ignore proBDNF. However those that include plasma measurements of proBDNF have found that the serum levels are negatively correlated with motor function (for instance, in recovery after stroke (Niimi et al., 2016) ). There has been evidence of BDNF being produced in smooth and skeletal muscle (Lommatzsch et al., 1999; Matthews et al., 2009) , but no studies have specifically examined the effects of proBDNF on muscle. However, several studies discuss the role of proBDNF in cell death and atrophy of motoneurons Taylor et al., 2012 ). Here we found that higher proBDNF only in L1CAM + EVs is associated with walking speed decline, suggesting that proBDNF plays a role in motor function and aging-associated motor decline. Decliners may either be producing an excess of proBDNF, have reduced cleavage of proBDNF, or an increase in release into the circulation (packed predominantly into L1CAM + EVs). However, the fact that we see only minimal reduction in BDNF levels between groups suggests that an alteration in cleavage is not the main culprit.\nIn this study we found a novel association between proBDNF and aging-related walking speed decline using L1CAM + EVs as a diagnostic platform. This supports the broader hypothesis that increased proBDNF levels are associated with motor impairment including with aging-related motor impairment. Though previous studies have found associations between motor function and BDNF plasma levels, we did not find any such association, raising doubts about any specific implication of plasma BDNF levels in aging-related motor impairment.\nWhile our study was designed to assess potential causality (operating within the timeframe between the two time points) by including \"before and after\" measures of gait speed and neurotrophins, we were unable to achieve this goal. While we anticipated that associations between the neurotrophins and walking speed would only develop at time 2, we observed an association between LICAM+ EVs proBDNF at both time 1 and time 2. Our walking speed decliner group had a slower baseline gait speed, and even though we accounted for this in our analyses, the associations between L1CAM+ EVs and walking speed at time 1 persisted. Therefore, the neurotrophin changes may have preceded our time 1 observations and the direction of effect cannot be determined.\nMany factors affect change in walking speed. While changes in muscle strength are a potential contributing factor, and soluble plasma levels of BDNF are known to be associated with muscle (Colombo et al., 2013; Mousavi and Jasmin, 2006) , our study found no differences in strength measures between decliners and non-decliners, and found no associations between strength and proBDNF from L1CAM + EVs. The association we found between neuronal origin EV-derived proBDNF, but not circulating soluble proBDNF, and decline in walking speed provides supporting evidence for a contribution from the nervous system to decline in walking speed.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that cognitive and motor functions are inter-related and BDNF signaling is perhaps the most prominent mechanism evoked to support this connection. Our findings highlight the complexity of measuring candidate biomarkers in biological fluids, as they may be variably present in different fractions in mature and precursor forms. Moreover, clinical studies where levels of a single molecule are used to characterize a complex and likely multifactorial phenomenon (typical for all aging-associated changes) may oversimplify this inherent complexity. More research should be done to advance EV research, and, in particular, studies of cell type-specific subsets of EVs that can further improve knowledge of complex phenomena of aging."}]
