The fertile land where alluvium and freshwater meets the sea creates a bounty that has been used by man to support important economies and major cities throughout the world. Each delta is unique, shaped by boundary conditions and forcing factors that can be classified into three general categories: river dominated, tide dominated, or wave dominated . Within these categories deltas can take on much different morphologies based on sediment load and discharge (catchment characteristics), accommodation space, coastal bathymetry, coastal energy, and density differences (Syvitski and Saito 2007). Holocene deltaic environments started developing once the global sea level stabilized during a sea level still stand period 5,000-7,000 years ago (Frazier 1967;Amorosi and Milli 2001). The natural evolution of a delta is controlled tightly by the factors listed previously, and under natural conditions undergoes a dynamic stable equilibrium punctuated by transgressive and regressive stages depending on sea level rise, local tectonics, and river power. This natural cycle has been altered greatly as human influence has increased to a scale that impacts entire catchments. With increases in farming, dams, and river training structures (levees, bank stabilization, channel straightening, check dams etc.) altering inputs and local morphology deltas have responded accordingly. The Mississippi River Deltaic Plain in coastal Louisiana, USA is one of the most highly engineered and developed deltas in the world. The Mississippi River that feeds the delta has a total length of 5,969 km with a catchment that comprises 3,224,535 km 2 of mostly farmland, and has many dams along its major tributaries. The river is continuously leveed for 2445 km, starting in south Illinois all the way to the outlet at the delta mouth in Louisiana, thus ensuring no flooding of the delta plain and no river avulsion. Because of the hydrologic alterations, the deltaic plain has seen approximately 4877 km 2 of low-lying coastal land become submerged since 1932 , with peak delta plain loss being reported on the scale of 60-75 km 2 per year from the 1960's to the 1980's Barras et al. 2003). Although, land loss has not been universal along the delta plain, with prograding delta features at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River, the largest distributary of the Mississippi River. The Atchafalaya River has been a distributary of the Mississippi River as far back as the 1500s . As a distributary, it is more than 308 km shorter than the Mississippi River (from where the rivers intersect) and because of this the Atchafalaya River has a more favorable gradient when compared to the Mississippi River . Due to the more favorable gradient in conjunction with human alterations to the Mississippi River and Atchafalaya River a better defined channel began to form in the mid-1900s, which increased the flow volume going down the Atchafalaya River . open water habitat due to lacustrine delta formation . With many of the open water areas becoming sediment filled sedimentation in the Atchafalaya Bay began to become noticeable in the 1950s with the formation of a subaqueous delta . Since 1973 there has been an increase in subaerial delta formation at Wax Lake Outlet (a man-made canal connected to the Atchafalaya River) as well as at the main channel of the Atchafalaya River (Roberts 1997). Land loss in coastal Louisiana has not been isolated to the Mississippi Deltaic Plain, but has also been occurring in the Louisiana Chenier Plain, a physiographic region west of the Mississippi Deltaic Plain. The Louisiana Chenier Plain is named after the oak trees that line the beach ridges, (Ch\u00eane-French for oak). It is located west of the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain in southwestern Louisiana, comprising an area of approximately 5,000 km 2 and a coastline of about 200 km. The Louisiana Chenier Plain was created by western movement of Mississippi River sediments along the coast . During periods when the Mississippi River discharged further west, more readily available riverine sediment allowed for progradation of the Chenier Plain coast. During periods when the Mississippi River avulsed eastward, the Chenier Plain coastline was sediment starved and reworked by wave erosion creating transgressive chenier ridges of shell and sand (Russel and Howe 1935;). These ridges are interspaced with lowland marsh plains formed during periods of high sediment input . The Louisiana Chenier Plain is bisected by four, north to south flowing rivers; Sabine River, Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and Vermilion River. All of the rivers have been highly altered with dams, locks, dredged channels, permanent openings to the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the east to west traveling Gulf intercoastal waterway that connects the once separate rivers. The modern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain and interior portions of the Louisiana Chenier Plain are undergoing land loss due to subsidence that has been accelerated by anthropogenic changes to the course and catchment characteristics of the Mississippi River as well as hydrologic alterations to the rivers that bisect the Chenier Plain. Subsidence is one of the major factors that reshape river deltas after avulsion and subsequent abandonment. Subsidence dictates accommodation space, progradation speed, or lack of progradation if sediment inflow to the delta cannot keep up with subsidence rate. Louisiana has one of the highest rates of relative sea level rise in the world with estimates between 1.09-1.19 cm yr -1 (Penland and Ramsey 1990). The relative sea level rise is greater due to high rates of subsidence. There have been many different explanations of why subsidence is high in Louisiana, with the main reasons being; (1) tectonics (fault processes and halokinesis), (2) Holocene sediment compaction, (3) sediment loading, (4) glacial isostatic adjustment, (5) fluid withdrawal, and (6) surface water drainage and management . Each explanation comes with different rates of subsidence due in part to either different measurement techniques or from multiple processes working in conjunction (Meckel 2008). Whatever the true cause, the problem still exists of land loss and inundation of land due to sea level rise and storm events, endangering many coastal communities and industries (Blum and Roberts 2009). The Mississippi River Delta development and maintenance depends on sediment supply from the Mississippi River. After the great flood of 1927 flood control measures were implemented in order to ensure that the Mississippi River stayed within its banks and did not flood farmland and communities close to the river (MRC 2007). In addition to flood controls there have been many dams completed along the Missouri River, a major tributary of the Mississippi River. Other engineering structures that have altered the natural state of the river have been meander cutoffs, river-training structures, bank revetments, and dikes . Due to the many alterations to the river and catchment (soil conservation) it has been estimated that sediment load reaching the delta has been reduced by 50% to 70% . Sediment loads prior to the 1960s reached upwards of 400 x10 6 tonnes yr -1 , while current estimates are only to 115 to 130x10 6 tonnes yr -1 (Horowitz 2010) for the Mississippi and 172x10 6 tonnes yr -1 for the Mississippi and Atchafalaya combined . This reduced sediment supply limits opportunities for the river to create new wetlands and it has been postulated by Blum and Roberts (2009) that current sediment levels would not be able to counterbalance future sea level rise. With land loss endangering coastal communities, state and federal agencies have been working together to implement various restoration projects ranging from rebuilding barrier islands to marsh restoration (CPRA 2012). To achieve restoration goals, a comprehensive understanding of sediment availability is needed. Sediment resources have been identified as offshore shoals from previous delta complexes as well as fluvial sediments derived from the Mississippi River (Khalil et al. 2010). Most calculations of riverine suspended sediment supply have only been long-term studies on trends (as introduced above), and have neglected other coastal riverine resources. What still has not been identified is the actual amount of available sediment for restoration, and how changes in sediment dynamics may affect coastal evolution. The objective of this thesis research was to answer the principal question of what is the actual amount of riverine suspended sediment that is discharged to coastal Louisiana. This question is broken down into four separate chapters that detail sediment dynamics of three distinct areas along coastal Louisiana. The second chapter presents a study completed on the rivers that bisect the Louisiana Chenier Plain. The study quantifies suspended sediment yield of the Sabine River, Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and Vermilion River, investigates seasonal and interannual variations of suspended sediment transport, and discusses potential impacts on Chenier Plain management. The third chapter focuses on the amount of suspended sediment available from the Mississippi River. Calculations are completed using different river stages at Red River Landing, LA to understand changes in suspended sediment dynamics during flood pulses, between different flood magnitudes, as well as during the rising and receding limb. Chapter three is discussed with current and future diversion management considerations. Chapters four and five focus on suspended sediment dynamics of the Atchafalaya River. These studies examine longterm suspended sediment dynamics of the Atchafalaya River, explore a spatial based sedimentation estimate technique for the Atchafalaya River Basin, and quantify Atchafalaya River Delta Complex growth and discuss it in light of suspended sediment discharge from the Atchafalaya River. Chapters two, three, four, and five are written as stand-alone manuscripts that have been accepted, reviewed, or submitted to peer-reviewed journals."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE CITED", "text": "Amorosi, A., Milli, S., 2001.

Preliminary classifcation of water aresa within the Atchafalaya River Basin Floodway system by using Landsat Imagery. U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2008-1320: 14p. The second largest riverine sediment resource to coastal Louisiana is the Atchafalaya River, providing 49 MT of total suspended sediment at the outlets to Atchafalaya Bay annually. The Atchafalaya River Basin traps 5.3 MT annually, although it would seem that the Atchafalaya River has reached equilibrium, as there are years that have net export. The use of Landsat imagery to predict sedimentation rate basin-wide provides estimates between 30.4 mm yr -1 to 79.1 mm yr -1 . Refinement of this method using LIDAR to predict land cover and subsequently bulk density reduces estimated sedimentation rates to 23.2 mm yr -1 to 56.0 mm yr -1 . Although this modeling is very coarse, the method does provide promising results that with better bulk density estimates, hydroperiod data, and better sediment load estimates could be refined to a point where land managers could use this as a tool to better manage sediment in the Atchafalaya River Basin. The Atchafalaya River Delta Complex (ARDC) is one of the few areas where there has been prograding land along Louisiana's coastline. Since 1989 the land change rate was 2.8 km 2 yr -1 , although rates have been slowly decreasing from a high of 5.6 km 2 yr -1 (1989 to 1995) to a low of -0.4 km 2 yr -1 (1999 to 2004). Atchafalaya River Morgan City subdelta (ARSD) had much more stable growth over the period with all the periods having net gain. The Wax Lake Outlet Subdelta (WLSD) was much more variable with the 1999 to 2004 period seeing a net loss -4.6 km 2 . Both of the subdeltas saw decrease in land change rate, which was associated with an increase in tropical storm frequency, as well as variability of the flood magnitude of the Atchafalaya River. The largest factor affecting growth were major flood events (>13,800 m 3 s -1 at ) and tropical systems. There was a net land loss during the period 1999 to 2004 due to the absence of large flood events. Vegetation did have some stabilizing affecting on the ARDC when compared to barren areas, with vegetated land loss of 7.3% whereas barren land was lost 32.0% between years. Newly vegetated land remained land >60% between subsequent years, except for the period 1999 to 2004. This demonstrates that vegetation may not be able to maintain land by itself and reinforces the importance of large flood pulses for maintaining land and growth. If stable growth is to be continued at the ARDC suspended sediment load reaching the deltas needs to be stabilized or engineering efforts need to be taken to reduce the impacts of large storm events, especially during periods when there is a lack of large floods to offset losses. With many future projects relying on fluvial sediment for restoration in coastal Louisiana, the calculations completed in this thesis research provide an important insight into actual available total suspended sediment. The future of coastal Louisiana rests upon taking advantage of the natural processes that shaped the coastline, instead of trying to maintain a static environment. Emphasis needs to be taken away from products (e.g. building barrier islands or Figure A2. Linear regression of annual rainfall and discharge for the Chenier Plain rivers.

Much of southern Louisiana has been formed by Mississippi River sediments through the natural process of river avulsion and subsequent delta switching. The Chenier Plain, a physiographic province in southwestern Louisiana, has similarly been influenced by the movement of the Mississippi River sediment plume . In general, when compared with the barrier islands along Louisiana's coast or the Mississippi Deltaic Plain, the Chenier Plain is less well known. Nonetheless the area has gone through many anthropogenic alterations that have exacerbated natural land loss. The Chenier Plain comprises an area of approximately 5,000 km 2 and a coastline of about 200 km. The land cover is dominated by location sensitive salt, brackish, intermediate, and fresh marshlands (Gammill 2002). The lowland marsh is interspaced by chenier ridges formed during transgressive phases when the Mississippi River sediment plume is unable to reach the plain (for details regarding Chenier Plain formation see . Bisecting the plain are four north to south flowing rivers, Sabine River, Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and Vermilion River. The Sabine River has a drainage area of 25,267 km 2 with a total length of 893 km bordering Texas and Louisiana draining into Sabine Lake before the Gulf of Mexico (Phillips 2003). The Calcasieu River drainage basin is 9,780 km 2 and the river is 322 km long and discharges into Calcasieu Lake before the Gulf of Mexico (Nichol et al. 1992 (Gammill 2002). The locks added to exclude salt water have potentially raised inner plain water levels. Much discussion has centered on whether salinization or higher water levels has led to more marsh loss, but regardless proper management is needed to maintain healthy marsh. This is especially true as the main discharge of the Mississippi River through the Plaquemines/Balize (birdfoot) delta has left much of the Chenier Plain sediment starved except for portions that are closest to Atchafalaya Bay (Draut et. al 2005). Land loss (taking in account for land gains) has been approximately 146 km 2 between the years from 1988 to 2010  and, for the 2005 hurricane season alone, an area of about 218 km 2 was estimated to be lost ). With the Chenier Plain being highly modified and cut off from the main Mississippi River sediment plume, other sediment resources within the plain have become increasingly important in order to counteract natural land loss from coastal erosion and marsh subsidence (CPRA 2010). One possible sediment resource located in the Chenier Plain is sediment from the four rivers that drain through the plain. Until now, however, no report has been published on sediment loads from these rivers and little is known about their impact on sediment accumulation within the Chenier Plain. As Campbell and others (2005) postulated, future restoration projects in this coastal region must direct attention toward obtaining essential data along the Chenier Plain. This study aimed to fill the knowledge gap and provide useful information to coastal resource policy makers in developing plans and strategies for regional sediment management. The primary purpose of the study was two-fold: (1) to quantify long-term suspended sediment delivery from Sabine River, Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and Vermilion River, and (2) to investigate the effect of hydrometeorological conditions on seasonal and inter-annual trends of suspended sediment transport.\nThe Mississippi River Delta Plain in Louisiana, USA has undergone extensive land loss during the past century . Peak delta plain loss occurred from the mid-1950s until the 1970s at rates between 60-75 km 2 yr -1 Barras et al. 2003), but possibly exceeded 100 km 2 yr -1 (Gagliano et al. 1981).  have estimated that a total of 4877 km 2 of land has been submerged since 1932. Land loss has been attributed to both natural and anthropogenically exacerbated reasons (Walker et al. 1987;Kesel 1989; Current discharge management at both of these locations is based on salinity, with lower salinity during the spring (higher discharge) and higher salinity during the summer and fall (lower discharge) (OCPR 2011). To maintain the salinity gradient, the diversions are nearly continuous (OCPR 2011;Moore et al. 2011). Despite careful planning and many years of operation, a recent study (Kearney et al. 2011) found no significant changes in either relative vegetation or overall marsh area from 1984 to 2005 in zones closest to the diversion inlets. The lack of positive response to the freshwater diversions has been attributed to inappropriate timing of discharge, insufficient discharge magnitude (need >100 m 3 s -1 to induce sheet flow needed to carry sediment across the marsh at Caernarvon Diversion, while DPFD is too small and channelized to induce sheet flow (OCPR 2010), and/or overloading of nutrients affecting sediment stability (Snedden et al. 2007;Kearney et al. 2011). The West Bay Sediment Diversion was designed for sediment capture. Completed in November 2003 on the west bank of the Mississippi at river mile 2.9 (7.6 km from the Head of Passes), the planned discharge was 396 m 3 s -1 when the Mississippi River was at 50 % discharge, but since construction the diversion has increased to 765 m 3 s -1 (Carter 2003;USACE 2009). It has been reported that the diversion could be impacting navigational interests in the area while not producing land growth within 5 years (Brown et al. 2009;Barras et al, 2009;Heath et al. 2010). This has prompted USACE to draft plans to close the diversion. New sediment diversions further up river are under study (Myrtle Grove) or proposed for future investigation (Moffatt and Nichol 2008;CPRA 2012). However, there lacks a guideline that effectively addresses various interests, such as maintaining navigation, managing fisheries and wetlands, while still efficiently using diversions to capture sediment. A number of studies have examined long-term annual sediment loads of the Mississippi River. These studies have documented a decreasing trend of riverine sediment attributed to dams, land management, and other river engineering structures  The significance of the flood pulse with regards to sediment transport and healthy maintenance of river floodplains and deltas has long been recognized (Junk et al. 1989;Sparks 1995;Bayley 1995;Allison and Meselhe 2010). In Louisiana, it has been observed that stable marshes in the Mississippi River Delta Plain receive input of sediments and freshwater during the spring flood (Baumann et al. 1984). Mossa (1996) indicated that the highest sediment concentrations occurred during the rising limb, while recent work by Allison et al. (2012) reinforced these findings. From these papers there is a general understanding that the rising limb provides more sediment, and that high discharge has a greater total suspended sediment load than low discharge. With this said, there is a knowledge gap concerning the quantity and variability of total suspended sediment (coarse and fine suspended material) from the Mississippi River during its flood pulse (discharge >18,000 m 3 s -1 ) and between different flood peaks. This was highlighted by Allison and Meselhe (2010) \nAmongst coastal margins, deltas may be the most economically important regions, serving as transportation hubs and commercial centers while providing abundant natural resources that support large populations of people and wildlife. However, many of the world's deltas today are under unprecedented pressure from land loss due to reduced riverine sediment supply (e.g., Walling and Fang, 2003), coastal land erosion (e.g., Smith and Abdel-Kader 1988; Chen and Zong 1998), subsidence (e.g., Syvitski et al. 2009), and sea level rise (e.g., Gornitz, 1995). As with other delta regions, the Mississippi River Delta Plain has not been immune from land loss and has had one of the most significant conversions of land to open water, with over 4877 km 2 submerged since 1932, endangering large coastal communities . This loss has been attributed to rapid subsidence of Holocene strata (T\u04e7rnqvist et al. 2008), exacerbated by the reduction in riverine sediment supply , hydrocarbon extraction (Morton and Bernier 2010), local faults, and glacial isostatic adjustment . With much of the delta plain under stress, research and management interests have been building in the Atchafalaya River Delta Complex (ARDC), the only noticeable prograding delta feature along the Mississippi River Delta coastline. The Mississippi River enters the Gulf of Mexico through two distributaries: the Mississippi River main channel southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana and the Atchafalaya River located to the west on the Louisiana central coast. The Atchafalaya River is approximately 190 km long, flowing southwards through a levee-confined floodplain area of 4921 km 2 , much of which is riparian forested swamps (Ford and Nyman 2011). Since the early 20 th century, due to human alterations to the Atchafalaya River and a more favorable gradient than the Mississippi River, a well-defined channel began to form, which increased the flow volume going down the Atchafalaya River . The increased discharge caused many of the open water areas in the Atchafalaya River Basin to accumulate sediments, losing much of the open water and swamp habitat to lacustrine delta formations . With the open water areas sediment filled, formation of subaqueous deltas at the two outlets of the Atchafalaya River, Morgan City main channel (ARMC) and Wax Lake outlet (WLO), became noticeable in the 1950s . Subaerial land started forming in 1972 and was accelerated by large floods that occurred from 1973 to 1975, forming the Atchafalaya River subdelta (ARSD) and Wax Lake Outlet subdelta (WLSD) . With subaerial delta formation primary vegetation succession was able to begin with emergent plants colonizing once the delta islands reached intertidal elevations. By 1979 the Atchafalaya River delta had over 16 km 2 vegetated (Johnson et al. 1985). Several factors may have affected deltaic growth of the ARDC: sediment load, tropical systems, cold fronts, and vegetation colonization. Rouse et al. (1978) observed high growth rate of the ARSD following the 1973, 1974, and 1975 river floods.  found that hurricane Rita in 2005 removed much of the submerged aquatic vegetation and floating vegetation in the ARDC, while also enlarging existing ponds. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 was documented adding, on average, 16 cm of accumulated sediment to marshes surrounding the Atchafalaya Bay (Guntenspergen et al. 1995), while Walker (2001) found that hurricanes can also cause sediment-laden water to be transported off the coast, away from the ARDC. Cold frontal passage has also been documented transporting sediment out of Atchafalaya Bay, with an estimate of 400,000 tonnes per front, which equates to approximately 10.6 megatonnes (MT) during a year (Walker and Hammack 2000;Roberts et al. 2005). This erosion reduces the rate of subaerial delta development and leaves the delta features sandy (van Heerden and Roberts 1980). Johnson et al. (1985) noted that with the colonization of plant species (most notably S. nigra) physical processes were aided by biotic controls to enhance sedimentation and stabilization of the ARDC (Johnson 1985), although the long-term effect of vegetation on delta land growth in the ARDC is unclear. The above studies identify separate factors that have affected delta growth, but there has not been a systematic longer-term look into how the ARDC subdeltas have responded to varying sediment input and stressors. With the decline of total suspended sediment throughout the Mississippi River Heimann et al. 2011) it has become imperative to track changes in total suspended sediment discharge to coastal Louisiana and the impacts on coastal processes. Sediment supply is one the most important components that shape delta growth (Orton and Reading 1993). However, it is unclear how much sediment is discharged from ARMC and WLO to the subdeltas. Previous studies have documented sediment discharge to the ARDC from sediment data collected from the upper Atchafalaya River (Rouse et al. 1978), but it was reported by  that there is a 9% sediment load reduction in the Atchafalaya River Basin before reaching the outlets, fluctuating with the river hydrological conditions. With new management plans that have suggested diversions from the Atchafalaya River to other coastal areas in Louisiana (CPRA 2012), there is an urgent need to have a comprehensive assessment on riverine sediment discharge, and how the quantity and fluctuation of the sediment discharge and vegetation succession may have influenced land growth in the ARDC. This assessment is critical since different delta progradation at the two river outlets have been reported (e.g., ). Using this background information, we conducted this study to take a longer-term (1989-2010) look at total suspended sediment discharge to the Atchafalaya River subdeltas below Morgan City and Wax Lake Outlet to assess how this may have affected delta land change over four approximately 5-year periods (i.e. 1989 to 1995, 1995 to 1999, 1999 to 2004, and 2004 to 2010).

The Vermilion River showed the lowest average daily discharge of 33 m 3 s -1 (\u00b133), varying from zero flow to 396 m 3 s -1 . Daily discharge of the Mermentau River and Calcasieu River averaged 82 m 3 s -1 (\u00b1104) and 72 m 3 s -1 (\u00b1126), respectively (Table 2.2). All these rivers, except the Vermilion River that received water from the Atchafalaya River, showed a decreasing trend in discharge in the past 20 years. The trend was, however, only statistically significant with the Sabine River (seasonal Mann-Kendall, p=0.05) (Figure 2.3). All these rivers, except for the Sabine River that is dammed for the Toledo Bend Reservoir, showed a close, positive precipitation-discharge relationship (r 2 =0.68, 0.82, and 0.75 for the Calcasieu River, Mermentau River, and Vermilion River, respectively) (see Appendix Figure A2).

The Mermentau River TSS during the study period averaged 26 mg l -1 (\u00b134), with a minimum of 4 mg l -1 and a maximum of 280 mg l -1 .

In general, as with the river discharge, TSS concentration of the four rivers showed a seasonal trend with higher values during the winter and spring and lower values during the late summer and fall ( Figure 2.5). The trend was especially prevalent in the Mermentau River and Vermilion River, whose drainage basins were predominantly agriculture in land use.

The interannual variation of TSS yields for each river can be explained by tonnes in 1996 and 2000, two drier years during the study period, to 629,000 and 611,000 tonnes in 1991 and 2001, two wetter years (Table 2.3). Annual total TSS yields from the four rivers were highly dependent on the Sabine River, the largest river in the study. Higher or lower total annual yields were reflected mainly by the variation in Sabine River's discharge as affected by the upper basin precipitation and Toledo Bend reservoir management (see section 2.4.1). There was a decreasing trend in annual sediment yields from 1990 to 2009 for the Sabine River, Calcasieu River, and Mermentau River, but the trend was only statistically significant for the Sabine River (seasonal Mann-Kendall, p=0.03) ( Figure 2.7).   "}, {"section_title": "Hydrometeorological and Land Use Effects on Sediment Loads", "text": "Seasonal trends in discharge were controlled by the hydrometeorological conditions of the region. Higher flow in the winter and spring months and lower flow during the summer and fall occurred in all the rivers. During the summer months high evapotranspiration in conjunction with sporadic rainfall caused discharge to decrease. The winter months with low evapotranspiration and greater rainfall amounts allowed for greater runoff and discharge. This affected sediment loads during the time periods with higher sediment loads occurring during the months that had higher discharges. However, the Vermilion River did not show large discharge variation between seasons, primarily a result of the regulated inflow from the Atchafalaya River by the Teche-Vermilion pumping station (USACE 2000) adding both freshwater and sediment into the system. All the rivers except the Vermilion River experienced decreasing TSS load over the entire study period. This was a direct response to declining discharge corresponding to decreasing trend in precipitation. The Vermilion River is unique with discharge remaining nearly steady and high TSS elevating sediment load. The elevated TSS cannot be fully explained by land use because it would be expected that the Mermentau River (67% agriculture) to have comparable or higher TSS than the Vermilion River (40% agriculture). A direct relationship between higher TSS and agriculture has been found in many studies (e.g., Lenat and Crawford 1994;Ahearn et al. 2005). The elevated TSS for the Vermilion River can be explained by additions from Bayou Teche, subsequently from the Teche-Vermilion pumping station. As discussed earlier, the diversions from Bayou Teche can account for up to 52% of the discharge of the Vermilion River. This can contribute 60 (median) to 100 (mean) tonnes of sediment daily, equating to 44%-72% of the total daily sediment load of the Vermilion River. Although the diversions from Teche-Vermilion pumping station added to the sediment load, in a historical context this may not be unusual because before the Atchafalaya River was confided by levees the Vermilion River was naturally connected (USACE 2000). The other rivers better reflect land use within their basins with the Sabine River and Calcasieu River that are heavily forested having comparably lower TSS than the Mermentau River. During the study period measured TSS concentrations did not show a long-term change in any of the rivers except the Vermilion River, suggesting that the hydrologic modifications during this study period did not have a significant effect on suspended sediment in the lower reach of the rivers. It could be argued that even though the Sabine River, Calcasieu River, and Mermentau River have been heavily hydrologically modified, the main factor that controls the rivers sediment load is changes in discharge. Phillips (2003) made a similar observation concerning the lower Sabine River, reporting that although the lower Sabine River has been dammed at Toledo Bend reservoir the expected change in sediment transport, sand supply, or channel morphology had not occurred. This finding implies that the sediment regime of the river has not changed from the previous pre-dam state (less hydrologically modified) and, thus, sediment from the lower Sabine River must be coming from sources in the lower part of the river. The other rivers do not have the same dam modification as the Sabine River, but nonetheless have had many modifications and yet TSS has not changed with the largest factor affecting sediment load being discharge changes. The Vermilion River is the exception as it is heavily influenced in its flow and sediment concentration by water introduced from the Atchafalaya River via the Teche-Vermilion pumping station."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Source and Potential for Future Chenier Plain Development", "text": "From all four rivers, we estimated an average annual delivery of 342,950 tonnes of sediment. This amount is likely an underestimation as it has been documented that sediment rating often results in underestimation of sediment loads (Walling 1977;Ferguson 1986 and. In our study loads may possibly have been underestimated between 8.5%-37.6% (eq. 7). The Calcasieu River sediment loads could be underestimated by This can be seen graphically in Figure 2.8 with observed and estimated loads plotted against flow exceedance interval. Underestimation occurred except for the highest flows (0-10% exceedance) for the Sabine River, underestimation for high to low flows (10-90% exceedance) for the Calcasieu River, the Mermentau River had all flow ranges underestimated, and the Vermilion Figure 2.9. Observed sediment loads calculated from LDEQ TSS samples and estimated sediment loads plotted using flow exceedance. The smooth line is estimated loads and the individual markers are observed loads. River had higher flows (0-40%) and the lowest flow periods underestimated (90-100%). The larger percent underestimation for the Vermilion River and Mermentau River could also be due to the fact that the discharge gauging stations used for this study experienced reversals of flow during certain time periods, reducing the amount of data used for developing sediment rating curves. For all the rivers a more comprehensive sediment sampling regiment would produce more accurate estimations, especially for different flow regimes (e.g., high vs. low flow, rising vs. receding limb of a hydrograph), which cannot be covered by a monthly sampling regiment that only takes a snapshot of sediment in the river at that time period. uncommon for coastal plain rivers to be unable to overcome the tidal/wave force due to low power from low slope, river meanders, and estuaries. This can cause much of the sediment to be deposited in the upper portions of the estuary or within the alluvial plain (Barret 1971;Phillips and Slattery 2006). Calcasieu Lake, the estuary that the Calcasieu River flows into before the Gulf of Mexico, demonstrates this being classified as wave dominated with fluvio-deltaic deposits terminating 31 km from the coast (Dalrymple et al. 1992;Nichol et al. 1992;. The low river power compounded by the decreasing discharge and sediment load lessens the likelihood that these rivers will be significant sources of sediment to coastal portions Louisiana Chenier Plain. The greatest asset to the coastal Chenier Plain is from the Atchafalaya River sediment that has been documented by Huh et al. (1991) and Draut et al. (2005) as accreting on the eastern coastline of the Chenier Plain. In a recent study, Xu 2010reported an annual average sediment yield of 53 x 10 6 tonnes for the Atchafalaya River. Certainly, when compared with the large quantity of sediment from the Atchafalaya, sediment delivery from the four rivers in this study (0.34 x 10 6 tonnes yr -1 ) appears to be insignificant. However, this sediment source can be crucial for the inner portions of the Chenier Plain that are undergoing wetland loss and salt intrusion due to alterations to the natural hydrologic state of the rivers. Under a best case scenario there exists the potential that the average annual sediment yield from the four rivers could provide a thin cover of 2.3 x 10 7 m 2 of sediment to the depth of 1 cm (assuming sediment bulk density of 1.5 tonnes m -3 and average annual load of 0.34 x 10 6 tonnes). This would not be enough to cover the entire 5,000 km 2 plain, but could counter localized subsidence that varies between 0.5-2.5 cm yr 1 . Current annual dredging from the Sabine-Neches and Calcasieu River ship channels ranges from 2,000,000 to 6,000,000 tonnes, with possible increases due to channel expansion (USACE 2010). All of the dredge cannot be attributed to riverine sediments, but regardless these channels represent a large sink for sediment. It is known that the channels create greater tidal prism as well as permanent outlets for the rivers to flow down during ebb tides or high flows, losing sediment and freshwater that would be trapped in the basins. Recent work completed by Mesehle and Miller (2009) to model Chenier Plain hydrodynamics indicate that all the freshwater reaches the Gulf, except in areas where locks prevent freshwater loss. This model is still in preliminary stages and thus greater commentary on how freshwater moves throughout the plain cannot be made (see Meselhe and Miller 2009 for more information of the regional model). Using hydrologic models in conjunction with these estimated sediment loads could help better understand where riverine sediments move within the Chenier Plain, but current knowledge is limited. A possible solution to better track sediment movements would be using satellite imagery to classify clear water and turbid water (riverine influenced) areas in conjunction with gauge data as has been done by Allen et al. (2008) for the Atchafalaya basin. Also, there needs to be consideration that the Sabine River accounts for 62% of the sediment load to the Chenier Plain. Currently, this river only has influence on its own basin and part of the Calcasieu River basin. If restoration efforts were to be seriously taken there would need to be a concerted effort to either use the Sabine River as a sediment and freshwater source or to find another source, such as the Atchafalaya River. Even with limited understanding of sediment movements the sediment yield estimates are suitable for ongoing projects that are targeted at restoring freshwater marshland, especially for areas that are using dredged materials or rock dikes in order to trap sediments for rebuilding lost land (CPRA 2010)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study is the first comprehensive assessment on river flow conditions and sediment inflow to the Louisiana Chenier Plain in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Although the quantity of sediment delivered by these rivers is relatively low, the resource is important for creating new wetlands in the interior portions of the plain that have been affected by saltwater intrusion and land loss. If a serious effort to restore the Chenier Plain to pre-development conditions is to be undertaken, all of the hydrological modifications would have to be reversed, channels allowed to be silted in and the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway closed. This is unrealistic, given the complexity of political, economic, social, and cultural factors, and thus it is up to land managers to make decisions about what current characteristics of the Chenier Plain are worthy of saving or trying to restore. With economic interests influencing many decisions, especially for the Sabine River Basin and its deep water port, it becomes imperative to have a dialogue and coordination between land managers, conservation agencies, and local, state, and federal agencies about the future of the Chenier Plain. A long term perspective needs to be taken instead of short-term risk management economic gain outlook. The riverine sediment yields calculated in this study provide a long-term look into other sediment sources that could be utilized in current or future\nThis study shows that land growth of the Atchafalaya River Delta Complex in the past two decades was dictated by large flood events, while severe tropical systems temporarily impacted delta size to a large degree. Large floods were able to transport substantial quantities of sediment needed to create rapid subaerial land formation, which was followed by vegetation colonization. When compared to barren land vegetation succession provided stabilization. However, during the period with no large flood events the buffering effect of vegetation appeared to be limited against higher energy storm surges. The result implies that future growth and stabilization of the ARDC will mostly depend on sediment supply from the Atchafalaya River and storm weather conditions in the northern Gulf of Mexico. If sediment supply does decline in the future, delta growth will slow further and may also cause large flood events to be less effective at building land. Losses will likely be most apparent at WLSD that unlike ARSD surrounding the river . The loss of mineral inputs and high subsidence rates has caused approximately 4900 km 2 of land loss in the delta plain (Yuill et al. 2008;). Management of the Mississippi River is complicated with the need to control flooding and land loss. One area that is heavily regulated by federal and state agencies is the largest distributary of the Mississippi, the Atchafalaya River. The Atchafalaya River is confined by levees creating the 35 km wide Atchafalaya River Basin (ARB), which is managed as a floodway for the Mississippi River. The ARB comprises an area of 4921 km 2 , making it the largest river swamp in the United States. The Atchafalaya River is about 307 km shorter than the Mississippi River to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Due to the more favorable gradient  in conjunction with human alterations to the Mississippi River and Atchafalaya River, a better defined channel began to form in the mid-1900s, which increased the flow volume going down the Atchafalaya River and into the ARB . Another problem related to rapid sedimentation in the ARB is that many backwater areas have become cut off and subsequently hypoxic (Sabo et al. 1999). This has negatively affected biological communities within the ARB (Fontenot et al. 2001;Rutherford et al. 2001). Also, there is the hope that the ARB has the potential to reduce nitrogen before nutrient-rich Mississippi River waters enter the Gulf of Mexico (Xu 2006). The first basin-wide maps of inundation and turbid water areas were completed by Allen et al. (2008), helping land managers better understand water distribution and flow patterns. Xu 2010provided the first comprehensive long-term estimates of sediment inflow and outflow, providing insight on sediment dynamics during different hydrological conditions. Although this information is crucial for future management, the images do not provide information on sedimentation rate, while the sediment calculations do not provide separate estimates for the two outlets at Morgan City and Wax Lake Outlet. The goal of this study was to add to previous work to help generate a better understanding of spatial sedimentation in the ARB as well as regional sediment resources in Louisiana by calculating total suspended sediment yield entering and exiting the ARB, and expanding the use of Allen et al. (2008) spatial datasets. The specific objectives of this study were: (1) to derive the best estimates of total suspended sediment inflow, total suspended sediment outflow, and retained sediment in the ARB by calculating total suspended sediment yields separately for Simmesport, Morgan City, and Wax Lake Outlet, and (2) to use remotely sensed images to estimate sedimentation rates based on sediment retention over time.\nThe results from this study indicate that the Atchafalaya River Basin has reached equilibrium where there is no longer a large amount of net sediment retention. The system is apparently under fluvial rather than palustrine or lacustrine controls, with the Atchafalaya River meandering through an alluvial plain, depositing sediments along in-channel bars or during overbank floods, but counterbalancing this through lateral migration and bank erosion as well as channel scouring, while sediment retention in the basin occurs mainly in back water areas. Furthermore, this study demonstrates an approach of combining riverine sediment loads and spatial information on turbid water surface to derive sedimentation estimates. Greater refinement of the method needs to incorporate hydroperiod, and differing suspended sediment concentration which could help generate more specific sedimentation estimates for different areas. Future management of the Atchafalaya River Basin will rely on spatial tracking of sedimentation to effectively monitor and predict where resources will be necessary to effectively maintain the river basin as a floodway and wildlife habitat."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: A HYDROGRAPH BASED SEDIMENT AVAILABILITY ASSESSMENT WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR MISSISSIPPI RIVER DIVERSION MANAGEMENT", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "River Stage Classification for Sediment Availability Assessment", "text": "Daily stage data for the period 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2010 were collected from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for the Red River Landing (RRL) station in Louisiana (30\u00b057'39\"N, 91\u00b039'52\"W; river mile 302.4).

Previous studies have shown a declining trend in Mississippi River sediment discharge following the 1950s to 1960s construction of dams, cutoffs, training structures, and bank stabilization structures .  reported an overall decline in the long-term trend (1950s to 2000s) of total suspended sediment loads at TBL. Our analysis shows that there was actually an upward shift of SSL since the early 1990s (Figure 3.2). Horowitz 2010 (Table 3.5). Mossa (1996) identifies that differences in SSC between annual floods can be attributed to the peak of SSC occurring earlier during large floods and nearly coincident with the peak during minor floods. Successive flood events produced a decrease in magnitude of the SSC peak (Mossa 1996). If there was a winter flood before the spring flood there was lower SSC during the spring flood. This is demonstrated in the results for the seasonal analysis where higher SSC was observed during the winter flood (Figure 3.4). On the flood pulse portion of the hydrograph, our study showed that SSC is maximized on the rising limb during Action Stage and Flood Stage. Other studies on the lower Mississippi River corroborate this finding (Mossa 1996;Allison et al. 2012) with Mossa (1996) describing the sediment peak occurring more than 40 days before the discharge peak, and Allison et al.  . Observational data from Snedden et al. (2007) and Day et al. (2009) documented higher sediment concentration and therefore greater sedimentation behind the Caernarvon Diversion during the rising limb of winter or spring flood pulses. To implement COS at DPFD, an Action Stage can be determined based on the data from RRL using a two day lag (Figure 3.6 Using this method would take full advantage of the flood pulse elevated total suspended sediment, and restore a more natural hydrological regime to the area. Utilization of this hydrograph based approach could also be beneficial to diversion regulation of the Mississippi River's water into the Atchafalaya River at the Old River Control Structure (ORCS). Currently the structure controls an average diversion rate of approximately 25% . With the ability to estimate when the most sediment is arriving to the lower river via TBL (just south of the structure) the ratio being diverted can be adjusted between the Atchafalaya River and the Mississippi River. Based on this study's findings we suggest that \nThe Atchafalaya River Delta Complex is the only notable prograding delta feature along the Mississippi River Delta coastline in recent decades. For the past 21 years our study found an average growth rate of the entire delta complex of 2.8 km 2 yr -1 , which was slightly lower than two other recent estimates: 3.1 km 2 yr -1  by     by . The two subdeltas of the ARDC exhibited slightly different growth rates: 1.6 km 2 yr -1 for ARSD and 1.2 km 2 yr -1 for WLSD. Allen et al. (2012) had a similar estimated growth rate of 1.0 km 2 yr -1 for WLSD (1983 to 2010), and Xu (2010) estimated growth rates for the period 1984 to 2004 of 1.1 km 2 yr -1 (ARSD) and 2.0 km 2 yr -1 (WLSD). Overall, differences in these growth rate estimates are small and can be attributed to different time frames and aerial coverage. Delta growth fluctuation among the periods is of great interest. There was a clear decreasing trend in delta growth from a high of 3.2 km 2 yr -1 (WLSD) and 2.4 km 2 yr -1 (ARSD) over the period 1989 to 1995 to a low of 0.6 km 2 yr -1 (WLSD) and 1.6 km 2 yr -1 (ARSD) over the period 2004 to 2010. Majersky et al. (1997) estimated similar rates for the earlier periods, 3.2 km 2 yr -1 (ARSD) and 3.0 km 2 yr -1 (WLSD), while Allen et al. (2012), looking at a later period (2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010), found that WLSD had no net gain. From 1999 to 2004 there was a net loss of land from the ARDC, which was driven by large losses of land from the WLSD. During this period the growth rates dropped to -0.9 km 2 yr -1 for WLSD and 0.5 km 2 yr -1 for ARSD. The declined growth rate at ARSD depicts a part of a longer trend, where high early rates, estimated at 6.5 km 2 yr -1 (1972 to 1976) (Rouse et al. 1978) and 5.8 km 2 yr -1 (1976-1981)  ) fell sharply following 1981 and has continued a slight decline to the latest period (Figure 4.6). WLSD had much slower development, but eventually eclipsed ARSD growth rate during the 1980's, but since the mid 1990's growth rate at WLSD has declined below ARSD growth rate, despite the increased portion of flow and sediment through WLO. The more stable growth rates at ARSD could be attributed to the many dredge spoil islands created from deposits of the Atchafalaya River Bar Channel. Further studies are needed to determine the management effect on land growth in the ARDC. Among the four study periods, the 1999 to 2004 period was the only period without a large flood event (discharge >13,800 m 3 s -1 ) (Figure 4.6). This period also had the highest recorded storm surge (3.75 m) caused by hurricane Lili in 2002 (SURGEDAT 2012). During this period we found a net land loss at the ARDC (Table 4.4) due solely to the 4.6 km 2 loss at WLSD (Figure 4.3B). In other periods the transport capability of large floods was still able to maintain positive growth (Figure 4.6). Rouse et al. (1978) indicated that the high growth rates observed during the initial stages of subaerial delta development (1972 to 1976) were fueled by two large floods over a three year period. The 1975 flood was much larger than normal producing 11.4 km 2 of new land, whereas the smaller 1974 flood created only 2.6 km 2 (Rouse et al. 1978). It is well known that large flood events often provide the greatest sediment delivery, and periods with low flow can result in decreased delta growth, even in rivers with high SSC such as the Yellow River in China (Chu et al. 2005;Wang et al. 2007). Nittrour et al. (2008 identified that bedform transport rate of the lower Mississippi River had a positive exponential correlation with discharge, indicating the importance of large discharge events for delivering coarse load. This is evidenced in our study by the increase in suspended sand load with increasing discharge at both ARMC and WLO outlets (Figure 4.7). The large quantity of coarse sediments provided by floods can be important for fueling delta growth by capping fine sediment deposits with a layer of course sediments that creates a substrate elevated enough for colonization of marsh species (van Heerden and Roberts 1988). Our study suggests that river floods are a major contributing factor to the variation in deltaic growth rate of ARDC, and that future growth of the ARDC will rely on a consistent frequency of large floods to counteract other stressors such as hurricanes, subsidence, and decreased SSC.

Tropical systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) have been documented causing variable affects to marshes, both physically destroying large areas Howes et al. 2010) and supplying sediment (Rejmanek et al. 1988;Nyman et al. 1995). Over the four periods in this study we found the most severe reduction in growth rate at the ARDC followed hurricane Lili in 2002. It was reported that the hurricane caused 7 km 2 of marsh loss approximately 21 km west of WLSD (Barras 2003). Although there is no documentation of land loss at the ARDC, Lili and the two additional tropical storms ( Table 4.1) that affected the area during the 1999-2004 period would have contributed to the negative growth rate. This is not a new phenomenon as observing growth rate estimates for previous periods would also seem to indicate that increases in tropical system frequency caused a reduction in growth rates (Figure 4.6). The periods of 1999-2004 and 2004-2010 present an interesting contrast. The latter period had two category 3 hurricanes make land fall in 2005 (Table 4.1) causing 23 km 2 of land loss in the region around the ARDC (Barras 2006), while the former only had one category 1 hurricane make land fall. Even with the land loss following the hurricanes during the 2004 to 2010 period, large flood events were able to counterbalance this loss to maintain a positive growth rate (Figure 4.3B). This again indicates the dominant role of large flood events for maintaining growth at the ARDC. Over the study period there was decreasing suspended sediment concentrations observed at both subdeltas. The decreasing SSC observed over the period can be ascribed to decreasing SSC identified throughout the Mississippi River Basin ). The SSC decline directly affects total suspended sediment input to the ARDC. The Yellow River in China has also gone through a reduction in sediment discharge from 1000 MT yr -1 to 150 MT yr -1 (Wang et al. 2007), contributing to a gradual erosion phase at the Yellow River Delta since 1996 (Chu et al. 2005). The defining difference between the Yellow River and the Atchafalaya River is that both flow and SSC of the Yellow River have declined greatly (Wang et al. 2007) whereas flow of the Atchafalaya River has stayed relatively constant over the past 21 years (Figure 4.2). This has enabled the continuation of large flood pulses to occur in the  .7. Daily suspended sand load (grain size >62.5\u00b5m) versus water discharge above 25% discharge exceedence  for the Atchafalaya River Morgan City (ARMC) and Wax Lake Outlet (WLO). Vegetation colonization of deltaic land occurred rapidly in ARDC, with 87% of the new subaerial land since 1989 vegetated. Between the four periods vegetated land was not converted to water as readily as barren areas with, on average, only 7% of the vegetated land converted to water as compared to 32% of barren land. This may have been caused by greater sedimentation from vegetation influences and/or due to the stabilizing effect of root density. In an early study on vegetation succession in newly created land, Johnson et al. (1985) found that biotic enhancement of sedimentation only occurred with S. nigra (black willow) on the highest elevation areas of the delta (e.g. levee), while the majority of delta sedimentation was controlled by physical processes, indicating different species effect. Even at lower elevations where sedimentation is controlled by physical processes, vegetation may still be important because McGinnis (1997) found that soil strength (ability to resist erosion) in a Louisiana coastal marsh was a function of live root density. We found that newly vegetated areas maintained vegetated in subsequent periods at greater than 60% in the ARDC (Figure 4.4). The only instance where newly vegetated land was converted to water at higher rates was during the 1999 to 2004 period (Figure 4.4), where WLSD lost 4.4 km 2 of newly vegetated land. As discussed earlier, this period was characterized by a lack of large floods, and 3 tropical system impacts. The combination of these factors could have generated this loss by salt water stress causing vegetation mortality while lacking large flood events to provide large quantities of sediment. Hurricanes can cause extended periods of saltwater intrusion, which can kill freshwater marsh vegetation, in addition to physically eroding away large areas of land (McKee and Mendelssohn 1989;Flynn et al. 1995;Steyer et al. 2007;. The land loss caused by tropical systems during the 1999 to 2004 period may not have been counterbalanced by enough sediment input in subsequent years from the lack of large flood pulses. In addition, the lower sediment input may not have been able to offset subsidence rates, which could exceed 6.0 mm yr -1 due to compaction of new delta surface . This provides two important insights on vegetation stabilization of delta land. First, under reduced flow conditions vegetation alone may not be enough to maintain delta surface. This is supported by the findings of Neubauer (2008) that tidal freshwater marsh in active deltas in Louisiana was maintained through mineral additions. Second, that the stabilization displayed in other periods could have been land re-generation by large floods after high energy storm events followed by rapid vegetation colonization. Due to the lack of field surveys and a comparative design, our study cannot make a conclusive estimation as to the degree of vegetation stabilization in newly created land. Two other factors may have affected our delta growth assessment: cold fronts and tidal variations. Cold front passage can cause water to flush out of the bay area and has been documented for being able to remove up to 10.6 MT of sediment annually from the Atchafalaya Bay (Walker and Hammack 2000;Roberts et al. 2005). Unlike tropical systems and floods, cold fronts occur every year and there is little variation between years, thus making their impacts relatively consistent, and not a driving factor in the overall changes observed (Hardy and Henderson 2003). Tides can also affect land estimates by affecting the amount of land surface visible. At the ARDC tide can cause the extent of land estimates to vary by as much as 30% (Allen et al. 2012), and this may have been the main cause for the small difference in delta growth rate estimates between this study's and others . During our four study periods the difference in tides varied from 0.02 m to 0.24 m. For the periods 1989 to 1995 and 1995 to 1999 each subsequent image had higher tide, which may have made the land estimates to be conservative. For the period 1999 to 2004 tide was the highest and may have exaggerated the net loss seen at the time. For the period 2004 to 2010 tide was the lowest for any image and thus could have caused a slight exaggeration of extent, adding to the gain seen during that period. The barren land class would have been affected by tide the most since these areas are most likely tidal flats so any variation in tide could have affected classification. Vegetated land was probably unaffected because the vegetation at lowest elevations (S. platyphylla, N. lutea and S. latifolia) grows taller (>0.8 m) than the tides observed and thus variations in tides between images would not have caused these areas to be classified differently.\n"}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4: RECENT DECADAL GROWTH OF THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER DELTA COMPLEX: EFFECTS OF VARIABLE RIVERINE SEDIMENT INPUT AND VEGETATION SUCCESSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER DELTA COMPLEX", "text": "ARDC is composed of two subdeltas, Atchafalaya River subdelta (ARSD) and Wax Lake Outlet subdelta (WLSD), extending approximately from 29\u00b023'N to 29\u00b032'N in latitude and from 91\u00b015'W to 91\u00b030'W in longitude (Figure 4.1).

ARMC mean total suspended sediment yield was 28.9 MT yr -1 , while WLO averaged 19.8 MT yr -1 . Xu (2010) estimated 58.0 MT yr -1 for the outlets combined, whereas our estimate was 48.7 MT yr -1 . Xu (2010) did not provide separate estimates for the outlets and only used SSC from ARMC to calculate the combined sediment yield. From our study it was identified that ARMC had 10% higher SSC than WLO. The higher SSC at ARMC as well as different time frames ) may explain the difference in sediment yield between  and this study's estimates. Allison et al. (2012) estimated total suspended sediment yield separately for the period 2008 to 2010. Their estimate for ARMC was 27.9 MT yr -1 and WLO was 20.5 MT yr -1 . This is similar to our estimate of 30.0 MT yr -1 (ARMC) and 21.6 MT yr -1 (WLO) for the same time frame. ARS mean total suspended sediment yield, 54.0 MT yr -1 , was slightly lower than previous studies   (2008)(2009)(2010), which was similar to our estimate of 68.3 MT for the same time frame. Difference in these estimates can be ascribed to different time frames, a general decrease in sediment yield from the Mississippi River over the past 50 years , and different sediment rating curves applied to estimate loading . A slight decrease in total suspended sediment yield occurred over the past 30 years, which was driven by significant decreasing SSC at ARMC and WLO. The decreasing SSC could be linked to the decreasing SSC in the Mississippi River . Within the annual mean SSC data there are two peaks that stick out, one in 1998 at both ARMC and WLO, and the other in 2010 at ARS. The large peak in SSC at the outlets in 1998, that was not as pronounced at ARS, could be explained by bank failures resulting from the large flood the previous year (1997, highest peak discharge for period at ARS, 18,027 m 3 s -1 ). The Atchafalaya River at Simmesport is leveed and well confined in its channel, whereas the lower section of the river is non-engineered allowing for bank erosion and lateral migration, which in other non-engineered rivers has been documented as a major source of suspended sediment (Bull 1997;Dunne et al. 1998;Hudson and Kesel 2003). The peak in SSC at ARS in 2010 is harder to explain and could be either due to work on the channel or from sampling error."}, {"section_title": "Retained Sediment", "text": "On average, 5.3 MT yr -1 of total suspended sediment was retained in the ARB, which is 10% of the total suspended sediment input from ARS. Retention of sediment varied, with a net export of sediment occurring in some years. Years when there was a net export averaged 5.1 MT yr -1 exported or 9% more than what was input to the ARB from ARS. Years with net retention averaged 12.3 MT yr -1 (22%) of total suspended sediment retained, although not including 2010, estimated retained mean total suspended sediment decreases to 8.4 MT yr -1 (16%).  estimated an average of 5.7 MT yr -1 (9%) of retained sediment (1974 to 2004). Allison et al. (2012) estimated 23.1 MT yr -1 retained (2008 to 2010), slightly higher than our estimate, 16.6 MT yr -1 , for the same time frame. Hupp et al. (2008) estimated from in situ sedimentation data an average of 5.9 MT yr -1 deposited in backwater areas, although there was a net loss of sediment from the ARB during the study (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003). The total amount of total suspended sediment retained (not including 2010) was 36.5 MT, which is only 5% of the total suspended sediment supplied (725.8 MT). This indicates that the ARB has reached equilibrium and its present form is more characteristic of a fluvial system. Hupp et al. (2008) also described that during their study on sedimentation (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003), there was a net export of sediment out of the ARB, and that deposited material in backwater areas was most likely being counterbalanced by either bank erosion or in channel re-suspension of sediment. Mason et al. (2012) findings on nitrate removal also support this as there was no significant processing of nitrate, an indication of low retention time, and thus a system that is fluvial rather than palustrine or lacustrine. The best explanatory variable for sediment retention was SSC entering the ARB from ARS, followed by SSC exiting through the outlets. It is known that differing discharge regimes can cause sediment deposition or re-suspension along the lowermost Mississippi River Allison et al. 2012). Although, when qualitatively looking at different variables that could have affected retention or export of total suspended sediment on the annual scale it would seem that flood peak, discharge volume, and retained discharge during the same year played little or no role in the retention or export of total suspended sediment in the ARB (Table 5.3). This indicates that suspended sediment dynamics within the ARB are complicated by hydrological and climatological interconnections between different years. This was discussed earlier when in 1998 SSC at the outlets could have been elevated by bank failures caused by the large flood the previous year. Also, drought years when there is low discharge could induce greater channel sedimentation from low river velocity, producing greater sediment availability for the next year. Another consequence of droughts could be the drawdown of backwater areas allowing for greater accommodation for subsequent floods. This occurred in 2011, during which extreme drought conditions in Louisiana (NCDC 2012) helped mitigate flooding of the ARB from the opening of Morganza Spillway due to below normal water conditions and soil water content. Another complicating factor is rapid sedimentation that could change flow patterns between years. All of these factors could have influenced the retention of sediment between different years, and make it hard to pinpoint the defining factors that control sedimentation annually in the ARB."}, {"section_title": "Sedimentation Rate", "text": "The estimated mean sedimentation rates from the spatial datasets were higher than in situ measured mean sedimentation rates. Our mean sedimentation rates, estimated from a range of different bulk densities, varied between 30 mm yr -1 and 75 mm yr -1 . Hupp et al.

Our estimated mean sedimentation rates using discrete bulk densities for the same cover types as Scaroni (2011), were 53.9 mm yr -1 (open water), 23.2 mm yr -1 (bottom land hardwood forest), and 56.0 mm yr -1 (cypress forest). Our estimates are much higher than Scaroni (2011), but fall close to the higher rates from Hupp et al. (2008). From the sedimentation rates estimated in this study it was possible to estimate a time range for the amount of bottom land cypress forest that could be transformed to higher elevation bottomland hardwood forest. Using the low end estimates for sedimentation from the two methods (30.4 mm yr -1 and 55.8 mm yr -1 ), mean area for turbid water flooded land class distributed over 0 m to 2 m, and assuming that the areas remain inundated year-round with sediment laden water, it can be estimated that approximately 273.2 km 2 of BLCF will be filled within 36 to 132 years. More precisely this represents 179.3 km 2 of land at the elevation 0 m filled within 71 to 132 years, 62.0 km 2 of land at 1 m filled in 54 to 99 years, and 31.9 km 2 of land at 2 m filled in 36 to 66 years. The total represents approximately 7% of the 3581 km 2 of forested wetlands in the ARB (USGS 2001), and is most likely a conservative estimate because of the use of mean values that may underestimate sedimentation in certain areas, as well as not accounting for the effects of large floods. There are several reasons why our estimates are higher than those obtained from in situ studies. The main reason is that bulk density may not be negatively correlated with sedimentation rates as our calculation assumes. From ARB studies there does not seem to be a strong correlation (negative or positive) of bulk density and sedimentation rate (Hupp et al. 2008, Scaroni 2011. Other possible errors can stem from the total suspended sediment load calculation on the daily scale, which could have an error of \u00b1100% (Horowtiz et al. 2001), the lack of imagery for flood periods or summer months, and the inability to specify to greater precision different bulk densities for different areas. The results from spatial analysis are promising because the method provides an easy and efficient way to analyze sedimentation basin wide, and could help management efforts by allowing for monitoring remotely rather than through costly trips. The use of the spatial sedimentation model also lends itself to modeling that tries to predict the future of coastal Louisiana, such as the modeling completed for Louisiana's 2012 Coastal Master Plan. Future work using this method would benefit from incorporating hydroperiod in the estimation. Hupp et al. (2008) found that hydroperiod in coordination with high connectivity with sediment laden water and slow velocity produced the highest sedimentation rates in the ARB. Estimation of sediment in the water could be refined by accounting for the decreased SSC away from main channels . While, daily total suspended sediment load estimation would benefit from SSC being sampled on days when images are captured at the outlets and 2 days before the image at ARS."}]
