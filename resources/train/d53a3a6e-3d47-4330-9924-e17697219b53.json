[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coastal ecosystems are subject to a wide range of stressors arising from climate change as well as land use conversion and other anthropogenic activity. Increased rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR)-particularly when coupled with altered nutrient, sediment, or hydrological budgets-are promoting rapid ecogeomorphic shifts in coastal ecosystems worldwide (Scavia et al. 2002;IPCC 2014). Brackish marshes, typically dominated by plants with narrow tolerance ranges for salinity and hydroperiod, can serve as an effective prism for studying relationships between plant community composition, ecosystem attributes, regional manifestations of climate change, and human alterations of the coastal environment (Brewer and Grace 1990;Craft et al. 2009;Langley and Megonigal 2010;Wieski et al. 2010;Weston et al. 2011). Accretion rates in coastal marshes have historically increased with RSLR, resulting in elevations at or near sea level (Redfield 1972;Wilson et al. 2014), but evidence is mounting that coastal marshes in many regions do not accrete at rates necessary to keep up with accelerating increases in sea level (Donnelly and Bertness 2001;Hartig et al. 2002;Kolker et al. 2010; Kirwan and Megonigal 2013). Marsh elevation deficits have been linked to climate change, subsidence, insufficient Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13157-016-0769-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. sediment loads, reduced rates of autochthonous sediment production, and increased salinity stress (Orson et al. 1985;Hartig et al. 2002;Reed 2002;Kirwan and Megonigal 2013). These and other factors, like hurricanes and storms (e.g., van de Plassche et al. 2006), can act independently and synergistically to alter the time and depth of flooding, the distribution and productivity of marsh plants, and ultimately, the persistence of coastal wetlands. We examined environmental records preserved in coastal wetland sediments because the sedimentary record is an excellent vantage point to understand how coastal systems will respond to future environmental changes (Donnelly and Bertness 2001;Horton et al. 2009;Kolker et al. 2009;Kemp et al. 2011;IPCC 2013). In particular, we assessed how two North Carolina coastal brackish marshes responded to regional climate and sea-level variability in the previous century by constructing chronologies of plant community composition and sediment accretion using seed bank records of two ecologically contrasting sedges, Cladium jamaicense and Schoenoplectus americanus, and naturally occurring radioisotopes. Both of the plant species studied produce seeds in proportion to abundance (Sherfy and Kirkpatrick 1999;Saunders 2003;Saunders et al. 2006), and their seeds can persist in sediments for centuries to millennia (e.g., T\u00f6rnqvist et al. 2004). Historic records for three environmental variables that could promote shifts in brackish marsh plant communities-RSL (relative sea level), precipitation, and temperature-were obtained and compared against seed bank profiles and geochronologies. These comparisons allowed us to test the hypothesis that compositional shifts in plant communities of brackish marshes on the mid-Atlantic coast are driven by regional manifestations of climate change and to infer whether responses occurred at rates comparable to the pace of environmental change."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Region", "text": "Pamlico Sound (Fig. 1) is a back-barrier coastal lagoon located on the Atlantic coast of North Carolina (35.3128\u00b0N, 75.9372\u00b0W) that is characterized by shallow water depths, negligible slopes, low elevation, and extensive coverage by hydric soils (Moorhead and Brinson 1995). Freshwater is delivered to the Sound from the Albermarle system, which enters from the north, and from the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, which enter from the west. Average monthly salinity in the Pamlico Sound has ranged from 0 to 17 ppt over a recent 30 year period (1980-2009), with a mean of~7 ppt (Carpenter and Dubbs 2012). Within the Sound, salinity generally decreases from east to west, and values are typically lowest with increased freshwater inputs during the late winter to early spring (Abbene et al. 2006;Carpenter and Dubbs 2012). Tidal range in the Pamlico Sound varies from~10 cm at Hatteras to~100 cm at Beaufort and Morehead City ( Fig. 1; Abbene et al. 2006;NOAA 2014). Although inorganic sediment content in the Sound appears to be increasing (Cooper et al. 2004), the small tidal range in the Sound implies relatively small tidal currents and thus limited capacity to delivery and distribute sediment onto marsh surfaces, which suggests that organic production is especially important for maintaining marsh elevation in the face of rising sea level (Moorhead and Brinson 1995). These attributes make marshes in the Pamlico Sound attractive targets for studying the effects of sea-level rise (Pruitt et al. 2010;Kemp et al. 2011). Like estuaries elsewhere, the Pamlico-Albemarle system has experienced substantial environmental changes over the past century. Between 1982 and 2006, urban development increased from~418 to~1660 km 2 within the system (Carpenter and Dubbs 2012). Factors associated with increased urban development, such as road and ditch construction, have been linked to nutrient and sediment loading (Cooper et al. 2004;Carpenter and Dubbs 2012). Regional precipitation, temperature, and estuarine salinity have all increased over the past century (Abbene et al. 2006;Carpenter and Dubbs 2012). In recent decades RSLR has also increased, from~2 to~5 mm year \u22121 (Horton et al. 2009;Kemp et al. 2011;NOAA 2014). Concurrently, the North Carolina coast has been experiencing shoreline erosion and net loss of coastal wetlands. The state had 352 km 2 of salt and brackish marsh in 1994; by 2001, 24 km 2 had converted from marsh to open water and 2 km 2 had transitioned to upland elevations, resulting in a total loss of 7.3 % of salt and brackish marsh in less than a decade (Carle 2011). Comparisons of historical aerial photographs to 1998 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles indicate that shoreline erosion rates have varied from 0 to~1.5 m year \u22121 in Pamlico Sound (Riggs and Ames 2003;Carpenter and Dubbs 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Study System", "text": "The spatial variation of salinity regimes in an estuarine system like Pamlico Sound can create distinct zones of plant communities (e.g., Odum 1998). In this region, intertidal marshes in the areas of lowest elevation and highest salinity are dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Higher elevation marshes experiencing brackish conditions tend to be dominated by Juncus roemerianus and Schoenoplectus americanus. Tidal freshwater marshes are often comprised of more diverse assemblages that can include broadleaf plants such as Sagittaria lancifola and Pontedaria cordata, although these assemblages can also be dominated by sedges like Schoenoplectus pungens (Blum et al. 2005) and Cladium jamaicense (NCDEHNR 1997). Sharply delimited zonal bands occur between monodominant assemblages within salt marsh ecosystems (e.g., S. alterniflora in low salt marsh) as a consequence of exposure to stressors like inundation (Odum 1998, Donnelly andBertness 2001). Sharp transitions can also occur among contrasting assemblages in tidal brackish and freshwater marshes, though local environmental heterogeneity often results in bounded mosaics rather than zonal bands (Odum 1998). Transitions among ecosystems also are often bounded, but shifts can sometimes be attenuated as a result of hybridization (Ayres et al. 2004, Blum et al. 2005). This study focused on two ecologically contrasting sedges, C. jamaicense and S. americanus, as indicators of marsh plant community composition in tidal brackish and freshwater marshes. Commonly known as sawgrass, C. jamaicense is a perennial sedge that grows throughout the year in coastal marshes of the southeastern United States (Steward and Ornes 1975). It is typically found in fresh to slightly brackish or oligohaline marshes with background levels of salinity of \u2264 5 ppt (Brewer and Grace 1990;Ewe et al. 2007;USFS 2014). Above-ground primary productivity of C. jamaicense is negatively correlated with salinity and time of inundation (Valentine 1977;Childers et al. 2006;Macek and Rejmankova 2007). In the Florida Everglades, where it has been well-studied, populations of C. jamaicense have shifted inland 3.3 km since the 1940's, a change attributed to RSLR and water management practices (Ross et al. 2000). Schoenoplectus americanus is a perennial sedge species that is found in marshes from South America to Nova Scotia and along the Pacific coast of the United States (Sipple 1978). On the Atlantic coast, S. americanus tolerates salinities of 2 ppt to 17 ppt, with peak performance occurring in soils with salinities of 5 ppt to 10 ppt (Ross and Chabrek 1972;Hess 1975). Consequently, this species has been used as an indicator of brackish conditions and as a model organism for studies of ecosystem responses to climate-related stressors such as increased salinity due to sea-level rise and elevated CO 2 (Blum et al. 2005;Cherry et al. 2008;Blum et al. 2010;Langley and Megonigal 2010;Kirwan and Guntenspergen 2012). Both C. jamaicense and S. americanus produce annual crops of resilient seeds with thick coats that contribute to viability and taphonomic preservation (Mohamed-Yasseen et al. 1994;Sherfy and Kirkpatrick 1999), resulting in longstanding seed banks that have served as environmental archives for reconstructing annual-to-millennial records of plant community shifts in coastal wetlands (Brush 2001;Saunders 2003;Saunders et al. 2006). Schoenoplectus seeds are so persistent that they are routinely used for 14 C dating in sedimentary records (e.g., T\u00f6rnqvist et al. 2004). Seed profiles of these species offer a basis for inferring prevalence over time since seed production is also positively correlated with aboveground biomass (Sherfy and Kirkpatrick 1999;Saunders 2003;Saunders et al. 2006). Seed profiles of both species exhibit little evidence of taphonomic bias due to production, deposition, or preservation (Saunders 2003, Saunders et al. 2006. Seed densities for the two species are high; when measured at the center of dense monospecific stands, seed density can reach 400 seeds m \u22122 for S. americanus (Diggory and Parker 2010) and 5000 seeds m \u22122 for C. jamaicense (Alexander 1971). Comparable densities were found in the marshes examined for this study (ESM 1). The seeds of both species are heavy compared to seeds of other wetland plant species-seeds of S. americanus weigh 0.5 mg (Diggory and Parker 2010), while C. jamaicense seeds weigh~3 mg (Miao et al. 1997)-which is likely to result in relatively low dispersion. Furthermore, seed viability and germination rates for both species tend to be low (e.g., Alexander 1971;Webb et al. 2009), and the depositional nature of coastal wetlands promotes anoxic conditions with low decomposition rates (Lee 1992) and reduced bioturbation that favor seed preservation."}, {"section_title": "Site Description and Sampling", "text": "Sediment cores were collected from two brackish marsh sites in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina; both locations support plant communities currently dominated by S. americanus (Fig. 1). Scranton Marsh is adjacent to the Buck Paysour Memorial Bridge, approximately 6 km northwest of the town of Scranton (N 35\u00b030.023\u2032 W 76\u00b026.695\u2032). This marsh consists of large stands of S. americanus with smaller interspersed patches of J. roemerianus. Cedar Island Marsh is located at the Cedar Island Bridge outside of Morehead City (N 34\u00b054.977\u2032 W 76\u00b022.197\u2032) and is dominated by S. americanus with interspersed stands of J. roemerianus. Both marshes were inundated by less than 10 cm when sampled, which was approximately during average high tides according to the nearest NOAA tide gauge in Beaufort, NC (NOAA 2014). Both marshes also appear to be located in areas that have been relatively stable over the past several decades according to aerial imagery (ESM 2). Ten 50-cm sediment cores were manually collected at each site in October of 2011 using a 2-cm diameter Eijkelkamp Russian peat sampler to prevent compaction. Cores were collected in each marsh in a radial configuration, at 3 locations within stands of S. americanus that were separated by 120\u00b0a nd approximately 100 m apart. This approach, similar to that taken in Grandin and Rydin (1998), helped maximize spatial coverage and capture within-site heterogeneity in each marsh (Saunders 2003). Cores were stored in PVC tubes to prevent deformation and transported on ice to Tulane University, where they were kept at 4\u00b0C. Within a month of collection, all 20 cores were cut into 2 cm intervals that were stored at 4\u00b0C until further processing. One core from each marsh was chosen for radionuclide dating based on a preliminary assessment of seed counts across the cores. Approximately 5 g of sediment was removed from each section of these cores for radionuclide dating and sediment bulk density analysis. The remaining sediment from these cores and all sediment from the other 18 cores was sieved for seeds."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Geochronology", "text": "Chronologies of sediment accretion were developed using the naturally-occurring, particle reactive radionuclide 210 Pb. We chose 210 Pb as a dating technique for this study because, when measured via alpha-spectrometry, it can be analyzed using a constant rate of supply (CRS) model that provides unique ages for each interval of sediment, often at resolutions of <10 year (McCaffery and Thompson 1980;Kolker et al. 2009;Kolker et al. 2010). For this study, activities of 210 Pb were determined via alpha spectrometry (Nittrouer et al. 1979;Kolker et al. 2009) for each 2 cm interval of core. Sediment accretion rates were then calculated using both the CRS method, which assumes a constant rate of supply of excess 210 Pb ( 210 Pb XS ) to marsh surfaces, and a second method that assumes a constant initial concentration (CIC) of 210 Pb XS in marsh surfaces (McCaffery and Thompson 1980;Bricker-Urso et al. 1989). The CRS sediment chronologies were used to define a time series for each study site, in which the relevant environmental record (i.e. RSL, precipitation, and temperature) was divided into intervals corresponding to age ranges of the core sections (Kolker et al. 2009). Using the CIC method, a single average accretion rate was determined for each marsh based on the slope of the ln-transformed excess activities."}, {"section_title": "Seed Recovery", "text": "Seeds were recovered from all 2 cm sections of every core using geological sieves that retained the 1 to 2 mm size fraction of sieved material. Retained material was examined under a dissecting microscope, and seeds were counted and identified to species whenever possible. Species were identified using the National Park Service's Seeds of Success website (NPS 2014), photographs and descriptions from Martin and Barkley (1961), the Tulane Herbarium, and input from taxonomic experts (R Hesselink and C Saunders, personal communication). We created a composite record of S. americanus and C. jamaicense at each site by combining seed profiles for all cores from each marsh (ESM 1). Composite records are representative of variation across a site and reduce spurious inferences that can arise due to anomalous fine-scale heterogeneity and small sample size (van der Valk and Davis 1979; Grandin and Rydin 1998;Saunders 2003;Saunders et al. 2006;Saunders et al. 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Data", "text": "We examined two different sources of RSL data from the past century at Pamlico Sound (Figs. 1 and 2, ESM 3)-annual RSL means obtained from the Wilmington, NC tide gauge (Woodworth and Player 2003;PSMSL 2014) and a BTump Point^RSL record (Fig. 1) from Kemp et al. (2011), in which the authors studied foraminifera to reconstruct a two millennia record of sea level from salt marsh sediment. The use of these two records allowed us to evaluate marsh responses to RSLR over time scales ranging from 10 1 to 10 3 years, fully bracketing the expected 10 2 years range often captured in marsh sediment cores (e.g., Saunders 2003, Saunders et al. 2006. Though many aspects of the hydrological cycle can affect coastal marshes (e.g., the position and duration of mean high water is a major control on sediment deposition, whereas the depth and duration of low water controls drainage, which influences the edaphic factors that impact plant growth and survival), we examined mean sea level as a measure of marsh response to RSLR because it is widely considered to be the best single measure of the variety of hydrological processes potentially influenced by changing climate conditions (Bricker-Urso et al. 1989;Roman et al. 1997;Kolker et al. 2009;Carey et al. 2015 and refs therein). Annual mean temperature (\u00b0C) and total annual precipitation (cm year \u22121 ) values for the past century were calculated from historical monthly means obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC 2014) for one station at Belhaven (NC) and two stations at New Bern (NC), the closest stations to the study marshes with nearly complete records (Fig. 1, Table 1). Annual values were calculated only for years not missing data for any months, and the completeness of each record is given in Table 1 as the percentage of years for which means were calculated. After regression analyses indicated that the two New Bern records were highly correlated for precipitation and temperature (Table 2; ESM 3), long-term composite records were created by averaging the records during the period of overlap (Fig. 2)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses of Plant Assemblage Variation", "text": "We conducted regression analyses in a model-testing framework to examine the relative influence of historical Fig. 2 Records for the past century of relative sea level (RSL) and climate variables for Pamlico Sound over time: a RSL records from Wilmington tide gauge (solid grey circles) and Tump Point, reconstructed from foraminifera data (solid black circles), including significant trendlines (p < 0.05) from linear regression analyses (see also Table 1 and Fig. 5); b total annual precipitation in cm for combined New Bern 3 and New Bern airport stations, averaged where overlapping; c mean annual temperature in\u00b0C for the two New Bern stations combined, averaged where overlapping; and d total annual precipitation in cm for the Belhaven station Stations are the official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) numbers for locations of data records.

Asterisks denote significant relationships of variables with time changes in RSL, temperature, and precipitation on the number of S. americanus and C. jamaicense seeds recovered from sediment cores. Eleven least-squares regression models were constructed to predict numbers of seeds recovered from cores for each species at each marsh over the period of time defined by the 210 Pb geochronology. Models were created with Systat v13 using single environmental variables and logical combinations of multiple environmental variables (Blum et al. 2010), including the Wilmington or Tump Point RSL records, the Belhaven station for precipitation at the Scranton Marsh, the composite New Bern record for precipitation at the Cedar Island Marsh, and the composite New Bern record for temperature at both marshes. The best models among significant models (p < 0.05, as defined by n-1 degree of freedom) for each marsh and species were identified by comparison of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values (Burnham and Anderson 2002). A correction for small sample size (AIC c ) was used that increases the relative penalty for model complexity with smaller data sets, where AIC c = \u22122 (ln (likelihood)) + 2 K*(n/(n -K -1)). As n (the number of samples) grows larger than K (the number of parameters), AIC c converges on AIC (Burnham and Anderson 2002), thus using AIC c when n is not many times larger than K 2 reduces the probability of overfitting, or selecting models that have too many parameters (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Therefore AIC c values represent conservative estimates of statistical significance that account for the relatively small number of seeds recovered from our sediment cores."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sediment Ages, Accretion Rates, and Bulk Density", "text": "Excess 210 Pb was confined to the upper 14 cm in the Scranton marsh core and the upper 16 cm in the Cedar Island marsh core.

Sediment accretion rates determined with the CIC method were 1.9 (\u00b1 0.40) mm year \u22121 for the Scranton Marsh and 2.6 (\u00b1 0.34) mm year \u22121 for the Cedar Island Marsh (Fig. 3).

RSLR values (mm year \u22121 ) are equivalent to the slope of linear regression lines fit to RSL data from the Wilmington time gauge for the time intervals corresponding to each core section. Deficit values refer to calculations of the difference between the changes in average RSL (cm) from either Wilmington (W) or Tump Point (TP) for the period of years corresponding with each core section and in marsh elevation (cm) from the same core section, with average RSL and elevation of the core sections corresponding with the year 1945 set to zero.

Linear regressions for composite seed profiles indicated that the number of S. americanus seeds tended to increase while the number of C. jamaicense seeds tended to decrease towards contemporary horizons (Table 2). In the composite seed profiles for both marshes, C. jamaicense dominated at deeper depths while S. americanus dominated at shallower depths, transitioning around 8 cm in the Scranton Marsh core and around 4 cm in the Cedar Island Marsh core (Fig. 4). Variation in seed numbers by core section was not correlated with the CRS accretion rates, suggesting that it was not driven by dilution with sediment (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Change", "text": "A series of linear regressions were constructed to determine the direction and magnitude of regional changes in environmental variables over time (Table 2).

We also assessed how accretion in the two marshes compared to the pace of regional changes in RSL over the past century (Orson et al. 1985;Kolker et al. 2010;Donnelly and Bertness 2001;Wilson et al. 2014;Carey et al. 2015). Our findings indicate that the marshes transitioned from systems typically found in higher or fresher regions of an estuary (i.e. those dominated by C. jamaicense) to systems typically found in the middle or brackish regions of an estuary (i.e. those dominated by S. americanus). These observed transitions correspond to trends in sea level and regional precipitation. In addition, we found that accretion rates in the two marshes are likely not high enough to keep pace with current rapid and accelerating rates of RSLR. These findings advance the view that coastal wetlands are shifting in response to climate change (Warren and Niering 1993;Donnelly and Bertness 2001;Kolker et al. 2010;Voss et al. 2012;Lagomasino et al. 2013;Carey et al. 2015;Smith 2015;Raposa et al. 2016), and that highly vulnerable low salinity systems like brackish marshes may become increasingly threatened or lost within the coming century (Craft et al. 2009;Friess et al. 2012)."}, {"section_title": "The Trajectory and Pace of Community Shifts in Brackish Marshes", "text": "Dated cores indicated that a transition from a C. jamaicense to a S. americanus dominated community occurred around 1960 in the Scranton Marsh and after 1985 in the Cedar Island Marsh (Fig. 2).

Observed changes are consistent with what would be expected based on the physiological tolerance of these plants given increases in RSLR and salinity. Our findings indicate that the observed plant community transitions are likely attributable to the development of aggradation deficits (Table 3, Fig. 5). Centennial scale, CIC-derived accretion rates were 1.9 mm \u00b1 0.40 year \u22121 for the Scranton Marsh core (for the period of 1935-2011) and 2.6 \u00b1 0.34 mm year \u22121 (for the period of 1920-2011) for the Cedar Island Marsh core, suggesting elevation deficits of 4.9 cm and 1.0 cm respectively using the Wilmington tide gauge as a proxy record for sea level at the study sites (Table 3). While more detailed reconstructions of CRS rates indicate that accretion rates at both sites increased during the late 20th century (Fig. 3), our results indicate that overall the marshes are not keeping pace with RSLR (Fig. 3). Other factors, such as Table 4 Results from AIC c selection of the best least squares linear regression models using relative sea level (RSL), temperature (Temp), and/or precipitation (Precip) to explain variation in numbers of S. americanus and C. jamaicense seeds for each marsh  Kemp et al. 2011) localized irregular below-ground growth, may have contributed to observed shifts in dominance of species, but the interpretation that an aggradation deficit contributed to a plant community shift is consistent with evidence of tidal marsh community transitions driven by elevation deficits elsewhere on the Atlantic coast (e.g., Donnelly and Bertness 2001). The staggered timing of elevation deficits and plant community transitions at the two study marshes likely reflects a range of factors, including variation in sea level rise, regional trends in RSLR, and local variability in subsurface conditions. For example, Church and White (2006) report that the years 1962~1970 and 1985~1995 were periods of relatively rapid sea level rise, and this pattern appears in the Wilmington tide gauge record; RSLR from 1961 to 1971 was 4.85 \u00b1 2.60 and 7.26 \u00b1 2.50 mm year \u22121 from 1985 to 1995. Tide gauge records also indicate that rates of RSLR increased northward along the North Carolina coast over the past century, and peat-based records indicate that the pattern extends over the past millennium (Englehart and Horton 2012). This suggests that the more southerly Cedar Island Marsh may be less vulnerable to elevation deficits and saltwater intrusion than the Scranton Marsh site. Differences in accretion rates among the study sites could also reflect heterogeneity in compaction of sediments and organic matter decay, as the observed increase in accretion rates is not associated with changes in sediment bulk density at Scranton Marsh but is at Cedar Island Marsh. It is possible that accretion has been influenced by punctuated climatic events (e.g., hurricanes, freshwater flooding, storm surge). Signatures of such effects should be embedded within regional precipitation, temperature and sea-level records, but we found little evidence that punctuated events have influenced accretion at the Cedar Island and Scranton marshes since the early 20th century. Our findings reinforce a broad body of work indicating that coastal wetlands are challenged by increasing rates of sealevel rise (e.g., Fagherazzi et al. 2011). Global sea-level rise has accelerated over the past two centuries at a rate of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122 mm y \u22122 (Church and White 2006;Jevrejeva et al. 2008), resulting in contemporary rates of 3.1 mm year \u22121 (Merrifield et al. 2009). A recent field-based bioassay indicates that reduced plant production from increased inundation make marshes vulnerable to current rates of RSLR (Voss et al. 2012). In geologically stable marshes along Long Island Sound (NY and CT), rates of marsh accretion have accelerated at a comparable rate to global SLR (2.3 +/\u2212 0.2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 mm year \u22121 ), while rates of mineral deposition appear to have fluctuated with changes in global temperature, indicating that accelerated sea-level rise is flooding marshes for greater periods of time (Kolker et al. 2010;Hill and Anisfeld 2015). In New England, marshes have transitioned from systems dominated by high marsh plants to systems dominated by low marsh plants (Warren and Niering 1993;Donnelly and Bertness 2001;Smith 2015;Raposa et al. 2016), and organically dominated marshes appear to be converting to mineral dominated systems (Carey et al. 2015). Creeks in South Carolina salt marshes are experiencing headward expansion and vegetation dieback (Hughes et al. 2009), while in Louisiana rapid losses of coastal wetlands also have been partly attributed to submergence and erosional processes associated with RSLR (e.g., Reed 2002;Kolker et al. 2011). Given current and predicted accelerations in the rate of global sea-level rise (IPCC 2013) and observations of climateinduced flooding observed elsewhere in the region, it is likely that the observed changes in mid-Atlantic coast brackish marshes reported here are climate induced and that further change will continue in the foreseeable future."}, {"section_title": "Non-Climatic Drivers of Marsh Change", "text": "It is worth considering whether non-climatic factors such as changes in sediment supply, hydrology, nutrient availability, and fire regime have influenced observed geological and ecological changes. Evidence of changes in sediment supply in Pamlico Sound marshes over the past century is equivocal; diatom diversity in sediment cores suggest an increase in sediment supply (Cooper et al. 2004), while suspended sediment loads in the region, including the Neuse River, have been declining (Carpenter and Dubbs 2012). Nonetheless, dredging of inlets may have created a sediment sink by increasing tidal flooding as a result of a greater tidal prism (Hackney and Cleary 1987). While there is clear evidence that nutrient loads are increasing regionally (Stow et al. 2001;Cooper et al. 2004, Paerl et al. 2007, recent studies indicate that elevated nitrogen (N) concentrations do not necessarily lead to substantial changes in S. americanus productivity or relative abundance (Meert and Hester 2009;Langley and Megonigal 2010), suggesting that nutrients are not driving the increases in S. americanus observed here. While fire regimes in Pamlico Sound marshes changed during the time period (Hackney and de la Cruz 1981), we did not observe charcoal or other evidence of burning in our cores, suggesting that it is not of critical importance at the two study sites. The relative importance of these and other possible drivers of shifts in marsh plant community composition could be evaluated further with additional work linking plant surveys and sediment cores across elevation transition zones. Comparisons of seed profiles for modern marshes that vary with respect to elevation, salinity, and habitat might also prove to be a useful reference and could better capture more complex relationships among the variables examined in this study."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Management of Coastal Wetlands", "text": "With the geographical extent of tidal marsh systems declining (Stedman and Dahl 2008;Carle 2011;Prahalad et al. 2011;IPCC 2014), there is growing urgency for understanding and mitigating responses to environmental change that promotes coastal wetland loss. Because of Bcoastal squeeze^ (Doody 2004), freshwater and brackish marshes are likely to be among the first wave of ecosystem casualties from climate change. Our findings suggest that observed changes in plant community composition are linked to the development of a marsh elevation deficit that, coupled with a decline in precipitation, selects for species more tolerant of salt water inundation (Orson et al. 1985). Thus, Pamlico Sound marshes may be experiencing a deleterious positive feedback loop, in which increased salinity, and particularly increased SO 4 2\u2212 availability, leads to increased oxidation of marsh peat relative to background methanogenesis rates, thereby leading to an enhanced elevation deficit (Craft et al. 2009;Kirwan and Blum 2011;Marton et al. 2012). This increases the waterlogging of marsh sediments, accelerating the eco-geomorphic transitions already underway (Craft et al. 2009;Kirwan and Blum 2011;Marton et al. 2012). Given the thermal inertia associated with rising sea surface temperatures, it is almost inevitable that high rates of sea-level rise will continue for at least a century, if not longer (IPCC 2013). Without wise management practices such as those that maintain the flux of freshwater and sediments to the coastal zone, sensitive coastal ecosystems like brackish marshes will continue to change, and perhaps disappear, during this century."}]
