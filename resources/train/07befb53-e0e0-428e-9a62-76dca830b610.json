Thus, a finding of gender differences in the hiring and promotion of females in a particular academic field is a necessary but clearly not sufficient condition of discrimination, flagging areas of potential concern. The academic market has an importance beyond its numbers. College students' perceptions of the gender representation in positions of authority and status may color their expectations about future jobs; at the same time, the absence of female role models or mentors among academics, particularly at senior levels, may affect students' motivation and aspirations. An additional factor makes this labor market of particular interest: female Ph.D. recipients who have entered the academic labor market, particularly in a field as heavily dominated by males as economics, have already signaled a high degree of attachment to the labor market by investing in their education. Many of the arguments to explain general gender wage differentials point to employers' difficulties in distinguishing between women who are committed to the labor market and those who are not. This argument should not hold-or should not hold nearly as strongly-for Ph.D. economists."}, {"section_title": "I.

With each survey, new doctorate recipients are added; at the same time, some previous respondents are dropped. People are dropped from the survey either when the number of years since Ph.D. receipt exceeds 42 (or 44 in some years), or for sampling reasons. The sample was stratified by sex, as well as by cohort, field, and size of doctoral institution. Women and minorities were oversampled. To give an example of the sample sizes in this survey in economics, in 1989 625 males Ph.D. economists were surveyed, of whom 361 were in academia in 1989, while 331 females Ph.D. economists were surveyed, of whom 184 were in academia. However, even with the oversampling, the numbers are sufficiently small to warrant caution in generalizing to all economists. This study can thus be only suggestive. Although there are data on very early cohorts (as early as 1930), the first observations on these cohorts are from 1973. Consequently, the data on early cohorts cannot be used to study the tenure process. People from earlier cohorts who are still in academia are much more likely to have been successful in academia (e.g., received tenure) than those who began in academia but left pre-1973. Since the academics observed from earlier cohorts are not a random sample, all statistical analysis presented here includes only those who received their Ph.D.'s after 1970. The questionnaire is quite short and has limited control variables. Moreover, at this point, access to the entire set of independent variables has not yet been obtained, particularly on the present employer (or the prestige of the present employer). However, even without this variable, the longitudinal nature of the questionnaire allows us to answer a myriad of questions about careers of academics as they unfold. The questionnaire does not ask for measures of publications. Therefore, these data cannot be used to examine whether academics with similar publication records six years post-Ph.D. were treated differentially by gender. This analysis is thus a reduced form: it models the likelihood of being promoted for a male or female with similar background and demographic characteristics. This likelihood includes the likelihood that the individual will publish enough to receive tenure. Some academics use the strategy of changing institution or even field in order to obtain a tenured job when tenure is not obtained in the present institution or field (see e.g., P. Allison and J. S. Long, 1987). I include a dummy variable for whether the individual moved to a field slightly outside of economics or management (such as public policy).2"}, {"section_title": "II.

The difference in the proportion going into academia is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Controlling for cohort, differences still seem to remain. Of those who do enter academia directly after receiving the Ph.D., women are less likely to enter tenure-track jobs. Only 58.1 of females who start in academia enter tenure track jobs, while 73.3 percent of men do.3 This difference is statistically significant. However, the strength of the effect and significance falls dramatically when the quality of Ph.D. institution, cohort, and other available variables are controlled for. The remainder of this paper considers promotion for those who do have a tenure-track job. The non-tenure-track academic population, however, warrants considerable further study."}, {"section_title": "III.

Another way to evaluate this result is by considering the estimated median time until tenure for men and women with otherwise identical values of the independent variables. When the independent variables are set at their mean level, the median predicted time until tenure for a man is nine years, while for a women it is 16 years (after nine years, only 36 percent of women with \"average\" characteristics can expect to have tenure). Gender differences are reflected in the survival curves of Figure 1, which graphs the likelihood of remaining untenured as a function of time since Ph.D., based on nonparametric (univariate) Kaplan-Meier estimates. These curves indicate that males are much more likely than women to receive tenure within seven years following Ph.D. receipt, but that the gender difference eventually narrows somewhat. Analysis of the multivariate results indicates that gender differences in independent variables (other than sex) account for only a very small part of the difference in tenure probabilities;4 the bulk of the difference is directly due to gender. In the nonacademic general labor market, one source of gender differences in careers lies in the higher tendency of women to move in and out of the labor market. Is this true in academia as well? The data indicate that there is only a minuscule difference in women's tendency to leave the labor market. Of the more than 600 Ph.D. recipients analyzed (i.e., those who received the Ph.D. after 1970 and were ever academics) who did not retire by 1989, hardly any were observed as being out of the labor market in any questionnaire year: two out of 179 fe-males and two out of 429 males. These tiny numbers could not account for any observed differences in tenure probabilities.5 There is some evidence in this survey that the gender differences are disappearing over time. If we construct Kaplan-Meier medians for the cohort who received Ph.D.'s in the early 1970's and compare them to those who received Ph.D.'s in the late 1970's,6 there is a large difference in the earlier period but no difference at all in the later period. Multivariate hazard analysis on these same cohort groups finds that for the earlier cohorts, men have a significantly higher hazard rate of receiving tenure during this period (coefficient = 0.528, SE = 0.218). In the later period, however, the coefficient on \"male\" drops to zero (coefficient = -0.053, SE = 0.367). This may merely be due to the fewer observations in the later period. Additional years of surveys are needed to confirm this result. Finally, the results in Table 2 also speak to the progress of minority economists within academia. The instantaneous likelihood of blacks and Native Americans receiving tenure is essentially identical to that of Caucasians."}, {"section_title": "IV. Promotion to Full Professor", "text": "The \"glass ceiling\" argument applies most strongly to jobs further up on job ladders. In academia, this might translate into a reduced opportunity to advance beyond the tenure decision to full professorships. Looking at cross-sectional data, there appear to be large sex differences.

On the other hand, looking at the median length until receipt of full professorship and accounting for right-censoring using Kaplan-Meier estimates, a different story emerges (see Table  1). The median length of time from tenure until full professorship is if anything lower for females. Multivariate hazard-rate estimation confirms the results of the Kaplan-Meier estimates for promotion to full professorship. If one models the length of time between tenure receipt and being promoted to full professorship, the coefficient on \"male\" is actually negative (i.e., men are less likely to be promoted to full professors), but clearly not significantly different from zero. There seems to be no gender difference in the promotion to full professor. However, again, the caveat applies about sample size. Since the sample includes 276 tenured academics of whom only 69 are women, this \"nonfinding\" may be due entirely to lack of power."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "This study has found gender differences in some but not all aspects of the career progression of Ph.D. economists who received their Ph.D.'s in the past two decades. The tenure hurdle seems to be particularly difficult for academic women to overcome. All of the analyses here show large gender differences between men and women in terms of tenure progress. There is some evidence, however, that for more recent co-horts, tenure differences between men and women have narrowed. As additional years of data become available, it will be possible to evaluate this more conclusively. If tenure rates have substantially equalized in the past decade, this should not suggest to universities that they can relax their affirmativeaction efforts. Equalization achieved through active affirmative-action policies is very likely to be reversed if these policies are abandoned. Finally, from the limited observations that we have, both sexes seem to fare equally well in the process of promotion to full professorship. Many interesting questions remain. The \"glass ceiling\" might manifest itself in limited employment and promotion opportunities at the more prestigious academic institutions. In addition, men and women might use interuniversity mobility as a strategy to obtain tenure to a different extent or may benefit from it to different degrees. Both of these issues will be addressed when data on employers are obtained."}]
