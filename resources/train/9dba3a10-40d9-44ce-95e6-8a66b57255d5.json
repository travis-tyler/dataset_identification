[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, increasing attention has focused on the distribution of government payments, especially the share of payments that go to large farms and high-income farm households. Farm commodity program payment limits were first introduced in the Agricultural Act of 1970. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 for the first time supplemented program payment limits with a cap on the income farmers could earn and still receive farm program payments. The 2008 Farm Act tightened payment limitations on some producers and replaced the total adjusted gross income (AGI) limit with separate lower caps for the farm and nonfarm components of AGI. This research uses data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), a survey of farm operator households conducted annually by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, to examine the impact of government payments and changes in payments as a result of changes to farm program policies on income inequality among farm households."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "To estimate the impact of changes in farm program policies, including payment limits and income caps on payment eligibility, on the distribution of government payments.

Evidence from generalized Lorenz and Kernel density plots further illustrate the improvement (worsening) in the distributions of income (government payments) between 1996 and 2008 ( fig. 2 and fig.3). Compared to 1996, a larger share of the top 10 percent of farm households by level of total household income received payments in 2008. These farms received about onethird of payments in 2008 compared to only about one-fourth of total payments in 1996 ( fig. 4). The bottom 10 percent also received slightly higher payments. Results suggest that the relative marginal effect of an increase in government payments would be a slight reduction in farm household income inequality (table 1)."}]
