For example, participants who begin at age 60 may be systematically different from participants who started at age 40 and remain in the study for 20 years. For example, in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) ( 20 ) , all volunteers are healthy at recruitment, whereas the health of participants who have been in the study for some time may have deteriorated over time.

Modeling is necessary to separate cross-sectional and longitudinal changes from this unbalanced data.\nLinear mixed-effects models have been used in many analyses conducted on the BLSA population ( 22 -29 ) .

The resulting data contain 103 observations with a mean of 2.4 repeated observations per participant ( Figure 1 ). Note that we selected participants with at most three visits so that longitudinal patterns of change appear to be linear and hence equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) from Model 1 will best describe these data. Also, participants with at most three visits require a model with only a single random effect in order to provide a satisfactory description of the data. Appendix A provides the SAS code used to fi t all the models. Table 1 compares the results of the fi ts of Model 1 to these data. The FAge and Time effects are statistically different ( p = .018), and both the AIC and BIC suggest that the fi rst age and time version of Model 1 ( equation 2 ) is the most appropriate. The plot ( Figure 1 ) of the fi tted version of Model 1 ( equations 1 and 2 ) clearly shows the differences between the model versions as well as the selection bias present in the data. Women beginning the study at older ages have lower predicted body weights than women who reached that age while already in the cohort. Interestingly, the Time coeffi cient is not statistically signifi cant in the fi rst age and time version ( p = .116), suggesting that there are cross-sectional differences in body weight with age but no statistically signifi cant longitudinal changes over such a short follow-up time. The estimated random effects for the age Model 1 show a downward trend with Age ( p = .028; fi gure not shown), suggesting the possible existence of unaccounted for terms missing from the model. In contrast, the estimated random effects for the fi rst age and time Model 2 (fi gure not shown) are randomly scattered with no correlation ( p = 1.0)."}, {"section_title": "Model 2 Example: Two Random Effects for Modeling Cholesterol Change", "text": "This example considers cholesterol levels (mg/dL) of 202 male participants aged 60 and older who had between two and four visits resulting in 616 observations and an average of 3.0 observations per participant.

The plots ( Figure 2 ) indicate that the longitudinal and cross-sectional changes are different, probably because of selection bias due to the recruitment of healthy volunteers. Again both the AIC and BIC prefer the fi rst age and time model Version 4 to the age model Version 3. In the fi rst age and time model, the FAge term is not statistically signifi cant ( p = .071), suggesting no statistically signifi cant cross-sectional differences but longitudinal declines in cholesterol."}, {"section_title": "Model 3 Example: Higher Order Terms and One Random Effect for Modeling Body Weight", "text": "Often one has data in which only a limited number of repeated measurements exist for each person and there are also defi nite age/time effects.

Here, we include a random intercept as well as the fi xed components given in Model 3 with an additional Age 2 term in Model 5 or additional FAge 2 , Time 2 , and FAge \u00d7 Time terms in Model 6. Although there is not much follow-up time and it is not anticipated that the fi xedeffects Time 2 term will be signifi cant, it is retained in the model to make the fi rst age and time model comparable with the age model. The results of the analysis are provided in Table 3 as well as in Figure 3 . As expected, the Time 2 coeffi cient in Model 6 is not statistically signifi cant ( p = .304); but the FAge 2 and FAge \u00d7 Time coeffi cients are signifi cant ( p < .001 and p = .007, respectively), and the Age 2 coeffi cient in Model 5 is statistically signifi cant ( p < .001).

When equations (7) and ( 8 ) were fi tted in Model 4 (see Table 4 ) the fi tted lines for both equations ( Figure 4 ) are almost indistinguishable, suggesting no selection bias. The AIC prefers the fi rst age and time model, whereas the BIC prefers the age model. In the fi rst age and time model, the FAge 2 term is not statistically signifi cant ( p = .069) and could be eliminated from the model. The estimated random effects are not signifi cantly associated with Age for either model ( p = 1.0, p = 1.0, p = .808, and p = .915), suggesting that, in this case, either model provides a good description of the data (fi gures not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In studying longitudinal data, many researchers fi nd it favorable to use a single term for age in their statistical models, thus exhibiting the effect of age as a continuous curve (eg, see thick broken lines in Figures 1 -4 ) However, this approach makes no distinction between cross-sectional and longitudinal differences. Often these same researchers fi nd objectionable or question a graph such as the thick solid lines in Figures 1 -3 where it appears that persons of the same age have different estimated response values. This approach fails to consider the possibility of a recruitment bias effect which may occur by design (healthy volunteers) or because sick individuals are less likely to be enrolled in a longitudinal study. For example, a healthy person who starts the study at age 40 when evaluated 10 years later may have less favorable risk values than a healthy 50-year-old individual of the same sex. This problem is more likely to be a concern in observational longitudinal studies that recruit individuals over a broad age range and perform relatively long follow-up.\nIn this article, data from observational longitudinal studies are analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models with terms involving entry age and time. Other approaches for analyzing longitudinal data can be used depending on the specifi c question to be addressed. Hierarchical or multilevel models ( 6 , 7 , 34 ) are used to describe time trends in a well-defi ned population with specifi ed, fi xed-time intervals; logistic regression may be used to model the probability of some event occurring in a fi xed follow-up time period as a function of explanatory variables; and the Cox proportional hazards model is used when time to event is of interest ( 34 ) . In addition, other authors have recognized the importance and fl exibility of random effects or mixed-effects models in analyzing longitudinal data. Gueorguieva and Krystal ( 35 ) describe how mixed-effects models have become the preferred choice of analysis for repeated measures data in psychiatric research, whereas Morrell et al. ( 36 ) discuss the importance of variable selection that maintains a hierarchy in the fi xed and random terms in the mixed-effects model.\nIn this article, we have examined the implications of modeling the longitudinal and cross-sectional components in a linear mixed-effects model using either age or fi rst age and time terms. The examples presented show that for observational longitudinal studies covering a broad age span, the fi rst age and time approach is more fl exible and in many cases will provide a better description of the data than using only age terms.
