[2] [3] [4] [5] Amyloid burden on PET scans is associated with neurodegenerative biomarkers [6] [7] [8] , and it can be an early biomarker to detect regional A\u03b2 deposition. While A\u03b2 deposition is considered a hallmark of AD, it must be considered alongside other biomarkers. 9 Another biomarker of AD pathology is longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measures used as a proxy for brain atrophy and neurodegeneration. 9, 10 In a prior investigation in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a stage of AD at which individuals experience cognitive decline that interferes with activities of daily living and could precede dementia stage of AD, had greater volumetric changes over time in whole brain, ventricles, temporal gray matter, orbitofrontal cortex, and hippocampus, as compared to those who remained cognitively normal. 11 Similar findings of greater rates of longitudinal change in association with MCI have been reported in other longitudinal cohorts. 8, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] Greater brain atrophy in MCI, compared with cognitively normal individuals, suggests greater vulnerability to neurodegeneration early in the prodromal phase of AD.\nThe hypothetical temporal ordering of biomarkers suggests that changes in amyloid PET occur prior to changes in brain structure, which are then followed by clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment. 9 The ability to assess amyloid positivity in vivo in cognitively normal individuals provides the opportunity to investigate A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T structural brain changes and presumptive neurodegeneration during the preclinical phase of AD prior to symptom onset. Previous studies have assessed the association of amyloid positivity and brain regional volumetric change, especially in the hippocampus, among cognitively normal individuals. Results to date have been mixed with some findings suggesting steeper declines in hippocampal volumes among those with amyloidosis [16] [17] [18] [19] and other studies finding no such associations [20] [21] [22] [23] . Some studies reporting associations between amyloid positivity and hippocampal volumetric change included visits after the onset of cognitive impairment or dementia, which could contribute to inconsistent findings.\nAdditionally, sex differences in the association of amyloid positivity with volumetric change among older adults who remain cognitively normal are unclear. Sex differences have been observed for volumetric change with males having greater age-related brain volumetric changes 11, 24, 25 and steeper rates of decline in mental status than females 26 , suggesting the possibility that associations with amyloid positivity might be greater in males. Conversely, women with AD pathology show more rapid hippocampal atrophy 27 and cognitive decline 28 in studies of age-related memory changes, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In ADNI, female APOE e4 carriers have more AD pathology and higher risk of developing MCI, as compared to male APOE e4 carriers. 29 Recently, there has been a push to replicate findings of sex differences from ADNI in other studies of aging. 30 In the current study, we examine the association of amyloid positivity with subsequent change in regional brain volumes that are known to be associated with AD pathology early in the disease process. We hypothesize that amyloid positivity is associated with regional volumetric declines, especially in entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus. Additionally, we evaluate sex differences in the association of amyloid positivity with volumetric changes, due to sex differences being reported in brain regional volume changes 11 and cognitive change 26 ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Study Sample", "text": "There were 177 participants from the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) with at least one positron emission tomography (PET) scan using the radiotracer [ 11 C]Pittsburgh"}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "Compound B (PiB) and structural MRIs occurring at the same visit as PiB-PET assessment and thereafter.\nEnrollment procedures are described elsewhere. 31, 32 Briefly, exclusion criteria were the presence or history of central nervous system disease (dementia, stroke, bipolar illness, epilepsy), severe cardiac disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease requiring angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery), severe pulmonary disease, and metastatic cancer at enrollment into the PET neuroimaging substudy. PiB-PET scanning began in 2005. We excluded six participants who had cognitive impairment at baseline. Our analytic sample consisted of 171 participants with 472 total MRI scans, and the mean follow-up time was 3.3 (Standard Deviation,\nThe procedures for determination of cognitive status have been detailed previously. 31 Briefly, cognitive impairment was determined by consensus diagnostic case conferences using DSM-III-R criteria for diagnosis of dementia and the National Institute on Neurological, Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for diagnosis of AD. 33 Mild Cognitive Impairment was determined by Petersen criteria. 34 The local Institutional Review Board approved the research protocol for this study, and written informed consent was obtained at each visit.\nA new automated labeling method specifically designed to achieve a consistent parcellation of brain anatomy in longitudinal MRI studies with scanner and imaging protocol differences was used to harmonize MR data in the BLSA from 1994 to 2017. This method combines the MUSE anatomical labeling approach 35 with harmonized acquisition-specific atlases. 36 The approach is described in more detail in Erus, Doshi, An, Verganelakis, Resnick, Davatzikos 36 . Briefly, using 35 labeled 3-T MPRAGE brain MRIs from the OASIS data set (available for download at https://masi.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/workshop2012) as atlases, we first performed the MUSE labeling method on 3-T MPRAGE images for 32 BLSA participants with 1.5-T SPGR at an earlier time point. Among these participants, the average time interval between 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T MPRAGE images was 4.2 (SD=0.4) years. Then, for each participant, we deformably registered their 1.5-T SPGR image to their 3-T MPRAGE image using a robust registration strategy that combines an ensemble of registrations obtained using two different algorithms and multiple smoothness parameters. From this approach, we obtained 32 pairs of 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T MPRAGE images in the same space with common anatomical labels. These sets were used as atlases in the MUSE approach to obtain labels on the entire collection of 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T MPRAGE images in the BLSA. This workflow for anatomical labeling has been extensively validated on the BLSA MRI data set. 36 \nAdditionally, our main findings for males and females were similar when restricting the observations to 3-T scans.\nhippocampus [44] [45] [46] [47] or there is a greater functional effect in volume loss from entorhinal cortex compared to volume loss in hippocampus 48 . Early volume loss in the entorhinal cortex may cause subsequent atrophy in the hippocampus, as evidenced by work in normal adult rodents. Lazarov, Lee, Peterson, Sisodia 49 found that amyloid precursor protein (APP), a precursor to A\u03b2, in the entorhinal cortex was transported rapidly to the hippocampus, where it cleaved to form APP fragments, which became amyloidogenic, suggesting that entorhinal cortex contributed to AD pathology in the hippocampus via APP transport.\nIn addition to investigation in the overall sample, we evaluated whether there were sex differences in the associations between amyloid positivity and regional volumetric changes. Although women are at higher risk of developing AD than men in part due to greater longevity, findings from previous studies suggest that there is greater age-related decline in specific cognitive domains in older men compared to women. 26, 50 In a previous BLSA study, steeper rates of decline on measures of mental status, perceptuomotor speed and integration, and visuospatial ability were found for males compared to females. 26 More recently, we found that males also had greater rates of normal age-related brain volume decline over time than females. 11 However, it remains possible that women show faster rates of change than men when symptomatic disease is evident. 27 Thus, we investigated whether amyloid positivity had differential effects on brain volume loss in men and women. In the current study, we found a three-way interaction between PiB+/-status, sex and time for selected brain regions. PiB+ males had steeper volumetric declines in fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus than PiB-females. Also, we observed sex differences in the rates of volumetric decline that vary as a function of PiB+/-status.\nOur results differ from those reported in several other investigations which recruit participants specifically into studies of \"memory\" or \"Alzheimer's disease\". As the BLSA is a study of physical and psychological aging, rather than a memory-specific study, it is perhaps less vulnerable to biases associated with recruitment of individuals who have memory-related concerns. Further, the inclusion/exclusion criteria in participant selection into the overall BLSA (for specific criteria, please visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00233272) differ from those of other studies. BLSA participants are recruited into a study of physical and psychological aging, without a focus on memory or cognitive impairment.\nIn comparison to some other studies, there is a lack of enrichment for APOE e4 carriers and participants are free There are several strengths of this study. First, we had a large sample of cognitively normal, older participants with up to 10 serial MRI assessments. Second, we were able to detect three-way interactions among sex, PiB+/-status, and time in brain regions that show evidence of early AD pathology. Additionally, there were several limitations. The BLSA is comprised of a high functioning group of community dwelling older adults with above average education, and therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Also, we cannot make any conclusions about causality, i.e., amyloid driving volume loss, and there could be unmeasured covariates that may explain these relationships. Lastly, the results involving the volumetric decline of the parahippocampal gyrus would be the only ones that would survive multiple comparisons correction. We reported all associations at p<0.05.\nNote: Bolded values indicate significance at p<0.05. * indicates that the three-way interaction among sex, PiB+/-status, and time was significant at p<0.10.

We used the residualized, harmonized volumes of these ROIs, which is the difference between measured harmonized ROI volume and expected harmonized ROI volume given the intracranial volume (ICV) and scanner type. The expected harmonized ROI volume at a given ICV is based on a cross-sectional linear regression model. A single ICV per person was used across all longitudinal visits for stability, and ICV was estimated at age 70, using linear mixed effects models for consistency in\ndefining ICV across the participants. Residualized volumes included a correction factor determined via linear mixed effects modeling to account for any remaining discrepancies in volumes across the two type of MRI scans. 40 The methods for adjustment and harmonization of the volumes were reported in detail in Bilgel, An, Helphrey, Elkins, Gomez, Wong, Davatzikos, Ferrucci, Resnick 40 ."}, {"section_title": "Amyloid PET Image Acquisition and Processing", "text": "PET scans were obtained over 70 minutes (33 frames) on a GE Advance scanner immediately following an intravenous bolus injection of approximately 555 MBq (15 mCi) of 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B.
