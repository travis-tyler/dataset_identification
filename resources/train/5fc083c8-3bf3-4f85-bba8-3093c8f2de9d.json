These regions are used to consistently quantify the associated measure of volume change by the probabilistic integration of the flux of the longitudinal deformations across the boundaries. The presented framework unifies voxel-based and regional approaches, and robustly describes the volume changes at both group-wise and subject-specific level as a spatial process governed by consistently defined regions.

We can broadly identify two main paradigms for the analysis of volume changes in T1 magnetic resonance (MR) images: hypothesisfree and regional analysis. In the first case, the volume changes are modeled at finer scales in the whole brain such as in the voxel/tensor based morphometry and in the cortical thickness analysis [12, 45] .\nOn the one hand these methods are useful for exploratory purposes at the population level, but usually lack robustness for a reliable quantification of the changes at the subject level. On the other hand, regional analyses are focused on the detection of significant changes in regions which are identified thanks to a preliminary segmentation. For instance, the boundary shift integral measures the longitudinal atrophy as a function of the displacement of segmented boundaries [14] . These approaches can provide robust assessment of longitudinal atrophy [25] , but are limited to previously defined regions of interest. Therefore they might fail to detect the complex and spread pattern of changes which is likely to characterize the biological variation. For example the failure in the recent trials on AD to show significant treatment effects on the hippocampal volume changes led to question whether a more general but still powered analysis would be able to detect possible improvements [40] ."}, {"section_title": "Unifying regional and hypothesis free-approaches", "text": "Providing a measure of volume change which can at the same time consistently identify and reliably quantify the volume changes is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the pathological evolution and for providing stable measures for the clinical setting.\nNon-linear registration encodes the morphological changes between pairs of longitudinal MRIs as deformation fields. It was employed both for the whole brain exploratory analysis and for the regional quantification, for instance through the Jacobian determinant analysis [6] . However, the identification of atrophy regions through group-wise voxel-by-voxel analysis of Jacobian determinant maps, like in tensor based morphometry (TBM) [41] , is prone to statistical issues such as multiple comparisons problems. Moreover, the robustness of the regional quantification of the Jacobian is inherently dependent on the accuracy of the underlying anatomical segmentation, and is highly sensitive to numerical biases introduced by the spatial derivatives. For these reasons, tools like TBM are mainly employed in research and found limited applications in the practical clinical routine.\nThe above limitations might be overcome by noticing that the topology of deformation fields implicitly encode the spatial location of relevant atrophy processes, and thus we might not really require the explicit definition of anatomical regions for the Jacobian determinant analysis [10] . The aim of this paper is indeed to develop novel analysis techniques to simultaneously extract and analyze these regional features encoded by the deformations."}, {"section_title": "Helmholtz decomposition of anatomical deformations", "text": "It was proposed in [19] to parametrize the deformations by irrotational and divergence-free components, according to the Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields. If we assume that atrophy is described by the change of volume associated with the deformation, then it is completely identified by the irrotational part of the deformation, while the divergence-free part only accounts for volume preserving (\"locally rigid\") processes which can be interpreted as tissue reorganization. With such a decomposition, the locations of the maximum/minimum irrotational potential define the centers of expanding and contracting regions [23] . These extrema may represent a promising feature for localizing brain atrophy.\nA different measure of volume change associated to the deformation field is the flux across surfaces [8] , which may be seen as the infinitesimal formulation of the boundary shift. However flux-based analysis has been seldom used in morphometric studies, due to the complexity of reliably integrating vector normals on segmentations of the regional boundaries.\nExpanding on the conference article [29] we propose to merge these approaches, leading to the regional flux analysis of deformations, a novel method for reliably discovering and robustly quantifying volume changes based on the Helmholtz decomposition.\nIn Section 2 we introduce the Helmholtz theorem, and the relationship between pressure and flux of deformations. These measures are used in Section 3 to provide a probabilistic formulation for the definition of the group-wise regions involved in the atrophy process. We then apply the proposed framework to the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), to identify and quantify the brain atrophy in three different scenarios: explorative group-wise morphological comparison (Section 4), discovery and quantification of group-wise longitudinal atrophy (Section 5), and robust and statistically powered quantification of hippocampal and ventricular atrophy (Section 6).

More generally, the tangent nature of SVF simplifies the definition of statistical quantities, like the group-wise barycenter [39] or local principal components analysis of variations [44] .\nIn the following sections we show how the SVF framework can be used to define a consistent statistical setting for the group-wise analysis of longitudinal anatomical volume changes."}, {"section_title": "Pressure potential and flux through a region", "text": "The Helmholtz theorem states that a vector field v (which in our case is a SVF) which vanishes at infinity can be uniquely factored as the sum of an irrotational and a divergence free component,\nThe irrotational component \u2207p is the gradient of a scalar pressure (potential) field p, while the divergence-free component is the curl of the vector potential A. Since \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207p = 0, the scalar pressure component encodes the information concerning all the volume change. Please note that the diffeomorphic transformation \u03c6(x, t) = exp(\u2207(tp))(x) is the flow of an irrotational velocity field \u2207p(x) = d\u03c6(x, t)/dt, for every t.

From the divergence theorem, the flux across the boundaries of these regions is flowing either inward or outward. The saddle points for the pressure are on the boundaries of those regions, and identify a change in the flow.\nThe analysis of the critical points of a pressure map can be addressed by the Morse-Smale theory as a topological problem, leading to the representation of incompressible fields as a geometrical complex of regions, boundaries, edges and vertices [34] . Although intriguing, the application of such concepts to medical imaging is still difficult, due to the missing statistical version (and implementation) of the Morse theory. In order to obtain a tractable approach to the problem, we propose in this study to focus on the statistical definition of a consistent subset of critical regions in a sample of observed pressure maps. This way we can robustly describe group-wise irrotational fields as a spatial process governed by key critical regions. In the following section we provide a framework for the statistical definition of these critical regions, and for the quantitative analysis of the associated scalar flux, in order to provide a robust measure of volume changes in anatomical studies."}, {"section_title": "Probabilistic Group-wise Definition of the Critical Regions", "text": "The aim of this section is to provide a statistical definition of the groupwise pressure field associated to a set of observed pressure images\n. We rely on the standard deformation based morphometry setting, in which the anatomies observed in a given population of images\nare represented by the non-linear transformations parameterized by SVFs, \u03d5 i = exp(v i ), obtained by non-linear registration to a reference anatomical template T . According to the Helmholtz decomposition, the group-wise volume changes are encoded in the set of scalar pressure fields {p i } N i=1 asscociated to the SVFs v i . The group-wise pressure field p is unknown and must be inferred from the set\n. In particular we are interested in characterizing the common topological properties among the observed scalar pressures, i.e. in the localization of the group-wise critical points, and of the associated boundaries between critical regions of contraction and expansion. For this reason we cannot simply rely on the standard statistical tests based on the sample mean p avg = 1 N N i=1 p i since its topology might not be representative of the group-wise one. In fact since the scalar pressure fields are integral quantities they might differ by a constant value and cannot be directly compared. Moreover the set of maxima, minima and boundary points of the sample mean can be importantly affected by the presence of outliers, and thus the topology associated to the average pressure field might be biased. For this reason, we propose here to implicitly estimate the group-wise pressure p by relying on simple geometrical assumptions about the spatial distribution of the pressure fields, and on robust statistics of the group-wise divergence maps. This approach avoids the direct identification (and subsequent manual selection) of the critical points associated to the average pressure map, differently from the approach previously proposed in [29] .\nBased on these considerations we provide in this section an alternative definition of the group-wise pressure p by relying on simple geometrical assumptions about the spatial distribution of the pressure fields. We recall from Section 2 that the critical regions of expansion and contraction of p form a binary partition of the whole space that we denote by R + \u222a R \u2212 .\nFor a given location x, we note by N (x) the neighborhood of radius \u03c3 centered in x, and by {p \u03c3 i (x)} the set of pressure fields\ne. the probability of x to belong to R + , given observed group-wise pressure fields in the neighborhood N (x). Since the critical regions define a binary partition of the space we have\nThe critical regions of expansion (resp. contraction) are characterized by strictly positive (resp. negative) divergence, which can be measured by H(\u2206p i (x)) = 1 (resp. H(\u2206p i (x)) = 0), where the Laplacian \u2206p i (x) is the divergence of the irrotational field \u2207p i , and H is the step function: H(j) = 1 if j > 0 and 0 elsewhere.\nThus, we may identify the probability q = p(x \u2208 R + |{p \u03c3 i (x)}) with the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution, and compute the estimateq of q as the sample mean:q\n(1)\nSuch a formulation identifies the critical regions through a robust statistic of the pressure fields, since that it accounts only for the sign of the divergence map, and not for its magnitude). In particular the proposed computation is motivated by the definition of the discrete Laplacian:\nfor specific coefficients w(x), defined for instance by the heat kernel associated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator [4] . Formula (2) shows that the step function H(\u2206p i (y)) evaluates whether the value of p i (y) is extremal in N (y) with respect to the neighbouring voxels, thus providing a quantification of the local topological properties of the pressure field. The quantityq can be generalized to any neighborhood size \u03c3 and weights w(x) to define a coarse Laplacian operator for the detection of critical regions at different resolution levels, similarly to what has been in [36] for the coarse Ricci curvature."}, {"section_title": "Probabilistic Cross-Sectional Comparison of the Critical Regions", "text": "The probabilistic formulation presented in Section 3 enables us to define the group-wise critical regions associated to a given set of observed pressure fields. In this section we extend the proposed model to the comparison between the groupwise critical regions associated to two different sets of pressure fields. We then provide an application to the group-wise comparison of the brain morphology between AD patients and healthy controls.\nGiven two groups of images A = {I A n } and B = {I B m } with the associated set of pressure maps {p A n } and {p B m }, the proposed probabilistic setting provides a straightforward way to compare the associated critical regions. In fact, the differences between the modelled sets of critical regions can be initially evaluated by the difference between the beliefs \u2206Flux\nWe note that by definition \u2206Flux\nHowever, as for the Jacobian analysis in TBM, the above measure is informative about the presence of significant group-wise volume differences only, and it does not provide any information concerning the specificity of the critical regions. In fact volumetric differences can be equally due to the different spatial localization of the critical regions as well as to the same set of critical regions leading to different associated flux.\nFor this reason we are interested in assessing the set of critical regions R + jointly associated to the groups A and B, and the set of critical regions which are specific for a given group.

We observe that the AD patients have increased probability with respect to the healthy controls of showing critical regions of expansion (i.e. apparent volume gain) located generally in the CSF areas and in particular in the ventricles, in the temporal horns of the hippocampi and around the temporal poles. On the other hand, critical regions of contraction (i.e. apparent volume loss) are more likely for the AD patients in the temporal regions, hippocampi, and around the ventricles. The latter result is due to the smoothly construction of the non-linear diffeomorphic registration, which associates to the apparent ventricles expansion a complementary matter contraction in the surrounding regions.

In particular, the probabilistic model of Section 3 is applied in order to discover the critical regions associated to a the longitudinal evolution of a group of AD patients. The resulting regions are then used for the quantification of the longitudinal atrophy in an independent group of AD patients and healthy controls.\nConsider the longitudinal observations from a group of subjects composed of a baseline image I I n 1 . Let T be the population-specific anatomical template estimated as in [17] from the group of baseline images. By non-linearly registering every baseline image I n 0 to T we obtain the correspondent subjectto-template deformation \u03c8 n . In order to perform group-wise statistics of the longitudinal SVF v n in this anatomical reference we use the deformation \u03c8 n to normalize them to the template space.\nIn the context of the flux analysis, several strategies are possible in order to normalize the irrotational component in the group-wise anatomical reference space through the change of coordinate \u03c8 n . A simple normalization strategy consists in the scalar interpolation of the pressure potential in the reference coordinate system to obtain the resampled pressure fieldp n (x) = p n (\u03c8 \u22121 n (x)). However further investigation of the irrotational component associated to the resampled pressure field is required, for instance to assess the invariance of the volume change associated to the resampled regions. One may also take advantage of the mathematical framework of the diffeomorphic registration, in order to parallel transport the longitudinal SVF v n on the reference space T . The parallel transport is a mathematical operation which consists in translating the tangent vector v n along the geodesic defined by the change of coordinates according to the geometrical properties of the manifold of the diffeomorphisms [7] . The parallel transport is however dependent on the geometrical properties of the transformation space, and therefore its implementation is not unique. One may refer to [5, 48, 31] for different parallel transport schemes employed in the context of morphometric analysis. Concerning the proposed application in the context of the flux analysis we ideally require to preserve the flux properties of the parallel transported trajectory v n , or eventually of the parallel transported irrotational component \u2207p n . For instance, volume preserving parallel transport methods are currently under investigation, as proposed in [35] in the LDDMM setting applied to the registration of 2D shapes. In this work the parallel transport is performed by the Pole ladder, a method that was shown to be stable in the context of SVF-based registration [32] , to obtain the normalized trajectory\u1e7d n . In particular, empirical evidence showed that the Pole ladder outperforms other standard transport methods in preserving the local measures of volume changes, and thus the irrotational component, when applied to longitudinal trajectories [32] . In particular, the Pole ladder improves our previous discrete parallel transport methods based on the Schild's ladder by reducing the computational time, along with the potential numerical inaccuracies introduced by the multiple registration involved.\nThe ensemble of SVFs {\u1e7d n } is now defined in the common template reference, and can thus be compared voxel-wise. Let \u2207p n be the irrotational component of\u1e7d n computed as the solution of the Poisson equation.\nThe approach proposed in Section 3 can be applied to the set of longitudinal pressure fields {p n } in order to identify associated group-wise critical regions of volume change. In particular a set of group-wise probabilistic critical regions {T k } can be defined by opportunely thresholding the resulting probabilistic maps. Given a novel subject I, the regions {T k } can be resampled in the subject space thanks to the previously estimated subject-to-template non-linear mapping, and thus they can be used as prior weights for the integration of the subject-specific regional flux."}, {"section_title": "Discovery and Quantification of Longitudinal Atrophy in AD", "text": "Baseline and 1-year follow-up brain scans of 200 healthy controls, 150 MCI, and 142 AD patients from the ADNI dataset were linearly aligned and nonlinearly registered with the LCClog-Demons.

Those 20 AD patients were discarded from the subsequent analysis. Figure 1 shows the associated mean pressure map corresponding to the group-wise longitudinal trajectories. The figure shows that most of the local pressure maxima are located in the ventricels and around the hippocampi, and that these regions are characterized by the lowest divergence values. Interestingly the divergence-free component appears to be highly localized in the temporal poles. This is indicative of a local rotational component detected by the non-linear registration, which might be associated to a process of structural readjustment.\nThe critical regions were estimated in a neighborhood of size \u03c3 = 3 voxels. The whole set {T k } of critical regions was obtained by thresholding the probabilistic map at p > 0.8, and was composed of respectively 44 regions of minimal and 18 of maximal pressure.

The second one (R + h ) is defined similarly for the ventricles from the locations of maximal average divergence in the hippocampal mask ( Figure 9C red) , and encodes the expansion of the temporal horn which is complementary to the hippocampal atrophy ( Figure 9A purple).\nThe subject specific regional longitudinal changes are computed by following the Processing Step 2."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal Atrophy on the ADNI Dataset.", "text": "The presented method was applied to the quantification of the longitudinal hippocampal atrophy in a sample of 96 AD subjects and 160 healthy controls from the ADNI dataset. Images of 0, 12, and 24 months were aligned according to the Step 1 and the longitudinal atrophy was evaluated as in Step 2 to test the following quality criteria:\n\u2022 Consistency with the clinical condition. As indicated by Table 2 the AD group has significantly higher ventricular expansion and hippocampal atrophy for all the considered intervals (p < 0.001, standard t-test). The estimated atrophy rates are consistent with those reported in the literature [15, 42, 24] .\n\u2022 Symmetry. The longitudinal atrophy measure is perfectly symmetric, due to the symmetry of the registration algorithm. Therefore the absolute changes measured from A to B are equal (with opposite sign) to those from B to A.\n\u2022 Linearity over two years. \u2022 Transitivity. Table 3 , second row, shows the compatibility in time of the atrophy measures computed as the error between the measure from A to C and the cumulative one from A to B and B to C. As indicated, the transitivity error is never significantly different from 0, even though it is close to significance for the hippocampal atrophy in AD. We notice that this error is however small relatively to the atrophy rate at 24 months (about 1%).\n\u2022 Sample size analysis. Based on the reported atrophy rates, we estimated the sample size required to detect a 25% difference in the AD longitudinal progression relative to the normal aging (80% power, 0.05 significance). The sample size values listed in table 4 are in line with those reported in the previous studies [24, 42] . We observe that the regional flux analysis in the specific anatomical regions generally provides better results than those obtained from the group-wise longitudinal analysis. This results can be explained by observing that the approach presented in this section is optimised in order to provide subject-specific measures of longitudinal changes."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "In this study we presented the regional flux analysis of deformations, a novel approach to deformation based morphometry which combines the flexibility of TBM-like voxel based approaches with the robustness of ROI based methods for the atrophy quantification.\nWe proposed to decompose the longitudinal trajectories according to the Helmholtz theorem, in order to analyze the atrophy processes through the pressure potential map and the associated flux. This new approach studies the morphological changes as a topological problem, and paves the way to new analysis methods based on graph and complex theory. The proposed work provided precise and statistically powered quantifications of the group-wise regional atrophy processes. Moreover the presented method describes and compares the patterns of dynamic changes between clinical populations, and might thus lead to potentially new anatomical findings, such as differential atrophy trajectories at different disease stages.\nWe showed the potential and the flexibility of the flux analysis in the analysis of the morphological changes in AD across very diverse settings: cross-sectional comparison, longitudinal group-wise analysis, and atrophy quantification on specific regions.\nA central aspect of the regional flux analysis is the reliable identification of the critical points of the pressure field. In this paper we contributed a probabilistic inference algorithm which makes the presented method fully operator independent, contrarily to the manual definition of [29] . Moreover, the proposed framework circumvents the explicit search of extremal points, since it is based on the detection of the critical regions through robust statistics of the group-wise divergence maps. In fact, in our previous experiments we noticed that the local search of pressure extrema can be biased by local noise, and usually leads to the detection of a number of spurious extremal points which are not necessarily informative about the underlying topology of the pressure field.\nOur first implementation of the flux analysis [29] was based on the simple scalar interpolation of the pressure field, which is generally a robust and efficient operation. However, we believe that further investigation of the properties of the associated irrotational field is still required, for instance concerning the resulting volume change of the resampled regions. In this work we opted for the Pole ladder since in previous experiments it provided good results in terms of preservation of the regional volume change, as measured by the average Jacobian determinant of the deformation in specific regions (see [32] for more details). We believe that this is a crucial aspect as the ultimate goal of our study is the quantitative analysis of brain atrophy, even though we cannot exclude potential numerical inaccuracies introduced by the parallel transport operation.\nAs a future perspective, the present work might be extended to the different spatial scales of the atrophy process. Critical regions can be contained in larger zones of pressure extrema, and the global irrotational field is therefore the contribution of several components acting differently across scales. It is therefore of interest to introduce a scale space analysis of the topology of pressure fields in order to disentangle and separately analyze its different components. This issue was addressed in our recent work [30] , in which we proposed a robust framework for the reliable scale-space identification of critical regions associated to irrotational fields of anatomical deformations. The framework was based on the scale-space decomposition of the pressure field through difference of Gaussians. Future extensions of the present study will aim to combine proper scale-space 21 analysis of pressure fields to the robust atrophy quantification.\nThe present study is a step towards the consistent topological analysis of deformations. For example, one can define a tree-like structure of the pressure field, where each level of the tree is a given spatial scale, and the branches connect critical regions which are nested across scales. This way, topology of deformations can be studied with Morse-Smale or graph theory.\nFurther appealing approaches to the topological analysis of the pressure fields are represented by the random field theory which was extensively developed for the analysis of statistical parametric maps [46, 47, 16] , or by the study of the homological properties of the scalar fields as proposed in [9, 37] .\nThe presented work can be also extended to the analysis of sequences of deformations, for instance for detecting anatomical changes in time series of several images. For this purpose, the consistent extension of the presented framework to 5-dimensional data (space+scale+time) is required.\nFinally, thanks to the Helmholtz decomposition of velocity fields, we illustrated for the first time that the evolution of AD is not exclusively associated to volume changes represented by the irrotational component, but is also characterized by a complementary rotational part (Figure 1 ). This component accounts for local matter reorganization associated to the disease progression. We believe that future analysis of the rotational part of the deformation might provide novel and informative insights about the dynamics of morphological changes in AD."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was partially funded by the European Research Council through the ERC Advanced Grant MedYMA, and by the French ANR \"programme blanc\" Karametria number ANR-09-BLAN-0332.\nData collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904).
