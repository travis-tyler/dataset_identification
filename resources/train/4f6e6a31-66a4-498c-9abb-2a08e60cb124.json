Theoretically, ventriculomegaly can be caused by either two different pathophysiological processes: brain atrophy or hydrocephalus. The former is commonly observed in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, often in the advanced stages and sometimes in mild stage [2] [3] [4] . The latter can be due to congenital [5] or adult hydrocephalus [6] , which has more cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in ventricles. In MCI and AD studies, ventriculomegaly is commonly attributed to brain atrophy due to neuronal loss [2] [3] [4] . With the wide use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans in clinical practice, ventriculomegaly has been increasingly observed in cognitively normal individuals, especially in elders. However, the clinical significance of the incidental finding of ventriculomegaly in asymptomatic individuals remains elusive.\nHere, we stratified cognitively normal individuals into two groups, the presence or absence of ventriculomegaly using the Evan's index (EI) 0.30 [7] and investigated the neuropsychological and biomarker characteristics of ventriculomegaly in cognitively asymptomatic subjects."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study sample", "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Until now, the characteristics of neuropsychological and biomarker profiles of ventriculomegaly in cognitively normal elderly individuals and its implication are poorly understood. Our findings have shed light on this issue showing for the first time that cognitively normal individuals with ventriculomegaly shown neuropsychological and multiple biomarker abnormalities that can be identified before clear clinical presentation. EI is an indicator of the enlargement of LVs and traditionally used in the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Idiopathic NPH (iNPH) was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, with a typical clinical triad of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence in the elderly patients who showed the association with the enlargement of the cerebral ventricular system and good response to shunt surgery [19] . Some researchers found that EI more than 0.30 should be indicative of ventriculomegaly [7] . Following this criterion, our demographics data showed that 22.5% of cognitively normal individuals in the selected ADNI cohort had ventriculomegaly. Only gender and age were significantly different between the two groups. Individuals with asymptomatic ventriculomegaly tended to be older (76.0 6 5.6) and of male gender (70.8%). Although ventriculomegaly is common in both AD and NPH, the male predominance has been observed in NPH epidemiological study [20, 21] , whereas gender predominance in AD is uncertain [22, 23] even with female predominance is reported in AD studies [24, 25] . Hence, our findings suggested that male cognitively intact elders with ventriculomegaly concord more with the early spectrum of iNPH although this needs to be confirmed in future longitudinal studies.\nMoCA, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and Clock Drawing scores reflect global cognitive function. The scores in these scales all suggested that the subjects with ventriculomegaly had consistently worse cognitive functions compared to those without ventriculomegaly although they were still cogni-tively normal. This finding is consistent with the scores of Logical Memory Test and Rey AVLT. Furthermore, the scores of ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF also supported the framework that memory and executive function domains of individuals with asymptomatic ventriculomegaly were impaired although they remained clinically cognitively normal. Hence, subclinical memory and executive dysfunction may be the earliest neuropsychological impairments, which characterize asymptomatic ventriculomegaly.\nThe structural volume differences in our study showed certain characteristics that were unique for asymptomatic ventriculomegaly. The hippocampal gyrus volume and the volumes of the CC were significantly smaller in the individuals with asymptomatic ventriculomegaly than individuals without ventriculomegaly. Atrophy of these structures is regarded as a typical finding in AD. However, our findings showed that the gray matter volumes in ventriculomegaly group were significantly larger. As the increased ventricular volume in AD is commonly caused by the loss of brain tissue or brain atrophy [26, 27] , this enlargement of gray matter makes brain atrophy as the underlying cause for ventriculomegaly in cognitively normal individuals less likely. In this study, we also found some unique phenomena such as smaller middle part of CC, posterior cingulate gyrus and entorhinal gyrus without significant difference, and the larger anterior cingulate volume, while they are uncommon in early AD, where the most involved part of CC should be the anterior [28] or posterior/splenium region [29, 30, 31] , the posterior cingulate gyrus and entorhinal gyrus [32, 33] are often involved and the anterior cingulate volume is often unaffected [27] . In addition, we observed that the bilateral caudate, paracentral gyrus, and isthmus cingulate volumes were also larger in these individuals. These features, at least, make the manifestation unlike typical AD. As these enlarged brain structures were located near the LVs: caudate is medial to the LV; paracentral gyrus is superior and medial to the LV; and isthmus cingulate is medial to LV, we speculate that the enlargement of these structures may be caused by increase of water content or some kind of compensation mechanism, rather than brain atrophy [34, 35] . Nevertheless, the decreased hippocampal volume is not consistent with our speculation as this structure is also near the LV though atrophy of hippocampus has been observed in NPH [36] . We suppose that this can be due to the position of this structure, which is inferior and medial to the LV, while the previously described brain structures with increased volumes are superior and medial to the LV. Perhaps, the decreased hippocampal volume is still an indicator of AD. As such, this finding of disproportionately changed brain structure volumes may further characterize the asymptomatic ventriculomegaly framework.\nIn iNPH, the disproportionate enlargement of subarachnoid space (DESH) was observed by Hajime in 1998 and was proposed as a preclinical state of iNPH in an epidemiological study [37] . Both the convexity and the medial subarachnoid spaces were significantly smaller in most of the patients with iNPH than those with AD while the sylvian fissure was larger in iNPH than in AD [38] . However, the underlying pathophysiology of DESH is unknown. Our finding of a disproportionate enlargement of the brain structures is consistent with the proposed framework of DESH. Essentially, brain regions with enlarged subarachnoid space in NPH have structures with decreased volumes (hippocampus), and brain regions with decreased area (tight convexity) have structures with increased volume (paracentral gyrus and caudate). Significantly larger inferior LVs and choroid plexus may also suggest NPH tendency, and the enlargement of inferior LVs may exert pressure on the medial part of temporal lobe, resulting in the decreased hippocampal volume. The enlargement of LVs can also exert pressure on the CC, which results in the reduction of the volume of CC, a common MRI finding in iNPH [39] . As iNPH has been reported frequently in comorbidity with AD [40] [41] [42] , our NPH-like structural findings further support our claim that these individuals with asymptomatic ventriculomegaly may be an early signature of AD and/or preclinical spectrum of iNPH.\nThe caudate plays a key role in supporting the planning and execution of behavior needed to achieve complex goals [43] . In preclinical familial AD studies, the volumes of the both caudates have been shown to be decreased [44] . Therefore, our finding of the enlargement of bilateral caudates cannot be explained by the AD pathophysiology. However, this finding cannot be completely explained by NPH pathophysiology, either, as one NPH study has reported smaller caudate volume in NPH compared with normal control [45] . Hence, while we propose that the disproportionate enlargement of brain structural volumes characterizes asymptomatic ventriculomegaly, future longitudinal studies are needed to test this hypothesis and further elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of this observed phenomenon.\nWe found that the [ 18 F]FDG SUVR was decreased in the bilateral angular gyri and posterior cingulate gyri of the individuals with asymptomatic ventriculomegaly compared to those without ventriculomegaly. As hypometabolism in posterior cingulate was reported to be obvious [46] , this metabolic signature indicates that this population with ven-triculomegaly has some features of AD. However, there was no significant difference in [ 18 F]FDG SUVR in temporal gyrus between the two groups. It has been reported that medial temporal regions were also often affected in AD [47] . The decreased [ 18 F]FDG uptake in both the angular and posterior cingulate regions, not in the temporal area, in the group with ventriculomegaly made this biomarker profile look unlike typical AD.\nWe also found that [ 18 F]florbetapir SUVR was increased in the neocortex (frontal and parietal), and the CSF Ab 1-42 level was decreased in the individuals with asymptomatic ventriculomegaly compared to those without ventriculomegaly. This finding is consistent with the Ab biomarker signature of AD [16] . Taking CSF Ab 1-42 192 pg/mL as a cutoff value for having AD risk [15] , asymptomatic ventriculomegaly group had higher risk of AD according to the recent definition of asymptomatic at AD risk [48] . CSF biomarker changes are evident over two decades before the individual's expected age at symptom onset, as determined by their parental age at onset [49] . Reduced concentrations of CSF Ab 1-42 and increased concentrations of CSF tau were detected at 25 and 15 years from the expected symptom onset, respectively. However, there was no significant difference in the [ 18 F]florbetapir SUVR in cingulate and temporal areas between the groups in our study, which is not consistent with the typical AD feature [50, 51] . CSF t-tau and p-tau had no significant difference either. Unsurprisingly, this phenomenon can be found in AD as decrease of Ab in CSF can happen earlier than increased level of tau. Meanwhile, this feature is also in concordance with iNPH as total secreted amyloid precursor protein (APP), soluble APP a and Ab have been shown to decrease in the CSF of NPH patients without change of t-tau or p-tau [52] . Therefore, Ab and tau biomarker features of asymptomatic ventriculomegaly could be early AD or preclinical NPH spectrum.\nAltogether, asymptomatic individuals with ventriculomegaly are ostensibly cognitively normal, however, they have worse memory and execution compared with those with normal ventricles, therefore, special attention should be paid to these individuals. This study showed that asymptomatic individuals with ventriculomegaly have smaller hippocampal volumes, less FDG uptake, more Ab deposition in the neocortex, and less CSF Ab 1-42 level, which are characteristics of preclinical AD [16] . However, relatively bigger posterior cingulate gyrus and uninvolved entorhinal gyrus are not supportive of preclinical AD. Besides these, interestingly, it has also been found that these specific individuals have bigger volumes of gray matter, paracentral gyrus, and caudate with unchanged CSF tau levels. The pattern of MRI structural volumes implies the disproportionate change of brain structures, which concords with DESH feature of iNPH. Some researchers suggest that less CSF Ab 1-42 level and unchanged CSF tau levels may be features of iNPH [52] . Therefore, cognitively normal individuals with ventriculomegaly may constitute a unique group of people. Here, we just reported this interesting finding. There is limitation in this study. The self-selected group of participants in the ADNI limits the generalizability of our results. The follow-up is not long enough. Our findings will require further validation in a larger population-based longitudinal study and a longer follow-up. Furthermore, future work should be carried out to answer questions such as \"what triggers this phenomenon?\", \"what is the underlying pathophysiologic process?\", \"How about the prognosis?\", and \"Are there interacting mechanisms between AD and NPH?\""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Ventriculomegaly is common among cognitively normal individuals. The characterization of the neuropsychological and biomarker profiles in these individuals implies that it may be an early imaging signature of preclinical AD and/ or have comorbidity of iNPH and more research should be performed."}]
