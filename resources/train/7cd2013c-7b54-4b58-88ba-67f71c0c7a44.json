[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: APOE 4 and sex have been linked to increased risk for conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between APOE 4 gene dose, sex, and AD biomarkers remains understudied. Objective: To investigate the effect of APOE 4 dose on AD biomarkers in a sample of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to examine whether APOE 4 dose modifies AD risk differently in MCI women and men. Methods: We examined cross-sectional AD biomarkers for participants with MCI (n = 930, 55-96 years old) from three large aging cohorts. Region of interest MRI volumes, global cognition, and episodic memory were analyzed by number of APOE 4 alleles and stratified by sex. Results: Across all participants, number of APOE 4 alleles was associated with smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes and poorer cognition. When stratified by sex, women showed an APOE 4 dose effect for bilateral hippocampal and left amygdala volumes and cognition. In contrast, men showed an APOE 4 dose effect for hippocampal volumes with a trend in amygdala, but cognition did not differ between men with 1 and 2 APOE 4 alleles. Women with 2 APOE 4 alleles had poorer memory between 65-69 and poorer global cognition between 70-74 compared to men with 2 APOE 4 alleles. # Last authorship.\nConclusion: APOE 4 confers a dose effect on AD biomarkers in patients with MCI, and the number of APOE 4 alleles has a greater detrimental impact in women than men, which may be specific to a critical time window."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Currently, there are no effective treatments for AD, creating a critical public health concern [1]. Because it is likely that effective therapies will require early intervention, understanding the role of AD risk factors, such as apolipoprotein E 4 (APOE 4) and sex, is critical for identifying individuals who are at greatest risk [2] .\nThe greatest known genetic risk factor for lateonset sporadic AD is the APOE 4 allele [3] . APOE 4 is more prevalent in people with AD compared to cognitively normal individuals [4, 5] , and extensive research has demonstrated that relative to APOE 3, APOE 4 significantly increases the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [6] and AD [7, 8] . One APOE 4 allele increases risk by 2-to 3-fold, and 2 alleles increase risk by 10-fold [5, 9] . While a number of studies have shown that AD risk increases as the number of APOE 4 alleles increases [5, 10] , few have examined the effect of APOE 4 dose on specific biomarkers for AD. Evidence for an APOE 4 dose effect on cognitive and MRI biomarkers is needed.\nFemale sex is another major risk factor for AD [11] . Studies that have examined the interaction between APOE 4 and sex suggest that women may be more adversely affected. Indeed, 1 APOE 4 allele has been shown to increase lifetime AD risk in women, whereas 2 APOE 4 alleles increased lifetime risk in men [5] . Similar APOE 4 by sex effects have been observed for hippocampal volumes [12] . A recent meta-analysis of approximately 58,000 subjects reported a critical time window starting at 65 years old in which women with APOE 4 are at greater risk of conversion than men with APOE 4 [13] . Another recent paper examined the longitudinal differences between men and women and the effect of APOE 4 status across the AD spectrum on hippocampal volume, cognition, and association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of tau and amyloid [14] . The findings from this study suggest pronounced sex differences exist within the MCI stage, motivating additional explicit examination of this phase of disease progression.\nIn the present study, we examined the effects of APOE 4, sex, and their interaction on MRI brain volumes and cognition in a sample of older adults with MCI [15] via within-sex and between-sex analyses."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "De-identified and coded data from 930 participants with MCI between 55-96 years old were acquired with permission from three aging cohorts: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Study (AIBL). This study was approved by our local institutional review board as non-human subjects research. Subjects with a baseline diagnosis of MCI with a probable etiology of AD were included. APOE 4 carriers who may have conferred protection from AD [16] were excluded from the analysis to include only those who were APOE 3/3, APOE 3/4, and APOE 4/4. Participants with no available diagnosis, genetic information for APOE, imaging and cognitive data, less than 6 years of education, or possible co-enrollment across cohorts were excluded.

AIBL is an ADNI collaborative study established in the Australian cities Melbourne and Perth in 2006 in order to assemble a cohort of individuals who could be assessed at regular intervals for AD [18] . NACC was established by the National Institute on Aging in 1999 to sup-port collaborative research in AD from participants at 34 past and present NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs) [19] .\nAll three cohorts collect imaging, genetics, cognitive, and biological biomarker data, and evaluate enrolled participants approximately every 12-18 months with a comprehensive cognitive battery and clinical assessment.

NACC aggregates data from multiple ADCs, and diagnoses are made either by a physician or by a consensus committee, according to each ADC's protocol.

In the present study, we showed an association between number of APOE 4 alleles and the AD biomarkers for hippocampal and amygdala volume and cognition in older adults with MCI, providing insight into those at risk for AD. Importantly, we demonstrated that the effect of APOE 4 dose on cognition differs by sex and preliminary, exploratory analyses suggest that cognitive differences for women compared to men exist between 65-69 for episodic memory and between 70-74 for global cognition. While APOE 4 dose is associated with smaller hippocampal volume in both sexes, 2 APOE 4 alleles may have a greater impact on cognition in women than in men.\nAcross all participants, those with 2 APOE 4 alleles were significantly younger than those with 1 APOE 4 allele who were younger than those with 0 APOE 4 alleles, suggesting that APOE 4 may shift risk of AD earlier. However, this effect was modified by sex, showing men with 2 APOE 4 alleles were younger than men with 0 or 1 APOE 4 allele, while women with 1 or 2 APOE 4 alleles were significantly younger than women with 0 APOE 4 alleles.\nPrevious research has demonstrated an APOE 4 dose effect of increased AD risk and undesirable changes to a variety of AD biomarkers in participants with MCI. APOE 4 carriers with MCI are at increased risk of converting to AD [30] , have poorer cognitive function [12, 31, 32] , smaller hippocampal volumes [12, 31, 33, 34] , lower CSF amyloid-\u2424, higher CSF hyperphosphorylated tau [35] and higher total tau [14] . Our study expands this work to examine how APOE 4 dose and sex modify risk based on AD biomarkers.\nOur general finding of a significant APOE 4 dose effect on hippocampal and amygdala volumes in this sample of individuals with MCI suggests that each APOE 4 allele has a measurable effect on regional brain structure. While not all studies have found this [36] , our result is supported by previous research which found reduced hippocampal volume [33] and cognition [31] with each APOE 4 allele and reduced amygdala volume for APOE 4 carriers versus non-carriers [36, 37] in individuals with MCI. Furthermore, our results show that, while there was a significant APOE 4 dose effect on hippocampal and amygdala volume for both men and women, Fig. 5 . Predicted values for cross-sectional data of Global Cognition and Episodic Memory by APOE 4 allele and sex. Predicted values generated from cross-sectional data for global cognition (MMSE, A) and episodic memory (Logical Memory Immediate, B and Delayed Recall, C), separately for men and women. Lines represent intercept and slope of predicted values over the lifespan, grouped by number of APOE 4 alleles. Women with 2 APOE 4 alleles performed worse than men with 2 APOE 4 alleles on delayed memory (65-69 years, p = 0.042) and MMSE (70-74 years, p = 0.002) at specific 5-year age bins. the same was not true for cognition. In our analysis of cognitive performance, women had worse performance with each APOE 4 allele, while men with 1 and 2 APOE 4 alleles did not differ, suggesting a differential impact of APOE 4 allele between the sexes on cognition. Importantly, at 1 and 2 APOE 4 alleles performance on delayed memory was significantly worse for women than men, even though women were also significantly younger.\nTo date, the effects of APOE 4 dose on brain structure and cognition, two important AD biomarkers, have not been demonstrated conclusively in women and men. The research predominantly informing current views on the interaction between APOE 4 and sex reports differences in AD risk. These studies reported that APOE 4 confers greater AD risk to women than men. Specifically, it has been reported in a number of studies that one copy of the 4 allele is sufficient to increase AD risk in women, whereas two copies but not one, increase risk in men [5, 7, 9, 38, 39] . A similar finding was demonstrated by Fleisher et al., who reported an APOE 4 by sex interaction in the hippocampal volume of MCI subjects [12] . Recent studies reported that women with higher amyloid burden were at greater risk of cognitive decline than men and that this effect was even stronger in women who were APOE 4 carriers [14, 40] . Additionally, women who were APOE 4 carriers had greater tau burden than men who were APOE 4 carriers [14] , especially in those who had significant amyloid burden [41] . New genetic targets associated with amyloid and tau pathology have been implicated in women's risk for AD, suggesting that the sex differences may extend beyond APOE 4 [42] .\nWhile previous research suggests that APOE 4 relates to AD risk differently for women and men, a recent meta-analysis by our group reported that women and men had nearly the same risk of developing MCI or AD between 55-85 years of age [13] . However, a critical period of risk for APOE 4 women to convert to MCI was found between 55-70 years of age whereas APOE 4 women to convert to AD were at elevated risk between 65-75 years of age. This study, which aggregated data for nearly 58,000 participants, suggests that the sex-specific effect of APOE 4 may not differ, but that sex differences are evident at critical time periods. Although preliminary and exploratory in nature, the trends in our current findings support this critical period in women with 2 APOE 4 alleles compared to men with 2 APOE 4 alleles between 65-69 years of age in delayed memory performance. Additionally, this same relationship was identified for global cognition, but for those 5 years older, between 70-74 years of age, positing a temporal relationship of differences in memory preceding differences in global cognition, although this cannot be directly assessed in our cross-sectional analysis.\nPotential mechanistic explanations for the consistent sex and APOE 4 differences may be related to hormonal changes experienced by women during menopause, which has cascading effects in the subsequent aging process. Higher levels of estradiol are associated with better cognitive performance [43] and estrogen has been shown to reduce vulnerability to cell death in the hippocampus in the presence of amyloid-\u2424 [44] , which may be exacerbated in APOE 4 carriers because of higher amyloid-\u2424 burden [45, 46] .\nA primary strength of our study is the direct, intentional analysis of sex differences in AD by utilizing large, retrospective datasets to examine subtle and understudied effects. Obtaining and harmonizing large datasets to increase the sample of participants with 2 APOE 4 alleles was a necessary task to examine APOE 4 dose effects stratified by sex and age, although the study was underpowered for multiple comparison correction likely due to subtle sex and APOE 4 dose effects. However, there are limitations to conducting retrospective analyses. Many aging cohorts have only a limited number of cognitive tests available for analysis. There is some variability in how MCI is defined (see Supplementary Materials) . Other risk factors that may differ between women and men, such as smoking, alcohol use, and cardiovascular disease [47] , were not available in all the datasets and therefore, not included in our models. Other sex-specific considerations may also be contributing to this, such higher rates of mortality due to cardiovascular disease and stroke in men that might lead to a surviving population of older adult men who are healthier than their female counterparts [48] . Additionally, ascertainment bias poses several problems for population-based studies. For example, our cohort is enriched for APOE 4 carriers beyond what is observed in the general population. Individuals with a family history of AD may be more likely to participate [49] , and importantly, these studies may oversample healthier individuals due to the difficulty for sick participants to participate in follow up data collection [50] . Lastly, the combination of 1.5T and 3T MRI scans is less favorable than MRI scans from the same scanner and/or MRI field strength.\nOur findings, taken together with previous literature, support the hypothesis that detrimental effects conferred by APOE 4 are dose-dependent and sexspecific in the MCI stage. While the importance of APOE 4 is key to understanding AD risk, sex as a biological factor may additionally modify level of risk at critical time periods."}]
