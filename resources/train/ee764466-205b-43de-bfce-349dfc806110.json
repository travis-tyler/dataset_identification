[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Growing consensus shows that obesity is a systems-level problem and that solutions can come only from approaches that involve the integrated actions of multiple stakeholders (55) within a comprehensive framework that is rooted in the social ecological model (60,83). Governments, through their ability to set, implement, and monitor policies, have an important role in addressing the obesity epidemic, and many local, state, and nationwide policies and practices are designed to control further increases in the prevalence of obesity. In the United States, the Healthy People 2020 goals set a target of reducing the prevalence of obesity by 10% from 2005-2008 levels, among both adults and youth aged 2-19 years; these goals are among the Leading Health Indicators (LHI) for the nation (52). In addition, several Healthy People 2020 objectives target nutrition and physical activity behaviors or environments that are associated with obesity. Other policy and environmental measures to prevent obesity include initiatives such as the development of national guidelines for physical activity and foods in schools and early care and education (ECE) centers; recommendations for nutrition labeling; federal efforts to increase access to and financing for fresh fruits and vegetables; and changes in the built environment to accommodate increases in walking and bicycling (60). Evaluating the effectiveness of population-wide initiatives requires data systems that are timely and actionable and include both behavioral and environmental determinants as well as reliable measures of obesity. The importance of these strategies as part of an overall surveillance system was emphasized in the Health and Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) reports Progress in Preventing Childhood Obesity: How Do We Measure Up? (65) and Evaluating Obesity Prevention Efforts: A Plan for Measuring Progress (EPOP) (58). The EPOP report, in particular, stresses the importance of a national plan that includes a coordinated system with designated leadership and resources to prioritize, implement, and oversee the surveillance process; identification of data sources; harmonization of existing data and surveillance systems; and effective presentation of data to end users (58). Routinely collected surveillance data are also emphasized as an important source of evidence and external validity in the HMD's Locate Evidence, Evaluate It, Assemble It, and Inform Decisions (L.E.A.D.) Framework, which has been proposed to bridge the evidence gap in the context of evaluating environmental and policy measures targeting obesity (57,67). More recently, the HMD report Assessing Prevalence and Trends in Obesity: Navigating the Evidence (74) identifies challenges in collecting data and assessing trends, with a framework to address the goals of the end user. Despite the importance of obesity surveillance in directing prevention efforts, few reviews have investigated the potential for strengthening existing surveillance systems. The objectives of this review are to (a) describe the current goals and structures of existing surveillance systems in the United States; (b) examine current international trends in obesity surveillance; (c) present examples of data that evaluate population-based obesity initiatives; and (d ) review current opportunities for improving surveillance methods."}, {"section_title": "FRAMEWORK FOR OBESITY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM EFFORTS", "text": "Models for the evaluation of obesity prevention efforts (58,65) emphasize a systems-level approach, in which various sectors such as government, industry, health care, communities, worksites, schools/ECE centers, and homes are targeted for obesity initiatives. Ultimate impacts include improvement of population-level health and health equity through the reduction of overweight and obesity prevalence and/or decreased incidence. Antecedents to overweight and obesity include behavioral outcomes related to energy balance such as diet, physical activity, and other individual BMI: body mass index obesity-related behaviors as well as psychosocial factors. In addition to individual factors, these evaluation frameworks (58,65) focus on the assessment of upstream determinants, such as the environments, institutions, systems, and policies that influence more proximal outcomes, which are the focus of recent obesity prevention efforts (60). The HMD's 2012 Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention (APOP) report, for example, targets five specific goals to advance progress in obesity prevention by addressing messaging, food and beverage, physical activity, school, and worksite/health care environments (60). Implementation of interventions at the systems or policy level can have broad population impact and is consistent with the focus on population health (58,60,63). Shifting obesity prevention efforts toward broad environmental targets presents both opportunities and challenges. First, the relations between these environments and individual outcomes have historically been difficult to determine, and they rely on robust surveillance or study designs that can establish causality. Recent strides in the development and evaluation of environmental assessment tools have increased both the precision and the utility of these instruments for research and surveillance (44). Effective evaluation of environmental or policy interventions requires ongoing assessment of adoption and implementation as well as periodic surveillance of individual-level data over the life of the intervention using prospective study designs (91). Assessment of environmental factors that influence obesity-related outcomes can also highlight health equity issues that may be obscured when focusing on individual factors alone. Finally, although many current prevention efforts focus on policy, systems, and environmental interventions, most surveillance is conducted at the individual level (58)."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT OBESITY SURVEILLANCE DATA SOURCES AND SYSTEMS", "text": "Surveillance, defined as \"the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data tracked over time to detect patterns, disparities and changes that may be associated with interventions or other causes\" (58, pp. 2, 19), refers to data collected from populations over two or more points in time. The term surveillance has traditionally meant assessment, i.e., characterizing the scale and distribution of a problem, but the term is increasingly used to refer to an overall decision-making cycle that includes collection, review, and use of the data to make appropriate changes in policy or programmatic efforts (58,96,101). In general, most existing obesity surveillance systems in the United States use data to monitor trends in populations and collect a limited number of anthropometric measures, such as height and weight data used for calculating body mass index (BMI). Data on behavioral antecedents of obesity, such as diet and physical activity, may come from the same surveys or other national data sets. Behavioral measures often tend to be self-reported, although some surveys use objective measures such as accelerometry to assess physical activity. High-risk populations, e.g., demographic or health status subgroups, are often not adequately represented in national or state-level surveys (58). Most surveillance does not include the measurement of policy or environmental factors, although recent efforts have been made to include some of the contextual factors that may influence obesity (58). Because the behavioral and environmental determinants of obesity can be varied, relevant assessments involve surveys from other sectors or disciplines that can be difficult for health researchers to access."}, {"section_title": "Surveillance of Obesity Prevalence and Individual-Level Risk Factors", "text": "Several surveillance systems with differing purposes and types of data support monitoring of obesity and related risk factors at the individual level ( Table 1). Data from many of these surveys serve as benchmarks for Healthy People 2020 goals (49). A more complete listing of surveillance systems in the United States can be found in the EPOP report (58) or through the searchable  (73). Several of the most common surveys are described below. National-level surveillance. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is overseen by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides the most comprehensive individual-level data on obesity and related behaviors (58). The NHANES is a series of national-level cross-sectional surveys that have been administered at irregular intervals since the 1960s and on a rolling basis since 1999, with data released in two-year increments. The current NHANES survey includes all ages, from infants 2 months of age to adults. Obesity data from the NHANES are based on measured height and weights and provide benchmarks for current trends for adults (ages 20 years and above), children (ages 2-19 years), and infants/toddlers (<2 years). However, the sample weighting scheme allows only an estimation of BMI across broad age, gender, and racial/ethnic categories. For example, the NHANES divides children into age categories of 0-2, 2-5, 6-11, and 12-19, which do not correspond to child developmental levels and thus limit the use of these data in evaluating intervention strategies. In addition to collecting height and weight data, the NHANES collects detailed dietary and physical activity behaviors as well as other biologic information (27). The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) is one of the few nationally representative cohort data sets with information on child BMI obtained from measured height and weight. The program includes three separate longitudinal studies, one from birth to kindergarten, one from kindergarten to eighth grade, and one from kindergarten through fifth grade. ECLS data have been used to examine BMI trajectories (37), as well as individual obesity-related risk factors such as self-reported dietary intake, physical activity, and screen time (30). The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) also collected data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States over 4 measurement waves from 1994-1995 through 2008-2009, i.e., from adolescence (ages 12-20) through the transition to adulthood (ages 24-32) (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth). In addition to repeat measures of height, weight, diet, physical activity, and use of health care services, the Add Health data set is longitudinally geocoded, allowing investigators to assess responses to local obesity environment and policy effects (77). State-level surveillance. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System (YRBSS) provide national-and state-level survey data and are conducted by the CDC (19). The BRFSS survey is administered annually to \u223c500,000 adults (ages \u226518) over the telephone and includes self-reported height and weight data as well as behavioral measures. All states and US territories are included in the survey, and statistical weights are provided to allow estimates of obesity prevalence at the state level. BRFSS data also provide data by selected metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) (25). BRFSS data have been used to plot state trends in obesity prevalence; in fact, the Obesity Trend Maps using BRFSS data were among the most powerful tools used to identify the rapid increase in obesity among the states (Figure 1). Because the BRFSS allows estimates to be generated at the state level and is conducted continuously, these data are useful in identifying population trends and effects of any statewide initiatives (58). However, self-reported BRFSS data are subject to bias. For example, the national adult obesity prevalence estimates from the NHANES are often higher than those reported for the BRFSS (34.9% in NHANES 2011-2012 versus 28.1% in BRFSS 2012) (19,80 ninth-through twelfth-grade students and allow for stratification by race/ethnicity and gender (26). As with the BRFSS, the YRBSS data allow investigators to estimate state-level prevalence rates for most states and some large urban districts. The National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) (6) includes parent-reported height and weight data on children aged 0-17 years at national, regional, and state levels. Data were collected at three different time points from 2003 to 2012, but annual data collections are planned from 2016 onward (see http://childhealthdata.org/learn/NSCH). The validity of parent-reported data varies depending on the age of the child and race/ethnicity (46,47) but may be improved if parents are asked to measure their children at home before providing height and weight data (56). Local-or regional-level surveillance. Because most national data sets are of limited utility in evaluating initiatives at local levels, several local surveillance systems have emerged. Schoolbased surveillance systems, which typically span entire states, offer several advantages. Because a majority of US children attend schools, most children can be reached through this setting; obesity measurements can be incorporated into other school-based screenings; and school-level obesity data can be used to evaluate specific school-based policy changes and programs, as well as to identify subgroups at greatest risk of obesity (69,78,79). BMI data are often collected as part of an overall physical fitness assessment, such as FITNESSGRAM R (109); however, data from physical fitness assessments can be more variable and subject to error compared with standard surveillance measures (62). Often, school-based assessments provide population data, as well as individual screening, i.e., notifying parents if their children are overweight or obese. Screening at school can be problematic, though, because of parent confusion about BMI categories and the lack of community resources for referrals (78). To date, legislation mandating some form of BMI surveillance and/or screening programs has passed in 25 US states (86), although not all of these states have an active school-based surveillance program: A recent study found that only 14 states collect BMI data that can be used for public health surveillance, and 13 of those programs are school-based (5). Concerns about privacy, stigmatization, and the possibility of dysfunctional behavioral responses such as eating disorders have been raised about school-level BMI surveillance, and schools are increasingly sensitive to these concerns (70). Health systems data. The use of electronic health record (EHR) data for monitoring of population health, clinical research, and improved patient care has accelerated owing to the meaningful use initiative in the United States (7). Data sharing across multiple institutions for child obesity surveillance is feasible and produces data similar to that obtained in national surveys (3). In adults, weight data obtained through EHRs has been highly correlated with data obtained from trained research staff (1). One example of the utility of EHRs is the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient health care database in the United States (48), which includes individuals covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance, as well as those who are uninsured. Although findings from such special-purpose data sets are not generalizable to the general population, the populations they represent are often at-risk; therefore, these data sets can be a way to study health disparities."}, {"section_title": "Surveillance of Obesity Environments and Policy", "text": "Within the past 10 years, research on environmental determinants of obesity has accelerated, largely owing to the growing evidence connecting these factors, including policy, to obesity outcomes (60), as well as to the recognition that a healthy weight and related behaviors are difficult to sustain in current food and physical activity environments that promote energy imbalances (34,39,60,90,98)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental and Policy Measures", "text": "Assessing environments can be difficult and presents numerous methodological challenges, owing to the broad reach and the diffuse and confounding nature of multiple influences and levels in real-world settings (90). Evaluation of policies related to obesity prevention should include measures of adoption and implementation, as well as prospective study designs (72,91). Several recently developed measures provide valid and quantifiable data for the environment ( Table 2). These measures include, among others, policy analyses collected by Bridging the Gap (34); the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey (NEMS), which provide observations and quantifications of food availability at restaurants, stores, and vending machines (45; http://www.med.upenn.edu/nems/measures.shtml); school and ECE policy measures (WellSAT and WellCCAT) (41; http://www.wellsat.org/); and the environment and policy assessment and observation (EPAO) designed for ECE centers (108), as well as observations of the built environment or neighborhoods using geographic information systems (GIS). Active Living Research (http://activelivingresearch.org/) and Healthy Eating Research (http://healthyeatingresearch.org/) both provide links to environmental measures for physical activity and nutrition, respectively, as well as relevant research in these areas (89). The NCCOR measures registry also provides listings of measures for the food and physical activity environment, with a focus on child obesity (73)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental and Policy Surveillance", "text": "In 2013, the EPOP report provided a list of 83 indicators derived from current surveillance systems and databases, which can be used to evaluate obesity prevention efforts (58). Notably, this list of indicators emphasizes contextual measures, which comprise environmental, policy, and settingspecific indicators. Because of the relatively recent focus on environmental determinants of health as obesity intervention targets, few surveillance systems have been developed specifically for this purpose. Some of the most comprehensive measures of environment and policy are at the school level, likely owing to the established public school infrastructure and federal regulations regarding food and physical activity. The School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS), conducted by the CDC, evaluates school health and environment in a nationally representative sample of schools at all levels (elementary, middle, high school) (17). Also conducted at a national level, the School Nutrition Dietary Assessment (SNDA) study assesses the implementation of the federal school meal standards, as well as other related food policies and programs (102). The Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (CLASS) survey collects data about laws regarding school nutrition and physical activity environments at the state level (see http://class.cancer.gov/). These data are then compared with national standards, and a state profile tool allows end users to view the strength of school laws relative to these standards. Other national surveillance systems collect data that examine active transport and/or the built environment and track obesity-related policies, policies and practices for infants and preschool children, and practices and environments in health care settings ( Table 1). Thus, multiple sources of data to assess obesity-related environments exist but differ in periodicity, populations, and sampling units. Evaluation using these data involves manipulating large data sets and complicated analytic techniques, which can be challenging. Several compilations of obesity and obesity-related environmental data have recently been developed, including the Community Commons (http://www.communitycommons.org/), the Health Indicators Warehouse (http://www.healthindicators.gov/), and the US Department of Agriculture Food Environment Atlas (http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas.aspx). Users can access these resources to obtain data at various levels (e.g., state, county) as well as maps or graphs. Despite recent advances, there are still gaps in the availability of both indicators and surveillance systems for areas such as community-level estimates of obesity-related environments, policies, programs, partnerships, and social norms; community-based physical activity programs; surveillance of local policies on nutrition standards for foods and beverages in the ECE setting; communitylevel data on exposure to food marketing; national-and community-level data on worksite programs; and obesity-related policies on college campuses (58)."}, {"section_title": "EVALUATING OBESITY PREVENTION EFFORTS", "text": "In a recent paper in the Lancet, Brownell & Roberto (11) call for a greater role for strategic science in obesity research, defined as research to address gaps in knowledge important to policy makers. Surveillance systems can provide data to address these gaps, but it is difficult to evaluate changes in obesity prevalence resulting from specific policy measures. For example, the SHPPS collects data from a representative sample of schools approximately every six years, the latest data collection taking place in 2014 (10,17). Although the SHPPS has been useful in mapping school policies, the data have limited utility for several reasons: (a) Data are not collected at a local level, (b) the time period between data collections is lengthy, and (c) child BMI data are not collected concurrently. If surveillance systems can be expanded to provide data for specific policy or environmental interventions for local municipalities, there is a greater likelihood that such evidence will be utilized in the development of statewide or national policies and therefore will have a more sustained effect on obesity initiatives."}, {"section_title": "Examples of Obesity Policy Evaluation Using Surveillance Data", "text": "For various reasons, national-level obesity prevention policies, however well intentioned, often fail to yield a significant effect on the targeted outcomes (114). Moreover, national-level policies tend to be modest in scope and hedged by many competing interest groups. We need to assess policy implementation, as well as complementary or supportive policies, both of which can promote the effectiveness of other approaches and strengthen ultimate impact (90,91,114). In this context, policies enacted at the local level are usually far more innovative and precisely targeted and can be implemented in supportive communities (85). School policies are a good example of local-level mandates. A wide variety of policy options are available to schools, and these options can be legislated at several levels: state, municipal, or school district (33,34). For example, one study examined the relation between state laws regulating the nutrition content of \"competitive foods\" (e.g., foods sold at schools outside of the reimbursable meals) and adolescent weight gain (100). Using data from the ECLS to examine BMI changes from fifth to eighth grade (2003-2006) among 6,300 children in 40 states, investigators found more favorable weight trajectories among children in states that had strong and consistent nutrition standards, relative to states with no laws or weak and inconsistent laws. In a review of competitive school food-andbeverage policies, 6 of 24 studies used outcome data from a variety of nationally representative surveys of students and/or school officials, such as the ECLS-K, the NSCH, and the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (NYPANS) conducted by the CDC (33). Nationwide data on high school students from the YRBSS for 1999, 2001, and 2003 were merged with state policy data from several sources and used to demonstrate that participation in physical education (PE) classes for boys and girls was positively correlated with both a PE unit requirement and a state PE curriculum. State spending on parks and recreation was positively correlated with girls' overall physical activity (14). In a California-based study, 10 years of routinely collected school FITNESSGRAM R data from more than 2 million fifth-grade students in approximately 5,000 public schools were used to demonstrate a reduction in obesity after the introduction of laws governing the nutritional content of competitive foods and beverages (92). The sample was large enough to allow the researchers to demonstrate that the amount of reduction in overweight/obesity prevalence was greater in schools of higher socioeconomic status. Data from the Texas School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) surveillance study were used to evaluate outcomes of a natural experiment that included local implementation of community and school programs combined with media messages targeting obesity in a large regional population, i.e., El Paso, Texas. SPAN data from 2004-2005 found significant decreases from 2000-2002 in the prevalence of obesity among fourth-grade students in El Paso (54). Furthermore, compared with a similar border region in Texas (Rio Grande Valley) without changes in obesity prevalence, there were significant increases in sports team participation, reductions in television viewing time, better meal patterns, and greater consumption of milk/yogurt and cereal; however, there was no relation with sugary beverages or fruit/vegetable consumption (40). By the time the 2009-2011 SPAN survey was administered, however, obesity prevalence in fourth-grade students in El Paso had reverted to preintervention levels, perhaps reflecting a reduction in funding for community initiatives in El Paso after 2008 (Figure 2). Case studies such as this one are useful in determining policy outcomes but would provide stronger evidence if coupled with more robust surveillance of programs and policies."}, {"section_title": "INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS FOR OBESITY SURVEILLANCE", "text": "An awareness of obesity surveillance systems outside of the United States is important to understanding how obesity trends relate to those in other countries. Data from other countries can also provide insights into opportunities and trends in assessment methodologies that may have relevance for US approaches."}, {"section_title": "Individual-Level Data", "text": "Most data on obesity prevalence and trends in the developing world have been obtained by multicountry surveillance programs. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID; http://www.dhsprogram.com/), are part of the DHS program that seeks to improve and institutionalize the collection and use of data by host countries for program monitoring and for policy decisions. DHS surveys include objectively measured height and weight data for children under age 5 as well as for adults, along with some measures of dietary intake. Similar to the DHS, the World Health Surveys (WHS) have been implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the intent of obtaining valid and reliable health data according to a standard protocol from multiple countries representing major regions of the world (111). Recently, there has been a move by the European member states of the WHO to standardize data collection across European countries. In 2006, the WHO Regional Office for Europe initiated the WHO European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) with 13 member states (112). The COSI protocol was started in response to a perceived need for nationally    representative and standardized data on obesity prevalence among primary-school children in European countries (68). It includes direct measurement of children's heights and weights, along with survey information on numerous individual-level risk factors related to obesity."}, {"section_title": "Environmental-Level Data", "text": "In 2008, the WHO released the report, A Framework to Monitor and Evaluate Implementation: WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health (110). This report identified indicators that assess not only outcomes such as obesity, diet, and physical activity, but also a variety of environmental and policy measures, including political will, cultural climate, dietary and activity norms, and legislative efforts. Environmental measures are being incorporated into existing surveillance systems, such as the COSI protocol, which includes detailed school environmental measures as an option (112,113). The International Network for Food and Obesity/Noncommunicable Diseases Research Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) was formed to accelerate the creation of healthy food environments through monitoring, benchmarking, and supporting related governmental and private efforts (99). Food environments in this context are defined as physical, economic, policy, and sociocultural and focus on governmental policies and actions as well as private-sector policies and actions (66,99). The project is currently working on developing protocols, databases, and data systems and pilot testing (99). The completed modules will eventually be available for countries to use to collect comparable data. The INFORMAS program is a good model for international collaboration and coordination for food environment surveillance systems."}, {"section_title": "HOW CAN WE IMPROVE CURRENT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND DATA?", "text": "Current surveillance methods and infrastructure need to (a) become more nimble in responding to research findings, (b) provide data that are sufficiently timely and precise to evaluate obesity policies and programs at different geographic levels, and (c) link these data to policy measures.

Recommendations from an expert meeting on environmental and policy research on obesity, physical activity, and diet call for surveillance systems with good measures of the environment, policy surveillance measures, and systems; surveillance to track changes in food industry activities over time; attention to minority and low-income populations; and measures of valuation (91). Another review identified gaps in research related to macroenvironments (city or larger) and within economic and political microenvironments in home, workplace, and neighborhood settings (64). To address these issues, greater surveillance infrastructure is needed at the local and state levels, where these policies are often implemented first. Considerations for socially disadvantaged and culturally diverse populations are often not adequately incorporated into surveillance systems and measures. Low numbers or regional locations of underserved populations, insufficient provisions for differences in language or culture, and lack of infrastructure must be anticipated, and surveillance systems should be monitored to be sure these elements are addressed (58)."}, {"section_title": "Harmonize Data Across State and National Surveillance Systems", "text": "Harmonization of data can be accomplished by coordinating efforts and standardizing protocols across different surveillance and evaluation structures to minimize duplication of effort, leverage resources, and maximize data use (58).

However, recent studies suggest that the addition of new measures or methods can augment current data collection and amplify research and monitoring possibilities. Additions to BMI measures. Measurement of BMI has long been a consistent outcome of obesity surveillance systems, owing to the ease and low cost of directly measured height and weight or even obtaining these data via self-report. BMI misclassifies as nonobese one-quarter of adult males and nearly half of adults whose dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements classify them as obese (95). BMI has similarly poor sensitivity as a measure of adiposity in children (61). In addition, BMI does not detect an accumulation of abdominal fat, which is known to correlate with insulin resistance even in lean individuals (35). Surveillance science has been slow to take advantage of research that identifies alternative anthropometric measures of obesity (8). Combining two or more different anthropometric measures, such as waist-to-hip ratio and waistcircumference-to-height ratio, works well and may be more sensitive to the accumulation of abdominal fat (8,13,115), although these measurements are more invasive and require additional privacy. Addition of longitudinal data. Methods for longitudinal population-based analyses are essential to assess the impact of policy-led interventions on the incidence of obesity during crucial developmental time periods, such as childhood or transitions from high school to college (36). Developing cohorts with regularly assessed obesity measures over the lifespan would provide data on incidence of obesity that would coincide with obesity prevention initiatives. Longitudinal BMI measure analyses are uncommon, particularly among low-resource populations, which are at greater risk of obesity."}, {"section_title": "Workforce Development", "text": "Although few data have assessed the size of the workforce that is engaged in surveillance work, similar studies have documented shortages in related disciplines, such as epidemiologists, public health nurses, and informaticians (38).

Hence, there is considerable potential for their use in obtaining measures relevant to obesity in a general population. The use of these types of self-measurements has been feasible, even among low-income communities (116). Data from social media postings of individuals offer another source of self-measured data.

Also critical is the addition of environmental and policy measures to surveillance systems to allow for a better understanding of the effects of obesity prevention initiatives. With the emerging technological advances in measurements and data management, the ability to obtain more and better surveillance presents unlimited opportunities for obesity prevention efforts, especially when coupled with the presentation of this information using data visualization techniques and easy-to-understand dashboards. To capitalize on this convergence of technology and data collection, researchers will need to nurture the science of surveillance by providing increased funding for new methodologies and outlets for presenting and publishing the resulting findings. Facilitating the development and use of surveillance data for evaluating obesity prevention efforts has the potential to significantly advance action against obesity."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE ISSUES", "text": "1. To fully determine the tracking and effects of current and future initiatives for obesity control and prevention, current surveillance systems for overweight and obesity should be expanded to incorporate both behavioral and environmental measures, as well as biologic outcomes. In addition, measures such as waist circumference, which more accurately track obesity risk, should be added to surveillance systems. Finally, representative serial cohort studies, beginning in childhood, should be initiated to provide data on incidence of obesity. 2. Because several innovative obesity prevention and control initiatives are being implemented at the local or state level, surveillance efforts should also be expanded to provide local data that are comparable to national and international data. 3. Current sources of existing data, such as EHRs and wearable devices, provide promise for more accurate and timely data collection that may be leveraged for obesity surveillance. Incorporation of decision supports into EHRs and links to current manufacturers of wearable devices would ensure more consistent collection of data. 4. With increased surveillance of body size and contextual factors, it is necessary to implement procedures to ensure adequate privacy and anonymization of sensitive data."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": ". Actionable data for decision-making purposes need to include a rapid feedback mechanism for practitioners in easily understandable formats, such as dashboards or infographics. Progress toward national health goals, such as Healthy People 2020, should be included in user feedback. 6. To allow for the expansion of data surveillance systems, it will be necessary to further develop or expand infrastructure in terms of catalogs of measures, development of new measures, increased training in surveillance and epidemiologic methods, and workforce development. 7. To encourage the development of better surveillance methods and systems, it is necessary to provide funding streams for research as well as opportunities for peer review through publications and presentations at national conferences and meetings. 8. Current surveillance systems should be examined to ensure the inclusion of children or adults who are at an above-average risk of obesity and related health conditions."}, {"section_title": "DISCLOSURE STATEMENT", "text": "Dr. Hoelscher was a member of the committee for the HMD's Evaluating Obesity Prevention Efforts: A Plan for Measuring Progress report.
