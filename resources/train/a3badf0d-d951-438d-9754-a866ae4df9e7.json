[{"section_title": "", "text": "It was worth noting, however, that cross-national studies were still rare on the topic of PD focus areas. The existing comparative research on educational characteristics and student achievement has primarily focused on such topics as teacher quality (e.g., Akiba, LeTendre, & Scribner, 2007; Akiba & Liang, 2014) , classroom instruction (e.g., Hiebert et al., 2005) , class size (e.g., Pong & Pallas, 2001) , and teacher compensation (e.g., Akiba, Chiu, Shimizu, & Liang, 2012; Woessmann, 2011) . To our knowledge, little cross-national research exists that used nationally representative datasets to examine the association between national math achievement and students' access to teachers with PD in various focus areas.\nTo fill the knowledge gap, this study used the latest administrations of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data across the years (i.e., 2003, 2007, and 2011) and grade levels (i.e., students and teachers in both fourth and eighth grades), and examined the relationship between students' access to teachers who participated in PD and national math achievement. It focused on the PD activities in the following areas which share a relatively common meaning across the various national and cultural contexts: (a) math content, (b) math pedagogy or instruction, (c) math curriculum, (d) integrating information technology into math, (e) math assessment, and (f) improving students' critical thinking or problem solving skills."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions:", "text": "(1) How does the percentage of students whose teachers participated in math professional development in the United States compare with the other countries around the world from 2003 to 2011? (2) How are the national levels of students' access to teachers who participated in professional development associated with national math achievement?"}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods:", "text": "This study used secondary data from the fourth and eighth graders and their math teachers in the latest 2003, 2007, and 2011 administrations of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). For the first research question, this study reported the percentages of students in the United States whose math teachers participated in professional learning by grade level, PD focus area, and TIMSS cycle. The average percentages were also reported for the other countries. To address the second question, Pearson's correlation coefficients were first calculated on the association between national mean math achievement and students' access to teachers with PD. Based on the findings of the correlations, a series of multiple regression models were conducted for each grade, PD focus area, and TIMSS cycle. The data were also pooled across the TIMSS cycles by PD focus area and grade level.\nResults: (1) Although the national levels of access for students at the fourth and eighth grade levels to teachers who participated in professional learning in the United States were higher than the other countries, one third to one half of the fourth grades were taught by teachers who had no professional learning focusing on math instruction or curriculum; (2) In addition, teachers' participation in professional development was positively associated with higher student math achievement. Holding GPD per capita and educational expenditure as percentage of GPD constant, an average of a .96 point increase in national math achievement is associated with a one percentage point increase in the proportion of fourth graders whose teachers had PD focusing on math content, a .78 point increase on math pedagogy or instruction, a .70 point increase on math curriculum, a 1.58 points increase on integrating information technology into math, and a .94 point increase on improving critical thinking or problem solving skills. For the eighth graders, when the proportion of students increases by one percentage point on their access to teachers with PD on math content, math pedagogy/instruction, math curriculum, and integration of information technology, the associated national math achievement increases on average by 1.04, 1.24, .93, and 1.07 points, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions:", "text": "Educators and policymakers around the world strive to improve student learning with various reform initiatives such as compensation (Akiba et al., 2012) and performance-related pay (e.g., Liang, 2013a; Liang & Akiba, 2011) . Educational reform efforts to improve student achievement, however, can only succeed by building the capacity of teachers to improve their instructional practices and the capacity of school systems to promote teacher learning (Darling-Hammond et al., 2009) . Building on the findings of the previous studies, this study provides cross-national evidence that enhancing students' access to teachers who participated in PD is promising in increasing student learning. It suggests that when coupled with high quality teacher evaluation (Liang, 2013b; Liang & Akiba, 2013) , content specific professional learning activities can be an effective tool for strengthening the capacity of frontline educators and ensuring adequate access and opportunities for students to a teaching workforce with continuous learning.\nA recent study used longitudinal data from middle school math teachers in a mid-western state found that teachers who received an increased amount of organizational resources were more likely to increasingly participate in high quality PD activities (Akiba et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is important for districts and schools to continuously provide adequate resources for professional learning in order to support and encourage their teachers' participation in high quality learning activities.
