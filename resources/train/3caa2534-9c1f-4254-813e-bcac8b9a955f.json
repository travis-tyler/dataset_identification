[{"section_title": "", "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is actively engaged in the Arctic, providing science, service, and stewardship to this rapidly changing region, its inhabitants, and the Nation. Through its broad range of activities, NOAA is well prepared to make significant contributions, to the extent possible within existing resources, to all three lines of effort in the recently released U.S. National Strategy for the Arctic Region (May 2013) and its subsequent Implementation Plan (January 2014). As described in its 2011 Arctic Vision and Strategy, NOAA has six strategic goals in the Arctic, each of which directly supports the National Strategy. Advancing U.s. security interests in the Arctic requires improved maritime domain awareness, for which NOAA's weather and sea ice forecasts are critically important. NOAA's sea ice research strengthens forecasts of both ice and weather conditions as well as building a better understanding of the direct links between sea ice and climate. As a result of this research, the complicated linkages among melting sea ice, changing climate, and weather patterns in the Arctic and around the globe are becoming more apparent and allow better planning to cope with Arctic change. NOAA plays a key role in pursuing responsible Arctic region stewardship. Foundational science enables better understanding of Arctic ecosystems, the atmosphere, climate, and their dynamic interconnections. NOAA's fisheries research and management programs are likewise vital, particularly for the economically important U.S. Bering Sea fisheries. Research and stewardship of marine ecosystems and protected species like marine mammals promote sustainable use, conservation, and protection from potential impacts of offshore development, increased shipping, and environmental degradation. NOAA provides important services to coastal communities by improving safe Arctic maritime access with mapping and charting as well as increasing preparedness and communities' resilience to intensifying weather. NOAA is also an important partner in hazard response and mitigation (e.g., providing scientific support to the U.S. Coast Guard after oil spills). Research relevant to oil spills, sea ice, and marine ecosystems will help to prepare for and to protect against potential environmental disasters in the Arctic. All of NOAA's Arctic activities are united in one aspect: leveraging national and international partnerships and collaborating to support common Arctic goals. NOAA strengthens international cooperation through the Arctic Council, joint research opportunities, and provision of services. NOAA also has many successful Arctic national partnerships, within and outside the Federal Government. Existing partnerships will be strengthened and new ones developed in the coming years as NOAA continues its work to address the Nation's challenges in the Arctic.

One dramatic change is the loss of sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean and its peripheral seas. The past 10 years have been the 10 years with the lowest Arctic sea ice coverage, and 2012 marked the all-time lowest sea ice extent ever recorded. Since the 1980s, 75% of Arctic sea ice volume has been lost, and there are consistently more than 300 kilometers of open water north of Alaska every summer. In contrast, 30 years ago 50 kilometers of open water was typical. The ice-free season north of the Bering Strait is projected to increase from 2-3 months at present to about 5-6 months over the next few decades. By 2040, the Arctic Ocean will likely be nearly ice-free during the summer months. This rapid loss of sea ice is affecting weather patterns, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and human activities. Reductions in sea ice cover are changing polar atmospheric circulation patterns, ultimately increasing the frequency and severity of Arctic storms. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that changes in Arctic atmospheric circulation are reflected in the weather patterns at lower latitudes as well. Weather and climate changes in the Arctic are already affecting the United States and other parts of the world, and these forces are expected to intensify in the coming years. As Arctic waterways become ice-free and navigable for longer periods, patterns of commerce and industrial activities are also shifting. There is growing interest in oil and gas exploration and development, spurred by estimates of over 23 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and 108 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas within the Outer Continental Shelf of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. There was a 118% increase in maritime transits through the Bering Strait between 2008 and 2012. 1 Furthermore, ecological shifts in Arctic marine ecosystems are likely to impact commercial fisheries, protected resources such as marine mammals and birds, and Alaska Native subsistence harvests. Arctic climate change and loss of sea ice will influence maritime safety, traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, economies, and associated ecosystems for decades to come. \u2022 Advance U.S. security interests, \u2022 Pursue responsible Arctic region stewardship, and The National Strategy's guiding principles are to safeguard peace and stability, make decisions using the best available information, pursue innovative arrangements, and consult and coordinate with Alaska Natives.

In July of 2013, NOAA and its sister agencies on the Committee on the Marine Transportation System submitted a report to the President entitled, \"U.S. Arctic Marine Transportation System: Overview and Priorities for Action,\" which calls for near-and long-term efforts to develop safeguards for anticipated increases in vessel traffic. 8"}, {"section_title": "noaa's arctic action plan", "text": "NOAA has many diverse and robust programs underway in the Arctic. NOAA's Arctic Action Plan describes those efforts, how they implement NOAA's Arctic Vision and Strategy, and how they support and harmonize with the National Strategy for the Arctic Region. This document lays out concrete objectives to set priorities, leverage partnerships, and build upon accomplishments, to the extent possible within existing resources. Specific actions and outcome targets for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 are described in the Appendix. The geographic scope of NOAA's Arctic Action Plan includes all of the areas defined by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 (i.e., the zone within and to the north of the red line in Fig. 1). 9 For the United States, that area includes four large marine ecosystems (West Bering Sea, East Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Beaufort Sea) and the terrestrial portions of northern and western Alaska (Fig. 1). NOAA currently has active programs in all of these Arctic geographic subareas. II. National strategy line of NOAA contributes to all of these objectives, particularly through its activities supporting its strategic goals to \"Forecast Sea Ice\" and \"Improve Weather and Water Forecasts and Warnings.\" NOAA's forecasts, warnings, and research on weather and sea ice inform decision-making for all stakeholders in the Arctic. These services are critical for safe Arctic operations and enhanced maritime domain awareness. weather and Sea ice forecasts NOAA provides forecasts, warnings, and information for marine, aviation, and other weather interests, which are critical for maritime domain awareness in the Arctic. NOAA's National Weather Service provides forecast services to protect life and property, to enhance the national economy, and to fulfill NOAA's obligations under international treaties for the safety and security of maritime shipping, energy exploration, and tourism activities. Major stakeholders and partners, including the U.S. Coast Guard and the State of Alaska, require weather, water, and sea ice information for planning and decision-making to serve communities and to manage the region's many resources. People in the Arctic rely heavily on aviation, marine weather, and sea ice information for safe transportation and access to goods and services. Forecasts and warnings are delivered through a number of media, from the Internet to highfrequency radio broadcasts. Increasing air and ocean temperatures, thawing permafrost, loss of sea ice, and ecosystem shifts are evidence of widespread and dramatic change. Critical environmental, economic, and national security issues are emerging, many of which are having significant impacts on human lives, livelihoods, and coastal communities. Meeting the information needs for Alaska, with its vast size, remote population, and cultural diversity, presents NOAA with unique challenges. Partners, emergency managers, and communities in the Arctic deal with extremes in temperature, darkness, and sea ice, further complicating decisions and possible actions. For example, a decision to deliver heating fuel to a coastal community in the Arctic may require weather and sea ice outlooks weeks in advance to ensure safe navigation. Evacuation of coastal communities that might take several hours in Connecticut, for example, may take several days in remote Alaska during the winter, when daylight hours are fewer and emergency response is hindered by darkness. These unique challenges make NOAA's decision support services vitally important to Arctic communities. Weather and sea ice forecasting are closely linked, and forecasts are often provided together. Weather conditions affect the development and movement of sea ice, and the loss of sea ice in the Arctic impacts the weather and climate. The present rate of sea ice loss, with its regional and global impact, creates an urgency to improve sea ice predictions at all time scales, from the short term (i.e., daily to weekly) to seasonal and decadal time scales. Some of NOAA's sea ice services and forecasts are described below. \u2022 NOAA provides Arctic sea ice analysis and forecast services from local to regional scales through the National Weather Service, and at basin to global scales through the U.S. National Ice Center in collaboration with the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. \u2022 Accurate weekly sea ice information is important for many stakeholders to operate in the marine environment, including the U.S. Coast Guard, Arctic coastal communities and Alaska Native populations, the oil and gas and fishing industries, first responders to emergencies, and scientific researchers. Current sea ice forecasts are based primarily on satellite data, simple sea ice drift calculations, and Arctic weather models. Generating timely forecasts depends on the ability to collect basic observations and rapidly process the information. To improve weekly sea ice forecasts, NOAA is developing and refining higher spatial resolution regional sea ice models for Alaska waters that can assimilate both weather and sea ice observations. and clouds. Although accurate forecasts and models depend upon the availability of observations, existing observations in the Arctic are very limited in both geographic scope and frequency. The ability of NOAA and its partners to deploy a variety of sensing devices to collect observations, from buoys and other in situ technologies to airborne and satellite sensors, is key to improving weather and sea ice forecasts. Real-time satellite data are critical for accurate forecasting and warning of events, such as rapid sea ice formation and frequent storms that pose major hazards to life, property, and economic activities in the Arctic. NOAA will continue to improve Arctic marine weather, storm surge, and sea ice forecast services. Improved sea ice and marine weather forecasting would assist the energy, maritime shipping, and transportation industries as well as infrastructure planning, economic development, and ecosystem stewardship. Forecast improvements will be made by enhancing and integrating different types of observations of the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean (including use of traditional and local knowledge) and by directly combining sea ice and climate models with weather forecast models. \u2022 The ability to provide accurate advanced sea ice predictions of the seasonal timing of the freeze-up and melt-out of sea ice has direct implications for U.S. commerce and industry. For example, in 2012, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management asked NOAA to assist in reviewing an oil and gas industry request to extend the drilling season in the Chukchi Sea based on the possibility of a late freeze-up of sea ice. NOAA provided a probability-based sea ice forecast indicating an unusually rapid freeze-up. The resulting decision to deny the extension request mitigated risks for offshore drilling operations. \u2022 On a decadal scale, sea ice loss is a major index of global climate change and represents an important time horizon for community, industrial, and environmental management. NOAA has contributed key input to several national and international climate reports that illustrate trends in sea ice loss and climate, including the 5th Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change. Weather analysis and prediction capabilities are currently poorer in the Arctic than in other parts of the United States. Major challenges for long-term modeling being addressed by NOAA include the lack of good physical data regarding winds"}, {"section_title": "NOAA Provides Essential Decision Support Services", "text": "\u2022 Forecasts and warnings for highimpact events, such as extra tropical storms, tsunamis, floods, droughts, volcanic ash, fires, and space weather, are particularly critical in Alaska communities. \u2022 Storm surge and inundation hazards threaten northern and western Alaska coastal communities. Waterlevel information and forecasts are necessary to help protect these communities and improve coastal community hazard resilience. \u2022 An enhanced and integrated set of environmental observations is required to track changes to the Arctic across the land, in the atmosphere, and in the ocean, including physical indicators, biological responses, and social and economic impacts. Rapid integration, interpretation, and dissemination of this information in near-real time are required to support decision-making. \u2022 Accurate sea ice charts and forecasts are critically important for the maritime shipping, commercial fishing, and offshore energy industries, as well as for safe navigation, successful search and rescue operations, and other emergency response efforts."}, {"section_title": "Sea ice research", "text": "NOAA conducts sea ice research to better understand the drivers and associated impacts that cause ice to form and melt.

Through its many marine research programs, NOAA provides the information necessary to support management decisions that are based on a strong scientific foundation. NOAA also plays key management and regulatory roles in the Arctic, working to ensure that natural resources are utilized sustainably and that marine ecosystems are protected. Living Marine Resource Surveys and Assessments: NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service is responsible for research on marine species and their habitats in the coastal oceans of the Arctic region. These waters support some of the most important commercial fisheries in the world, as well as rich, productive ecosystems. Living marine resource surveys and assessments include: \u2022 Fishery stock assessments, incorporating fisherydependent and fishery-independent data collection, to support groundfish and shellfish management, \u2022 Economic and socio-cultural information for resource managers, commercial and subsistence fishers, and other stakeholders, and \u2022 Marine mammal stock assessments incorporating stateof-the-art survey design, telemetry, passive acoustics, and other technologies to support management.

In the future, NOAA will continue its innovative approaches and investments in advanced technology for improved assessment surveys. Ecosystem and Habitat Research: NOAA conducts integrated ecosystem-level observation and process studies to understand Arctic marine ecosystems. These programs address fish recruitment processes, ecological processes, contaminant impacts, and marine mammal-fisheries interactions. \u2022 The overall goal of recruitment process research is to examine linkages among fish, oceanographic conditions, and climate change (e.g., ocean warming, loss of sea ice, ocean acidification) to understand the mechanisms that affect fish survival. NOAA conducts this research to reduce uncertainty in stock assessment models of commercially important species in the Arctic. \u2022 Integrated ecosystem research programs address diverse ecological processes, spanning physical oceanography, plankton, fish, shellfish, bottom-dwelling communities, mammals, and birds. This research includes efforts to assess and mitigate, as needed, potential impacts of bottom trawling on marine life. \u2022 Studies of marine mammal-fisheries interactions evaluate the effects of commercial fishing on marine mammals near the top of the food chain, such as Steller sea lions. \u2022 NOAA conducts bioeffects studies in coordination with the State of Alaska and others to provide comprehensive assessments of environmental contamination and toxic impacts in regional water bodies, ranging from small bays to large sounds to the coastal ocean.

NOAA co-chairs the U.S.-Russia Marine Mammal Working Group, which promotes scientific cooperation and effective marine mammal management and conservation, and which has fostered long-standing research partnerships with several Russian institutes.  Arctic Council: The Arctic Council is the predominant intergovernmental forum addressing international Arctic issues for the eight Arctic nations. NOAA provides substantial leadership and expertise to several of the Arctic Council working groups on diverse subjects such as oil spill response, safe shipping, ecosystem-based management, and biodiversity monitoring. These efforts help the United States to sustainably use and manage its resources, protect the environment, and advance U.S interests in the Arctic Council and the circumpolar Arctic. NOAA will continue its leadership role in the Arctic Council, which the U.S. will chair from 2015 to 2017. NOAA's contributions to the Arctic Council's ministerial mandates issued in 2013 will include: \u2022 Participating in future national, binational, and multinational contingency plans, training, and exercises to develop effective measures for oil spill preparedness and response, \u2022    "}, {"section_title": "Stewardship and management liviNG mAriNE rEsOUrcE sUrvEys ANd AssEssmENt", "text": "Improve the frequency and quality of assessments for key fish stocks, prepare a baseline monitoring report for all managed fish stocks, and add next-generation assessments for selected stocks with high sensitivity to ecosystem conditions.
