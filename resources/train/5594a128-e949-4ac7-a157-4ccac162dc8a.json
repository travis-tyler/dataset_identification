[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: The neural and cognitive substrates of measures of orientation as used in clinical trials and examinations have not been comprehensively examined. Methods: We studied 473 subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) at baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Regression analyses at baseline were conducted to find significant predictors of orientation score among cognitive, brain morphometry, and glucose metabolism measures. Mixed model longitudinal analysis was performed to examine consequences of orientation on functional decline, and Cox hazard models examined the risk of conversion to AD in the MCI group. Results: In MCI and AD subjects, orientation was predicted by poorer neurocognitive performance on immediate and delayed episodic memory and attention and processing speed. Among magnetic resonance imaging measures, orientation was predicted by entorhinal cortex thickness, hippocampal volume, and inferior temporal cortex thickness. Glucose metabolism in both middle-inferior temporal cortex and hippocampus were also predictive of orientation score. Functioning was significantly lower in disoriented subjects after 4 years of follow-up, and MCI patients who also were disoriented showed a higher rate of conversion to AD with a hazard ratio of 1.5. Conclusions: Orientation is associated with medial temporal lobe structure, temporal lobe glucose metabolism, and episodic memory function. In MCI individuals orientation was a risk factor for progression to AD, also associated with rapid functional decline and worse prognosis. Thus, orientation may serve as a surrogate for episodic memory in clinical examination. These results have direct implications for the use of orientation in MCI and AD clinical trials including ceiling effects in healthy controls and issues of redundancy with measures of memory, when both are used in composite scores."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Tests of orientation to time, date, and place are widely used in clinical psychiatric and neurologic examinations and for staging and monitoring progression in research studies and clinical trials involving individuals with dementia or its antecedents. Pragmatically, orientation may be useful as an indicator of decline in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum [1, 2] , and can also be used to discriminate between AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, that is, frontal temporal dementia [3] . Neurocognitive studies examining the relationship between orientation and cognition have found correlations between episodic memory and working memory and/or executive impairment and orientation [4] [5] [6] [7] . Several lesion and neuroimaging studies have implicated multiple brain areas (presumably subserving different cognitive operations) as being involved in orientation, including the hippocampus [8] , medial temporal and parietal cortical areas [9] , and orbitofrontal cortex [10] in various disorders. However, few studies have examined the neural substrates of orientation in the context of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. A single fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) study of patients with mild-to-moderate AD found that temporal disorientation was related to reduced glucose metabolic rate in the posterior cingulate gyri and in the right middle temporal gyrus, but cognition was not examined [11] .\nBeyond its routine use in the clinic, orientation has come to be viewed as increasingly important in tracking neurodegenerative disease progression [2, 12] . Recently several socalled composite measures of cognition have identified orientation as a key component in the battery [12, 13] . Selection was made after analyses revealed that orientation (scored on the Mini-Mental State Examination or MMSE) demonstrated consistent decline in MCI and AD groups over time (i.e., had robust signal to noise properties using mean/standard deviation ratios). Further adjustments for group, namely individuals who remained cognitively normal versus those who progressed or showed practice effects were sometimes made [2, 12] . However, selection criteria did not include redundancy with other measures (e.g., episodic memory), nor applicability to preclinical AD given the possibility of ceiling effects [14] . For the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) selection of items including MMSE orientation was based on a literature review. The resulting composite was used retrospectively in measuring change in various groups with preclinical AD and setting aside the possibility of tautology, was able to track \"progressors\" in various groups [13] .\nIn this article we examine spatial and temporal disorientation in the context of AD dementia and MCI, disorders in which disorientation may be a frequently observed symptom [15] . This study is the first to comprehensively examine cognitive, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain morphometry, and positron emission tomography (PET) functional glucose metabolism substrates of orientation in a single large sample of MCI and AD patients. We predicted that orientation would be associated with (1) cognitive operations involving episodic memory, given demands for acquisition, and recall of new information in specific contexts; (2) executive processes involving cognitive estimation, updating, and management of interference between similar items (\"remembering to remember\" to advance the date after time has passed); and (3) semantic knowledge to parse meaning based on attributes (e.g., a city is different than a county), that is, a network involving higher integrative processes. These operations would engage such brain regions as the medial temporal lobe (episodic memory), prefrontal cortex (updating and estimating), and lateral temporal lobe (semantic knowledge). However, our results strongly supported a more restricted conceptualization of orientation involving episodic memory and its medial temporal lobe substrate and to a lesser extent, lateral temporal lobe glucose metabolism (perhaps impacting semantic knowledge). In an extension of our approach to examine prognosis, we examined the consequences of disorientation on longitudinal functional capacity (over 4 years of followup), and specifically in the context of MCI, the influence of disorientation on conversion to AD, and demonstrated that it was a robust and negative prognostic indicator. Our findings also have clear implications for orientation's possible use in clinical trials in various AD subpopulations."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

For the combined group of AD and MCI individuals, functioning level, as measured by FAQ, was significantly lower in disoriented subjects. FAQ scores systematically declined over 4 years, as indicated by the group ! time interaction factor (F 4, 437 5 5.21, P 5 .0004) in the mixed model analysis, that is, those patients who showed disorientation at baseline declined to a greater extent on their everyday functioning level (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This finding remained unchanged when analyzing both groups separately, although as expected, it was of greater statistical significance for AD patients compared with MCI patients.\nMCI patients who were disoriented converted at a higher rate to AD (61%) than MCI patients who were oriented (42%) over a 5-year period (X 2 5 8.45, P 5 .004).

In addition, KaplanMeier survival analysis revealed that subjects with MCI converted at a higher rate to AD if they also had disorientation compared with MCI patients with relatively intact orientation (Fig. 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Although orientation has long been used as a measure of global mental status in neurological and psychiatric assessment [28] , research has been sparse on the cognitive operations involved in orientation abilities and the neural substrates that support them. The current findings provide convergent evidence that episodic memory ability and both structure and metabolic function of medial temporal brain areas are primary predictors of disorientation in the context of MCI and AD. We also found evidence for a role of lateral temporal cortex in orientation ability. This region has been thought to support semantic knowledge, including featural attributes and has been compromised in MCI and AD [29] . Importantly, our results were robustly supported by k-fold cross-validation analyses in which shrinkages were very small.\nThese results have important clinical implications in that the use of orientation as a measure can aid in the assessment of memory functioning. Additionally, it adds to prognostic information: more disoriented individuals were more likely to experience steeper declines such that they converted more rapidly than less disoriented individuals, and concomitantly also demonstrated reduced functional abilities over time. Based on the analyses presented here, orientation could be used as an outcome in clinical trials, given that it is valid on its face, can be objectively scored, and has plausible biological correlates. Given the relationship of disorientation to steeper decline in everyday function and MCI to AD conversion, it could also be used to enrich samples. Nevertheless, there are caveats. We found marked ceiling effects in HCs in ADNI (mean orientation score 5 9.8 of 10) and so the measure may have limited utility in determining fine differences in medial temporal lobe integrity in this group.\nAs noted, little research has specifically focused on orientation items in relation to neurocognition and neurobiological variables in MCI or AD. Our initial hypothesis involved a large network of cognitive and regional neurobiological predictors. However, our findings, combining three different and complementary lines of evidence, pointed toward medial temporal lobe integrity and episodic memory as the critical factors that determine the presence of disorientation in MCI and AD. Although our findings may be attributed to orientation in MCI and AD having unique cognitive and neurobiological underpinnings, in our view, the locus of pathology, rather than its nature, more likely played a determining role [30] . In this respect, we acknowledge that there is evidence that AD pathology is often accompanied by other disease processes [31] .\nOne point to take into consideration is the method by which orientation is measured. There is likely a difference in the cognitive domains needed to verbally \"name\" a location as opposed to navigating to the location. Questions of spatial orientation (e.g., state, country, name of building) may rely on new learning of the names of places rather than actual tracking of one's location in space. Similarly, temporal orientation may also be \"memorized\" to some degree (e.g., month, year). This may account for the seeming reliance of orientation on memory function and temporal lobe brain structures found in this study. It would be useful to examine other aspects of orientation, in which routefinding in space [32] and temporal monitoring might be used as orientation measures. It is worth noting here that when we separated spatial and temporal orientation, we found that predictors were generally the same, but the amount of variance accounted for was less in spatial orientation than temporal orientation. This perhaps suggests that predictors outside the domains included in ADNI's data set may play a role or alternatively that there may have been a reduction in range for spatial orientation.\nOrientation has also been shown to be a significant predictor of further cognitive decline [1] . Our findings similarly suggest that individuals with MCI who were disoriented at baseline had higher hazard ratio for the conversion to AD compared with MCI individuals who were oriented at baseline. Furthermore, disoriented individuals declined in everyday function significantly more than oriented subjects. In this sense, greater atrophy and glucose hypometabolism in the hippocampal and middle temporal lobe brain region (beyond what is expected in prodromal AD) may indicate a more aggressive form of AD from which a primary clinical manifestation would encompass impairments in orientation ability. In keeping with this, clinicopathological studies of post-mortem brain tissue have found that disorientation was significantly correlated with neurofibrillary tangle density in CA1 field of the hippocampus and Brodmann's Areas 7 and 23 [33] . It may also be important in future studies to examine the covariance of orientation and its neural substrates monitored over time.\nThese findings have important implications for the use of orientation in preclinical and prodromal AD (i.e., MCI due to AD) clinical trials. First in healthy subjects, a ceiling effect may be present that could obscure subtle longitudinal change. Although the PACC was able to demonstrate sensitivity to various groups of \"progressors\" in preclinical AD or a possible surrogate based on APOE 34 genotype, it is unclear if orientation directly contributed to sensitivity [13] . Second, the use of orientation may be redundant in composite test batteries with cognitive tests assaying episodic memory processes that engage medial temporal lobe. On the other hand, orientation does not overlap completely with episodic memory measures and thus may demand unique cognitive operations sensitive to functional decline (see point 4 below). Third, several composite batteries (ref e.g., PACC, ADCOM) and orientation scores are included from multiple sources (e.g., CDR, MMSE, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale [ADAS-Cog]) [34] . Thus, critical examination of subtle differences in administration and items in orientation may be necessary to more comprehensively understand what orientation, in its various implementations, is measuring. Fourth, disorientation was associated with steeper declines in MCI subjects in everyday function and ultimately to progression to AD, and may have prognostic advantages. Although we did not test this directly, orientation may not be subject to severe practice effects because of the necessity for the person to regularly update information, especially with respect to temporal items [35] . Thus, the use of orientation measures in translational interventions may be dependent on the group that is being monitored (preclinical, prodromal, and established AD), the length of time over which monitoring is to occur, and the type of treatment. Depending on the type of treatment, it is also worth considering whether orientation might be best be used as a \"stand-alone\" measure or be included in a composite.\nIn summary, in this, the largest and most comprehensive study of the neurobiological and behavioral components of orientation, we found that disorientation in the context of MCI and AD was predicted by reduced thickness in temporal and entorhinal cortex, and reduced volume of the hippocampus, and poorer performance on neurocognitive measures of immediate and delayed verbal memory. We also found that MCI subjects with signs of disorientation showed an increased risk of conversion, and in both AD and MCI, disoriented individuals had steeper decline in function than those with preserved orientation. Our findings support the perspective that orientation is an important clinical measure, as it may be considered an ecologically relevant surrogate for traditional laboratory tests of episodic memory in MCI and AD. Our findings also may usefully provide evidence-based knowledge so that an informed discussion of orientation's use in translational clinical trials can begin.\nShore LIJ) and National Institutes of Health (RO1 AG038734 to TEG)."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary data", "text": "Supplementary data related to this article can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trci.2015.04.002."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": "1.
