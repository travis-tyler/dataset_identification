Mean storm lifetime only di\u21b5ers by approximately 2% between the simulations. This further underscores that the overall distribution of storms produced is similar; it is the tail of the intensity distribution (most extremes TCs) that is shifted due to the coupling feedback described in this manuscript. A cursory look at track density for all tracked TCs (Fig. 1) shows no fundamental shifts (spatially) that appear to be significant. 'The same relationship holds true for mean storm lifetime. Spatial plots of TC track density also show no discernible di\u21b5erence (not shown).' has been added to the manuscript to address both of these points.\nSince precipitation is driven by dynamical processes within the core of the TC, we anticipate the differences in precipitation between configurations would be somewhat analogous to that seen in intensity, with most intense precipitation rates associated with TCs being higher in the configuration which produced stronger TCs (ne120 gx1v6). Using precipitation data from 1980-1993 (this data was already regridded for analysis purposes), the mean integrated precipitation rate (within 2 of the sea level pressure minimum) for all TCs was 2% higher in the ne120 gx1v6 configuration, although there is significant variability between individual storms, likely due to di\u21b5ering sizes. 'This is further corroborated by the mean TC precipitation rate (integrated over a 2x2 domain over the TC center for all storms), which is approximately 2% higher using the ne120 gx1v6 configuration' has been added to the revised manuscript to note this.\nFigure 1: Mean annual track density for 4x4 gridboxes for the ne120 ne120 (top) and ne120 gx1v6 simulations (bottom). A 'hit' occurs when a 6-hour tracked TC location occurs in a particular gridbox.\nDeterministic simulations of hurricane Leslie are done to illustrate what have been showed in the climate simulations. If the e\u21b5ect of the grid resolution on wind stresses is clear in figure 5 , the realism of the simulated hurricane has not been assessed, which should be, in my sense, the objective of such simulations. For example, it is not clear in figure 5 if resulting winds are di\u21b5erent between the di\u21b5erent simulations and which one is the nearest to real winds observed during Leslie. I do not really understand the usefulness of such simulations if comparison with observations is not undertaken. Climate simulations may be su cient to demonstrate the impact of the resolution on wind stresses by a statistical approach.\nWe have added 'The simulated intensity of Hurricane Leslie at 120 hours (as measured by minimum sea level pressure) was 950 and 958 hPa for the ne240 gx1v6 and ne240 ne240 configurations, respectively. Both configurations predicted a TC stronger than the observed intensity at that forecast time (988 hPa), in broad agreement with previous work that has shown CAM5-SE produces TCs which are (on average) too intense in forecast frameworks at 0.125 resolution . However, it should be emphasized that we are not concerned with forecast verification, but rather, the relative di\u21b5erences that arise due to coupling strategy despite identically-initialized cases to confirm di\u21b5erences suggested by the analysis of the decadal simulations. Highly similar results to those highlighted here would be expected when using di\u21b5erent historical TCs or even more idealized frameworks.' which addresses this point.\nEssentially, the choice of simulation is not critical to the results of this study. The same results were seen with a di\u21b5erent TC during the 2012 season (Hurricane Michael, not shown). The only criteria is that the simulations are initialized with identical initial conditions, use identical forcing, and are on identical grids except for the one used to calculate the air-sea fluxes and wind stresses. Reply: To further show how heat flux patterns can influence TCs, we have added the following text: 'The pattern of surface heat and moisture fluxes underneath TCs has been shown to be critically important in intensification processes [Peng et al., 1999 , Chan et al., 2001 , Wang and Wu, 2004 . Therefore, the choice of coupling grid may play an indirect role in storm energetics, with the 1 ocean grid providing a larger, more di\u21b5use source of surface heating to the boundary layer within the TC core.' 2 While we understand that the impact of enthalpy (sensible and latent heat) fluxes on TC structure and intensity are highly complex, we feel that prior research (e.g., Peng et al. [1999], Chan et al. [2001], Wang and Wu [2004]) has indicated that the spatial patterns and subsequent phasing of these quantities with other dynamical aspects of the storm (e.g., moisture convergence) are critically important to TC representation. While the wind stress appears to play a much larger role in the mean climatology, it is worth noting that the aspects of coupling discussed in this manuscript may also play roles in other TC processes.\nTitle: You should mention explicitly 'tropical cyclones' instead of 'extremes' since it is the only phenomena assessed in the study.\nWe have changed the title to 'Impact of surface coupling grids on tropical cyclone extremes in high-resolution atmospheric simulations' (see also Reviewer #2's comments regarding the title).\nPage 7987, Line 26: The expression ?prescribed ocean/ice model? seems to me as misleading. It would be better to mention the ocean grid instead. Indeed, what I understand is that observed SST and ice are prescribed via the coupler CLM as in a fully coupled model but no ocean/ice model is run. I suggest to reformulate the sentence.\nReply: Agreed. To address this, we have changed the referred section to read 'The first simulation uses prescribed ocean and sea ice conditions applied on a grid where the polar point is displaced over Greenland, which is at approximately 1 horizontal resolution (ne120 gx1v6). This is coarser than both the atmosphere and land models. The second simulation is identical to the first, except the ocean/ice conditions are applied on the same 0.25 (ne120) grid as the atmosphere and land (ne120 ne120).'\nThis paper is a short study that points out some spurious e\u21b5ects when the surface fluxes in an atmospheric GCM are computed on a coarser grid. In particular, this leads to wind stress vectors that are not always aligned with the surface wind, leading to a mis-representation of extreme events. The problem is demonstrated here with an atmosphere-only GCM, but it should remain present in coupled mode. This problem may not occur very frequently in practice : not all atmospheric models compute surface fluxes on the ocean grid, and it is probably relatively rare to have a coarser ocean resolution, especially now that surface datasets at 0.25? exist. Still, it is something to be aware of when designing the interface of a GCM (along with the converse issues for the ocean with a coarse atmospheric grid). The problem pointed out may not be immediately apparent as the mean state is not impacted, and the paper shows it in a clear and pedagogic way. It should therefore be a valuable addition to the literature on model development.\nReply: Thank you for your positive feedback.\nTitle could be more specific (fluxes on coarse surface grid... rather than \"coupling strategy\" when imposed SSTs are used here).\nWe have chosen to change the title to 'Impact of surface coupling grids on tropical cyclone extremes in high-resolution atmospheric simulations' in response to both this comment and one from Reviewer #1.\nMaybe a comment could be made in the intro or model section on why the fluxes are computed on the surface model grid in the first place ? (History of higher-resolution surface grid presumably). This would fit with the conclusion that fluxes should always be computed on the finest grid.\nReply: We agree. The first paragraph within the coupling section now reads 'Historically, this has not been the case, with the surface model (land, ocean, ice) grids being finer than their (more computationallyintensive) atmospheric counterparts. As computing capabilities improve, and smaller atmospheric grid spacings become more common in simulations utilizing prescribed SSTs and ice data forcing, it's no longer typical for the ocean resolution to be similar or finer in resolution in such setups. Therefore, having the atmospheric grid be the finest in the climate system is the default setup for many high-resolution configurations in CESM.' 3 Conclusion, first line: \"atmospheric extreme climatology\" is a bit awkward: distribution of extremes in atmospheric circulation ? Or just \"strength of tropical cyclones\"?\nReply: To address this, we have changed the passage to read 'This manuscript describes biases in the distribution of atmospheric extremes which arise from choice of ocean grid and coupling strategy in CESM.' Figure 5 : Legend does not explain panels (c,f ) type of simulation. Note that there are few di\u21b5erences between the (e,f ) panels only because the SST used has no smallscale structure; there would presumably be more impacts in the presence of oceanic front or eddies.\nReply: We have amended the caption to read '... Right panels (c,f) show version of 1 ocean grid where calculations are instead carried out on the finer atmospheric grid. ...' We have also added 'It should be noted that, as discussed earlier, the resolution of the SST forcing data set is 1 , which provides identical spatial forcing across all configurations. If SSTs were provided at the native resolution of each ocean grid, larger di\u21b5erences would be expected between the ne240 ne240 and ne240 gx1v6 reverse configurations due to additional small-scale forcing (such as ocean fronts and eddies) in the ne240 ne240 experiment.' to emphasize the second point. This paper discusses the sensitivity of tropical cyclone climatology to ocean coupling strategy in high-resolution configurations of the Community Earth System Model. Using two supported model setups, we demonstrate that the choice of grid on which the lowest model level wind stress and surface fluxes are computed may lead to differences in cyclone strength in multi-decadal climate simulations, particularly for the most intense cyclones. Using a deterministic framework, we show that when these surface quantities are calculated on an ocean grid that is coarser than the atmosphere, the computed frictional stress is misaligned with wind vectors in individual atmospheric grid cells. This reduces the effective surface drag, and results in more intense cyclones when compared to a model configuration where the ocean and atmosphere are of equivalent resolution. Our results demonstrate that the choice of computation grid for atmosphere/ocean interactions is non-negligible when considering climate extremes at high horizontal resolution, especially when model components are on highly disparate grids."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The aim of this paper is to emphasize the role of the model configuration in the computation of the atmosphere/ocean fluxes as well as their feedback on TCs.

It has been shown that GCMs can model TCs at horizontal resolutions of approximately 100 km grid spacing, albeit with limitations (e.g., Bengtsson et al., 2007; Knutson et al., 2010; Strachan et al., 2013) . As GCMs have advanced to even higher horizontal resolutions (i.e., \uf8ff 50 km) the simulated climatology of tropical cyclones has improved greatly (e.g., Oouchi et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009; Murakami et al., 2012; Manganello et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2012; Wehner et al., 2014; . Furthermore, the use of variable-resolution GCMs has shown to be useful for the study of regional TC climatologies at reduced computational cost compared to equivalent global high-resolution Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | simulations, providing further resources capable of pushing climate simulations to finer grid spacings (Zarzycki et al., 2014a; Zarzycki and Jablonowski, 2014) .\nRecently, intercomparisons have shown that the range of simulated TC climatology across different climate models can be large (Camargo, 2013; Walsh et al., 2015) . It has also been shown that, within individual GCMs, TC characteristics can vary greatly depending on model design choices. Various studies have documented the large uncertainty in TC simulations due to the choice of individual subgrid parameterizations, such as cumulus parameterizations (e.g., Kim et al., 2012; Reed and Jablonowski, 2011a; Lim et al., 2014) , while others have focused on differences due to changes in whole parameterization suites (Reed and Jablonowski, 2011b; . The dynamical core, the main fluid flow component of a GCM, has also been shown to be an important source of uncertainty for TC simulations, though less widely documented (Reed and Jablonowski, 2012; Zhao et al., 2012; .\nIn this manuscript we describe another mechanism through which simulated TC properties are influenced by model design choices, in particular, the manner in which the ocean and atmosphere are coupled within the climate system. Specifically, we will utilize the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), within the Community Earth System Model (CESM), to explore the impact of two different strategies for coupling to a prescribed ocean. CAM5 has shown increasing ability to model tropical cyclones at high horizontal resolutions of 0.25 Zarzycki and Jablonowski, 2014; Wehner et al., 2014 Wehner et al., , 2015 ) and a similar model setup will be used for part of this study.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 5 discusses the results and offers further insight into their implications."}, {"section_title": "Community Earth System Model", "text": "In this paper, we utilize CESM, which is a community climate model allowing for atmospheric simulations to be coupled to land, ocean, and ice models (Hurrell et al., 2013) . The atmospheric component, CAM5 (Neale et al., 2012) , is configured with the Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core. SE is the newest dynamical core available in CAM5 and is based upon continuous Galerkin spectral finite elements which are applied on a cubed-sphere grid (Taylor et al., 1997; Thomas and Loft, 2005; Taylor and Fournier, 2010) . In addition to attractive conservation characteristics (Taylor, 2011) , CAM-SE has shown appealing scaling properties since atmospheric primitive equations are solved locally on individual elements (Dennis et al., 2012; Evans et al., 2013) . The land model is the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.0 run in satellite phenology (SP) mode (Oleson et al., 2010) . While CESM also allows for coupling to dynamic ocean and ice models, all of the simulations here utilize prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and ice cover concentrations. Using data forcing for the ocean and ice models is a commonly-used configuration to minimize the computational cost associated with high-resolution atmospheric modeling (Walsh et al., 2015) . In the default CESM configuration, prescribed SSTs and ice are passed to the model on a 1 \u21e5 1 grid and internally interpolated to the particular ocean and ice grids."}, {"section_title": "Coupling within CESM", "text": "When all earth system model components operate on identical grids, vertical coupling (such as between the ocean surface and lowest level of the atmosphere) is straightforward.

The coupler utilizes remapping weights to regrid quantities which are needed across model components.

Generally, CESM has computed atmosphere/ocean fluxes on the ocean grid. Therefore, when coupling is required, these values are then conservatively remapped to the ocean grid (blue) (Fig. 1b) . Surface momentum stress (\u2327 , gray vectors) and sensible and latent heat fluxes (not shown) are calculated on the ocean grid using these remapped values (Fig. 1c ).

SSTs and ice coverage are applied using the monthly 1 Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST, Hurrell et al. (2008) ). While the ocean/ice model may operate on the 0.25 grid, all data is interpolated from the same 1 dataset. Therefore, the higher resolution ocean grid does not provide more spatial structure in surface forcing, isolating the effect of solely the resolution of the coupling calculations. Both simulations are integrated from 1980 to 2005. Taylor statistics for the 1980-2000 global-mean quantities for sea-level pressure (PSL), total precipitable water (TMQ), total precipitation rate (PRECT), 200 hPa zonal wind (U200), 850 hPa zonal wind (U850), 600 hPa relative humidity (RH600) and 500 hPa temperature (T500) are shown in Fig. 2 . The two simulations are compared to observational datasets including NCEP (Kalnay et al., 1996) (PSL, U200, U850, RH600, T500), MERRA (Rienecker et al., 2011 ) (TMQ), and TRMM (Huffman et al., 2007 ) (PRECT). The absolute distance from the origin (lower left) represents the magnitude of the spatial variability within the domain (as measured by normalized standard deviation) while the spatial correlation is plotted as the radial angle between the model marker and the origin. A comprehensive discussion of Taylor diagram analysis can be found in Taylor (2001) . Red dots highlight the climatology of the ne120_ne120 simulation while blue dots show the same for the ne120_gx1v6 simulation. This analysis is only concerned with the relative difference between the two simulations and, therefore, whether or not mean climatology is impacted by choice of coupling grid. A thorough analysis to understand why each parameter is modeled with their particular skill in CAM5 itself is beyond the scope of this paper. We do note, however, that the results are consistent with skill scores reported in previous CAM5 modeling studies, such as Bacmeister et al.

Given that the total number of storms is roughly equivalent between the two configurations, this signifies a shift in the overall intensity distribution towards stronger TCs Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | in the ne120_gx1v6 setup. :::: This ::: is :::::: further ::::::::::::: corroborated ::: by ::: the :::::: mean :::: TC :::::::::::: precipitation :::: rate To explore this further, Fig. 3 displays the minimum surface pressure versus maximum 10-m wind speed relationship for TCs in each simulation with a quadratic least squares fit shown as a solid line. IBTrACS observations are again included as a reference. To be consistent with the TC tracker, only storms that reach tropical storm strength in their lifetime are used. At low wind speeds (i.e., < 40 m s 1 ) the relationship between the minimum surface pressure and maximum wind speed for the two model simulations and observations compare well. However, at larger wind speeds the relationship between the two simulations diverges, consistent with the differences in TC counts in Table 1 . In particular, the ne120_gx1v6 simulation produces greater wind speeds at a given minimum pressure than the ne120_ne120 simulation, suggesting the ocean coupling resolution impact on tropical cyclone intensity is non-negligible, especially with respect to intense TCs. Figure 4 shows the number of annual 10-m TC wind exceedances in the 3-hourly model output for both category 3 and category 4 storm thresholds. These represent two of the most intense classifications of tropical cyclones, with maximum 10-m winds surpassing 50 and 59 m s 1 , respectively. The blue curve with open markers indicates the number of 3-hour samples within the TC trajectories which surpass each threshold in the simulation using the 1 ocean/ice grid (ne120_gx1v6). The red curve with filled markers represents the same for the simulation with the 0.25 ocean/ice grid (ne120_ne120). From the left panel, we see that for all years (except 1985 and 1988) , the simulation coupled to the coarser ocean grid produces a significantly greater frequency of category 3 level winds, with the average number of annual instances being approximately 6 times higher than when using the highresolution ocean grid. This behavior is even more pronounced in the right panel, where the ne120_gx1v6 simulation averages approximately 10 instances of category 4 level winds per year. However, this threshold is not exceeded at any point during the 25-year sample in the ne120_ne120 simulation.\nSince all aspects of the model configurations in Sect. 3 are identical except for the grid on which the prescribed SSTs and ice concentrations are passed to the other model components (and therefore the atmosphere/ocean exchange computation grid), we hypothesize that the marked difference in TC climatology is induced by the coupling strategy and difference in grid resolutions. To assess the differences in simulated TCs in a controlled, deterministic manner, we utilize two identical CAM setups to complete short-term forecast simulations of observed storms. These simulations utilize the new, variable-resolution capability of CAM-SE (Zarzycki et al., 2014b) .\nThe setup is similar to that used in the previous section, but the model is configured with a variable-resolution atmospheric grid with 0.125 (\u21e0 14 km, ne240) resolution over the Atlantic Ocean. Forecast simulations are initialized with a digitally-filtered atmospheric analysis from the National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). Observed SSTs on a 1 \u21e5 1 grid are derived from the NOAA High-resolution Blended Analysis (Reynolds et al., 2007) . The land surface is modeled by CLM 4.0 and is initialized with a state nudged to be in balance with the atmospheric initial conditions. The model setup and initialization are both thoroughly detailed in .\nAs in the climate simulations, the only difference between the two setups is the grid used by the data ocean and ice models. The first set of simulations uses the aforementioned displaced pole grid with an equivalent resolution of 1 (ne240_gx1v6) while the second uses an ocean grid identical to the atmospheric grid with an equivalent resolution of 0.125 (ne240_ne240). Since the SST and ice cover data are provided at coarser scales than the model interpolates to, any differences in the results again arise due to the differences in calculating of surface fluxes and momentum drag on the corresponding ocean grids.\nAfter initialization, each configuration is integrated for 8 days. (Fig. 5a,d) , with the 0.125 ocean grid in the center (Fig. 5b, e) . In Fig. 5a, b, d , e all calculations are done on the ocean grid. All fields are extracted from the atmospheric model component. The top panels depict instantaneous lowest model level wind (black vectors) as well as the surface frictional stress vector (red). In Fig. 5a , it is readily apparent that many instances exist where the vectors are not aligned. This results from the surface stress being calculated on the coarser ocean grid. This coarser information is then used to provide stress information at the higher resolution used by the atmospheric numerics (as in Fig. 1 ). In Fig. 5b , the wind and stress vectors are parallel (180 difference), indicating that the frictional drag is acting in direct opposition to the wind within the atmospheric dynamical core, which is the expected behavior from theory. The higher resolution ocean grid preserves the resolution of the surface wind field during stress calculations. Because of this, not only are the stress vectors properly aligned with the high-resolution ocean grid, the maximum magnitudes of the stress vectors are larger at the storm's radius of maximum wind in Fig. 5b when compared against a.\nThis highlights that maxima in the stress field at the atmospheric grid cell scale are conserved with the higher resolution ocean grid, whereas these maxima are \"smoothed\" in the calculation where wind is first averaged to the coarser ocean grid (Fig. 5a ). This is further evidenced by the fact that the integrated dot product (over a 3 \u21e5 3 domain centered over Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | the TC minimum surface pressure) of the two fields is approximately 20 % smaller in the simulations using the 1 ocean grid. Therefore, the use of the coarser ocean grid results in a misaligned, and therefore universally weaker, frictional force fed back to the atmospheric dynamics, leading to enhanced extreme wind speeds.\nThe cumulative surface heat (sensible plus latent) flux is shown on the bottom of Fig. 5 for the two storms at the same forecast time. It is clear that the coarser ocean grid (Fig. 5d) provides information back to the atmosphere with significantly less spatial structure than the 0.125 ocean grid (Fig. 5e ). While the difference in 5 \u21e5 5 integrated heat flux is relatively small (approximately 1%), it is clear that the spatial structure of the heat flux field is very different between the two model configurations. This may further play a :::\nThe :::::::: pattern :: of ::::::: surface intensification :::::::::: processes ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: (Peng et al., 1999; Chan et al., 2001; Wang and Wu, 2004 To conclusively verify that this discrepancy arises from the choice of coupling, we complete a third simulation, which is identical to the ne240_gx1v6 simulation, except coupling calculations are carried out on the higher-resolution atmospheric grid (ne240_gx1v6_reverse) instead of the ocean. If the TC behavior in the ne240_gx1v6 configuration is due to errors arising from carrying out computations on the coarser grid in the coupling system, we expect this to be primarily alleviated by ensuring coupling is carried out on the higher-resolution grid. This should result in maximum spatial resolution of the computed fields and no \"loss\" of information due to interpolation from fine to coarse and back to fine resolutions. Figure 5c , f show the same analysis as with the previous configurations. It is obvious that inverting the grid to ensure calculations of surface stresses and fluxes are done on the higher resolution grid (in this case, the atmosphere) results in a solution that looks much more similar to the configuration where both atmosphere and ocean are of high resolution (Fig. 5b, e) . We note that these two simulations (ne240_ne240 and ne240_gx1v6_reverse) are not fully identical due to the fact that remapping is still required in the ne240_gx1v6_reverse calcula-Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | tions. Examples of prominent similarities include the fact that surface stresses are stronger and aligned parallel to lowest model level wind vectors and that there is additional fine scale structure in the total surface flux field. atmospheric :::::::::: extremes : which arise from choice of ocean grid and coupling strategy in CESM. Since surface stress and flux calculations are carried out on the ocean grid, running the model with a coarser ocean than atmosphere presents problems with respect to tropical cyclone (TC) climatology. In particular, surface stress vectors which are passed back to the atmospheric dynamical core following coupling are not aligned with the surface wind due to being computed on a coarser grid. This allows winds near the cores of TCs to become stronger than if the stresses were computed at the same resolution of the atmosphere. Additionally, when surface fluxes are calculated on a coarser grid, the influxes of heat and moisture to the lowest levels of the atmosphere underneath the TC are structurally different, with these quantities being more diffuse and misaligned with the maximum surface wind, in contradiction to bulk aerodynamic flux theory. The issues outlined in the manuscript underscore that the choice of ocean grid when using prescribed SST and ice data to force a dynamic atmosphere is not trivial, even if the native resolution of this forcing data is relatively coarse. However, they are easy to correct for these configurations, particularly since applying coupled atmosphere-ocean calculations on the same grid is straightforward and computationally inexpensive. Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | More problematic adjustments may arise when coupling to a dynamical ocean model. The vast majority of coupled, dynamic simulations not only utilize differing resolutions between different model components, but also different numerical techniques and grids. Therefore, remapping between components is, in many cases, an absolute necessity. The obvious recommendation to alleviate coupling inconsistencies when it is not feasible to use identical grids is to calculate these quantities on the finest resolution grid of the coupled system. Performing coupling in this manner ensures that information passed back to a model component has not been interpolated to a resolution coarser than the component's native resolution during the coupling process. In addition, in integrated models which allow for multiple grid options, the choice of the model component defining the grid for these calculations should not be pre-configured for all cases, but rather, determined dynamically based on the various resolutions chosen for the particular model setup.\nHowever, we emphasize that, even when applying this suggestion, it is not clear that it is fully appropriate for coupled dynamical models to be run at highly disparate resolutions from one another, where processes interacting between components may be sufficiently non-linear that essentially averaging from a higher resolution grid is not the most appropriate mechanism. Further work will be required to determine whether or not this is the case. Additionally, this strategy is not elementary when variable-resolution grids are coupled to uniform grids, particularly where the finest and coarsest scales of the multi-resolution grid may straddle the grid scales of the uniform-resolution component. In these cases, the choice of \"finer\" grid in the atmosphere-ocean coupling will be different depending on the region of interest, and may require even more flexible frameworks, such as exchange grids (Balaji et al., 2006; Valcke et al., 2012) .\nOur results demonstrate that the mean climatology of the simulations presented here are essentially identical regardless of coupling strategy, highlighting that this impact only becomes readily apparent in the tail of the distributions of interest. However, with climate models being used more and more frequently for direct analysis of extreme events, including TCs, both in present climate and under future scenarios, this sensitivity of model-derived extremes may become more prevalent. This is especially relevant as atmospheric models 13 Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | Discussion Paper | continue to march forward with respect to horizontal resolution, and therefore, their ability to dynamically resolve phenomena at smaller and smaller spatial scales. Consideration of these impacts when utilizing high-resolution climate data for analysis is required and modifications to how the current generation of atmospheric models treats coupling between various earth system components in supported configurations may be necessary.
