[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Previous studies have found mixed results about cigarette and alcohol consumption patterns among rural-to-urban migrants. Moreover, there are limited longitudinal data about consumption patterns in this population. As such, this study aimed to compare the smoking and heavy drinking prevalence among rural, urban, and rural-to-urban migrants in Peru, as well as the smoking and heavy drinking incidence in a 5-year follow-up. Methods: We analyzed the PERU MIGRANT Study data from rural, urban, and rural-to-urban migrant populations in Peru. The baseline study was carried out in 2006-2007 and follow-up was performed five years later. For the baseline data analysis, the prevalence of lifetime smoking, current smokers, and heavy drinking was compared by population group using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the longitudinal analysis, the incidence of smoking and heavy drinking was compared by population group with risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate both PRs and RRs. Results: We analyzed data from 988 participants: 200 rural dwellers, 589 migrants, and 199 urban dwellers. Compared with migrants, lifetime smoking prevalence was higher in the urban group (PR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.64-3. 20), but lower in the rural group (PR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31-0.99). Compared with migrants, the urban group had a higher current smoking prevalence (PR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.26-4.16), and a higher smoking incidence (RR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.03-7.34). Current smoking prevalence and smoking incidence showed no significant difference between rural and migrant groups. The prevalence and incidence of heavy drinking was similar across the three population groups. Conclusions: Our results show a trend in lifetime smoking prevalence (urban > migrant > rural), while smoking incidence was similar between migrant and rural groups, but higher in the urban group. In addition, our results suggest that different definitions of smoking status could lead to different smoking rates and potentially different measures of association. The prevalence and incidence of heavy drinking were similar between the three population groups."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Cigarette and alcohol consumption are major causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Smoking is the cause of approximately six million deaths per year [1] secondary to the development of different cancers as well as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [2] . Alcohol consumption, on the other hand, is associated with more than 200 diseases and accidents, causing 5.1% of the global burden of disease [3] .\nRural-to-urban migrants are thought to increase their cigarette [4] [5] [6] [7] and alcohol [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] consumption after migration, not only because they usually migrate from low to high consumption settings, but also because they often suffer from high levels of stress and poor mental health, which are related with greater alcohol and cigarette consumption [10, 11] . Some studies, however, have found that certain rural-to-urban migrants do not consume more alcohol and cigarette products, and even consume less, probably due to a protective effect of rural backgrounds, or economic limitations that prevent substance purchase [12, 13] .\nMost of the published studies in rural-to-urban migrants have cross-sectional designs, and compare the prevalence of current smoking, alcohol intake, or alcohol intoxication between only two of the three population groups: migrants vs. rural [14] or vs. urban groups [7, 8, 15] . Few crosssectional studies have contrasted smoking and alcohol consumption in rural-to-urban migrants with their rural groups of origin and their urban counterparts: one study in India [9] , two studies in China [6, 16] , and one study with data from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa [17] . Their results suggest mixed estimates of smoking and alcohol use between rural, migrant and urban groups.\nAlthough cross-sectional data is important to evaluate the association of increased substance consumption between rural-to-urban migrants to their rural and urban counterparts, longitudinal data is necessary to better understand its epidemiology and identify appropriate preventive interventions. To our knowledge, only two longitudinal prospective studies in rural-to-urban migrants have assessed these behavioral risk factors. The first is a study in Tanzania that evaluated smoking rates and weekly alcohol consumption before and one-to-three months after migration [5] . The second is a study in Indonesia that evaluated smoking initiation and changes in smoking quantity among recent (<3 years) migrants [18] .\nSmoking and alcohol consumption are behaviors whose negative health impacts are closely related to the quantity and frequency of consumption. Yet, before quantifying units of intake, it is also important to address major patterns of consumption across rural, urban, and migrant groups to identify meaningful approaches to prevention.\nIn addition, epidemiological studies use many different definitions to address substance consumption, which inhibits an adequate comparison. For instance, the concept of \"current smoking\" has various definitions, and therefore various prevalence rates [19] . Therefore, it is also necessary to compare these definitions and evaluate their appropriateness of use in rural-to-urban migrant studies.\nIn summary, migrant populations appear to be at increased risk to consume harmful substances such as alcohol and tobacco. To guide regional policy in places of high-density rural-to-urban migration, local studies of substance use are necessary. As such, this study aimed to compare the prevalence of tobacco smoking and heavy drinking among rural, urban, and rural-tourban migrants in Peru, as well as the incidence of new smoking and new heavy drinking cases at 5-years follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "This is a secondary data analysis of the PERU MIGRANT Study.

Both the urban and migrant populations were taken from Las Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, a periurban coastal setting located in the south of Lima.\nIn San Jose de Secce, our rural setting, people usually work as farmers, with hard physical labor and few televisions. In comparison, in our urban setting, people usually work in service industries or factories, and spend their leisure time watching television. In addition, poverty rates and illiteracy are lower in our urban than our rural setting (18 vs 80%, and 2 vs 33%, respectively) [21] . Additional information, including a map of the settings, is available elsewhere [20] .\nTo differentiate rural and urban settings, we relied on population size, according to thresholds proposed by the Department of Agriculture's Rural-urban Continuum Codes of the United States, that have been extensively used [22, 23] . This institution define rural and urban areas as places with fewer or more than 2,500 inhabitants respectively. Accordingly, in 2006, our urban setting had over 350 thousands and our rural setting less than 1000 inhabitants.\nThe baseline study was conducted in 2006-2007 after a general census in both study settings. A single-stage random sampling, stratified by sex and age groups, was performed in all three population groups. Trained community health workers administered the questionnaires and collected anthropometric measurements as well as laboratory samples. During 2012-2013, a follow-up visit was carried out, which included a survey and anthropometric measurements."}, {"section_title": "Variables definition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cross-sectional outcomes", "text": "For the baseline analysis, the outcomes of interest were: lifetime smoking, current smoking, and heavy drinking.\nDifferent definitions of smoking status are currently used in other epidemiological studies. In order to compare these definitions, we calculated prevalence rates for each of our population groups using four of the most popular definitions across the literature (Table 1) . For instance, definition 1 is similar to the one used in the Global Adult Tobacco Survey [24] and UK Labour Force Survey [25] . Definition 2 is similar to the one used in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health of United States [19] . Definition 3 is similar to the one used in the CDC' National Health Interview Survey [26] . Definition 4 is similar to the one used by the New Zealand Ministry of Health [27] .\nAlthough the 100 cigarettes threshold has not been associated with increased clinical risks, it has been extensively used to pragmatically identify lifetime smokers (current or former smokers) and differentiate them from experimental or new-onset smokers, so we decided to use it [28] . In addition, since we are evaluating consumption patterns across two settings, the \"occasionally smoking\" term could be interpreted differently between people living in these diverse environmental settings. As such, we used the \"one-month smoking\" threshold to more objectively identify current smokers. Consequently, definition 4, which includes both 100-cigarettes and one-month smoking thresholds, was used to define lifetime smoking and current smoking outcomes for our research questions and statistical models. Heavy drinking was assessed by the question \"In the last year, how often have you consumed 6 or more standard alcohol drinks on one occasion?\" Those who answered \"monthly,\" \"weekly,\" or \"daily or almost daily\" were classified as \"heavy drinkers.\" One standard alcohol drink, as established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, is defined as a 12 oz (355 mL) glass of beer, a 5 oz (148 mL) cup of wine, or 1.5 oz (44.3 mL) of distilled spirits, [29] .\nIn our settings, people commonly smoke branded cigarettes, and drink either branded beer or artisanal ca\u00f1azo (sugarcane brandy) [30] . Ca\u00f1azo is considered as a distilled spirit, since its alcohol concentration is approximately 40%."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal outcomes", "text": "For the longitudinal analysis, we used two outcomes: new smokers and new heavy drinkers.

We also used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the number of daily cigarettes smoked among daily smokers according to population groups.\nFor cross-sectional analysis, we generated crude and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variance and estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in order to assess the associations between exposures (population groups, sex, age, education level, asset index, and PMH) and three dichotomous outcomes: lifetime smoking, current smoking, and heavy drinking. Adjusted models included all exposures mentioned.\nFor longitudinal analysis, we performed Poisson regression models to report risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI for two outcomes: incidence of new smokers and incidence of new heavy drinkers. For both associations, we generated crude and adjusted models using the same aforementioned exposures and confounders as in cross-sectional models.\nWe also made post-hoc analyses in the migrant group, which was categorized according to the time since first migration at the baseline survey (<15 years, 15 to 30 years, or >30 years). In each of these categories, prevalence and incidence rates of smoking and of heavy drinking were calculated.

The proportion of those having completed at least a year in secondary education was lower in the rural group, intermediate in the migrant group, and higher in the urban group (Table 2) .\nWe evaluated four smoking status definitions. The prevalence of never smoking was higher among the rural population than the migrant/urban populations, for all evaluated definitions. The prevalence of current smoking followed a trend (urban > migrant > rural) as per definitions 3 and 4 (which included the 100 cigarettes threshold), was higher in the rural group than in the migrant/urban groups as per definitions 1 and 2. The prevalence of current smoking in definition 1 (defined as having smoked occasionally or daily) was 21.6%, 33.3%, and 85.3% higher than the prevalence of current smokers in definition 2 (defined as having smoked in the last month), among urban, migrant, and rural subjects respectively ( Table 1) .\nThe prevalence of daily smoking was higher in the urban group, intermediate in the migrant group, and lower in the rural group.

This indicates that following on a process of internal migration, subjects are more exposed to smoking behaviors than rural dwellers, and experience more smoking. However, smoking incidence was not different between rural and migrant groups. In comparison, prevalence and incidence of heavy drinking were similar between rural, migrant and, urban groups. "}, {"section_title": "Smoking patterns", "text": "When comparing four \"current smoking\" definitions, it is clear that prevalence found with definitions that asked for \"occasionally or daily smoking\" tend to be higher than the prevalence found with definitions that asked for \"smoking in the last month\". Moreover, these differences seem to be higher among rural dwellers, suggesting that more objective definitions of current smoking are needed, especially in low-consumption settings. In addition, in definitions 1 and 2, which did not utilize the 100 cigarettes threshold, no trend was observed. Implying, perhaps, that secular changes are occurring, and rural dwellers have recently started smoking; thus, they endorsed smoking in the last month but denied smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Although not statistically significant, this seems to be reinforced by the higher, smoking incidence in the rural group.\nOur population has a low smoking prevalence, consistently with previous studies conducted in Peru [32, 33] . Conversely, prevalence of daily smoking in high income countries reaches 13.7% in United States [34] and 25% in Finland [35] . Among daily smokers, the mean of cigarettes per day consumed by our population was under five cigarettes per day, lower than in other Latin American cities as Santiago (Chile), Quito (Ecuador), Bogota (Colombia), and Mexico City [33] , and other countries as United States [26] and China [36] .\nSmoking prevalence and incidence rates were lower in migrants than in the urban population, which suggest that the rural background have a protective effect. Lifetime smoking was significantly higher in the migrant than in the rural group. This smoking pattern is similar to that found with Chinese rural-to-urban migrants [4] , where behavior habit adoption has been attributed to acculturation, stress [11] and poor mental health [37] . Conversely, in the adjusted analysis, PMH, a mental health status evaluation, was not associated with smoking prevalence or incidence. However, since our migrant group lived in an urban environment for an average of 32 years, it is possible we are not observing an association of PMH that is given only among more recent migrants. On the other hand, current smoking was not significantly different among rural and migrant groups, possibly due to the low prevalence of current smokers and the small sample size.\nSmoking prevalence rates followed a consistent trend in our population (urban > migrant > rural). We found four studies that also compared smoking prevalence rates between the rural-to-urban migrants, urban, and rural groups. A study in Yi migrants (China) found the same trend but only in men, while smoking prevalence among women was higher in the migrant group than in the rural and urban groups [6] . A multi-country study found that migrants had a higher ever smoking prevalence than rural dwellers in Mexico, while no significant difference was found in China, Ghana, India, Russia, and South Africa [17] . These mixed results may be explained by differences in time since migration, smoking patterns, or the acculturation process between population groups included in those studies and ours. In addition, studies in India [9] and China [16] found that male migrants had lower cigarette consumption than rural and urban males. In these last studies, the migrant group was composed of workers, so it is possible that selective migration of people with the best education and predisposition to improve their lifestyle would explain their low consumption, while migration in our study was influenced by political violence lived in Ayacucho [38, 39] which could have reduced this selective migration effect. From the longitudinal point of view, only two prospective studies evaluating smoking in rural-to-urban migrants were found. A study in Tanzania [5] compared current smoking rates before migration and one to three months after migration, and found a non-significant increase in smoking rates (from 16.2 to 23.5%) only in men, while no women reported smoking in either evaluation. Another study in Indonesia [18] followed-up recent migrants, approximately 65% migrating less than three years ago, and found no significant increase in smoking initiation, but a clear increase in the number of daily cigarettes smoked. These studies suggest a slight increase in smoking rates after migration, but give no information about risk in long-term settled migrants.\nWhile lifetime smoking prevalence was higher in migrants than in the rural population, smoking incidence was not significantly different between those populations. This may suggest that the risk of initiating smoking in migrants could increase during the first years post-migration, and later decrease over time. To evaluate this assumption, we made a post-hoc analysis in our migrant group, and found that prevalence rates of having smoked in the last month were 0.0, 14.9, and 11.3% among those who migrated <15, 15 to 30, and >30 years prior to the baseline assessment (Fisher's exact p = 0.244). Accordingly, incidence rates were 0.0, 3.5, and 1.3% in these sub-groups (Fisher's exact p = 0.334). These findings suggest a higher smoking risk at 15 to 30 years of migration."}, {"section_title": "Heavy drinking", "text": "The prevalence of heavy drinking in the last year was similar between the urban, migrant, and rural groups. Accordingly, studies that evaluated alcohol intake in Guatemala [14] and alcohol dependence in Canada [40] , found similar patterns between rural-to-urban migrant and rural groups. However, data from Tanzania [5] found that weekly alcohol consumption prevalence increased after migration, and studies assessing monthly drinking in Vietnam [7] and alcohol intoxication in China [15] found that rural-tourban migrants had higher rates than the urban population. Three previous studies have compared alcohol intake rates between the rural-to-urban migrants, urban, and rural groups. One of them [6] made in Yi migrants (China), found that migrants had similar prevalence rates of current alcohol use than rural and urban dwellers. The other study, also in China [16] , surveyed migrants recruited in workplaces and reported that they had higher alcohol intoxication rates than rural and urban dwellers. While the first study resembles our results, the second did not, possibly because their participants were workers, younger (mean age 25 years), and therefore possibly more prone to alcohol drinking, than our migrant group with mean age of 48 years. The third study found similar alcohol use between rural and migrant groups in Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa, while migrants had lower alcohol use than rural dwellers in China [17] .\nWe only found one longitudinal study that evaluated alcohol intake in rural-to-urban migrants in Tanzania, which found that weekly alcohol consumption has a non significant increase after migration [5] . In our longitudinal analysis, incidences of heavy drinking were similar between the three study groups. As for smoking, we verified whether heavy drinking increases after the first years of migration in post-hoc analysis in our migrant group, and found that prevalence rates of heavy drinking were 18.2, 7.1, and 8.6% among those who migrated <15, 15 to 30, and >30 years previous to baseline assessment (Fisher's exact p = 0.270). However, incidence rates were 0.0, 3.9, and 0.8 in these sub-groups (Fisher's exact p = 0.099). These findings, along with the Tanzania study, are consistent with a non-significant increase in heavy drinking in the first years after migration.\nSubjects in our rural and urban settings, although living in different socio-environmental contexts, had similar heavy drinking rates. This may reflect similar heavy drinking manners in our urban and rural populations, along with similar alcohol access besides economic differences, probably because low resource individuals in our settings can purchase low-cost artisanal alcoholic drinks [30] . Some studies suggest that recent migrants may present migration-related psychological distress, which was associated to higher alcohol consumption [41, 42] . However, PMH, a mental health status evaluation, was not associated to heavy drinking in late-term migrants.\nClassically, smoking has been associated with alcohol intake and with heavy drinking [43, 44] . However, in Peru, alcohol intake prevalence is much higher than smoking prevalence [45] , and our results show that increasing smoking rates in migrants are not accompanied by an increase in heavy drinking rates. A possible explanation is that low-resource populations do not have enough money to buy cigarettes, but they can manufacture low-cost artisanal alcohol drinks [30] . Accordingly, asset index was associated with the prevalence of lifetime smoking, but not with the prevalence of heavy drinking."}, {"section_title": "Public health relevance", "text": "Our results present smoking and heavy drinking patterns in a rural-to-urban internal migration in Peru, which may be similar to other rural-to-urban internal migrations in Peru and other developing countries.\nOur results indicate that migrants are at risk to increase their smoking patterns, especially in the first years after migration. Thus, smoking interventions in migrant populations appear more beneficial if oriented to prevent smoking initiation rather than cessation. These observations are not against major tobacco control policies that remain to be sustained as beneficial public health policies at the country-level [46] . Post-hoc analyses show not significant lower smoking rates and higher heavy alcohol drinking rates among those who migrated in the past 15 years. Future studies in recent migrants could identify which would be the best moment for preventive interventions in smoking and alcohol consumption.\nIt is also important to take into account that Peruvian rural settings could have a higher use of artisanal alcohol distilled drinks with high alcohol concentration [30] , which may have a higher concentration of aliphatic alcohol [47] , and therefore represent an additional risk of liver damage [48] ."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "This study has assessed smoking and heavy drinking in well-defined rural, urban, and migrant populations. This allows a better understanding of the influence of ruralurban migration in the consumption patterns, and can be used to improve health interventions targeted towards these migrants.\nHowever, some limitations deserve consideration. First, all the variables studied were self-reported, with the inherent social desirability bias. Nevertheless, previous studies in other countries reinforce use of selfreporting as a reliable method to measure the smoking status [49] [50] [51] and alcohol consumption [52, 53] in the general population. Second, there are some confounders that we could not address, such as smoking/drinking status before migration, or reason of migration. Finally, some studies have reported that female migrants may be at higher risk of cigarette [54, 55] and alcohol consumption [56] compared to males. However, since we did not have enough cases to stratify by sex, we could not explore this.\nIn addition, we have to highlight that the smoking status categorization we used in this study is primarily driven by frequency of consumption (having consumed cigarettes in the last month), without considering the amount component (how many cigarettes have been smoked). Thus, in our population, in which the number of cigarettes consumed is low, current smokers will have a lower smoking-related risk than current smokers in other countries with high smoking prevalence [57] . Also, our results suggest an overestimation of current smoking rates among rural dwellers when using definitions based on \"occasionally/daily smoking\". Thus, studies using this definition may find different smoking rates and different measures of association than those found in our study."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our results show that migrants have a higher smoking prevalence than the rural population, but lower than the urban population, suggesting a potential protective effect of being exposed to a rural background.
