[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Health insurance provides a vital link between the health and economic well-being of individuals and households by reducing the cost burden of health care and improving an individual's access to health care services. In the United States, health care expenditures rose to $3 trillion in 2014, or about 17% of GDP (nearly $9,523 per capita). Historically, employer-sponsored health plans have been the mechanism by which the majority of nonelderly individuals, including those in farm households, receive health coverage. As health care expenditures have increased, employers have attempted to shift costs onto employees, offering more high-deductible plans. Consequently, the cost burden of health care and health insurance has shifted more and more to households. Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), individuals were faced with rising health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, declining coverage for pre-existing health conditions, and increasing costs for purchasing individual, self-employed or small business health insurance plans. Farm households have additional challenges related to obtaining health insurance coverage. Of approximately 2 million US farms, 98% are classified as family farms that are operated by a self-employed farmer. In many of these farm households, either the operator or spouse worked off-farm and thereby gained access to lower-cost employer-provided health insurance. \uf0b7 Between 2011 and 2015, among those with incomes less than 400% of the federal poverty line (FPL) in the United States, the rate of uninsurance among civilians between the age of 18 and 64 fell from 30.2% to 19.2%."}, {"section_title": "Since 2011, uninsurance rates have declined for all specializations except dairy", "text": "Source: Calculated by USDA Economic Research Service using data from the 2011 and 2015 USDA Agriculture Resource Management Survey. \uf0b7 The number of families with at least one uninsured member has fallen across most commodities, although the difference is not statistically significant in most cases. \uf0b7 Production of certain commodities, such as dairy, are time intensive and leave little time for off-farm work, where many farm household receive their health insurance. \uf0b7 For non-elderly farm households, off-farm employment continues to be the primary source of insurance, utilized by over half of all farms. \uf0b7 Post-ACA, farmers reporting insurance from an employer increased, while fewer reported receiving insurance from multiple sources. \uf0b7 While a plurality of commercial farm households, receive insurance from the off-farm employment of a family member, nearly are covered under a policy provided by the farming operation. \uf0b7 Nearly one in four commercial farm households purchase insurance directly, a significantly higher proportion than other farm households and non-farm households. \uf0b7 Between 2011 and 2015, the rate of uninsurance fell sharply for farm household with neither the operator nor spouse working off-farm. \uf0b7 Across both years, insurance rates were lowest when the operator or operator and spouse works off-farm, and highest when neither the operator nor spouse do. \uf0b7 Out-of-pocket premium expenses are highest for households with direct purchase insurance \uf0b7 Premium expenses rose between 2011 and 2015 for households purchasing both employer and direct health insurance plans The effect of the ACA on health insurance coverage"}, {"section_title": "0%", "text": "The objective of this regression analysis is to investigate how farm household health insurance coverage has changed between 2011 and 2015 (pre and post-ACA implementation).

Specifically: \uf0b7 Farm households living in Medicaid expansion states 2.3% less likely to have any person living in the household without health insurance (marginal effect at the mean of the data) \uf0b7 Farm households living in marketplace expansion states 4.4% less likely to have any person living in the household without health insurance (marginal effect at the mean of the data) \uf0b7 Uninsurance rates were higher for larger households and households operating smaller farms. \uf0b7 Households producing certain commodities, such as dairy, poultry, and high-value crops were less more likely to have uninsured household members, even after controlling for other factors."}]
