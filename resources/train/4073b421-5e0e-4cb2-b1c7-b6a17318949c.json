Greenwood, Chair", "text": "Advisory Committee Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel This report profiles the demographic and employment characteristics of doctoratelevel scientists and engineers in the United States in a descriptive manner. The data presented in the report were collected through the 1995 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), twelfth in a series of surveys initiated in 1973 by the National Research Council (NRC) in response to the needs of the federal government for demographic and employment information on scientists and engineers trained at the doctoral level. This survey is sponsored by NSF, NIH, and DOE. The purpose of the SDR, since its inception, has been to estimate the number of people holding research doctorates from U.S. institutions in science and engineering who reside in the United States and to characterize their demographic and employment patterns. The sampling frame for the SDR is the Doctorate Records File (DRF), a census of all research doctorates earned in the United States since 1920. The SDR sample for 1995 included 49,829 doctorate-level scientists and engineers, drawn from a population of 594,300. This report focuses on those doctorates who earned their degrees in a science or engineering field from a U.S. institution between January 1942 and June 1994 and were age 75 or younger and residing in the United States in April 1995. The estimated size of this population is 542,500. This profile report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 describes the size and composition of the doctorate-level scientist and engineer population, including such characteristics as gender, race/ethnicity, citizenship, and age. Chapters 2 and 3 profile the employment status of these doctorates in 1995. Special attention is given to the academic sector. Chapter 4 focuses on postdoctoral appointments held by doctoral scientists and engineers, and Chapter 5 covers second jobs held. Chapter 6 presents data on changes in employment for the population since 1993. Chapter 7 presents data on articles published, papers presented at conferences, and inventions patented by doctoral scientists and engineers. Chapter 8 describes professional development activities. Appendix A discusses survey methods and outcomes, including response rates, sampling and nonsampling errors, and weighting procedures. Appendix B contains a copy of the survey cover letter and questionnaire. Appendix C provides a description of terms used in the text and tables. Appendix D is a list of the Ph.D. fields covered by the SDR and aggregated into the broad groups shown in this report.

Managing/supervising as a primary work activity ranged from a high of 15 percent for health science and engineering doctorates to a low of 7 percent for computer sciences doctorates. As expected, some activities were concentrated in certain fields: 48 percent of psychology doctorates were primarily engaged in professional services; computer applications was the primary activity for 24 percent of computer sciences Ph.D.s; and 20 percent of engineers were primarily doing development/design. The proportion reporting applied research as the primary work activity declined as years since the doctorate increased, from 26 percent for recent Ph.D.s (those with 5 years or less since the doctorate) to 16 percent for those more than 15 years since doctorate award (see Table 13)."}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "On the other hand, the proportion primarily teaching grew as time since the Ph.D. increased, from 19 percent for recent Ph.D.s to 29 percent for those with more than 25 years since the degree.

The remaining doctorates employed in academe were adjunct faculty members (2 percent), held some other position (2 percent), or responded that rank was not applicable to their position or at their institution (12 percent) (see Table 21). The highest proportion of full professors was in mathematical sciences (46 percent); the lowest was in computer sciences (10 percent). Since 95 percent of the computer sciences doctorates graduated within the past 15 years, it is not surprising that the proportion of full professors in this field was low. Concentrations of associate and assistant professors were highest in computer sciences (82 percent) and health sciences (62 percent) and lowest in physics/astronomy (29 percent). Doctorates in physics/astronomy and earth/atmospheric/marine sciences said rank was not applicable more frequently than doctorates in any other field (25 percent and 20 percent, respectively). This might be explained by the fact that higher than average proportions of Ph.D.s in these two fields were working in universityaffiliated research institutions. Of those with 5 years or less since the Ph.D., only 2 percent were full professors and 61 percent were assistant professors. Between 6 and 15 years since the doctorate, 14 percent were full professors and 41 percent had become associate professors.

The gap widened with time and after 25 years, only 55 percent of women were full professors compared with 78 percent of men. It should be noted that these comparisons are made by years since doctorate, rather than years in the work force. Women are likely to have more career interruptions than men, which could account for some of the observed disparities.

As in the previous section on faculty rank, those on postdoctoral appointments were excluded from the analysis in this section. Mathematical sciences had the highest proportion with tenure, 72 percent, and the proportions for both agricultural/environmental sciences and social sciences were higher than average, 63 percent for each. While doctorates in computer sciences had the lowest proportion with tenure (42 percent), a much higher than average proportion of these doctorates were on tenure track, 45 percent compared to 18 percent overall. These figures reflect the relative youth of the doctorates in this field. Achievement of tenure is directly corelated with years since doctorate. At years or less since the Ph.D., only 6 percent had tenure. At 6 to 15 years since the doctorate, 47 percent had tenure. By the time 16 to 25 years had passed, 77 percent had tenure, and this proportion increased to 82 percent for those with more than 25 years since the doctorate (see Table 24). Women with 5 years or less since the doctorate held tenure in higher proportions than men from the same cohort, 8 percent compared with 5 percent. After 5 years, however, the proportion of men with tenure was between 13 and 14 percent higher than for women in each cohort.

Doctorates in psychology were most likely to hold a second job (33 percent), followed by doctorates in health and social sciences (21 and 19 percent, respectively) (see Table 30). The occupation of the second job was most frequently scientist (44 percent), followed by postsecondary teachers of science or engineering (20 percent). Another 19 percent were in \"other\" occupations which included such diverse categories as artists/broadcasters/entertainers/writers, farmers/foresters/fishermen, sales and marketing occupations, and service occupations.

Sixty-six percent of Ph.D.s holding second jobs said those jobs were closely related to their doctoral degrees. In psychology this proportion was 82 percent. For all science and engineering doctorates with second jobs, 15 percent said the second job was not related to their doctoral degree.

Under examination here are those science and engineering doctorates employed in April 1995. Of these, 74 percent were employed in 1993 and did not change either employer or job in the interim. Ten percent changed both employer and job, while 5 percent changed employer only and another 7 percent changed job only. Five percent reported that they were not employed in April 19938 (see Table 33). Doctorates in computer sciences were most likely to have made any type of employer and/or job change (32 percent). Change rates for all other fields were between 18 and 24 percent.  Computer sciences doctorates were also most likely to change both employer and job (19 percent), while mathematical and agricultural/environmental sciences doctorates were least likely to have done so (7 percent). Changes in employer ranged from 12 percent in both agricultural/environmental and social sciences to 17 percent in health sciences and 24 percent in computer sciences. (Employer changes include those doctorates who changed both employer and job and those who changed employer only.) Computer sciences doctorates also made job changes most frequently (27 percent). For other fields, job changes ranged from 13 percent in mathematical sciences to 20 percent for chemistry. (Job changes include those doctorates who changed both job and employer and those who changed job only.) The reason cited most frequently by science and engineering doctorates for changing job or employer was \"pay, promotion opportunities\" (52 percent). Computer, agricultural/environmental, and health sciences doctorates were more likely than those in other fields to give this reason (between 59 and 60 percent), while physics/astronomy Ph.D.s were least likely (42 percent). The second most cited reason was working conditions (28 percent) and the third was job location (21 percent) (see Table 34). 3 7 31 7 ARTICLES, PAPERS, AND PATENTS Productivity of science and engineering Ph.D.s can be measured by the numbers of published articles, presented papers, and applications for patents."}, {"section_title": "Articles", "text": "Sixty-three percent of science and engineering.Ph.D.s had an article published in a refereed journal between April 1990 and April 1995. The mean number of articles published was 4.7 for all science and engineering doctorates (see Table 35). Publication of articles varied by field. The mean number of articles ranged from a low of 2.8 for doctorates in psychology to a high of 7.0 for doctorates in biological sciences. Ph.D.s in biological and earth/atmospheric/marine sciences were the most likely to have published at least one article (78 and 77 percent, respectively). Twenty-one percent of doctorates in biological sciences had more than 10 published articles during the five-year period compared to 12 percent for all science and engineering doctorates. The least likely to have published were psychology Ph.D.s (44 percent). By sector, the mean number of articles was 6.7 for science and engineering doctorates employed in educational institutions, 4.4 for those in the nonprofit sector or governmental sector, 2.4 for those in private firms, and 1.1 for the selfemployed. Those most likely to have published at least one article were science and engineering doctorates in educational institutions (78 percent) and those least likely were the self-employed (28 percent). For all science and engineering doctorates holding academic positions, the mean number of articles published between April 1990 and April 1995 was 6.9, and 79 percent had published at least one article. Full professors had the highest mean number of published articles (9.2). More than one-quarter had published more than 10 articles. Adjunct faculty and instructors/lecturers had the lowest mean number of articles (3.2 and 3.0, respectively) (see Table 36). By contrast, those holding postdoctoral appointments were the most likely to have published at least one article (94 percent). About 77 percent of full professors had published at least one article, compared to 61 percent of instructor/lecturers and 58 percent of adjunct faculty. By tenure status, those with tenure had the highest mean number of articles published (8.2). Postdoctoral appointees, who were the most likely to have had at least one article published (94 percent), had a lower mean number of articles (5.4). Those for whom tenure was not applicable had the lowest mean number of articles (5.1) and were the least likely to have published (68 percent). 3 9 Papers Seventy-three percent of science and engineering Ph.D.s had authored or coauthored papers for presentation at regional, national, or international conferences between April 1990 and April 1995. The mean number of papers presented was 6.4 overall (see Table 35). Variances in the number of papers produced for conferences by field, sector, academic position, and tenure status were similar to those in the number of articles published (see above). An exception was that doctorates in computer and earth/atmospheric/marine sciences were most likely to have authored a conference paper (86 and 85 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Patents", "text": "The productivity of science and engineering doctorates can also be examined by looking at the number of patent applications on which they were named, the number of patents granted, and the number of patents that were commercialized. Overall, 12 percent said they had been named as an inventor on a patent application between April 1990 and April 1995 (see Table 37). The number of times science and engineering doctorates were named as an inventor on a patent varied by field. Almost no social science or psychology Ph.D.s were named as an inventor on a patent application (less than 1 percent for each). Other fields with a low, percentage of doctorates named as inventor included mathematical sciences (4 percent), earth/atmospheric/marine sciences (5 percent), health sciences (6 percent), and agricultural/envirimmental sciences (8 percent). Those fields with a high percentage named on a patent application were chemistry (31 percent) and engineering (25 percent). Of those who had been named as an inventor on a patent application between April 1990 and April 1995, 59 percent had been named on 1 to 2 patent applications, 36 percent on 3 to 10 applications, and 5 percent had been named on 10 or more. However, 30 percent had no patents granted, while 46 percent had 1 to 2 granted, 21 percent had 3 to 10 granted, and 4 percent had 10 or more granted. Ph.D.s in chemistry and physics/astronomy had the highest rates of success in obtaining patents (79 and 78 percent, respectively), followed by engineering doctorates (72 percent). An interesting follow-on question is whether the patents granted resulted in commercialized products or processes or were licensed. Overall, 52 percent of those granted patents said that their patents had been licensed or commercialized. Thirteen percent of all those who had been granted a patent indicated that more than 2 of their patents had been commercialized or licensed.

There was considerable variation by field. High percentages of Ph.D.s in earth/atmospheric/marine sciences (59 percent), social sciences (52 percent), and agricultural/environmental sciences (50 percent) had worked or done research outside the United States. Percentages were relatively low for health sciences (29 percent) and psychology (20 percent) (see Table 39). For those who traveled outside the United States, the length of their last trip for work or research was typically one month or less: 22 percent traveled for less than a week and 43 percent for 7 to 30 days. Another 19 percent traveled for 1 to 6 months and 17 percent for more than 6 months. Biological sciences, chemistry, and physics/astronomy had the highest percentages traveling for more than 6 months (between 19 and 20 percent). For those not working or conducting research outside the United States, the reason most often cited (39 percent) was \"not relevant to my career.\" Other principal reasons for not traveling were \"family-related reasons\" (37 percent) and \"no time\" (36 percent). Also about one-third said they were \"unaware of funding available\" for work or research outside the United States. The reason most often cited for not working or conducting research outside the United States varied by field. Computer science doctorates were most likely to say they had \"no.time\" (47 percent); psychology doctorates were most likely to say it was \"not relevant\" (45 percent); and computer, health, and biological sciences doctorates were most likely to cite \"family-related reasons\" (between 41 and 42 percent). Only 16 percent of scientists and engineers who had not worked or conducted research outside the United States said they were deterred by a \"lack of foreign language skills\" or that they were \"concerned about losing my place in U.S. job market.\""}, {"section_title": "Work-Related Training", "text": "Fifty-two percent of science and engineering doctorates attended work-related workshops, seminars, or training in the year leading up to the survey (this excludes college courses or general sessions at professional meetings). By field, participation in work-related training ranged from a low of 39 percent among Ph.D.s in physics/astronomy to a high of 72 percent among psychology doctorates (see Table 40). By and large, the training in which science and engineering Ph.D.s participated was technical training in their occupational field. This was true for 78 percent of all who participated in work-related training, with variations by field from a low of 70 percent in physics/astronomy to 92 percent in psychology.

For those who took courses or enrolled in school, the most frequently cited reason for doing so was to gain further skills (63 percent). This ranged from a low of 49 percent for mathematical sciences doctorates to highs of 77 and 80 percent for agricultural/environmental and health sciences doctorates, respectively. Personal interest was the second most frequently listed reason (52 percent). Mathematical sciences doctorates were most likely to cite this reason (64 percent). For 45 percent of doctorates, their employers paid the school-related costs associated with taking courses. Employers were most likely to pay the costs of courses taken by engineering Ph.D.s (55 percent) and least likely to pay the costs of courses taken by psychology Ph.D.s (34 percent).

Phase 1 consisted of two mailings of the survey questionnaire with a reminder postcard between the mailings. The first mailing was in May 1995 and the second (using Priority Mail) in July 1995. To encourage participation, all survey, materials were personalized with the respondent's name and address. The mail survey achieved a response rate of about 62 percent. Phase 2 consisted of conducting computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) on a 60-percent sample of nonrespondents to the mail survey (the CATI subsample). Telephone numbers were located for about 90 percent of the subsample and interviews were completed with 63 percent. Telephone interviewing was conducted between November 1995 and February 1996."}, {"section_title": "Data Preparation", "text": "As completed mail questionnaires were received, they were logged into a receipt control system that kept track of the status of all cases. Coding staff then carried out a variety of checks and prepared the questionnaires for data entry. Specifically, they resolved incomplete or contradictory answers, reviewed \"other specify\" responses for possible backcoding to a listed response, and assigned numeric codes to open-ended questions (e.g., employer name). A coding supervisor validated the coders' work. Once cases were coded, they were sent to data entry. The data entry program contained a full complement of range and consistency checks for entry errors and inconsistent answers. The range and consistency checks were also applied to the CATI data via batch processing. Further computer checks were performed to test for inconsistent values; these were corrected and the process repeated until no inconsistencies remained. At this point, the survey data file was ready for imputation of missing data. As a first step, basic frequency distributions were produced to show nonresponse rates to each questionthese were generally less than 3 percent, with the exception of salary, which was 6 percent. Two methods for imputation were adopted. The first, cold decking, was used mainly for demographic variables that are static, i.e., not subject to change. Using this method, historical data provided by respondents in previous years were used to fill a missing response. In cases where no historical data were available, and for nondemographic variables (such as employment status, primary work activity, and salary), hot decking was used. Hot decking involved creating cells of cases with common characteristics (through the cross-classification of auxiliary variables) and then selecting a donor at random for the case with the missing value. As a general rule, no data value was imputed from a donor in one cell to a recipient in another cell. The next phase of the survey process involved weighting the survey data to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection to the sample and to adjust for the effects of unit nonresponse. The first step was the construction of sample weights, which were calculated as the inverse of the probability of selection, taking into account all stages of the sample selection process over time. Sample weights varied within cells because different sampling rates were used depending on the year of selection and the stratification in effect at that time. The second step was to construct a combined weight, which took into account the subsampling of nonrespondents at the CATI phase. All respondents received a combined weight, which for mail respondents was equal to the sample weight and for CATI respondents was a combination of their sample weight and their CATI subsample weight. The third step was to adjust the combined weights for unit nonresponse. (Unit nonresponse occurs when the sample member refuses to participate or cannot be located.) Nonresponse adjustment cells were created using poststratification. Within each nonresponse adjustment cell, a weighted nonresponse rate was calculated. This weighted nonresponse rate took into account both mail and CATI nonresponse. The nonresponse adjustment factor was the inverse of this weighted response rate. The initial set of nonresponse adjustment factors was examined and, under certain conditions, some of the cells were collapsed if use of the adjustment factor would create excessive variance. The final weights for respondents were calculated by multiplying their respective combined weights by the nonresponse adjustment factor. Estimates in this report were developed by summing the final weights of the respondents selected for each analysis."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "The unweighted response rate, which is calculated as total returns divided by total sample, was 76 percent. The weighted response rate takes into account the different probabilities for selection to the sample and the CATI subsample and is calculated as the total returns multiplied by their combined weight divided by the total sample cases multiplied by their sampling weights. The weighted response rate was 85 percent. The unweighted response rate is a measure of how well the data collection methodology worked in obtaining responses, while the weighted response rate is an indicator of the potential for nonresponse bias and as such is a somewhat better indicator of data quality."}, {"section_title": "Reliability", "text": "The statistics in this report are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error.

Since 1973, we have sponsored this important biennial survey of people who earned doctorates in the United States. It helps government, businesses, and academic institutions do a better job of ensuring sufficient numbers of highly educated personnel in a variety of fields. We have asked the National Research Council to conduct this survey for us to take advantage of their experience in issues involving human resources. The letter from Dr. Alberts will explain more about this survey and our reasons for contacting you. I would greatly appreciate your participation in this important effort. I am writing to ask for your help with the 1995 Survey of Doctorate Recipients. This is an important biennial study of highly educated and trained persons, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, and conducted by the National Research Council. You have been chosen for this study as part of a scientifically selected sample of individuals holding doctoral degrees. Your response is needed whether or not you are employed, living in the United States, or working in your field of degree. The results of this study will be used by government and academic institutions to make decisions in such areas as graduate student support and R&D funding; to anticipate surpluses or shortages in personnel; and to study the relationship between graduate education and career outcomes. Results from earlier studies have been used to identify trends in faculty composition, in time spent teaching and doing research, and in characteristics of academic and nonacademic employment.
