[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and a specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. Results: In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid, and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid:CA, which reflects 7a-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles. Discussion: We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut-liver-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia in old age affecting over 40 million people worldwide [1] . There are currently no therapies to prevent or slow down AD progression, highlighting our incomplete knowledge of disease mechanisms and the need for new drug targets. A large number of biochemical processes are affected in AD and genes implicated in AD highlight the possible roles for lipid processing, immune function, phagocytosis, (innate) immunity and neurotransmitter function, and biological pathways that may affect metabolism [2, 3] . Recent AD hypotheses implicate viral and bacterial contributions to disease pathogenesis [4] [5] [6] .\nBidirectional biochemical communication between the brain and the gut contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases [7] [8] [9] [10] . The gut microbiome and the host collaboratively produce a large array of small molecules that impacts human health [11, 12] . Recently, a role for the gut microbiome in motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease has been highlighted [13] , and several animal models of AD showed a possible role of gut bacteria in amyloid-b pathology [14, 15] . The APP transgenic mouse model of AD had a drastically altered gut microbiome composition compared to wild-type mice [15] . Other studies linked proinflammatory bacteria, such as gram-negative producers of neurotoxic lipopolysaccharides, to brain amyloidosis and systemic inflammation, a central feature of AD [16, 17] . These studies suggest microbial dysbiosis or imbalance could potentially contribute to AD pathogenesis.\nCholesterol metabolism in the liver is thought to play a key role in AD [18] . In fact, many cholesterol metabolism-related genes (e.g., BIN1, CLU, PICALM, ABCA7, ABCG1, and SORL1) are among the top AD susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies [2, 19] . Cholesterol is cleared through production of bile acids (BAs). Primary BAs, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA), are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, conjugated with glycine or taurine, secreted into the gallbladder via the bile salt export pump, and transported to the intestine to be metabolized by gut bacteria (Fig. 1) . Intestinal anaerobic bacteria deconjugate the liver-derived BAs through the action of bile salt hydrolases to their respective free BAs. Subsequently, anaerobe bacteria convert primary BAs to the secondary BAs. That is, CA is converted to deoxycholic acid (DCA). CDCA is converted to lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid through 7a or 7b-dehydroxylation, respectively [20, 21] . In the terminal ileum and colon, BAs are reabsorbed by the enterocytes and released into the portal vein for return to the liver where they are conjugated to produce their glycine and taurine forms.\nBeyond BAs' role in cholesterol clearance, BAs are major regulators for maintaining energy homeostasis through Fig. 1 . Bile acid synthesis and cholesterol clearance pathway. Regulation of bile acid synthesis by feedback mechanism and bile acid transport through enterohepatic circulation (A and B). In the liver, the bile acids (CDCA, DCA, LCA, CA) activate FXR that inhibits (via a repressor SHP, not shown here) the ratelimiting enzyme CYP7A1. The bile acids via FXR/SHP also inhibit the influx transporter NTCP and induce BSEP and canalicular bile acid secretion. In the intestine, bile acids, via FXR, inhibit the uptake transporter ASBT, decreasing absorption and increasing basolateral secretion into portal circulation by inducing OSTa and b. Bile acid activated FXR in the intestine, which also exerts inhibition on CYP7A1 in the liver via FGF19 pathway. At the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, transporters OSTa and b, and also MRP3 and MRP4, secrete bile acids into the systemic circulation.

BAs also modulate the gut microbiome [22, 23] and seem to be indicators of gut dysbiosis. Both primary and secondary BAs are present in the brains of mice and possibly humans with evidence that they cross the blood-brain barrier [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Some BAs such as ursodeoxycholic acid exert beneficial effects while others are known to be cytotoxic [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . In particular, DCA's toxicity has been associated with modulating apoptosis involving mitochondrial pathways in a variety of tissues and cell types [35] [36] [37] [38] .\nIn recent pilot human studies, BA profiles were shown to be affected in AD [26, [38] [39] [40] [41] . Here, we used a targeted metabolomics approach to evaluate BA profiles in a large cohort of 1464 individuals enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) where rich clinical, imaging, and genetic data exist. A schematic representation of study design is shown in Fig. 2 . We used these data to address the following:\n1. Investigate if BA profiles are altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients and if these differences are related to cognitive decline. 2. Use ratios of BAs to pinpoint possible enzymatic alterations in the liver and in the gut microbiome that directly contribute to altered BA profile. 3. Investigate whether immune-related AD genomewide significant genes affect levels of BAs in circulation as markers for altered gut microbiome function.\nIn a subsequent study, we evaluated correlations between BAs and ATN (amyloid, tau, and neurodegenerative) biomarkers of AD including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain atrophy, and brain glucose metabolism."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study cohorts and samples", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI baseline samples", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were downloaded from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

Notably, six of the 13 genes have been previously linked via genetic studies to AD (ABCA7) or AD phenotypes, including cognitive decline and CSF protein levels (LRRC7, CYCS, GPC6, FOXN3, and CNTNAP4)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we interrogated a possible role for BA end products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance in cognitive changes in AD. Using stored blood samples from ADNI studies, we established that BA profile is significantly altered in AD patients. We noted a significant decrease in serum levels of a liver-derived primary BA (CA) and an increase in levels of a bacterially produced secondary BAs and their conjugated forms (DCA, GDCA and TDCA, GLCA) in AD patients compared to CN subjects (Table 4 , Fig. 1A ). Higher levels of secondary conjugated BAs (GDCA, GLCA, and TLCA) were significantly associated with worse cognitive function (ADAS-Cog13; Table 4 ). In a follow-up study, we illustrate that these changes are also correlated with changes in CSF markers of disease and with brain imaging changes.\nTo inform about enzymatic activity changes in the liver and the gut, three types of metabolite ratios were evaluated to inform about mechanisms leading to the noted altered BA profile in AD. We found no shift in metabolism between primary and alternative pathways ( Fig. 3 ; no change in CA:CDCA); a significant change in production of secondary BAs via enzymatic activities in the gut microbiome (increased DCA:CA as well as GLCA:CDCA and TLCA:CDCA as proxies for LCA:CDCA) and no change in processes involved in glycine and taurine conjugation of secondary BAs in the liver (no change in GDCA:DCA or TDCA:DCA). The significant increase in ratios of secondary to primary BAs (e.g., DCA:CA; Fig. 3 ) suggest altered activity of bacterial 7a-dehydroxylases leading to excess production of secondary BAs many of which are cytotoxic [34, [60] [61] [62] . This indicates potential gut dysbiosis in AD patients possibly caused by enhanced colonization of the large and possibly the small intestine with anaerobic bacteria capable of CA and CDCA 7a-dehydroxylation. Increases in these ratios also significantly correlated with poorer cognition (Table 5) . Together, these findings suggest that enzymatic steps in conversion of primary to secondary BAs in the gut might contribute to disease.\nWe also evaluated effects of BA levels on risk of progression to AD among 789 MCI patients. Lower levels of CA and higher ratio of secondary to primary BAs, GDCA:CA, and TDCA:CA were significantly associated with risk of developing AD dementia (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 6 ).\nThe increased production of bacterially produced DCA from CA modeled by ratio DCA:CA and its link to cognition was replicated in the independent ROS/MAP cohort. Association of the DCA:CA ratio with disease severity was evaluated separately in 566 serum and 111 brain samples. Because of the small number of AD patients (n 5 11, serum n 5 27, brains), we used global cognitive scores as an index of disease severity. Most of the BAs primary and bacterially produced secondary were found in the brain. Similar to ADNI findings, an increase in the DCA:CA ratio in both serum and brain were significantly associated with worse cognition. This finding suggests that downstream effects of the gut-directed dysregulation of primary versus secondary BAs are not limited to the periphery but also might affect metabolic homeostasis and/or signaling functions in the human brain.\nEarlier smaller studies suggested differences in BA levels in AD [26, [38] [39] [40] [41] . For example, in a study of 495 plasma metabolites comparing MCI (n 5 58) and AD (n 5 100) with those of cognitively normal controls (n 5 93), levels of DCA, LCA, and GLCA were significantly elevated in the disease state [41] . Mapstone and colleagues [39] identified increased levels of glycoursodeoxycholic acid in subjects likely to develop amnestic MCI or AD within 2 to 3 years compared to controls. In a small pilot study, Marksteiner and colleagues [38] reported increased levels of LCA, GDCA, and GLCA in AD (n 5 30) relative to MCI (n 5 20). We replicated these findings with the exception of LCA (excluded during QC) and glycoursodeoxycholic acid, which showed only a nonsignificant trend of upregulation in the AD group (P 5 .054). Marksteiner [38] did not report a significant increase in DCA or decrease in CA which we observed in the ADNI cohort. However, there is a trend in their data to suggest that DCA levels are increased in AD relative to CN. Our analyses build upon these pilot studies to include a large well-characterized cohort with rich clinical, neuroimaging, and genetics data. Our analyses include links to innate immunity-related genes, which was not possible in smaller studies. In addition, we controlled for medication use which is known to significantly affect the gut microbiome and BAs. In our follow-up study, we explore the association of serum BAs with CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD.\nComposition and functional changes of the gut microbiome have been implicated in several diseases. Microbiome GWAS revealed that variants in many human genes involved in immunity and gut architecture are associated with an altered gut microbiome composition [63] . Although many factors such as diet can affect the microbial organisms residing in the gut, emerging data support the hypothesis that certain host genetic variants predispose an individual toward microbiome dysbiosis and this can be linked to disorders of metabolism and immunity such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and autism [63] .\nAccumulating evidence links dysregulation of the immune system to AD pathology. In particular, genetic association studies in AD have robustly identified several genetic risk variants in immune-related genes [2, 59] . Using the ADNI and RS cohorts, we investigated the association of BA profiles of CN subjects with genetic variants in nine AD-related and innate immunity genes. Eight genetic variants were associated with selected BA levels at nominal significance (Supplementary Table 10 ). Three of these associations were significant after Bonferroni correction, with rs616338 (ABI3) and rs190982 (MEF2C) associated with the DCA:CA ratio, and rs11771145 (EPHA1) linked to both DCA and TDCA. The association of the BAs to AD genes suggests that these immune-related genes may influence the risk of AD through BA metabolism or changes in the gut microbiome. Interestingly, both ABI3 and MEF2C are thought to be involved in immune reactions to proinflammatory stimuli that are partially secreted by microbes [64, 65] . The link to the DCA:CA ratio may thus mirror differences in gut microbiome composition due to altered immune response in AD, providing a mechanistic hypothesis for our findings. The function of EPHA1 is not well understood, but it has been hypothesized that when activated, this receptor may affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [66] . Its association with levels of DCA is intriguing as DCA is known to be cytotoxic and can disrupt the BBB and then enter the brain [28] . rs11771145 is associated with gene expression levels of EPHA1 [55] , and as DCA is not known to be produced by human metabolism, changed expression and activity of EPHA1 may be related to DCA-mediated cytotoxic effects.\nUsing an established atlas of genetic influences on human blood metabolites [45] , we further investigated a potential cytotoxic role of DCA. For almost half of the 13 identified loci, we found genetic evidence for involvement in ADlinked complex traits (Supplementary Table 11 ). In particular, ABCA7 is an AD risk gene replicated in several genetic studies [67, 68] . Five additional genes (LRRC7, CYCS, GPC6, FOXN3, and CNTNAP4) genetically influence AD phenotypes, including cognitive decline and CSF markers. While it remains speculative if and how these genes interact with DCA to contribute to AD risk, it is intriguing that we identified ABCA7 by screening for associations with DCA levels. ABCA7 is highly expressed in the brain, and functions in the efflux of lipids, including cholesterol, from cells. Because of the structural similarity of DCA and cholesterol, we hypothesize that ABCA7 may be able to also transport this BA, reconciling metabolomics findings via a functional hypothesis to a risk gene for AD. The findings that BA levels are regulated by AD-related genes might provide new mechanistic insights.\nThere is growing support for strong connections between the intestinal environment, with its diverse microbial composition and activity, and the functions of the central nervous system. The \"gut-brain metabolic axis\" facilitates bidirectional chemical communication between the central and enteric nervous systems through mechanisms just starting to be defined [7] [8] [9] . Such a metabolic axis is thought to be involved in the regulation of multiple host metabolic pathways in which levels of hormones, neurotransmitters, amines, GABA, short-chain fatty acids, lipid metabolites, and others are regulated by gut microbiome activity [12] . Changes in the composition of intestinal bacterial populations are associated with a wide array of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders including multiple sclerosis, autism, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease [69] [70] [71] . In addition, increasing evidence suggests that liver disease may impact cognitive functions and contribute to AD [72] .\nOur findings suggest novel metabolic links in AD where BAs represent a component of the gut-liver-brain axis that relates to cognition. We hypothesize that interconnected immune and gut microbiome dysregulation leads to increase in production of cytotoxic secondary BAs like DCA and its derivatives and these can modulate the BBB and build up in the brain leading to impaired metabolic functions mediated by their receptors and targets. Such dysregulation includes cholesterol and glucose homeostasis.\nIt is of interest that BAs are ligands for nuclear receptors including FXR, LXRs among others and they acts synergistically as metabolic sensors to regulate energy homeostasis [73, 74] peripherally and might also propagate their effects to the brain. Interestingly, levels of four BAs produced by the gut microbiome and those we show to be significantly correlated with disease status and cognition (DCA, GLCA, TLCA, TDCA) are hydrophobic and cytotoxic [34, 35, 75, 76] . Cell lines, animal models, and human studies suggest that levels of such BAs, particularly DCA, lead to a disruption of mitochondrial membranes resulting in increased reactive oxygen species, markers of inflammation, and apoptosis as well as decreases in cell viability and DNA synthesis [34, 35, 77] . Studies in rodents with deuterium-labeled DCA demonstrated that DCA crosses the BBB and increases its permeability [27, 29] . Increased amounts of secondary BAs in blood may enter the brain through induced permeability of the BBB, affecting brain physiology and metabolism [28] . Several studies in human and animal brains also revealed that the full panel of BAs is found in the brain [24] [25] [26] [27] , but it is unclear whether this is due to transport from the periphery, from local synthesis, or both. The function of these BAs in the brain remains poorly defined with some support for them acting as neurosteroids [78] .\nBA levels and the gut microbiome influence each other, where bile salt hydrolase-rich bacteria readily modify the BA profile while, on the other hand, intestinal BAs control the growth and maintenance of commensal bacteria, maintain barrier integrity, and modulate the immune system [79] [80] [81] [82] . Such changes might impact brain functions. Significant data support a role for cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD including large genetic studies. Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated in part by the gut microbiome suggesting that cholesterol intermediates including those produced by gut might present as one gutbrain axis of communication that needs to be further investigated in human and animal studies."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This is an observational study, the results of which may contain confounding biases. For example, diet, lifestyle, exposome, and other factors may contribute to changes in the gut. It remains unclear how these important factors are related to AD pathogenesis and whether the observed differences we note are causes or consequences of disease. Further studies of metabolic changes in normal aging are required to help define which aspects of BA metabolism might be related to disease versus normal aging. Fecal material was not collected in the ADNI cohorts or other large studies therefore precluding a direct analysis of microbiota changes across the trajectory of disease. Such studies have just been initiated. Use of medications was extensively evaluated as a possible confound (Supplementary Methods  and Tables 7-9 ), and our key findings remained after controlling for medication use but larger studies need to further evaluate the effect of these medications. Additional experimental studies are needed to more fully define the expression of BAs and their receptors in the brain and the mechanistic roles of BAs in the development of AD. The impact of BAs on FXR, TGR5, vitamin, and hormone receptors in the brain and the signaling pathways impacted are currently unclear. It is important to evaluate in other large community studies the generalizability of our findings. The genetic links need to be tested in large populations.\nLongitudinal studies covering presymptomatic stages are needed to establish the influence of immune changes on gut microbiome composition and activity in AD patients and the impact of this on BAs and cholesterol homeostasis. Tracking earliest changes in BA and other gut-derived metabolites might provide insights into causality. Labeling studies are needed to evaluate if BAs cross the BBB and build up in brain with further elucidation of their signaling and regulatory functions centrally. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that changes in the brain during disease can also impact the gut and liver, and hence, some of our findings might be brain derived."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, there is evidence of a relationship among the intestinal BA profile, gut microbial composition and/or activity, innate immunity, and genetic variants implicated in AD. When disrupted, BAs may contribute to cognitive changes, highlighting the importance of cholesterol clearance and its regulation in AD. Disorders in BA metabolism cause cholestatic liver diseases, dyslipidemia, fatty liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, which are all associated with risk of cognitive decline, directly or indirectly. Our results lend support to this relationship in the context of AD and cohorts at risk for AD. Our evolving understanding of the gut microbiome's role in aging and in central nervous system diseases and their progression could open potential new hypotheses in the field, regardless of whether the role is ultimately found to be causative, consequence, or contributory. The role of the gut microbiome in AD needs to be further investigated along with the emerging links between central and peripheral metabolic failures that might contribute to brain health and disease during aging."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Authors' contributions: MahmoudianDehkordi, Arnold, and Nho had full access to all ADNI data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. has received research grants and advisory/speaking fees from several companies for other projects, and he owns stock in several companies.
