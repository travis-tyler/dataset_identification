More than 6 in 10 international graduate students in the United States in fall 2017 were enrolled in S&E fields, compared with about 4 in 10 international undergraduates. \u2022 In fall 2017, 69% of the international S&E graduate students in the United States came from China and India, similar to prior years. Master's degrees awarded in S&E fields increased from about 96,000 in 2000 to more than 180,000 in 2015.\nOver the past decade and a half, governments around the globe have increasingly regarded higher education as an essential national resource. Although the United States has historically been a world leader in providing broad access to higher education and in attracting international students, many other countries are providing expanded educational access to their own populations and are attracting growing numbers of international students. Nevertheless, in recent years, increases in international students contributed to most of the growth in overall S&E graduate enrollment in the United States. After a decline in the number of international students coming to the United States after 11 September 2001, international student enrollment in S&E had recovered, but in the last year their numbers have dropped once again.\nThe U.S. Higher Education System This section discusses the characteristics of U.S. higher education institutions that provide S&E education and various aspects of and trends in their finances.\n\n\nEnrollment patterns differ among racial and ethnic groups. For-profit institutions play a disproportionate role in the education of blacks and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, who are more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to enroll in private for-profit academic institutions (NSF/NCSES 2017a). For-profit academic institutions are not large producers of S&E degrees: they awarded between 3% and 5% of S&E degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels, as well as 18% of S&E degrees at the associate's level in 2015 (Appendix Table   2-2). Computer sciences accounted for three-quarters of the associate's degrees and nearly half of the bachelor's degrees awarded by for-profit institutions in S&E fields in 2015 (Appendix Table 2 -3). At the master's level, S&E degrees were mainly in psychology (38%), social sciences (32%), and computer sciences (27%); at the doctoral level, they were almost exclusively in psychology (79%) and social sciences (17%).\nInternational S&E Higher Education In the 1990s, many countries, coming to view an educated population and workforce as a valuable national resource, began to expand their higher education systems and broaden participation in higher education. At the same time, flows of students worldwide increased, often reflecting government incentives and programs. More recently, several countries have adopted policies to encourage the return of students who studied abroad, to attract international students, or both. As the world becomes more interconnected, students who enroll in tertiary (postsecondary) institutions outside their own countries have opportunities to expand their knowledge of other societies and languages and improve their employability in globalized labor markets."}, {"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "List of Figures", "text": "Degree-granting institutions, by control and level of institution: 2015-16.................................................... 2-10 Table 2-1 Degree awards, by degree level and institutional control: 2015 ..................................................................... 2-11 Table 2-2 Distribution of U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E doctorate recipients whose baccalaureate origin is a high-Hispanic-enrollment institution, by ethnicity and race: 2011-15 ............... 2-17 Table 2-3 U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E doctorate recipients whose baccalaureate origin is an HBCU, by ethnicity and race: 2011-15 ...................................................................................................... 2-18 Table 2-4 U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E doctorate recipients who reported earning college credit from a community or 2-year college, by ethnicity and race: 2011-15................................................. 2-20 Table 2-5 Recent recipients of S&E degrees who attended community college, by sex, race and ethnicity, citizenship status, and parents ' education level: 2015 .................................................................... 2-22 Table 2-6 Enrollment in Title IV institutions, by distance education enrollment status, control, and level of institution: Fall 2015 ........................................................................................................................ 2-25 Table 2-7 Net tuition and fees for full-time undergraduate students by institutional control: 2006-07 and 2011 -12 through 2016-17............................................................................................................ 2-36 Table 2-8 Primary support mechanisms for S&E doctorate recipients, by 2010 Carnegie classification of doctorate-granting institution: 2015 .............................................................................................................. 2-42 Table 2-9 International students enrolled in U.S. higher education institutions, by broad field  Table 2-13 Recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates on temporary visas, by country or economy of origin: 1995-2015 ............................................................................................................................................................. 2-75 Table 2-14 Asian recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates on temporary visas, by field and country or economy of origin: 1995-2015............................................................................................................................ 2-77 Table 2- Table 2-17 Selected average revenues and expenditures per FTE at public very high research universities: 2000-15............................................................................................................................................ 2-28 Figure 2-1 Average expenditures per FTE on research at public and private very high research universities: 2000-15............................................................................................................................................ 2-30    Full-time S&E graduate students with primary support from federal government, by field: 2015 ........................................................................................................................................................................ 2-39 Figure 2-7 Full-time S&E graduate students, by field and mechanism of primary support: 2015 ................................ 2-40 Figure 2-8 Share of full-time undergraduate enrollment among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, by race and ethnicity: 2000-15............................................................................................................................ 2-48 Figure 2-9 S&E bachelor's degrees, by field: 2000 Women's share of S&E bachelor's degrees, by field: 2000-15 ........................................................................ 2-56 Figure 2-11 Share of S&E bachelor's degrees among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, by race and ethnicity: 2000-15................................................................................................................................................. 2-58 "}, {"section_title": "Highlights", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the U.S. Higher Education System", "text": "A disproportionate number of S&E bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degree holders graduate from a small number of universities with very high levels of research activity.

About 30% of Hispanic S&E doctorate recipients who earned their doctorates between 2011 and 2015 had obtained their baccalaureate credential at a high-Hispanic-enrollment institution, and 24% of black S&E doctorate recipients who received their doctorates in the same period had obtained their baccalaureate degree at a historically black college or university. \u2022 Nearly one in five U.S. citizens or permanent residents who received an S&E doctoral degree from 2011 to 2015 had earned some college credit from a community or 2-year college. Higher education spending and revenue patterns and trends continue to undergo substantial changes with a higher share of total costs borne by students and parents. \u2022 Between 2000 and 2015, average revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) student from net tuition at public very high research universities nearly doubled, whereas state and local appropriations fell by 34%. \u2022 Although tuition remained lower at public very high research universities than at their private counterparts, average revenue from student tuition increased more rapidly at public institutions. \u2022 In public very high research universities, revenues from federal appropriations, grants, and contracts per FTE student grew by 11% between 2000 and 2015, and research expenditures per FTE student grew by the same percentage (11%). In private very high research universities, revenues from federal appropriations, grants, and contracts per FTE student grew by 14%, and research expenditures per FTE student increased by 25%. \u2022 Between 2008 and 2010, during a period largely coinciding with the economic recession, expanding enrollment in community colleges, coupled with reductions in state and local appropriations, contributed to a 9% reduction in instructional spending per FTE student. Instructional spending per FTE student continued to decline in 2011 but increased by 14% between 2012 and 2015, while enrollment declined as the U.S. economy improved. Between 2006-07 and 2016-17, estimated average net tuition and fees paid by full-time undergraduate students in public 4-year colleges increased by about 30% after adjusting for inflation. \u2022 With rising tuition, students rely on financial aid and loans to fund their education. Undergraduate debt varies by type of institution and state. Overall, it does not vary much by field of study. \u2022 Levels of debt among doctorate recipients vary by field. In S&E fields, high levels of graduate debt were most common among doctorate recipients in social sciences, psychology, and medical and other health sciences.\nIn the most recent academic year, the number of international visa holders increased in computer sciences and mathematics (by 11% and 5% respectively) but declined in engineering (5%), social sciences (3%), and non-S&E fields (4%). \u2022 In fall 2017, China, Saudi Arabia, India, South Korea, and Kuwait were the top countries sending S&E undergraduates to the United States, as in the previous year. Compared to fall 2016, the number of undergraduates from China, India, and Kuwait enrolled in fall 2017 declined (by 3%, 11%, and 4% respectively) while the number from Saudi Arabia and South Korea declined (by 18% and 7% respectively). Among students who began postsecondary education in 4-year colleges and universities in 2011-12, about 76% were still enrolled 3 years later, either at their first institution or at another and 6% had earned either an associate's or a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Among students in 4-year institutions, those who had declared an S&E major were more likely to be enrolled 3 years later than those who had declared a non-S&E major. \u2022 Among students in 2-year institutions, the level of degree attainment or continued enrollment did not vary much by the broad field of major that beginning students had declared in their first year of postsecondary study. However, students who had been undecided about their major early on were more likely than other students to have dropped out 3 years later.\nThe number of master's degrees awarded in engineering in 2015 was the highest in the last 16 years. The number of master's degrees in computer sciences awarded in 2015 surpassed its peak in 2004. \u2022 Increases occurred in most major S&E fields, with the largest in mathematics and statistics, biological sciences, computer sciences, and engineering.\nThe number and percentage of master's degrees awarded to women in most major S&E fields have increased since\nThe number of S&E doctorates conferred annually by U.S. universities increased among U.S. citizens and permanent residents and among temporary visa holders. \u2022 Among fields that award large numbers of doctorates, the largest increases in degrees awarded between 2000 and 2015 were in engineering and in computer sciences. Students on temporary visas continue to earn high proportions of U.S. S&E doctorates, including the majority of degrees in some fields. They also earned large shares of the master's degrees in S&E fields. In contrast, they earn smaller shares of undergraduate S&E degrees.\nIn 2015, international students earned more than half of the doctoral degrees awarded in engineering, economics, computer sciences, and mathematics and statistics. Their overall share of S&E degrees was 34%. \u2022 The number of temporary visa holders earning S&E doctoral degrees grew consistently between 2011 and 2014 but remained flat in 2015. \u2022 Students on temporary visas earned 2% of the associate's and 5% of the bachelor's degree in S&E fields in 2015.\nIn the United States, about 6% of all bachelor's degrees awarded in 2014 were in engineering. This compares with about 18% throughout Asia and 33% in China. In 2014, the United States awarded the largest number of S&E doctoral degrees of any individual country, followed by China, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and India.\nThe numbers of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in China and the United States have risen substantially in recent years. S&E doctorates awarded in South Korea and in many European countries have risen more modestly. S&E doctorates awarded in Japan increased fairly steadily through 2006 but have declined since then. \u2022 As a result of large government investments in higher education, in 2007 China overtook the United States as the world leader in the number of doctoral degrees awarded in the natural sciences and engineering (which includes agricultural, biological, and physical sciences, mathematics and statistics, and computer sciences and excludes social and behavioral sciences). Since 2010, this number in China has risen more slowly.

The number of S&E associate's degrees increased from 38,000 to 91,000 between 2000 and 2015. During this period, the growth of S&E degrees at the associate's level (136%) was higher than growth at the bachelor's (63%), master's (88%), and doctoral levels (60%). \u2022 In 2015, about 9% of the associate's degrees awarded were in S&E, and another 14% were awarded in S&E technologies. \u2022 Since 2000, the number of associate's degrees in S&E technologies, which have a more applied focus, grew by 72%, to 144,000. Nearly three-quarters of these associate's degrees are in health technologies, and close to one-quarter are in engineering technologies. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees has risen steadily in the United States over the past 15 years, peaking at more than 650,000 in 2015.

The composition of the U.S. college-age population is becoming more diverse as the Asian and Hispanic shares of the population increase. During the latest economic downturn, public institutions of higher education faced unique pressures from a combination of increasing enrollments and tight state budgets.

During the 2015-16 academic year, there were approximately 4,600 postsecondary degree-granting institutions in the United States; about two-thirds (66%) of these offered 4-year or higher degrees, and the remainder offered 2-year degrees (\ue605 Table 2-1). More than half of the 4-year institutions are private nonprofit, 24% are public, and 23% are private for-profit.

For example, public institutions awarded nearly 70% of S&E bachelor's and doctoral degrees and 55% of S&E master's degrees. Although relatively few (97), doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity-public and private-are the leading producers of S&E degrees: these research institutions awarded 72% of doctoral degrees, 42% of master's degrees, and 37% of bachelor's degrees in S&E fields in 2015 (Appendix Table 2 \n\nFemale S&E bachelor's and master's degree recipients were more likely than males to have attended a community college (\ue605 Table 2 -6). Attendance levels as measured by the proportion who took courses at a community college were highest among U.S. citizens, followed by permanent visa holders, and were much lower among temporary visa holders. Among racial and ethnic groups, attendance levels were highest among Hispanics and lowest among Asians. Attendance fell with rising parental education level, illustrating the special access function of these institutions. Recent S&E graduates (1.3 million) who took courses in community colleges (nearly 600,000) report doing so at different points in their educational careers. Nearly half of them reported doing so after high school but before enrolling in a 4-year college or university or while enrolled in college but before receiving a bachelor's degree. About one in three used a community college as a bridge between high school and college enrollment. One in five attended a community college after receiving their first bachelor's degree. One in 10 reported taking courses at a community college after leaving a 4-year college without receiving their first bachelor's degree. [8] Recent S&E graduates took courses at community colleges for various reasons. The most prevalent reason was to earn credits toward a bachelor's degree (30%), followed by preparation for college to increase the chance of acceptance at a 4-year institution (17%), for financial reasons (14%), and to earn college credits while still attending high school (13%). Other reasons mentioned included to complete an associate's degree (6%); to gain further skills or knowledge in their academic or occupational fields (6%); to facilitate a change in their academic or occupational fields (5%); for leisure or personal interest (4%); to increase opportunities for promotion, advancement, or higher salary (3%); and for other reasons (4%). [9] CHAPTER 2 | Higher Education in Science \nRevenue from federal appropriations, grants, and contracts, the source used for most research expenditures, is highest at the most research-intensive universities (Appendix Table 2 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 \nFour-Year and Other Graduate Public Institutions\n\nBetween 1999-2000 and 2011-12, changes in the net cost of higher education for dependent undergraduates varied by family income level and type of institution they attended (Table NSB 2016  tuition in certain types of institutions while seeing increases in others. (On average, these students experienced declines at public 2-year institutions; saw no changes at public and private nonprofit 4-year master's and baccalaureate institutions, as well as at private nonprofit 4-year research and doctoral institutions; and saw a rise at public 4-year research and doctoral institutions.) Research suggests that the vast majority of low-income, high-achieving high school seniors do not apply to any selective college, although selective institutions cost them less than nonselective ones because of the large amounts of financial aid they are able to offer (Hoxby and Avery 2013). [23] Undergraduate Financial Support Patterns and Debt\nTime to Doctoral Degree Completion The time required to earn a doctoral degree and the success rates of those entering doctoral programs are important for those pursuing a degree, the universities awarding the degree, and the agencies and organizations funding doctoral study. Longer times to degree mean lost earnings and a higher risk of attrition. Median time to degree (as measured by time from graduate school entry to doctorate receipt) increased through the mid-1990s but has since decreased in all S&E fields from 7.7 to 6.8 years (Appendix Table 2-30). The physical sciences and mathematics had the shortest time to degree, whereas the social sciences and medical and other health sciences had the longest. Time to degree varied among institution types (see sidebar \ue60a Carnegie Classification of Academic Institutions) and was typically longer at universities that were less strongly oriented toward research (\ue605 Table 2 -13). Consequently, time to degree was shortest at research universities with very high research activity (6.7 years in 2015, down from 7.2 years in 2000). Doctorate recipients at medical schools also finished relatively quickly (6.7 years in 2015). The median time to degree varies by demographic groups, but these variations reflect differences among broad fields of study. In 2015, across all doctorate recipients, women had a longer time to degree than men (7.7 versus 7.2 years, respectively) (Appendix Table 2 -31). However, with few exceptions, these differences were very small when comparing men and women within broad S&E fields. In engineering, women took slightly less time than men (6.3 versus 6.7 years, respectively), and in medical and other health sciences, the difference reversed and was considerably larger (9.7 for women versus 7.7 years for men). In most natural sciences and engineering fields, time to degree was longer for temporary visa holders than for U.S. students, particularly in the physical sciences (6.7 versus 5.7 years, respectively). However, in the medical and other health sciences, as in computer sciences, temporary visa holders finished faster. Among U.S. citizen and permanent resident students, in most broad S&E fields, median time to degree was shorter for whites than for other groups.  \nAsia From 1995 to 2015, students from four Asian locations (China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, in descending order) earned more than half of all U.S. S&E doctoral degrees awarded to international students (127,000 of 221,000)-nearly five times the number of doctoral recipients from Europe (26,000). China accounted for more than one-quarter of all these international S&E doctorates (64,000), followed by India (30,000), South Korea (21,000), and Taiwan (13,000). Most of these degrees were awarded in engineering, biological sciences, and physical sciences (\ue605 Table 2 -15). A larger proportion of South Korean and Taiwanese students (exceeding 25%) than Chinese and Indian (approaching 10%) earned a doctorate in a non-S&E field. The number of S&E doctorates earned by students from China has increased more than seven times in the last 20 years, from 675 to nearly 5,000, whereas the numbers from India nearly tripled between 2002 and 2009 but have since remained stable at 2,100. In the last 10 years, the numbers of S&E doctorates from South Korea and Taiwan have been broadly stable but remain low (about 900 and 500, respectively) (\ue604 Figure 2-19).   \n\nThe Americas Despite the proximity of Canada and Mexico to the United States, the shares of U.S. S&E doctoral degrees awarded to residents of these countries were small compared with those awarded to students from Asia and Europe. The number of U.S. S&E doctoral degrees earned by students from Canada increased from about 219 in 1995 to 390 in 2009, but it has overall declined in the last 6 years. The overall numbers of doctoral degree recipients from Mexico and Brazil peaked earlier (2003 and 1996, respectively) and have been relatively stable in recent years (\ue604 Figure 2-22). A higher proportion of Mexican and Brazilian students earned U.S. doctorates in S&E fields than the comparable proportion for Canadians (\ue605 Table 2 -17); this pattern was particularly strong in engineering and agricultural sciences.    \nFirst University Degrees in S&E Fields More than 22 million students worldwide earned first university degrees in 2014 (see sidebar \ue60a Comparability of International Data in Tertiary Education and Glossary), with more than 7.5 million of these in S&E fields (Appendix Table   2-34). [5] CHAPTER 2 | Higher Education in Science  includes the master's or equivalent level, and level 8 includes the doctoral or equivalent level. In addition, a separate but related process redesigned the fields of study classifications in the ISCED Fields of Education and Training (ISCED-F); these new standards were adopted in 2013 (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2014). Science and Engineering Indicators 2018 is the first edition to present statistics collected under the ISCED 2011 and the ISCED-F; previous editions had presented data collected under the ISCED 1997. As a result of these changes, there are several differences between the higher education international data reported in this volume and in past volumes. At the undergraduate level, the international comparisons in this volume present first degree data corresponding to ISCED 2011 level 6 (first degrees) and level 7 (long first degrees). Some countries (e.g., Germany, Belgium, Switzerland) reclassified some vocationally oriented programs previously classified as ISCED level 5B. As a result, the total numbers of first university degrees for these countries are different under the new classification compared with the previous classification. At the doctoral level, the data corresponding to the ISCED 2011 level 8 are similar to the doctoral degrees reported in the past. The changes in ISCED-F affect the following fields: \u2022 The data for engineering in this volume correspond to the ISCED-F 2013 \"engineering, manufacturing, and construction,\" which includes engineering and engineering trades, manufacturing and processing, and architecture and construction. In addition, \"environmental protection\" was a newly added discipline to this broad field of engineering. \u2022 The data for agriculture include \"veterinary.\" \u2022 The data for social and behavioral sciences include \"journalism and information.\" Because of these changes, the international higher education data have a higher degree of international comparability than in the past. This is because (1) the data for the majority of the countries were collected under the same OECD, EU, and UIS guidelines; and (2) the field groupings in the ISCED-F now have more in common with the aggregation of fields used in China, a major degree producer. For example, China statistics include \"architecture\" and \"landscape architecture\" under \"engineering\" and \"veterinary\" under \"agricultural sciences\" (China Ministry of Education 2011). For comparability purposes, U.S. data in the international tables correspond to the ISCED-F classification of fields and, as a result, the numbers reported in each of the broad fields are different from those reported in tables and graphics that examine domestic trends in higher education. These worldwide totals include only countries for which relatively recent data are available (primarily countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas) and are therefore underestimates of the global total. Asian universities accounted for more than 4 million of the world's S&E first university degrees in 2014, with more than half of them in engineering. Students across Europe (including Eastern Europe and Russia) earned more than 1.5 million S&E first university degrees (about 40% of them in engineering), and students in North America earned nearly 1 million S&E first university degrees in 2014 (24% in engineering). In terms of individual countries, India and China awarded the largest numbers of first university degrees in S&E (1.9 and 1.7 million, respectively), followed by the United States (742,000), Russia (429,000), and Japan (316,000). In several countries around the world, the proportion of first university degrees in S&E fields was higher than in the United States. Nearly half or more of all first university degrees in Japan, Iran, China, and Israel were in S&E fields, compared with nearly 40% in the United States. In 2014, about 14% of all bachelor's degrees awarded in the United States and worldwide were in the natural sciences (physical, biological, computer, and agricultural sciences, as well as mathematics and statistics). This proportion was similar to the proportions of first university degrees awarded in the natural sciences in Canada, New Zealand, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Germany, and Armenia, but it was lower than the proportion awarded in the United Kingdom (21%). Between 2000 and 2014, the number of S&E first university degrees awarded in China, Taiwan, Germany, [6] Turkey, and Romania at least doubled; it also grew, albeit at a slower rate, in Australia, [7] Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States; in France and Japan, it declined (by 5% and 11%, respectively) (Appendix Table 2 -35). In China, first university degrees increased greatly in all fields, with a larger increase in non-S&E than in S&E fields. Growth in natural sciences and engineering degrees in China accounted for most of the country's increase in S&E first university degrees: an increase of almost 1.2 million degrees and up more than 400% from 2000 to 2014 (\ue604 Figure 2-24; Appendix Table   2-35). China has traditionally awarded a large proportion of its first university degrees in engineering, but the percentage declined from 43% in 2000 to 33% in 2014 (Appendix Table 2 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 "}, {"section_title": "Carnegie Classification of Academic Institutions", "text": "The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is widely used in higher education research to characterize and control for differences in academic institutions. The 2010 classification update retains the structure adopted in 2005 and classified about 4,200 institutions. More than three-quarters of the institutions added in that update (77%) were from the private for-profit sector, 19% were from the private nonprofit sector, and 4% were from the public sector. The Carnegie classification categorizes academic institutions primarily on the basis of highest degree conferred, level of degree production, and research activity.* In this report, several Carnegie categories have been aggregated for statistical purposes. The characteristics of those aggregated groups are as follows: \u2022 Doctorate-granting universities include institutions that award at least 20 doctoral degrees per year. They include three subgroups based on level of research activity: very high research activity (97 institutions), high research activity (103 institutions), and doctoral/research universities (82 institutions). Because doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity are central to S&E education and research, data on these institutions are reported separately. \u2022 Master's colleges and universities include the 652 institutions that award at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees per year. \u2022 Baccalaureate colleges include the 749 institutions at which baccalaureate degrees represent at least 10% of all undergraduate degrees and that award fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees per year. \u2022 Associate's colleges include the 1,692 institutions at which all degrees awarded are associate's degrees or at which bachelor's degrees account for less than 10% of all undergraduate degrees. \u2022 Special-focus institutions are the 744 institutions at which at least 75% of degrees are concentrated in a single field or a set of related fields (e.g., medical schools and medical centers, schools of engineering, schools of business and management). \u2022 Tribal colleges are the 33 colleges and universities that are members of the American Indian Higher Education"}, {"section_title": "Consortium.", "text": "* Research activity is based on two indexes (aggregate level of research and per capita research activity) derived from a principal components analysis of data on research and development expenditures, S&E research staff, and field of doctoral degree.

Baccalaureate colleges were the source of relatively few S&E bachelor's degrees (11%) (Appendix Table 2-1), but they produce 13% of future S&E doctorate recipients (NSF/NCSES 2013). When adjusted by the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields, the top 50 baccalaureate colleges as a group yield more future S&E doctorates per 100 bachelor's degrees awarded than all other types of institutions except very high research universities.

Examples of MSIs established by legislation include historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs, see sidebar \ue60a Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and tribal colleges or universities [3] (TCUs). Given their legal definition, the number of institutions in these groups cannot increase in number unless Congress acts to designate additional institutions in those groups. In contrast, high-Hispanic-enrollment institutions [4] (HHEs, see sidebar \ue60a High-Hispanic-Enrollment Institutions: A Typology) are a type of MSI based on the percentage of minority student enrollment. The number of institutions in these groups vary from year to year based on the enrollment of students in their respective minority groups. [5] MSIs enroll a substantial fraction of underrepresented minority undergraduates (NSF/NCSES 2017a). In 2015, HBCUs awarded 16% of the 54,000 S&E bachelor's degrees earned by black U.S. citizens and permanent residents, and HHEs awarded about 34% of the 79,000 S&E bachelor's degrees earned by Hispanics. The proportion of blacks earning S&E bachelor's degrees from HBCUs has been declining in recent years. The proportion of Hispanics earning S&E bachelor's degrees from HHEs declined through 2011 but has been stable at about 34% since then. Tribal colleges, which mainly offer 2-year degrees, account for about 4% of the nearly 3,000 S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to American Indians; this proportion has increased slightly in the last 5 years.

In 2015-16, there were 102 HBCUs in operation in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Half of these institutions were public and half were private nonprofit institutions. The number of students enrolled at HBCUs increased by 32% between 1976 and 2015 to about 293,000. In comparison, the number of students enrolled in degreegranting institutions increased by 84%, to about 20 million during the same period (NCES 2017). In 2015, the majority of HBCU students were enrolled in 4-year institutions (89%) and the remainder were enrolled in 2-year institutions. More than three-quarters of HBCU students attended public institutions (75%) and 25% attended private nonprofit institutions.* Although HBCUs were originally established to educate black or African American students, they enroll a diverse student body.

Along these demographic trends, the number of colleges and universities serving large numbers of Hispanic students has increased considerably. High-Hispanic-enrollment institutions (HHEs) are degree-granting, nonprofit colleges and universities where full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment is at least 25% Hispanic students.* The number of HHEs has more than doubled from 189 in 1994 to 432 in 2015, accounting now for 13% of all degree-granting public and private nonprofit institutions. In addition, about 300 institutions enroll between 15% and 24% Hispanic students; these institutions are considered \"emerging HHEs.\" In 2015, HHEs enrolled a total of 3.9 million students; nearly half of them were Hispanic, but more than one-quarter were white, and nearly 1 in 10 was black.

As in other countries, the proportion of international students in S&E is much higher at the graduate than at the undergraduate level. For example, in 2015-16, international students were 14% of all undergraduates in the United Kingdom (an increase from 10% in 2005-06), compared with 47% at the graduate level (an increase from 43% in 2005-06). Within S&E, international students were particularly prevalent in engineering. At the undergraduate level, international students were close to one-quarter of all engineering students in 2016; at the graduate level, they accounted for the majority of the students in engineering and in mathematics and computer sciences. China has been the main country sending S&E students to the United Kingdom during this period. However, the number of S&E students from Hong Kong, Romania, and the United States grew considerably at the undergraduate level. In 2016, the United States was among the top 5 countries sending undergraduates studying S&E to the United Kingdom; it was not among the top 10 countries a decade earlier.

These institutions serve diverse groups of students and offer a more affordable means of participating in postsecondary education. Community colleges prepare students to enter the workforce with certificates or associate's degrees or to transition to 4-year colleges or universities, often before receiving a 2-year degree. Community colleges tend to be closely connected with local businesses, community organizations, and government, so they can be more responsive to local workforce needs (Olson and Labov 2012). In the 2015-16 academic year, there were 910 community colleges in the United States, enrolling 6.2 million students, or nearly one-third of all postsecondary students (NCES 2017). Most (62%) community college students enrolled part time. Responding to the economic recession in the late 2000s, enrollment in community colleges peaked in 2010 at 7.2 million but has declined with improving labor markets (Ginder and Kelly-Reid 2017;Ginder, Kelly-Reid, and Mann 2014;Ginder 2009, 2011). Community colleges play a significant role in educating students who go on to acquire advanced S&E degrees. About 19% of U.S. citizens and permanent residents with S&E doctoral degrees earned between 2011 and 2015 reported having some college credit from a community or 2-year college (\ue605 Table 2 -5). In fact, 47% of all recent S&E graduates had done some coursework at a community college (in 2003, it was 48%, according to the National Survey of College Graduates).

Four-year institutions accounted for slightly more than half of these institutions (55%) in 2015-16 (\ue605 Table 2-1).

Distance education has been around for more than 100 years (Perna et al. 2014), whereas online education is a relatively new phenomenon. Online education can serve individuals' needs for lifelong learning and skill retooling during times of rapid technological change. Distance education uses technology to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor, synchronously or asynchronously (Kena et al. 2016). Distance education enrollment has grown in recent years, given the growth of Internet technologies to deliver content. According to nationally representative data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) 2015 Fall Enrollment survey, 14% of all students in 4-year Title IV institutions (i.e., institutions that participate in federal financial aid programs) were enrolled exclusively in distance education courses, and another 15% were enrolled in distance education and regular on-campus courses; whereas the remaining 71% of these students were not enrolled in any distance education course (\ue605 Table 2-7). [12] Exclusive enrollment in distance education courses was considerably higher at private for-profit 4-year institutions than at either 2-or 4-year public or private nonprofit institutions or at private for-profit 2-year institutions. Enrollment in some distance education courses was highest at public institutions. Exclusive enrollment in distance education courses was higher at the graduate level than at the undergraduate level, whereas enrollment in some distance education courses was higher at the undergraduate level than at the graduate level.  Nationally representative data collected by the 2015 IPEDS Completions Survey also show that, regardless of the degree level, the proportion of distance education programs in S&E was highest at private for-profit 4-year institutions, ranging from nearly 30% of the S&E programs in these institutions at the associate's level to more than two-thirds of those at the master's level (Appendix Table 2 -4). In general, computer sciences and psychology were the two fields where distance education programs were most prevalent, irrespective of institution type and degree level. In addition, engineering, engineering technologies, health technologies, and social sciences fields also had considerable utilization of distance education programs. (Between 18% and 25% of the master's programs in engineering, engineering technologies, and health technologies at public 4-year institutions and the majority of social sciences programs at private for-profit 4-year institutions had distance education.) A recent study provided evidence that at a for-profit university with an undergraduate enrollment of more than 100,000 students where most of them were pursuing bachelor's degrees, taking a course online instead of in-person reduced student success and progress in college. Grades were lower not only in the course students took online but also in future courses. In addition, students who took a course online were less likely to remain enrolled a year later (Bettinger et al. 2017). Allen et al.'s (2016) most recent survey showed that a small segment of higher education institutions had massive open online courses (MOOCs; see Glossary) (11%) or were planning one in 2015 (2%); however, most institutions decided against having a MOOC (59%) or remained undecided about it (28%). MOOCs can provide broad access to higher education for free or at a very low cost, facilitating lifelong learning and continuing education. Through their online platforms, MOOCs also have the potential to collect massive amounts of information that can be used to conduct experimental research on how people learn and to identify online practices that improve learning (ED/OET 2013). Nationally representative data on MOOCs are not available. However, research conducted on the first 4 years of open online courses offered by HarvardX and MITx on the edX platform reveals that during that time, the platform included 290 courses, granted 245,000 certificates (including free and paid certificates), and had 4.5 million participants (Chuang and Ho 2016). [13] The survey of MOOCs showed that participants' median age was 29, two-thirds of them were males, 71% were from countries other than the United States, and 73% were bachelor's degree holders. The largest MOOCs were in computer sciences. Overall completion rates in MOOCs are low; however, they varied according to participants' intentions at the start of the course. Some MOOC participants indicated that they intended to obtain a free certificate, others reported that they were exploring a subject, and others reported paying in order to verify their identity and obtain a formal certificate. Students who paid for a certificate verifying their completion of the MOOC were much more likely to obtain a certificate than those who took a class that offered a free certificate (60% compared with 8%). Online education companies offering MOOCs have also expanded their offerings of certificate programs. For instance, Udacity partnered with AT&T to offer technology-focused \"nanodegrees\" teaching students a specific set of skills that can be applied to a job. These courses have been developed in partnership with employers. For example, Udacity developed a course on Android technology with Google and another on self-driving car engineering with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, and Otto (The Economist 2017). For students, these courses are much more affordable than attending a college or university and provide the flexibility they need to complete them while balancing other family and job responsibilities. For businesses, these types of classes provide a quick response to market demand for niche technological specializations. In 2014, the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), in collaboration with Udacity and AT&T, began to offer an online master's program in computer science, which combines MOOC-like course videos and assessments with a support system that works directly with students. The university's goal was to create a master's degree program that was just as rigorous as the one offered on campus but at a much lower cost. A recent study focusing on the students who applied to this program showed that access to this online option increased overall enrollment in higher education, rather than substitute for the brickand-mortar university options (Goodman et al. 2016). The researchers found that online students in this program were older than students in the on-campus program and that the vast majority of them were employed. They also found that the demand for Georgia Tech's online degree satisfied previously unmet demand for mid-career training and could increase the production of computer sciences master's degrees in the United States. Overall, their results also suggested that high-quality online education may open opportunities for people who otherwise would not be pursuing a degree. Changing modes of online education are prompting questions about how the use of this technology will affect the higher education sector. In particular, it is not yet clear how many students can sustain commitment to learning in the absence of more personal contact and to what extent the growing access to higher education facilitated by MOOCs will translate into learning and, in the long run, to higher levels of educational achievement. It is also not clear how these models can be applied in a wider range of disciplines and higher education institutions."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Higher Education Expenditures and Revenues", "text": "Higher education spending and revenue patterns have changed substantially since 2000, in trends that intensified during the economic downturn of the late 2000s. Although all types of higher education institutions faced competing demands in a stringent budget environment, each type faced unique challenges. Through 2010, increases in the number of students seeking an affordable college education compounded the challenges created by tight budgets. Despite declines in enrollment between 2011 and 2015 (Appendix Table 2 -5), the same challenges have remained.

[15] Very High Research Universities-Public and Private Institutions"}, {"section_title": "Revenues", "text": "Net tuition and federal appropriations, grants, and contracts are two large sources of revenues for public and private very high research institutions (Appendix Table 2-6). [16] For public institutions, state and local appropriations are also critical, supplying an amount of revenue just under three-quarters of net tuition ($9,200 per FTE in 2015); in contrast, they are a small source of revenue for their private counterparts (about $1,100 per FTE in 2015 and only about 4% of net tuition). Much more important for private institutions are private and affiliated gifts, investment returns, [17] and endowment income, which are usually the largest sources of revenue other than funds from hospitals and other independent operations. [18] State and local appropriations for public very high research universities have declined since 2000, with a particularly steep drop between 2008 and 2012 (\ue604 Figure 2-1). This decline coincided with a compensating increase in net tuition. average state appropriations per FTE at public very high research institutions were more than twice the amount of net tuition ($13,900 versus $6,500). By 2015, however, appropriations had dropped to $9,200 per FTE, whereas net tuition had increased from about $6,500 to more than $12,700 per FTE (Appendix Table 2 -6). This change represents a downward shift in higher education investment by state and local governments, resulting in a higher financial burden for individual students and their families. Starting at a higher level, net tuition at private very high research universities also increased during this 15-year period. But the increase, from about $22,700 to almost $27,700, was proportionally much smaller.\nFrom 2000 to 2015, state and local appropriations and net student tuition were the largest sources of revenues centrally involved with education at other public institutions offering 4-year and graduate degrees (Appendix Table 2 -6). [19] At these institutions, total revenues from these two sources were lower than those at public very high research universities. In 2015, net student tuition per FTE was higher at public 4-year institutions than at community colleges but state and local appropriations per FTE were lower. From 2000 through 2015, the percentage drop in revenue per FTE from state and local appropriations (25%) was somewhat less than that experienced at the public very high research institutions (34%). In 2010, net student tuition replaced state and local appropriations as the largest source of revenue in the public 4-year institutions. Average state appropriations per FTE in 2000 ($8,800) were almost twice as large as tuition revenue ($4,600).

According to the College Board (2016a), the estimated average net tuition and fees (i.e., the published prices minus grant aid and tax benefits) vary by institution type. In the last 10-year period ending in 2016-17, net tuition and fees paid by full-time, in-state undergraduate students in public 4-year colleges increased by about 30% in constant 2016 U.S. dollars (College Board 2016a; \ue605 Table 2 -8). Net tuition and fees at these institutions had dipped during the recessionary period between 2007-08 and 2009-10, but they increased by 70% since then and nearly 10% in the last 2 years. At private nonprofit institutions, net tuition and fees followed a similar path in the last 10 years, declining between 2007-08 and 2011-12 but rising since then, gradually approaching its highest point 10 years earlier. At public 2-year colleges, net tuition and fees have overall declined by more than 200% in the last 10 years, but they have increased by about 35% since 2011-12 (\ue605 Table 2 -8). On average, since 2009-10, undergraduate students enrolled full time at public 2-year colleges have received enough funding through grant aid and federal education tax credits and deductions to cover tuition and fees, and they can use the rest of those funds to cover books or living expenses (their net tuition was -$500 in 2016-17) (College Board 2016a). Despite large percentage tuition increases in public institutions, they are still more affordable than their private counterparts.  b In-state students."}, {"section_title": "Financial Support for Undergraduate Education", "text": "With rising tuition, students increasingly rely on financial aid to fund their education. Financial aid for undergraduate students comes mainly in the form of student loans (federal and nonfederal), grants (federal, state, institutional, and private), and tuition tax credits. A financial aid package may contain one or more of these kinds of support. In 2016-17, undergraduate students received $184 billion in federal, state, institutional, and other aid, excluding nonfederal loans (College Board 2016b). In the last 10 years, federal financial aid has constituted about two-thirds of the undergraduate student aid package; federal loans have been the main component, followed by federal grants, although the proportion of undergraduate students receiving federal loans declined (from 42% in 2005-06 to 33% in 2016-17), whereas the proportion receiving federal grants increased (from 18% to 23%). In addition, institutional grants increased (from 20% to 23%), and private and employer grants and state grants rose slightly as well (6% versus 7% in both cases). According to the latest data available from the NPSAS, a higher proportion of undergraduates in private institutions than those in public institutions received some type of financial aid and incurred student loans (Ifill and Shaw 2013). [24] Undergraduate Debt Among recent graduates with S&E bachelor's degrees, the level of undergraduate debt does not vary much by undergraduate major, although it is somewhat lower for recent recipients of engineering bachelor's degrees than for recent recipients of bachelor's degrees in social and related sciences and in physical and related sciences. [25] Levels of debt vary to a greater extent by type of institution. The extent of undergraduate indebtedness of students from public colleges and universities is almost as high as that for students from private nonprofit universities (about 60% at graduation ). Cost of living may account for some of the differences by state. [26] Graduate Financial Support Patterns and Debt"}, {"section_title": "Financial Support for S&E Graduate Education", "text": "In 2015, nonfederal funds were the main source of funding of full-time S&E graduate students (45%), followed by selfsupport (41%), and federal funds (15%) (Appendix Table 2 -8). Nonfederal sources include state funds and funding from universities, employers, nonprofit organizations, and foreign governments. Particularly in the large public university systems, state funds are affected by the condition of overall state budgets. Self-supporting graduate students rely primarily on loans, their own funds, or family funds for financial support. The number of full-time graduate students supported primarily by nonfederal sources or through self-support has increased in the last 15 years, with the steepest increase in 2014 (\ue604 Figure 2-6). [27] The proportion of self-supporting graduate S&E students gradually rose from 33% to 41% between 2000 and 2015, primarily because of increasing enrollment of master's students on temporary visas who are mostly self-supporting (IIE 2016; NSF/NCSES 2016). [28] Self-support was highest (60% or higher) among full-time graduate students in computer sciences and in medical and other health sciences (Appendix Table   2 The number of full-time S&E graduate students supported by the federal government increased between 2000 and 2004 and was fairly stable through 2010, but it declined by 16% in the last 5 years, with the steepest decline between 2011 and 2014 (Appendix Table 2 -8). Between 2000 and 2006, the proportion of full-time S&E students primarily supported by the federal government remained fairly stable at 20%-21% but has declined since then, reaching its lowest level in at least 16 years in 2015 (15%) (Appendix Table 2 -10). This decline was more pronounced in the biological, physical, and medical sciences (Appendix Table 2-10). The federal government plays a substantial role in supporting full-time S&E graduate students in some fields but a smaller role in others. Federal financial support for graduate education reaches a larger proportion of students in the physical sciences; the biological sciences; the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; and engineering (\ue604 Figure 2-7; Appendix Table   2 -11). For some mechanisms of support, the federal role is fairly large. In 2015, the federal government funded 55% of fulltime S&E graduate students who were on traineeships, 45% of those with research assistantships (RAs), and 22% of those with fellowships (Appendix Table 2 Teaching assistantships (TAs) are generally institutionally funded. Most graduate students, especially those who pursue doctoral degrees, are supported by more than one source or mechanism during their time in graduate school, and some receive support from several different sources and mechanisms in any given academic year. Primary mechanisms of support differ widely by S&E field of study (\ue604 Figure 2-8; Appendix Table 2-9). In 2015, full-time graduate students in physical sciences were financially supported mainly through TAs (40%) and RAs (37%). RAs were also important in agricultural sciences (47%); Full-time S&E graduate students with primary support from federal government, by field: Most federal financial support for graduate education is in the form of RAs funded through grants to universities for academic research. RAs are the primary mechanism of support for 71% of federally supported full-time S&E graduate students (Appendix Table 2 -8). Fellowships and traineeships are the means of funding for 22% of the federally funded full-time S&E graduate students. For students supported through nonfederal sources in 2015, TAs (i.e., institutional funds) were the most prominent mechanism (40%), followed by RAs (29%). NSF and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support most of the full-time S&E graduate students whose primary support comes from the federal government, followed by the Department of Defense (DOD) (Appendix Table 2 -12). In 2015, NSF supported about 23,000 S&E graduate students, NIH about 21,000, and DOD about 8,000. Trends in federal agency support of graduate students show considerable increases from 2000 to 2015 in the proportion of students funded by NSF, from 22% to 32% (Appendix Table 2 -12). NSF supported 58% of students in computer sciences or mathematics whose primary support comes from the federal government; 51% of those in earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; 42% of those in the physical sciences; and 39% of those in engineering overall (about 49% of those in electrical engineering and 48% of those in chemical engineering) (Appendix Table 2 -13). The proportion of students funded by NIH increased from 29% to 33% between 2000 and 2008 but has since decreased to 29%. In 2015, NIH funded about 70% of such students in the biological sciences, 57% of those in the medical sciences, and 36% of those in psychology. The proportion of graduate students supported by DOD has been relatively stable around 10%-12% in the last 15 years. In 2015, DOD supported 47% of the S&E graduate students in aerospace engineering, 31% of those in industrial engineering, 27% of those in electrical engineering, and 22%-23% of those in materials and mechanical engineering and in computer sciences. For doctoral degree students, notable differences exist in primary support mechanisms by type of doctorate-granting institution (\ue605 Table 2 -9). In 2015, RAs were the primary support mechanism for S&E doctorate recipients from research universities (i.e., doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity, that receive the most federal funding, and those with high research activity). For those from medical schools, which are heavily funded by NIH, fellowships or traineeships accounted for the main mechanism of support. Notable differences also exist in primary support mechanisms for doctoral degree students by sex, race and ethnicity, and Table 2 -14). In 2013-15, among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, male S&E doctorate recipients were more likely than their female peers to be supported by RAs (31% compared with 22%). Female S&E doctorate recipients were more likely than their male counterparts to receive fellowships or traineeships (28% versus 24%) and to support themselves from personal sources (18% versus 10%). Also, Asians were more likely than any other racial or ethnic group to have primary RA support (32%), followed by whites (28%). Compared with other racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native S&E doctorate recipients depended more on fellowships or traineeships (34% and 38%, respectively), and blacks and American Indians or Alaska Natives were more likely to use personal sources (28% and 19%, respectively). S&E doctorate recipients on temporary visas were more likely to have an RA (51%) than their U.S. citizen and permanent resident peers (27%); this has been a long-standing pattern. S&E doctorate recipients who were temporary visa holders were also less likely than U.S. citizens and permanent residents to use personal funds. To some extent, the sex, citizenship, and racial and ethnic differences in types of support mechanisms are related to differences in field of study. White and Asian men, as well as international doctoral degree students, are more likely than white and Asian women, along with underrepresented minority students of both sexes, to receive doctorates in engineering and physical sciences (see Appendix Table 2 -14), fields that are largely supported by RAs. In turn, women and underrepresented minorities are more likely to receive doctorates in social sciences (except for economics) and psychology, in which self-support is prevalent. However, some differences in type of support by sex, race and ethnicity, or citizenship remain after accounting for these doctoral field patterns. In 7 out of the 10 broad S&E fields presented in Appendix Table 2-14, men were more likely than women to have had RA as primary sources of support during their doctoral studies. In contrast, in 7 out of the 10 broad S&E fields, women were more likely to have used personal funds as a source of support. When looking at race and ethnicity patterns in primary source of support among U.S. citizen and permanent residents, in 8 out of the 10 S&E broad fields, Asians and whites were more likely to have used RA as primary source of support than underrepresented minorities. Underrepresented minorities (blacks in particular) were more likely than Asians and whites to have used personal funds as primary source of support in all the broad S&E fields (Appendix Table 2 -14). Overall, the variation in the use of RAs and personal funds as primary sources of support among doctorate recipients was also largely visible at very high research intensive institutions. [29] "}, {"section_title": "Graduate Debt", "text": "At the time of doctoral degree conferral, 43% of 2015 S&E doctorate recipients had debt related to their undergraduate or graduate education. In 2015, 29% of S&E doctorate recipients reported having undergraduate debt and 32% reported having graduate debt. For some S&E doctorate recipients, debt levels were high, especially for graduate debt: 6% reported more than $40,000 of undergraduate debt, 13% reported more than $40,000 of graduate debt, and 18% reported more than $40,000 in cumulative undergraduate and graduate debt (Appendix Table 2 -15). Levels of debt vary widely by doctoral field. A higher percentage of doctorate recipients in non-S&E fields (52%) than those in S&E fields (32%) reported graduate debt. In 2015, within S&E, high levels of graduate debt were most common among doctorate recipients in the social sciences, psychology, and the medical and other health sciences. The proportion of doctorate recipients in these fields who reported graduate debt has increased since 2003. [30] Psychology doctorate recipients were most likely to report having graduate debt and high levels of debt. [31] In 2015, 27% of doctorate recipients in psychology reported graduate debt of more than $70,000 (Appendix Table 2 -15).

[14] FTE enrollments are derived from the \"Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity\" section of the IPEDS Fall Enrollment survey. The FTE of an institution's part-time enrollment is estimated by multiplying part-time enrollment by factors that vary by control and level of institution and level of student; the estimated FTE of part-time enrollment is then added to the institution's FTE. The Department of Education uses this formula to produce the FTE enrollment data published annually in the Digest of Education Statistics. [15] For the definition of \"net tuition revenue,\" see Glossary. Definitions of standard revenue and expenditure categories are available in the Delta Cost Project data dictionary, available at http://www.deltacostproject.org/delta-cost-project-database. [ 16] Another large source of revenue for very high research institutions is \"hospitals, independent operations, and other sources,\" which includes revenue generated by hospitals operated by the institution and revenues independent of or unrelated to instruction, research, or public services. [17] Investment returns include realized and unrealized gains and losses. Institutions report the change in the value of their investment account, which is the reason behind the negative values under this category in Appendix Table 2-5. Thus, investment returns may not always represent revenue for the institution. [ 18] In 2015, income from private and affiliated gifts, investment returns, and endowment income at private very high research institutions was about $66,700 per FTE compared with about $27,700 in income from net tuition and $25,700 in income from federal appropriations (Appendix Table 2-5).

The data in this section correspond to the public institutions. [20] Community colleges are the public \"associate's colleges\" in the 2010 Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. [21] Despite this variability in spending from year to year, as a percent of each year's total expenditures, instruction and all other spending streams remained relatively constant between 2000 and 2015 for not only community colleges but all institution types. [ 22] The proportion of U.S.-trained doctorate holders employed at community colleges in adjunct positions grew from 12% in 1993 to 30% in 2015, according to estimates from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. This suggests that one of the ways community colleges may have reined in expenses during this period was to increase their reliance on adjuncts. [23] In this study, \"low-income\" referred to high school seniors whose families are in the bottom quartile of the income distribution. \"High-achieving\" referred to a student who scores at or above the 90th percentile on the ACT comprehensive or the SAT I (math and verbal) and whose high school grade point average is A-or higher. In this research, a \"selective college\" meant colleges and universities included in the categories from \"Very Competitive Plus\" to \"Most Competitive\" in Barron's Between 2000 and 2015, among U.S. citizens and permanent residents, the share of Hispanics and blacks enrolled full time in undergraduate programs increased (from 10% to 17% and from 11% to 13%, respectively); the shares of Asians and Pacific Islanders and of American Indians or Alaska Natives remained stable at about 6% and 1%, respectively; the share of whites declined (from 68% to 55%) (\ue604 Figure 2-9). The most recent data show that about 3% of undergraduate students enrolled report being of more than one race. In general, enrollment is higher among black, Hispanic, and white women than among their male counterparts (special tabulation, IPEDS Fall Enrollment data; for additional data on undergraduate enrollment patterns by sex and race and ethnicity, see NSF/NCSES 2017a).     (Eagan et al. 2017). [3] Increases in the proportion of freshmen planning to major in biological and agricultural sciences and in engineering account for most of this growth. In 2016 about 45% of freshmen indicated they planned to major in an S&E field (up from about 8% in 2000); about 16% in the biological and agricultural sciences; 11% in engineering; 10% in the social and behavioral sciences; 6% in mathematics, statistics, or computer sciences; and 3% in the physical sciences."}, {"section_title": "International Undergraduate Enrollment", "text": "Based on recent data collected in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) at the Department of Homeland Security, international undergraduate enrollment increased consistently from nearly 350,000 in fall 2012 to nearly 451,000 in fall 2016 but dropped to about 441,000 by fall 2017 (\ue605 Table 2-10). [4] , [5] Between 2016 and 2017, international undergraduate enrollment in S&E fields remained steady, rising only 0.2% or 360 students, while declining 3.8% in non-S&E fields during this time. The decline may reflect a smaller influx of international students in the United States, a declining proportion of them staying in the United States than in the past, or a combination of these two factors. In fall 2017, the top five countries sending S&E undergraduates to the United States were the same as in the previous year: China, Saudi Arabia, India, South Korea, and Kuwait (Appendix Table 2 -16). Compared to fall 2016, the number of S&E undergraduates from China, India, and Kuwait enrolled in fall 2017 increased (by 3%, 11%, and 4% respectively) while the number from Saudi Arabia and South Korea declined (by 18% and 7% respectively). At the undergraduate level, in 2017 40% of international students were enrolled in S&E fields (\ue605 Table 2-10; Appendix Table   2-16). Within S&E, the broad fields with the highest enrollment of international students are engineering, computer sciences, and the social sciences (particularly economics). In the most recent academic year, the number of visa holders increased in computer sciences and mathematics (by 11% and 5% respectively). The largest declines in international student enrollment were in engineering and social sciences (5% and 3% respectively) and also in non-S&E (4%).

Some drop out and do not complete any degree and others complete their degrees after switching to nonscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Degree attainment and retention are best measured by the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) survey, which examined a nationally representative cohort of first-time, beginning students at the end of their first year in 2011-12, followed up with them 3 years later, and will contact them 6 years later. [6] Of the students surveyed in 2011-12, 43% enrolled in 2-year institutions, 53% enrolled in 4-year institutions, and 5% in less than 2-year institutions. [7] Overall, the data provide limited evidence that retention patterns vary across S&E and non-S&E fields of study. Three years after enrolling in a 2-year institution in the 2011-12 academic year, about 55% of students had either completed an associate's degree (12%) or remained enrolled in school (at the same or another institution) without having earned a degree (43%); the remaining 45% were no longer enrolled at any institution and had not attained a degree (\ue605 Table   2 -11). Overall, the level of degree attainment or continued enrollment did not vary much by students' declared major field of study. However, students who had been undecided about their major in 2011-12 were more likely to be no longer enrolled at any institution without having earned a degree by the spring of 2014: 55% of those with undecided majors were no longer enrolled compared to 43% of those with majors in the natural sciences and engineering, 40% of those in the social and behavioral sciences, and 45% of those in the non-S&E fields respectively. In 4-year colleges and universities, 3 years after enrolling, the vast majority of students, were still enrolled either at their first institution or at another institution without having earned a credential (76%) or had attained an associate's or bachelor's degree (6%); about 18% had not earned a degree and were no longer enrolled at any institution. Overall those who had declared a major in S&E fields (natural sciences, engineering, and social and behavioral sciences) were slightly more likely to be enrolled 3 years later than students who had declared a non-S&E major (78% for natural sciences and engineering and 80% for social sciences compared to 74% for non-S&E majors). In addition, a higher proportion of students who declared a non-S&E major were somewhat more likely to be no longer enrolled at any institution (20%) than those who had declared a natural sciences and engineering (16%) or a social and behavioral sciences major (15%) (\ue605 Table 2 "}, {"section_title": "Field Switching", "text": "Among undergraduates who began postsecondary education in a 4-year institution, the majority who had declared a major during their first year in 2011-12 continued in the same major 3 years later.

Of the students who had not decided on a major in their first year, about equal proportions were enrolled in S&E (43%) or non-S&E (44%) fields 3 years later; the remainder continued to be undecided. Although a greater proportion of students who started as S&E majors switched to a non-S&E field than the other way around, major switching resulted in a net increase in the number of S&E students. The absolute number of students switching into S&E fields is larger than those switching out because more than half of students start in non-S&E or undeclared majors (\ue605 Table 2 -12).

Higher education financing data are not always fully comparable across different nations. They can vary between countries for reasons unrelated to actual expenditures, such as differences in measurement, types and levels of government funding included, types and levels of education included, and the prevalence of public versus private institutions. [3] Educational Attainment Educational attainment, measured as the proportion of a population that has reached a specific level of education, is often used as a proxy for human capital and the skill levels associated with that particular education level (OECD 2016). Higher education in the United States expanded greatly after World War II. As a result, the U.S. population led the world in educational attainment for several decades. Because of this, the United States offered clear advantages for firms whose work would benefit from the availability of a highly educated workforce. In the 1990s, however, many countries in Europe and Asia began to expand their higher education systems. Some of them have now surpassed the United States in the attainment of bachelor's or higher-level degrees among their younger cohorts. The generational shift in attainment so visible in many systems is not visible in the United States. Over time, the expansion of higher education elsewhere has substantially diminished the U.S. educational advantage. Although the United States continues to be among the top countries with the highest percentage of the population ages 25-64 with a bachelor's degree or higher, many countries have surpassed the United States in the percentage of the younger population (ages 25-34) with a bachelor's degree or higher (\ue604 Figure 2-23).

Most large countries in Europe are not far behind, with women earning more than 40% of S&E first university degrees. In most countries in the Middle East, except for Iran, women earned nearly half or more of the S&E first university degrees. In Asia, women generally earn about one-third or fewer of the first university degrees awarded in S&E fields. For example, in Taiwan, women earn 26% of the S&E first university degrees; in Japan, 29%; in South Korea, 34%; in Singapore, 36%. Malaysia is the exception, with 55% of its S&E first university degrees awarded to women in 2015 (Appendix Table 2-36). In the United States and Canada, more than half of the S&E first university degrees earned by women were in the social and behavioral sciences, and less than 10% were in engineering. In contrast, in South Korea and Singapore, nearly half of the S&E first university degrees earned by women were in engineering. Among the largest producers of S&E degrees (those in which 40% of their first university degrees were in S&E), other countries with relatively high proportions of women earning first university degrees in engineering include Portugal (37%), Iran (35%), Romania (35%), and Malaysia (33%)."}, {"section_title": "International Comparison of S&E Doctoral Degrees", "text": "More than 230,000 S&E doctoral degrees were awarded worldwide in 2014. [8] The United States awarded the largest number of S&E doctoral degrees of any country (about 40,000), followed by China (about 34,000), Russia (about 19,000), Germany (about 15,000), the United Kingdom (about 14,000), and India (about 13,000) (Appendix Table 2 -37). About 73,000 S&E doctoral degrees were earned in the EU (including the United Kingdom and Germany). The number of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in China rose steeply between 2000 and 2009, but the increase has slowed since then. Although the rise was steeper in China, doctoral production also increased in the United States (Appendix 2-38 and Appendix Table 2 -39). In the United States, about 37% of these doctorates were awarded to temporary visa holders. [9] Many of these doctorate recipients stay in the United States after obtaining their degree (for a discussion on \"stay rates\" of doctorate recipients who are temporary visa holders, see Chapter 3) In 2007, China surpassed the United States as the world's largest producer of natural sciences and engineering doctoral degrees, but the numbers of doctoral degrees in these fields in these two countries remain close (\ue604 Figure 2-25). The high growth of graduate education in China has been the result of large government investments in higher education over the last 20 years, intended to establish world-class universities in this country. Project 211 and Project 985 are examples of programs launched by the Chinese government in the mid-1990s to establish and strengthen institutions of higher education and key fields of study as a national priority (Lixu 2004). [10] CHAPTER 2 | Higher Education in Science 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009   In the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Ireland, and Estonia, the largest numbers of S&E doctoral degrees were awarded in the natural sciences, including the physical and biological sciences, and mathematics and statistics (Appendix Table 2 -38). In many other countries, the proportion of S&E doctoral degrees in engineering is 40% or greater; that is the case, for example, in Sweden, Slovakia, Latvia, Greece, Finland, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Austria. In Asia, China has been the largest producer of S&E doctoral degrees since 2000 (Appendix Table 2 -39). As China's capacity for advanced S&E education increased, the number of S&E doctorates awarded rose from about 8,000 in 2000 to more than 34,000 in 2014. Despite the growth in the quantity of doctorate recipients, some question the quality of the doctoral programs in China (Cyranoski et al. 2011). The rate of growth in doctoral degrees in S&E and in all fields has considerably slowed starting in 2010 (Appendix Table 2-39), after an announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Education indicating that China would begin to limit admissions to doctoral programs and focus more on the quality of graduate education (Mooney 2007). Between 2000 and 2014, the number of S&E doctorates awarded in India, South Korea, and Taiwan more than doubled; in Japan, the numbers rose consistently through 2006 but declined since then). In China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, more than half of S&E doctorates were awarded in engineering. In India, 58% of the S&E doctorates were awarded in the natural sciences, computer sciences and agricultural sciences, 22% in the social and behavioral sciences, and 20% in engineering (Appendix Table 2-39). Women earned 42% of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in the United States in 2014, about the same percentage earned by women in Canada and the EU (Appendix Table 2-40). [11] Women earned more than half of S&E doctoral degrees in Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, and Argentina but less than 25% of those in South Korea and Taiwan."}, {"section_title": "International Student Mobility", "text": "Governments around the world have increasingly come to regard movement toward a knowledge-based economy as key to economic progress. Realizing that this requires a well-trained workforce, they have invested in upgrading and expanding their higher education systems and broadening participation in them. In most instances, government spending underwrites these initiatives. Recent investments by several governments to send large numbers of their students to study abroad are a strategy for workforce and economic development. Examples include the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program (also known as Science without Borders), launched officially in July 2011, which provides scholarships to Brazilian students to study in STEM fields in universities in the United States. [12] In 2013, the Mexican government announced its Proyecta 100,000 program, which plans to send 100,000 students to study in the United States and to welcome 50,000 U.S. citizens to study in Mexico by 2018 (Helms and Griffin 2017;Lloyd 2014). The Chinese government has established the China Scholarship Council, a nonprofit affiliated with the Ministry of Education with the goal to provide financial assistance to Chinese citizens to study abroad, as well as to foreign citizens to study in China (China Scholarship Council 2017). Similarly, the government of Saudi Arabia has invested considerably in a scholarship program launched in 2005 that has supported study abroad programs for more than 100,000 Saudi students throughout the world, at an estimated cost of at least $5 billion since the program's inception. In 2016, however, a tighter national budget in Saudi Arabia has resulted in a 12% reduction in financial support for this initiative (Knickmeyer 2012;Walcutt 2016). The EU set the goal that 20% of its higher education graduates should have experienced tertiary-level study or training abroad by 2020 (OECD 2016). Students have become more internationally mobile in the past two decades, and countries are increasingly competing for them. According to data from UNESCO/UIS, the number of internationally mobile students who pursued a higher education degree more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, to 4.3 million. [13] In general, students migrate from developing countries to the more developed countries and from Europe and Asia to the United States. However, a few countries have emerged as regional hubs for certain geographic regions-for example, Australia, China, and South Korea for East Asia and South Africa for sub-Saharan Africa (Bhandari, Belyavina, and Gutierrez 2011;UNESCO 2009). In Asia, two new programs, ASEAN International Mobility for Students and Passage to ASEAN, encourage student mobility within Asia, although the level of student mobility within the region is still low, except for the student exchanges between Malaysia and Indonesia. In addition, several countries have set targets for increasing the numbers of international students they host; among these are Jordan (which plans to host 100,000 students by 2020), Singapore (150,000 by 2015), Japan (300,000 by 2025), and China (500,000 by 2020) (Bhandari and Belyavina 2012). Decisions about whether and where to study abroad are complex (OECD 2016). Some students migrate temporarily for education, whereas others remain abroad permanently after completing their studies. Some factors influencing the decision to seek a degree abroad include the policies of the countries of origin regarding sponsoring their citizens' studies abroad, the tuition fee policies of the countries of destination, the financial support the countries of destination offer to international students, the cost of living and exchange rates that affect the cost of international education, and the quality of the programs and the perceived value of obtaining a foreign credential. The long-term return on investment from international education also depends on how international degrees are recognized by the labor market in the country of origin or elsewhere. For host countries, enrolling international students can help raise revenues from higher education and can be part of a larger strategy to attract highly skilled workers, particularly as demographic changes in many developed countries cause their own populations of college-age students to decrease (OECD 2012) (Appendix Table 2-41). In recent years, many countries have expanded their provision of transnational education. One growing trend is the establishment of branch campuses: offshore programs established by higher education institutions in foreign countries. For local students, branch campuses provide the opportunity to earn degrees from foreign universities without leaving their home countries. For the institution venturing into a new country, meeting enrollment and financial goals without diluting quality standards is often a challenge. Branch campuses that bring in faculty from other countries can also fulfill some of the demand for highly qualified instructors that local higher education institutions cannot meet (UNESCO/UIS 2014). According to the State University of New York at Albany's Cross-Border Education Research Team (C-BERT 2017), a clearinghouse of information and research on transnational education, as of January 2017, there were 310 international branch campuses in operation. C-BERT defines a branch campus as \"an entity that is owned, at least in part, by a foreign higher education provider; operated in the name of the foreign education provider; and provides an entire academic program, substantially on site, leading to a degree awarded by the foreign education provider.\" Exporting countries (i.e., home countries of the institutions establishing branch campuses) totaled 34, and importing countries (i.e., host countries for branch campuses) totaled 84. The largest exporters of branch campuses, in order of the number of branch campuses established, were the United States (109 branch campuses), the United Kingdom (45), France (31), Russia (22), and Australia (21). The largest importers of branch campuses, in order of the number of branch campuses they hosted, were China (38 branch campuses), the United Arab Emirates (33), United Arab Emirates at Dubai (32), Malaysia (16), Singapore (15), and Qatar (12). In some cases, branch campuses are a part of what countries designate as an international \"education hub.\" C-BERT defines an education hub as \"a designated region intended to attract foreign investment, retain local students, build a regional reputation by providing access to high-quality education and training for both international and domestic students, and create a knowledge-based economy.\" An education hub can include different combinations of domestic and international institutions, branch campuses, and foreign partnerships within the designated region. Examples of education hubs include Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Botswana (C-BERT 2017; Knight 2014). More internationally mobile students (undergraduate and graduate) go to the United States than to any other country (19% of internationally mobile students worldwide) (\ue604 Figure 2-26 United Kingdom (10%), Australia (6%), France (5%), Russia (5%), and Germany (5%). Together with the United States, these countries receive about half of all internationally mobile students worldwide. Although the United States remains the destination for the largest number of internationally mobile students worldwide, its overall share has declined from 25% in 2000to 19% in 2014(OECD 2016. As in other countries, the proportion of internationally mobile students in the United States is higher at the graduate than at the undergraduate level (see Appendix Data are based on the number of students who have crossed a national border and moved to another country with the objective of studying (i.e., mobile students)."}, {"section_title": "Japan", "text": "In the context of slowing student enrollment, in 2008, the Japanese government announced plans to triple international enrollment within 12 years (McNeil 2008within 12 years (McNeil , 2010. Although Japan succeeded in increasing its enrollment of international students between 2004 and 2016 (in S&E and in all fields), growth has slowed considerably in the last 4 years (Appendix Table   2-43; Appendix Table NSB 2012 2-42; Appendix Table NSB 2014  , perhaps caused in part by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami (McNeil 2012). In 2016, nearly 70,000 international students were enrolled in S&E programs in Japanese universities, similar to the preceding 4 years and up from 57,000 in 2004. As in other countries, international students accounted for a smaller proportion of students at the undergraduate than at the graduate level in 2014 (3% of undergraduate and 19% of graduate S&E students). The vast majority of the international students were from Asia. In 2016, Chinese students accounted for slightly more than half of the international S&E undergraduate students and graduate students in Japan. South Koreans were 16% of the international undergraduates and 6% of the international graduate students. Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan are among the top 10 locations of origin that send both undergraduate and graduate students to Japan (Appendix Table 2 -43)."}, {"section_title": "Canada", "text": "International students also constitute a larger share of enrollment at the graduate than at the undergraduate level in Canada (Appendix Table 2 -44). Between 2004 and 2014, the proportion of international enrollment in Canadian universities grew slightly, from 6% to 7% at the undergraduate level and from 20% to 21% at the graduate level. In 2014, the highest percentages of international S&E students were in mathematics and computer sciences and in engineering, at both degree levels. At the undergraduate level, China was the top country of origin of international S&E students in Canada, accounting for 29% of international undergraduate students, followed by France and the United States (14% and 10%, respectively). The proportion of international undergraduate S&E students in Canada from China and France increased considerably between 2004 and 2014, while the proportion of students from the United States declined. At the graduate level, the top country of origin of international S&E students was also China with close to 3,700 students, but the country of origin of graduate S&E students was diverse. For example, France and India each sent about 2,500 S&E students to Canada, and Iran sent about 1,900. Unlike undergraduate students, during 2004 and 2014, the proportion of international graduate students from China declined slightly, and the proportion of those from France and the United States increased. The proportion of Indian S&E graduate students studying in Canada increased from 5% to 13% between 2004 and 2014, and the proportion of Iranian S&E students doubled to 10% in 2014."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Students Studying Abroad", "text": "Although the United States hosts the largest number of international students worldwide, U.S. students constitute a relatively small share of international students worldwide. About 70,000 U.S. students (in all fields) were reported as international students by OECD and OECD partner countries in 2012, far fewer than the number of international students from China, India, South Korea, Germany, Turkey, or France. The main destinations of U.S. students were the United Kingdom (about 16,600), Canada (about 9,600), Germany (about 4,300), France (about 3,900), New Zealand (about 3,200), and Australia (about 2,900)-mostly English-speaking OECD countries (OECD 2014). Given the relatively low number of U.S. students who study abroad and the importance of international experience in a globalized world, in 2014, the Institute of International Education (IIE) established Generation Study Abroad. This 5-year initiative has the goal to increase the number of U.S. students studying abroad, in credit and degree programs, to about 600,000 by 2019 (IIE 2017b). About 300,000 U.S. university students enrolled in study abroad programs in the 2014-15 academic year (credit mobilitysee Glossary), a 3% increase from the preceding year but almost double the number from 2000-01 (IIE 2016). Nearly 40% were enrolled in programs during the summer term, about one-third enrolled in programs lasting one semester, and nearly a quarter enrolled in short-term programs lasting up to 8 weeks. Only 3% enrolled for the full academic year, and very few enrolled for one or two quarters. The vast majority were undergraduates, primarily juniors and seniors; about 10% were master's students; and 1% were doctoral students. Two-thirds of the U.S. students studying abroad were women, and nearly three-quarters were white. More than one-third were studying in S&E fields: 17% in social sciences, 8% in physical or life sciences, 5% in engineering, 2% in mathematics or computer sciences, and 2% in agricultural sciences; these proportions have been fairly stable since 2000-01. The leading destinations for study abroad programs in the 2014-15 academic year were the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, followed by France and China. [14] [1] For most countries, the data in Appendix Table 2-33 include public and private sources. [2] The most recent data available from Canada correspond to 2012. [3] According to an international database compiled by the State University of New York at Albany's Program for Research on Private Higher Education (2011), the United States and Japan have long-standing private higher education sectors, and Western Europe has an almost completely public higher education sector. Eastern and Central Europe and several African countries have recently seen growth in private higher education. In most countries in Latin America, more than half of all higher education institutions are private. In Asia, many governments have encouraged the expansion of private higher education as one of the strategies to deal with high enrollment growth (see sidebar Trends in Higher Education in Asia in NSB 2016). In 2011, about 80% of the students in South Korea and Japan and 60%-64% of the students in Singapore, the Philippines, Nepal, Indonesia, and Cambodia were enrolled in private institutions (UNESCO/UIS 2014). [4] These data are based on ISCED 2011 and are thus not comparable with data presented in earlier volumes based on ISCED 1997. These data are based on national labor force surveys and are subject to sampling error; therefore, small differences between countries may not be meaningful (OECD 2016). Community colleges play a key role in increasing access to higher education for all citizens. Many U.S. citizen and permanent resident degree holders report earning college credit from a community college. Nearly half of Hispanic undergraduates are enrolled in them. The expected demographic growth in the number of Hispanic students between 20 and 24 years of age will affect community colleges and HHEs. Over the last two decades, higher education spending and revenue patterns and trends have undergone substantial changes, which intensified during the recent economic downturn. Public institutions faced competing demands in a tight budget environment, caught between declining state appropriations and the need to maintain educational quality and access. Despite the decline in enrollment in 2013-14, net tuition per FTE student continued to increase with the decrease in revenues from state and local appropriations in public institutions, so challenges remain. Globalization of higher education continues. Universities in several other countries have expanded their enrollment of international S&E students. In the United States, international student enrollment in S&E has recovered since the post-9/11 decline, increasing considerably at the undergraduate and graduate levels in S&E and non-S&E fields, but in the last year international enrollment declined. Overall, the United States continues to attract the largest number of internationally mobile students worldwide, although its share of international students in all fields has dropped since the turn of the century. The U.S. proportion may decrease further if the declining trend in international enrollment continues. Higher education is facing rapid technological transformations. The growth of distance and online education through MOOCs and similar innovations expands access to knowledge and has the potential to decrease the cost of some degrees, at the same time as pressures have been increasing to reduce rising costs. In computer sciences in particular, students can now obtain certificates that provide them with a specific set of skills they can apply to the job; these provide an affordable and flexible alternative to students' training. However, it is too early to assess whether different types of institutions will widely adopt MOOCs, whether increased access will be accompanied by increased learning, and what consequences distance and online innovations will bring to the higher education landscape."}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Definitions", "text": "Credit mobility: Temporary tertiary education within the framework of enrollment in a tertiary education program at a home institution (usually) for the purpose of gaining academic credit (i.e., credit that will be recognized in that home institution).
