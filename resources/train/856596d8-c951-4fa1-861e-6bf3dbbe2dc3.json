[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Heart failure is a progressive condition, and its incidence increases with advanced age [1] [2] [3] . Previous studies have reported that heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (EF) often occurs at a higher frequency in older women than in older men [4, 5] . Echocardiographic classification of diastolic function in cross-sectional community studies has shown diastolic dysfunction to be highly prevalent and associated with heart failure [6, 7] and heart failure prognosis [8] .\nObesity is a well-known reliable predictor of heart failure in middle-aged and elderly subjects [1] . However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) is not a risk factor of cardiovascular disease in metabolically healthy normalweight subjects (BMI < 25 kg/m 2 ). However, obesity in metabolically healthy subjects is associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular death [9] . Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a well-described constellation of risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and central adiposity, that leads to the development of cardiovascular disease [10] . The degree of MetS clustering is strongly related to left ventricular (LV) mass [11] , wall thickness [12] , and mitral E/A ratio (i.e., the ratio of early to late diastolic flow velocities on Doppler) [13] , and patients with MetS are thought to have a risk of heart failure [14] . The progressive addition of MetS risk factors, such as obesity [15] , diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia, is associated with increased LV mass, independently of hypertension [16] . In a previous study, Canepa et al. (from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) graded diastolic function in a population-based sample and found waist circumference (WC) to be predictive of abnormal diastolic function [17] . Their findings revealed that the assessment of diastolic dysfunction without tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) had limited accuracy because of the pseudo-normalization that occurs in two-dimensional echocardiography. Therefore, TDI technology has become a standard method of assessing LV diastolic function, providing both pathophysiological and prognostic insight into systolic and diastolic heart failure [18, 19] . Although recent studies have reported a relationship between age and LV myocardial relaxation (LVMR) according to gender [20] , the association of MetS and its component criteria on cardiac structure and function is poorly characterized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have evaluated the relationship between LVMR and MetS risk factors by TDI among healthy individuals without diabetes mellitus and/or cardiovascular disease. Age-related changes in LV diastolic indices have been previously reported in a communitybased study [21] . However, gender-specific differences in LV diastolic indices remain poorly understood in healthy subjects. In addition to MetS risk factors, other factors, such as aging and BMI, have been reported as risk factors of LVMR [22, 23] . However, no previous report has evaluated cardiovascular, MetS, and organ dysfunction risk factors among healthy individuals according to gender using multiple regression analysis.\nTotal Health Care (THC) is a health check system offered by our institution that includes over 1,000 registered members. We conduct detailed annual health examinations, which comprise detailed metabolic profiles, two-dimensional and TDI echocardiography, pulmonary functional tests, chest computed tomography scans, head magnetic resonance imaging/angiography, gastrointestinal endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasonography. Registered members are monitored for several years and have been followed for a mean 52 months.\nIn the present study, we analyzed the relationship between LV diastolic dysfunction and risk factors of MetS and cardiovascular disease in healthy individuals based on data obtained from the records of our unique THC system."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and protocol", "text": "Participants were registered THC members who underwent annual medical examinations between 2004 and 2011. Medical histories and physical examination findings were recorded for all participants, and participants underwent the following examinations on the first and second visits, which were within 6 month of registration: (1) Tissue Doppler echocardiography was conducted to assess LV diastolic function. (2) Blood pressure was measured after a 10-min rest in the sitting position and was expressed as the mean of three consecutive measurements in each arm using the conventional cuff method. (3) Blood sampling was performed in the morning after a 12-h overnight fast. The following blood components were subsequently assessed by standard laboratory techniques: plasma triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin (Hb), serum albumin concentration (Alb), uric acid (UA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum creatinine (Cr). (4) Pulmonary functional tests were performed to evaluate the following parameters: the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (VC; expressed as a percent predicted for age and sex). The annual health examination items are listed in Table A in S1 File.\nExclusion criteria included the following: 1) history or findings of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure symptoms or systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [LVEF] of <55%), coronary artery disease, significant valvular heart disease (i.e., greater than mild valvular insufficiency or stenosis), and/or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; 2) diabetes mellitus; 3) current pregnancy or lactation; and/or 4) major systemic illness such as malignancy."}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "The Human Research Protection Office of Tokyo Women's Medical University approved this protocol (#2507).

Systolic dysfunction was defined as an LVEF of <55%. Diastolic function was assessed by pulse-wave Doppler examination of mitral flow and Doppler imaging of the medial mitral annulus according to Redfield et al. [8] . In brief, TDI was performed in the apical 4-chamber view. Pulsed wave Doppler was used to obtain mitral annular velocity on the septal side. Peak early mitral annular velocity (e 0 ) and peak late mitral annular velocity (a 0 ) were recorded and measured; e 0 was used as an index of LVMR [20] , An abnormal, severe LVMR was defined as an e 0 value of <5 m/s according to the classification previously described by Lester et al. [26] .\nExtra-cardiac major organ system dysfunction Extra-cardiac major organ system dysfunction was evaluated as a risk factor for diastolic dysfunction. The measurement variables defining non-cardiac dysfunction included the following: 1) renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance [Ccr] <60 mL/min), 2) hyperuricemia (UA >7.0 mg/ dL), 3) hypoalbuminemia (Alb <3.5 mg/dL), 4) anemia (Hb <12 mg/dL in men, Hb <11 mg/dL in women), 5) pulmonary dysfunction (%VC <80% or FEV1.0 <70%), and 6) inflammation (CRP >0.03 mg/dL)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Prior to analysis, we reviewed the distribution of the data using the Normally distributed data are reported as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), non-normally distributed data as medians and interquartile range, and categorical data as absolute values and percentages.

Moreover, 21.0% of men (130/620) and 15.9% of women (49/435) had abnormal LVMR. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample showed the mean values of all data were within standard values ( Table 1 ).

No correlation was observed with Hb or LDL-C (Table 2) . Next, various factors potentially contributing to abnormal LVMR (e 0 <5 m/s) were evaluated. Significant differences in age, gender, WC, SBP, HDL-C, FPG, HbA1c, UA, Ccr, and %VC were observed between the normal and abnormal LVMR groups.

Because most cases of abnormal LVMR occurred in males, we analyzed the risk factors separately according to gender. In the multiple logistic analysis, only abnormal WC (85 cm) was an independent predictor of abnormal LVMR in men (OR 2.795, CI 1.649-4.737, P < 0.001). However, in women, both high DBP (85 mmHg) and abnormal WC (90 cm) were independent predictors of abnormal LVMR (OR 3.972, CI 1.557-10.136, P < 0.007; OR 2.086, CI 1.031-4.217, P = 0.041, respectively). In normal-weight subjects, aging, abnormal WC, and renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min) were independent predictors of abnormal LVMR (OR 1.080, CI 1.054-1.107, P < 0.001; OR 2.793, CI 1.793-4.352, P < 0.001; OR 2.142, CI 1.263-3.632, P = 0.005, respectively).

Recently, Russo et al. reported the correlation between BMI and E/e 0 or e 0 in adults [23] . In our study, although BMI showed a correlation with e 0 by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, it was not correlated with abnormal LVMR in the univariate analysis and was not an independent predictor of LVMR when adjusted for age and gender in the multivariate analysis. We found that only abnormal WC was an independent predictor of abnormal LVMR in all healthy participants. Thus, we can assume that central adiposity is a significant factor for abnormal LVMR, particularly in healthy participants without obesity. It was recently reported that in individuals with metabolic disease, the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was independently associated with altered parameters of diastolic function [27] . These findings also support our results. Canepa et al. [17] have already shown the effect of central adiposity on LV diastolic function; however, in their study, the mean BMI was 27 \u00b1 5 kg/m 2 and the mean WC was 99 \u00b1 10 cm in men and 85 \u00b1 11 cm in women. This means that most study participants were overweight and had an abnormal waist circumference. Thus, it is assumed to be difficult to investigate the relationship between the MetS factors and LVMR. Hence, we investigated the relationship in healthy subjects without diabetes, and in those who were not overweight or obese."}, {"section_title": "DBP was an independent risk factor of abnormal LVMR among women", "text": "In the present study, high DBP was an additional independent risk factor for abnormal LVMR among healthy women but not among healthy men. At least a partial explanation for this gender-specific result is the differences in vascular stiffness between women and men as a result of hormone release, such as estrogen [28, 29] .\nAging and central obesity in men LVMR deteriorates with age and is a symptom of cardiac aging. Our results showed an increase in abnormal LVMR in an age-dependent manner (data not shown), and the average e 0 also decreased with age, consistent with previous research [20] . We also found that WC and BMI correlated with LVMR. This indicates that the prevalence of obesity, a risk factor of diastolic LV dysfunction [23] , is increased in elderly individuals. However, WC and not BMI was identified as an independent risk factor of abnormal LVMR in healthy men without obesity and overweight, suggesting that central adiposity is more important than obesity as a risk factor of abnormal LVMR."}, {"section_title": "Extra-cardiac dysfunction and risk of abnormal LVMR", "text": "Previous studies have reported that higher serum Cr, lower FEV1 to FVC ratio, and lower Hb concentrations were associated with an increased risk of heart failure [30] .

In our study, we used the criteria for metabolic syndrome proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension and seven additional societies in 2005 [24] .
