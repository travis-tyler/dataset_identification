[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Aransas-Wood Buffalo whooping cranes (Grus americana) make up the only natural self-sustaining population of these endangered migratory wading birds in the world. Human and natural pressures threaten habitat quantity, quality, and integrity on their wintering grounds along the central Texas coast. This project developed tools for habitat conservation planning to support the endangered species downlisting goal of 1,000 cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population. First, a Comprehensive Habitat Type Database (CHTD) of benthic, wetland, and upland environments was developed from best available land cover information and bathymetric data. Then, habitat preference was determined using the CHTD and a spatially explicit dataset of whooping crane sightings from 2004 to 2010. About 1,000 km 2 of preferred habitat were mapped across the 7,000 km 2 study area. Projected losses and gains of preferred habitat as a result of sea level rise were then identified using results from the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) for various sea level rise scenarios up to the year 2100. Under 1 m of sea level rise, about 33% of preferred habitat is expected to be lost by 2100. Results showed that to reach the International Recovery Plan downlisting goal of 1,000 cranes, habitat conservation efforts must extend beyond the central Texas coast.

Currently consisting of a population of about 300 individuals, the International Recovery Plan for the Whooping Crane sets a population goal of 1,000 individuals, or 250 reproductive pairs in this population to down-list the whooping crane from endangered to threatened status. To reach this population goal, whooping cranes will have to occupy previously unused habitat beyond the protected lands of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Additionally, the extent and configuration of estuarine marsh and related intertidal wetlands-primary habitat for whooping cranes-is threatened by sea level rise impacts such as erosion and inundation by open water. To reach the conservation goal for the whooping cranes, conservation planners should prioritize conservation of currently unprotected lands, taking into account potential sea level rise impacts on whooping crane habitat. This project seeks to develop conservation planning tools, such as conservation priority maps, using available data to aid in the maximization of conservation effort in locations where it would be most effective."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The goal of this study is to develop decision support tools for the conservation of wintering habitat to support 1,000 whooping cranes along the central Texas coast. The habitat conservation planning (HCP) framework developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006) provides an approach for the development of a spatially explicit, assumption-driven analysis of land cover information and biological data to answer the following questions for this study area: (1) what constitutes good wintering habitat for whooping cranes along the central Texas coast: (2) where is that habitat located, (3) is there enough habitat to support a conservation goal of 1,000 whooping cranes along the central Texas coast,and (4) In what ways might the spatial configuration of that habitat change as a result of sea level rise? To answer these questions, the following objectives were set: 1.) Develop a continuous land cover dataset using best available information that describes the study area at the highest spatial and thematic resolution possible and in terms that are ecologically meaningful and commonly understood.\nThe first objective of this project was to develop a continuous land cover data set using best available information that describes the study area at the highest spatial and thematic resolution possible and in terms that are ecologically meaningful and commonly understood. Upon examination of the available land cover datasets, it was determined that no single dataset included thematically detailed information for subtidal, intertidal wetland, fresh marsh, and upland environments. Because all these environments are important to the whooping crane for some aspect of its life cycle, and because sea level rise can potentially affect environments from deep water to upland in coastal regions, the development of a land cover dataset combining the best available information for benthic/subtidal, wetland/intertidal, and upland environments was undertaken.\nThe ultimate goal of this project was to provide decision support tools for conservation planning toward the goal of preserving enough wintering habitat to support 1,000 whooping cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population. The first tool developed was a Comprehensive Habitat Type Database (CHTD) which interpreted land cover types across the study area in terms of micro-, meso-, and macro-scale avian habitat selection. The second objective of this project was to identify the extent and location of    (Stehn and Taylor 2006). As the cranes' range expanded, so did the survey area. Stehn and Taylor (2006) determined that over the wintering seasons 1988-89 through 2004-05, the percentage of cranes located by aerial surveys averaged 95.3%. During drought years such as 1993-94 when typical food resources such as blue crabs and Carolina wolfberry were scare, cranes spent more time in unusual locations such as uplands (Stehn 1992), bringing the location accuracy to a minimum of 89.4% (Stehn and Taylor 2006). In years when food resources were considered good such as 1996-97, location accuracy was closer to 98% (Stehn and Taylor 2006). Prior to 1997, locations of observed cranes were plotted on hand drawn maps. Taylor point out some of these concerns themselves, but propose no changes to the method (Stehn and Taylor 2006). Even so, the whooping cranes survey data is one of the most complete and longest-term datasets for the growth of a small population of endangered birds in the study of wildlife (Stehn and Taylor 2006), and no comparable location data for the whooping cranes on their winter range exists. Stehn and Taylor (2006) also point out that the annual winter population census is the only time when accurate monitoring of the AWB whooping crane population can be undertaken-they are much more disperse on their summer grounds in an area with less visibility from the air-and monitoring the population size is the most important management action that can be undertaken as long as the species is classified as endangered.

Though whooping cranes were most likely never observed in large numbers, their historic range was wide, once extending throughout the North American Great Plains, from the central latitudes of Canada to the high grasslands of central Mexico, with observations made as far east as New Jersey and as far west as Utah (Allen 1952). It has been estimated that, prior to European settlement of North America, whooping cranes numbered in the thousands, dwindling to around 1,300 birds by 1870 and reaching an all-time low of about 15 birds around (Allen 1952). The last naturally occurring population of whooping cranesknown as the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population (AWBP) or the Western Migratory Flock-was estimated to consist of 304 birds in the wintering season of 2013-14 (Harrell 2014. The AWBP spends almost 6 months out of the year in and around the marshes and tidal flats of Aransas National Wildlife Refuge between late October and the first of May. The 4,000 km spring migration to their breeding grounds at Wood-Buffalo National Park in Alberta, Canada begins in late March, during which the cranes travel through critical habitat in Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, and North Dakota. It has been well documented that the whooping crane is strongly tied to wetland environments on its breeding grounds in Canada (e.g. Allen 1952, Timoney 1999, throughout its migration Since 1975, four attempts at whooping crane reintroduction have been made with varying levels of success. A cross-fostering experiment in Gray's Lake, Idaho was initiated in 1975 and discontinued in 1989 when it was determined that though many of the whooping cranes successfully reached maturity and learned the migration route, the flock had a low probability of ever becoming self-sustaining because they failed to form successful breeding pairs (Travsky and Beauvais 2004). In 1993, a non-migratory population was established on the Kissimmee Prairie in Florida. Over an 11 year period, 289 captive-reared juvenile whooping cranes were released; in 2008, 31 birds remained (Folk et al 2008). Disease transmission, a series of extreme drought years, and habitat loss to development were identified as factors contributing to the low survival and productivity of this flock (Harrell and Bidwell 2013). Currently, two experimental populations of whooping cranes exist-one non-migratory flock of about 25 adult and 10 juvenile birds near White Lake, Louisiana (where a small natural, non-migratory population was once located), and the Eastern Migratory Population of about 100 birds that migrate between breeding grounds in Wisconsin and summer grounds on the northern Florida Gulf coast (Harrell and Bidwell 2013). Both populations are still very young, and it is too early to determine whether these reintroduction efforts will be successful. If these or additional whooping crane reintroduction efforts are not successful and the AWBP remains the only self-sustaining population, it would need to grow to 1,000 individuals, including 250 productive pairs, to attain down-listing from endangered to threatened status (Canadian Wildlife Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). It is thought that primary limiting factors as the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population grows will be available wintering habitat along the central Texas Gulf coast. Major direct and immediate anthropogenic pressures include reduced freshwater inflow into the bay systems that impact the health and productivity of estuary-dependent food sources such as blue crabs and Carolina wolfberry, pollution and disturbance from increasing residential coastal development, potential pollution impacts and disturbance caused by commercial ship traffic along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway shipping channel, nearby oil drilling, and transition of natural ecosystems to cultivated agricultural land (Meine and Archibald 1996). Potential whooping crane habitat is also threatened by longer-term process such as sea level rise, which will most likely lead to loss of whooping crane habitat to open water inundation of salt marsh, and transition of salt marsh habitat to mangrove forest as a result of increased mean annual winter temperatures (Osland et al 2013). Stehn and Prieto (2009) estimate that under current conditions, suitable whooping crane habitat contiguous to their current range can support between 329 and 576 whooping cranes, or 33%-58% of the population size needed to reach the down-listing goal of 250 productive whooping crane pairs. To ensure the future viability of the whooping crane population, and to reach the down-listing goal of 1,000 whooping cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population, conservation efforts should focus on identifying and protecting lands outside the current range of whooping cranes on the central Texas coast, taking into consideration potential impacts sea level rise on important potential whooping crane habitat."}, {"section_title": "Strategic Habitat Conservation", "text": "Over the last decade, theoretical and technological advancements in the science and practice of conservation have widened the scope of conservation planning from a site-specific, opportunity-or activity-based approach to a landscape-level discipline. In response to these changes, and recognizing increased demand for cost efficiency in habitat management, The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in partnership with the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) established a framework for conservation planning that can be applied by any agency or organization whose mandate is the conservation of wildlife populations. Termed strategic habitat conservation (SHC), the focus of this process is to achieve measureable biological conservation outcomes through the incorporation of adaptive management principles and assumption-driven research (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). The ultimate goal of SHC is to conserve biological populations and the ecological functions that sustain them; conservation of habitat is identified as a means to reach that goal. Within the strategic habitat conservation framework, conservation goals are developed to emphasize biological outcomes such as conserve enough habitat to sustain 1,000 whooping cranes on their wintering grounds, as opposed to an activity-based objective such as protect and improve more habitat for whooping cranes. Though protecting more habitat for whooping cranes may be a worthwhile goal, the questions \"What habitat?\", \"Where?\" and \"How much?\" are left unanswered. Setting conservation goals in terms of specific biological objectives necessitates a clear understanding of how exactly these objectives may be met, facilitates the identification of knowledge gaps, helps to highlight potential factors that could limit success, and provides the starting point for a scientific approach to determining whether the objective had been (or can be) met. SCH also emphasizes the use of spatial variables such as land cover and elevation in conjunction with biological data to create models that tie biological populations to the landscape. Such models provide a basis for setting justifiable population objectives. Because models include identifiable uncertainties and explicit assumptions, the development of conservation actions using models creates an opportunity to employ the strategy of adaptive management. Results from conservation actions based on biological models can be used to refine future models, which can then be used to develop future conservation actions ( Fig. 1)."}, {"section_title": "Fig. 1", "text": "The Strategic Habitat Conservation framework is an iterative process that applies the concept of adaptive management to the field of conservation science (adapted from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006) This project uses the SHC framework within the Biological Planning and Conservation Design phases to develop tools to support the delivery of on-the-ground conservation actions for the whooping cranes along the central Texas coast."}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": "The general geographic area for this project was chosen to encompass the central Texas coast between the Colorado River to the north and Corpus Christi Bay to the south, including the current extend of the whooping crane winter range in and around the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (Fig. 2).  This product combines the highest storm surge values for all hypothetical hurricanes of a given storm category within the SLOSH model basin at mean and high tide. For this project, the MOM for a category 5 hurricane striking Matagorda Bay, Texas, at high tide was used. This approach represented a \"worst case scenario\" for storm surge inundation that would affect vegetation assemblages or other factors related to whooping crane habitat, and was determined to be a good proxy for hydrologic impacts related to future sea level rise scenarios. MOM data from a SLOSH model run in 2008 for the Matagorda Bay SLOSH basin were downloaded from the National Weather Service Meteorological Development Laboratory (http://slosh.nws.noaa.gov/sloshPriv/meow.php?L=6, registration required). Following a methodology developed by the NOAA Coastal Services center (NOAA CSC 2012), the MOM vector grid was imported into ArcMap and a \"surge zone\" polygon was developed to identify the spatial extent of dry land projected to be inundated to any extent by the storm surge resulting from a category 5 hurricane striking Matagorda Bay at high tide. All spatial data used in further analysis were clipped to this Study Area polygon ( Fig. 3). "}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": "A matrix was developed to assess potentially useful spatial data for this project (Appendix A). Datasets were grouped into broad types: (1) elevation; (2) vegetation/land cover; (3) land use; (4) species ranges; and (5) models. Attributes examined for each dataset included originator, map projection, horizontal and spatial reference, mapping theme, classification system and method, data type (raster, vector), data format, age of the dataset, spatial resolution, minimum mapping unit, mapping scale, data source, spatial coverage, and intended application. Datasets were evaluated for issues such as poor resolution, inadequate spatial coverage, or outdated data, and other notes were made including possible future changes or improvements to the dataset or recent application of the dataset in other projects. Datasets deemed suitable for this project included those most recently developed, displaying a high degree of spatial and thematic resolution, using classifications based on a commonly used or well-documented standard, and having spatial coverage across the entire study area. The NOAA Benthic Habitat Atlas (BHA), the USFWS National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) Ecological Mapping System of Texas (EMST) were clipped to the general study area and further evaluated for their appropriateness for inclusion into a combined land cover dataset. It was determined that information from these three land cover datasets should be merged to create a single continuous land cover layer across the study area. Each land cover dataset uses different classification schemes with varying levels of descriptive detail. A framework was developed by Smith et al. (2014) to allow for the grouping of land cover types from different datasets at three nested spatial and thematic scales while retaining a high level of descriptive detail for each land cover type. This framework was adapted from Block and Brennan's (1993) nested classification approach for avian habitat selection ( Fig. 1). Following this framework, land cover types from all data sets were grouped hierarchically at the micro, meso-, and macro-scales. In this study, Macrohabitat referred to landscape-scale features such as stages of vegetation succession or broad geoenvironmental zones that are correlated with the distribution and abundance of an avian population within the larger landscape (Block and Brennan 1993). Broad ecological system categories such as upland or estuarine were classified at the Macrohabitat level. Microhabitats as described by Block and Brennan (1993) Block and Brennan (1993) The land cover classification scheme for each source land cover data set was examined in detail to identify attributes within the classification scheme that could be used to identify Meso-, Macro-, and Micro-habitat types. A crosswalk was created to relate each land cover type in the EMST, NWI, and BHA to Macro-, Meso-, and Microhabitat types (Appendix B). New fields \"Macrohabitat\", \"Mesohabitat\", and \"Microhabitat\" were added to each dataset (feature class within an ArcGIS file geodatabase), and a look-up table was generated to classify each land cover feature (polygon) in all feature classes according to the Block and Brennan (1993) hierarchy. A fourth new field \"Source\" was also added to identify the data source of each polygon in the final merged product (EMST, NWI, or BHA). The EMST, NWI, and BHA feature classes were then projected to a common spatial reference (NAD 1983, UTM Zone 14N) and clipped to the general study area. The data sets were clipped to the study area. Portions of each source dataset were combined according to the following rules ( Fig. 5): \uf0b7 Across entire project area: EMST except where more appropriate wetland/intertidal (NWI) data exists o In intertidal estuarine and upland freshwater wetland areas: NWI except where more appropriate benthic/subtidal data exists (BHA) \uf0a7 In mangrove, oyster reef, and seagrass areas Because of the extensive size of the study area (more than 7,000 km 2 or about 1.8 million acres), performing geoprocessing tasks across the entire study area at once was computationally expensive. To reduce the amount of processing time, manageable subsets of the data were processed in succession, as opposed to processing a single \"Godzilla\" dataset at once. A rectangle enclosing the entire study area was drawn and converted to a georeferenced polygon feature, then divided into sixteen polygons of equal area, creating a 4x4 grid, or sixteen \"data zones\" (Fig. 2). The Split Polygon editing tool was used to accomplish this task, as well as to divide the source datasets (EMST, NWI, BHA) into \"zones\" coinciding with each grid cell ( Fig. 6). The ArcGIS Analysis tool \"Update\" was used to combine EMST, NWI, and BHA data in each zone. A Python script automated the process for all zones. \"Update\" created a new feature class with all the polygons of the \"Update\" feature class and all polygons, or parts of polygons, in the \"Base\" feature class that were not covered by Update polygons. Thus, all polygons in the Update feature class were preserved. Base polygons, or parts of polygons, were carried over into the output feature class where Update a b polygons did not exists. This tool was run once for all zones using EMST as the Base layer and NWI as the Update layer and again for the zones where BHA data existed, using the result from the first Update as the Base layer and BHA as the Update layer. The following seven step correction methodology was applied to the feature classes for all updated zones.   6. Eliminate by area (ET Geowizards)--joins polygons with area <100m 2 to neighboring polygons with longest shared boundary. This size was chosen because it represents the minimum mapping unit for the EMST. 7. Dissolve (arcpy)-Joins adjacent polygons with same CHTD code. The fields \"Macrohabitat,\" \"Mesohabitat,\" \"Microhabitat,\" \"CHTD Code,\" and \"Source\" were retained in the combined data set. Each polygon dataset was then converted to raster format with a cell size of 10 m x 10 m-the minimum mapping unit of the EMST dataset. A \"snap raster\" was created with a cell size of 10 m that coincided with the grid created to divide the source datasets in the previous step. The \"Polygon to Raster\" tool was used to convert the 4x4 polygon grid (Fig. 6b) created previously to a raster. This spatial extent of the raster was set to \"round number\" locations in the UTM projection to ensure that each zone consisted of exactly the same number of cells of exactly 10 m on each side, and that cells within each zone matched up with no gaps or spaces between. Because numerical values are easier to work with than text in rasters, an integer field was added to the look-up table containing CHTD code, Microhabitat, Mesohabitat, Macrohabitat, and original data source. Each entry within the look-up table (essentially each alphanumeric CHTD code) was given a unique integer value. The attribute tables of the polygon dataset for each zone were updated with this numeric value before conversion to raster. When converted to raster, the text fields would be lost, but this numeric value would remain. The combined land cover datasets for each grid were then converted to rasters using the Polygon to Raster tool. Cells were given the value of the polygon with the greatest area within that cell. A mosaic dataset was then created to contain the rasters for all 11 zones. Advantages of using a raster mosaic dataset include faster symbolization because overviews and polygons are stored within the mosaic dataset and used to represent the raster at various extents. Additionally, a single attribute table and colormap can be attached to the mosaic dataset and applied to all rasters within the dataset. Geoprocessing toolboxes such as Map Algebra, Spatial Analysis, and Spatial Statistics can be applied to the entire mosaic instead of each constituent raster, and perform faster than they would on a single large raster dataset. Subtidal, and Submerged Vegetation) that occurred in depths greater than .66 m. Pixels identified as existing in \"deep\" water were appended with a \"D\" at the end of their CHTD code and \"Deep\" at the end of their mesohabitat identifier ( Fig. 4). The geodatabase was then gridded to a spatial resolution of 10 m and overlain by EPA ecoregion boundaries, county soils maps, stream centerlines from the USGS National Hydrologic Dataset, a 10 m digital elevation model (DEM), and road and railway data. The EMST land cover classification scheme was based on NatureServe's International Terrestrial Ecological Systems Classification (Comer et al. 2003).The classification structure was hierarchical, and was based on the identification of repeating patterns of physiognomic (structure, growth form, and leaf characters) and floristic (species composition) characteristics of the dominant vegetation (Grossman et al 1998). Land cover types were grouped by physiognomic type, then into systems according to the NatureServe classification, and each land cover type within the system was assigned a \"Vegetation Type\" and a \"Common Name\" descriptor which incorporates a discrete subset of the ecological system and vegetation type (Elliott 2010). This classification resulted in over 150 mapped Vegetation Types describing unique vegetation communities within the context of their underlying soil type, landform, hydrology, and ecoregion (Comer et al 2003). In terms of the Block and Brennan (1993) continuum, Macro-and Mesohabitat types were defined by the broad physiognomic descriptions and the NatureServe ecological systems which each Vegetation Type was grouped into as described in the Texas Ecological Systems Interpretive Guide (Elliott 2010). Microhabitats were defined by either Vegetation Type or Common Name depending on which descriptor included the most detail (Smith et al 2014). The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) was initiated in 1974 by USFWS in cooperation with USGS for the purpose of providing the most current information on the status and extent of wetlands and deep water habitats across the United States and to support research, education, policymaking, and resource management. All NWI data follows the Cowardin wetland classification scheme (Cowardin et al 1979), a hierarchical system that describes wetland types according to general System (e.g. marine, estuarine); Subsystem (e.g. subtidal, intertidal); Class based on substrate, flooding regime, or vegetation; and Dominance Type describing the characteristic vegetation or animal forms present. Additional Modifiers related to water regime, water chemistry, soil type, and human influence may be added at the finest level. Most of the study area was covered by NWI data from two major mapping efforts. Wetlands data for the remainder of the study area was developed using color infrared imagery from 1992 (National Standards and Support Team 2012). Further details regarding the specific methods of wetlands delineation were not available, but the data was determined to meet the NWI Wetlands Mapping Standard accuracy requirements.  1992, 2001, 2006, and 2008 Interpreting the Cowardin (Cowardin et al 1979) classification scheme in terms of the Block and Brennan ( 1993) Table 2. NWI classes organized by microhabitat into 3 palustrine mesohabitats. marshes, and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) were the focus of this mapping effort. Benthic habitat type units were mapped using automated, object-oriented processing using 4-band multispectral NAIP imagery from 2004 and 2007 resampled to 2-m resolution, followed by manual interpretation (Finkbeiner et al. 2009). Benthic habitat data was available as individual shapefiles for all bay systems within the study area except Matagorda Bay. All habitat types mapped in the BHA fell within the Block and Brennan (1993) macrohabitat type Estuarine. Level of detail varied among mapped benthic habitat type and between bays, so benthic habitat types were grouped to a common subclass level. Microhabitat information came directly from the common subclass, while mesohabitat was inferred from general knowledge of the benthic habitat type. For example, oyster reefs were assigned the \"Subclass 2\" attribute \"Bivalve Reef,\" but in various cases modifiers or secondary characteristics describing the specific location were included such as \"Shells and Shell Hash,\" \"Mat Algae,\" and \"Drift Mat Algae\". For simplification, all polygons classified as \"Bivalve Reef\" were assigned the microhabitat \"Bivalve Reef,\" regardless of subsequent subclass or accompanying modifiers, and the mesohabitat \"Estuarine Reef\". Table 3 gives an example of how the nested hierarchical classifications within the SCHEME system fit into the habitat hierarchy.  \nAll methods and data were exactly the same as the previous analysis with two exceptions: 1.) The SLAMM initial condition raster was used instead of the CHTD to provide habitat use information for the Habitat Use Model.  The IPCC climate change A1B family of sea level rise projections was based on a future greenhouse gas emissions scenario including very rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks in mid-century and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies incorporating both fossil-based and alternative energy sources (IPCC 2007). The A1B Mean scenario was the most conservative sea level rise scenario used in the SLAMM. It predicted sea level rising 0.39 m by 2100, the IPCC A1B Maximum scenario predicted 0.69 m of sea level rise by 2100 (IPCC 2007). Sea level rise of 1 m, 1.5 m, and 2 m by 2100 were also modeled. SLAMM raster outputs also included a wetland type raster representing the initial condition or starting point for all model runs. The initial wetland type raster was used for the habitat use analysis in this work. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "A strong emphasis for this project is placed on using the best available data and developing quantifiable, science-based methods and results. To this end, some attention should be paid to the difference between data and information. Data can be defined as \"the result of measurement of some agreed phenomenon,\" while information is \"the result of interpretation, categorization, classification, or some other form of processing\" (Comber et al 2005b). This is an important difference in the case of land cover Combining the best information from each available land cover data set is the only way to include the best information for all environments within the study area. Additionally, because the land cover type descriptions were generalized to Macro-, Meso-, and Microhabitat type, interpretation and analysis of use by whooping cranes or other species can be made using this dataset in an accessible and ecologically meaningful way. Perhaps the best way to minimize potential thematic or spatial inaccuracies within the combined land cover database would have been to create a land cover map using a single classification scheme. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System Classification Scheme (Kutcher et al 2008), is based on a modified Cowardin (1979) classification system, expanded to upland, ice/snow, and \"cultural\" or developed land cover types using elements of the Anderson (1976) \nThe Potential Whooping Crane Habitat map and associated habitat type information can be a valuable tool in the strategic habitat conservation toolkit. Conservation planners could combine this information with information related to land ownership status, parcel size, proximity to currently conserved areas, and habitat use preferences for other species to prioritize the use of conservation resources in areas that will have the most impact to the functioning of an entire ecosystem. Unlike some previous attempts to quantify habitat use and preference for the whooping crane, this analysis takes into account the relative abundance of habitat types in assessing the cranes' preference for them. The habitat use model revealed at least one Preferred Mesohabitat type that could otherwise be overlooked because its relative abundance is low. Estuarine Unvegetated Flats was used by about 7.7% of all whooping cranes observed (Table 4). This may seem insignificant, but this proportion is almost twice as high as would be expected by chance alone (4.5%). This observation is important because in parts of the coast where Estuarine Unvegetated Flats are relatively more abundant, overlooking these habitat types in conservation planning could result in a lost conservation opportunity for the whooping crane. This analysis represents a \"first-cut\" in determining preferred habitat for the whooping crane across the central Texas coast. In subsequent versions, it may be useful to add additional maps describing more sophisticated habitat variables beyond whooping crane presence/absence data and habitat type. Examples of other potentially useful variables include distance to various water features (manmade ponds, estuarine, marine, or freshwater features that may provide valuable food resources), distance to transportation or human activity corridors (highways, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, popular outdoor recreation locations that may deter cranes from using otherwise ideal habitat), proximity to residential or industrial development , or barriers to sight such as steep terrain, dense woodland/shrub, or man-made features like high fences or billboards. Additionally, the territoriality of whooping cranes on their winter grounds is well described (Allen 1952;Stehn and Johnson 1987;Meine and Archibald 1996;Stehn and Prieto 2009) but not included in this analysis. Habitat use is likely strongly influenced by some combination of an individual's territory status (part of a pair or family group with an established territory, versus part of a pair trying to establish a new territory, versus a group of unpaired young adults with no territory), Meso-and Microscale habitat type, and available resources. This use may be highly variable among individuals. As mentioned previously, determining boundaries for the Aransas-Wood Buffalo whooping cranes' winter distribution presented a challenge. Several different techniques for determining the home range of individuals or populations may be appropriate according to the type of location information available and characteristics of the population in question. The whooping crane is a highly mobile avian species whose available winter habitat could theoretically cover the entire Texas Gulf coast or beyond. The choice to define winter distribution as within 2 km of any whooping crane sighting in the study was somewhat arbitrary, as the reported distance whooping cranes may travel to find resources varied from 200 m (Timoney 1999) to 40 km (Stehn 1992). It was decided to use the 2 km buffer because the process was simple to implement and communicate, required no complicated statistical justification, and could be easily repeated in subsequent analyses. The 2 km buffer distance assumed that the dataset represented all whooping cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population on their winter range and captured any \"unusual\" habitat use such as use of upland areas or man-made ponds in times of drought or habitat used while fleeing a threat or traveling between preferred habitat. A standardized delineation of winter home range for the Aransas-Wood Buffalo whooping cranes would be useful to allow for comparisons between studies, but may not Finally, it should be acknowledged that the coastal environment is highly dynamic and will likely become even more so as the effects of climate change and sea level rise become more apparent. To get some idea of the effect sea level rise may have on preferred whooping crane habitat along the central Texas coast, the habitat use model analysis applied in this work was repeated using initial conditions and results of the Sea A habitat use model was developed for the whooping crane using the SLAMM initial condition raster and six seasons of whooping crane aerial surveys following the procedure described previously. Once habitat preference was determined, Potential Whooping Crane Habitat maps were developed for five different sea level rise scenarios to explore possible impacts of sea level rise on potential whooping crane habitat. Preferred Whooping Crane Habitat maps were produced for all scenarios under current and future conditions projected for the years 2025, 2050, and 2100.\nAll sea level rise scenarios show a net loss of potential Preferred whooping crane habitat by 2100 except the 2 m scenario. The increase in Preferred habitat in the 2 m sea level rise scenario may be partially attributed to an overtopping of the topographic ridge that exists along the eastern edges of the major peninsulas within the study area. This ridge, known as the Ingleside Barrier Strandplain, may prevent marsh migration inland across the coastal plain. As this ridge is overtopped, marsh migration is unimpeded across upland environments at higher elevations. This is only one reason why conservation of habitat should extend beyond habitat identified as potential Preferred habitat under current conditions. Marsh migration can also be impeded by built structures such as roads, culverts, and buildings. If development can be concentrated on upland areas least likely to be impacted by sea level rise, potential whooping crane habitat and human economic investment can be protected. In terms of Strategic Habitat Conservation, it may be beneficial to focus conservation efforts in two places: Preferred habitat that is likely to remain Preferred habitat and adjacent habitat that is not currently considered Preferred but may become so in the future. Identifying these areas is simply done by comparing the initial and final habitat rasters for any scenario. One of the goals of this project was to determine whether enough habitat existed along the central Texas coast to support 1,000 whooping cranes in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population, or at least 250 breeding pairs. A commonly used estimate for the amount of habitat needed by whooping cranes is about 200 ha per pair (Smith et al 2014). Even under the 2 m sea level rise scenario where Preferred habitat increases by more than 31%, less than half the area needed to support the down-listing goal population size exists within the study area of the SLAMM on and around the Aransas National Wildlife"}, {"section_title": "Winter distribution", "text": "Because the study area was much larger than the area actually utilized by the whooping cranes, it was necessary to constrain the spatial extent of habitat considered \"available.\" A variety of techniques exist for the determination of home ranges for species or populations. Common techniques include developing minimum convex polygons (MCP) or other geometric shapes from known locations of individuals (Schoener 1981, Southwood andHenderson 2009), delineating utilization distributions (UD) encompassing 50% or 95% of the space used by an animal or group of animals (Calhoun and Casby 1958, Jenrich and Turner 1969, Ford and Krumme 1979, and creating weighted distribution and density rasters for individuals or groups using bivariate kernel density estimators (KDE) (Anderson 1982, Worton 1987. The use of UD or KDE was rejected because both of these techniques require the ability to differentiate individuals' movements across the landscape and over time either through remote sensing technologies such as radio telemetry or highly detailed sets of in-situ observations. In most cases, the whooping crane dataset did not distinguish between observed individuals over time. Instead, a simple distribution polygon was constructed by buffering each whooping crane observation by 2 km, then merging all overlapping buffers to obtain a single polygon feature class that encompassed all whooping crane observations from season 2004-2005 to 2010-2011. This was considered to be the extent of whooping cranes' winter distribution. The CHTD was clipped by this polygon to obtain the area of available habitat. CHTD Mesohabitat values were also extracted to the whooping crane observation points to obtain the proportionate use of each mesohabitat (Fig. 11).\nThe AWB whooping crane winter distribution from 2004-05 to 2010-11 encompassed 105,813 ha and 27 Mesohabitat types (Fig. 14). The most common mesohabitat types were Estuarine Open Water Deep (22 % of winter distribution), Estuarine Vegetated Marsh (14.5%), and Upland grassland (13.5%). Least common were Upland Unvegetated and Upland Vegetated Woodland/Scrub (both <0.01 %, Table 4).  Whooping cranes exhibit habitat preference within their winter distribution. Expected use was compared to confidence intervals constructed for the observed proportion of use for each Mesohabitat within the winter distribution. To determine which Mesohabitat types contributed to the significance in the X^2 test, a 95% confidence level family of intervals was constructed for the observed use of the 26 Mesohabitat types within the whooping crane winter distribution with observed or expected use >0. If the observed use confidence interval was greater than the expected use of a Mesohabitat type, then that habitat type was Preferred. If the calculated expected use was within the confidence interval for observed use, then the Mesohabitat type was used as expected, or considered Neutral habitat. If the observed use confidence interval was less than the expected use, the Mesohabitat type was Avoided. All values were normalized to zero and plotted for ease of comparison (Fig. 15). Mesohabitat types within the whooping cranes' winter distribution were determined to be Avoided habitat types including Estuarine Reef, Palustrine Vegetated Shrub, and Upland Developed (Fig. 15).\nThe same winter distribution polygon was used as in the previous analysis. The SLAMM initial condition raster was clipped by the winter distribution polygon to obtain the area of available habitat. SLAMM land cover values were extracted to the whooping crane observation points to obtain the proportionate use of each mesohabitat (Fig. 18). The Pearson's chi-squared test ( 2 ) was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the frequency of use of land cover types by the whooping cranes than would be expected if whooping cranes used each land cover type in exact proportion to its availability (Neu et al 1974). The null hypothesis for this test was that there was no difference between expected and observed frequency of use of land cover types by whooping cranes. In other words; the distribution of whooping cranes among each land cover type was the same as the distribution of each land cover type across the landscape. To identify land cover types that were Preferred, Avoided, or Neutral, the use of each land cover type was compared to its expected use for that land cover type. As with the habitat use model using the CHTD, the expected frequency of use for each land cover type was compared with 95% confidence intervals constructed for the observed frequency of use for each land cover type. Use intervals were constructed using the Wilson score confidence interval method. The P-value (\u03b1) for each interval was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction for simultaneous comparisons as recommended by Neu et al ( 1974). All values were normalized by the observed use ratio for each mesohabitat. If the interval for observed use in a particular land cover type was greater than expected value, the land cover type was used preferentially. If the observed use interval was less than the expected value, the land cover type was avoided. Land cover types with expected use ratios that fell within the observed use ratios confidence interval were considered Neutral land cover (Fig. 12).\nWhen the winter distribution polygon developed in the previous section was combined with the SLAMM initial raster with portions of the raster >500 m from shoreline removed, the resulting winter distribution encompassed 80,883 ha and16 land cover types. Fig. 19 The Aransas-Wood Buffalo whooping crane population's winter distribution was determined by creating a 2 km buffer around all whooping crane sightings from wintering seasons 2004-05 to 1010-11 The most common land cover types within the winter distribution were Undeveloped Dry Land (33% of winter distribution), Estuarine Water (31%), and Regularly Flooded Marsh (10.1%). Least common were Tidal Fresh Marsh and Transitional Salt Marsh (both <0.01 %). Highest use land cover types were Regularly Flooded Marsh (43.3% of all cranes observed) and Estuarine Water (30.5%). The Pearson's chi-squared test ( 2 ) rejected the null hypothesis that there was no difference between expected and observed frequency of use of land cover types by whooping cranes. The distribution of whooping cranes among each land cover type differed significantly from what would be expected if whooping cranes used land cover randomly across the landscape ( 2 =19,419.9, df=11, p <..001). Whooping cranes exhibit habitat preference within their winter distribution. Expected use was compared to confidence intervals constructed for the observed proportion of use for each Mesohabitat within the winter distribution. To determine which Mesohabitat types contributed to the significance in the X 2 test, a 95% confidence level family of intervals was constructed for the observed use of the 16 land cover types within the whooping crane winter distribution. All values were normalized to zero and plotted for ease of comparison (Fig. 15). Estuarine Beach, Tidal Flat, and Regularly Flooded Marsh were determined to be Preferred habitat. Six land cover types were used as expected (Neutral habitat types) including Estuarine Water, Irregularly Flooded Marsh, Inland Shore, Tidal Fresh Marsh, Transitional Salt Marsh, and Mangrove. The remaining 7 land cover types within the whooping cranes' winter distribution were determined to be Avoided habitat types including Developed Dry Land, Open Beach, Inland Open Water, and others ( Fig. 15). Potential whooping crane habitat map The SLAMM initial condition raster was reclassified to reflect the habitat preferences determined by the habitat use model. A new attribute \"Preference\" was added to the raster attribute table and a value of \"Preferred,\" Neutral,\" or \"Avoided\" was given to corresponding land cover types. A value of \"Not Ranked\" was applied to the 3 land cover types with no expected or observed use in the habitat use model. \"Not Ranked\" habitat types are not necessarily avoided by whooping cranes; they merely did not fall within the whooping cranes' winter distribution. It could be inferred that because these habitat types are outside the whooping cranes' winter distribution they are not preferred (or \"Avoided\"), but caution should be taken when making such assumptions. Factors such as the cranes' tendency to use habitat and establish territories adjacent to those already in use could prevent cranes for using otherwise potential Preferred habitat (Allen 1952;Stehn and Johnson 1987;Stehn and Prieto 2009). There is not enough information about these habitat types to determine preference The raster was then symbolized and summarized according to preference. Across the entire study area (222,539 ha), 18,419 ha of potential preferred habitat was identified (8% of total area). 53,918 ha of neutral habitat (25% of total area) was also identified. Preferred habitat followed a pattern of fringing bay margins along the mainland and back sides of barrier islands and low lying river deltas similar to the Potential Whooping Crane Habitat map developed from the CHTD (Fig. 21). Though Estuarine Water was determined to be Neutral habitat in the habitat use model, it was depicted in blue for all habitat maps to better visualize sea level rise inundation. Estuarine Water is included with Neutral Habitat for all area calculations.

The Pearson's chi-squared test ( 2 ) was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the frequency of use of habitat types by the whooping cranes than would be expected if whooping cranes used each habitat type in exact proportion to its availability (Neu et al 1974). The null hypothesis for this test is that there is no difference between expected and observed frequency of use of habitat types by whooping cranes. In other words; the distribution of whooping cranes among each Mesohabitat type is the same as the distribution of each Mesohabitat type across the landscape. Once it was determined that whooping cranes use available habitat in a different proportion than would be expected through random use of available habitat, the use of each habitat type was compared to its expected use to understand which habitat types contributed to the overall significant difference in habitat use. To achieve this, the expected frequency of use for each habitat was compared with 95% confidence intervals constructed for the observed frequency of use for each habitat type. Use intervals were constructed using the Wilson score confidence interval method. The Wilson method was selected over the more commonly used Wald large sample normal test (i.e. asymptotic normal intervals) because it performs better when the proportions are much less than .5, as in this case (Agresti andCoull 1998, Wallis 2013). Additionally, the P-value (\u03b1) for each interval was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction for simultaneous comparisons as recommended by Neu et al ( 1974). This correction adjusts the required confidence level for each of a family of simultaneous statistical tests to reduce the chances of obtaining a type I error (false positive) over multiple comparisons (Gotelli and Ellison 2004). For a desired overall confidence level (1-\u03b1) with number of individual confidence intervals, each individual interval is calculated to the (1-\u03b1/k) confidence level. For example, for 5 habitat types and an overall 95% confidence level (\u03b1=.05) for the family of comparisons being made, the confidence interval for observed proportion of use of each habitat is calculated at the 99% confidence level (1-.05/5=.01). The observed use ratio for each mesohabitat was subtracted from the expected use ratio and the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval for each Mesohabitat, resulting in values normalized by the observed use ratio for each Mesohabitat. This enabled the expected values and observed use intervals for all Mesohabitats to be plotted on the same axes for comparison. If the interval for observed use in a particular habitat type was greater than expected value, the habitat type was used preferentially (Fig. 12). Additionally, since the values were all relative to observed use, expected use for preferred habitat was always negative. If the observed use interval was less than the expected value, the habitat type was avoided, and the expected value was always positive. Habitat types where expected use was within the observed use interval were considered neutral habitat. These expected values could be negative or positive. Habitat types were then ranked according to preference and assigned a numerical index according to whether the habitat was shown to be Preferred, used as expected (Neutral), or Avoided. Fig. 12 The habitat use model compared expected and observed use for each Mesohabitat type. Habitat types whose use was greater than expected were considered Preferred habitat. Habitat types used less than expected were considered Avoided habitat."}, {"section_title": "Potential whooping crane habitat map", "text": "The CHTD was then re-symbolized according to habitat preference and a Potential Whooping Crane Habitat map was produced showing Preferred and Neutral whooping crane habitat across the study area.

Time steps 2025, 2050, 2075, and 2100 were all mapped. Under this scenario, potential Preferred habitat for whooping cranes decreased by 31.7% to 12,590 ha by 2100 (Table 9Error! Reference source not found.) as almost 6,000 ha of Preferred habitat consisting of low lying marsh and flats were converted to Estuarine Water (Table 10) Neutral habitat (including Estuarine Water) increased by 18.2 % or slightly less than 10,000 ha by 2100. In addition to the conversion of Preferred habitat to Estuarine Water, about 3,000 ha of Undeveloped Dry Land (Avoided habitat) was converted to Transitional Salt Marsh. Under this scenario, potential Preferred habitat for whooping cranes decreased by 41.7% to 10,730 ha by 2100 (Table 11). As in the A1B Mean scenario, a large portion of Preferred habitat was converted to Estuarine Water (about 8,000 ha, Table 12). In this scenario, about 2,000 ha was also converted to Estuarine Water. The area of Neutral habitat increased by about 25%, with an addition of about 6,000 ha of Estuarine water and 4,500 ha of Inland Shore.  (Fig 24), potential Preferred habitat for whooping cranes decreased by 33.4% to 12,253 ha by 2100 (Table 13). As expected, a large portion of Preferred habitat was converted to Estuarine Water (almost 8,000 ha, Table 14). In this scenario, about 10,000 ha of Undeveloped Dry Land was also converted to Estuarine Water. The area of Neutral habitat increased by about 32%, with an increase of about 18,000 ha of Estuarine water and 7,500 ha of Transitional Salt Marsh.  Under the 1.5 m sea level rise scenario (Fig 25), potential Preferred habitat for whooping cranes decreased by only about 4.6% by 2100 (Table 15). Neutral habitat increased by more than half, with an addition of about 21,000 ha of Estuarine Water, coming primarily from the conversion of Inland Fresh Marsh and Undeveloped Dry Land (Avoided habitat), as well as about 2,000 ha of Regularly Flooded Marsh (Preferred, Table 16). Though there was a relatively small net loss of Preferred habitat by 2100, 6,000 ha of Regularly Flooded Marsh was lost by 2075. Almost 4,000 ha were regained in the next time step, as well as over 6,000 ha of Tidal Flat.  (Fig 26), potential Preferred habitat actually increased by about 31.5% by 2100 (Table 17). This occurred in the last time step, as Inland Fresh Marsh and Undeveloped Dry Land (Avoided) were converted to Regularly Flooded Marsh and Tidal Flat (Table 18). Following a similar patterns as the 1.5 m sea level rise scenario, this increase in Preferred habitat followed loss of more than 4,000 ha Preferred habitat by 2075. Other notable changes include an increase of over 20,000 ha of Inland Shore (Neutral). "}, {"section_title": "Refuge.", "text": "Sea level rise should be modeled along the entire Texas coast. This would improve our ability to more completely understand potential effects of sea level rise on whooping crane recovery and many other issues related to coastal conservation and management. Another useful addition to this analysis would be to examine the current and future state of freshwater inflows to the estuarine system. Whooping cranes rely on the contribution of freshwater to sustain much of their food and drinking water needs. Municipal, agricultural, and industrial retention of upstream freshwater supplies as well as decreased precipitation could impact the salinity of coastal wetlands that may alter habitat preference independent of sea level rise. As in the previous section, this analysis represents a \"first-cut\" in understanding changes to preferred habitat for the whooping crane across the central Texas coast. In keeping with the Strategic Habitat Conservation goal of revising models b y targeting research at key model assumptions, some future recommendations are offered. In subsequent versions, it may be useful to add additional rasters to the GIS analysis describing more sophisticated habitat variables beyond whooping crane presence/absence data and habitat type. Examples of other potentially useful variables include distance to various water features, distance to transportation or development, or barriers to sight. Habitat quality variables such as estuarine salinity, abundance of food items, or potential climate related changes to vegetation type and structure could also be incorporated. Ecological variables such as patch size and corridors, as well as territory size, location, and establishment patterns may also be helpful. This work represents a substantial advance in understanding potential changes to the quantity and distribution of potential whooping crane habitat along the central Texas coast due to sea level rise. Future work includes a more sophisticated habitat use analysis taking into consideration other geoenvironmental variables, the territorial behavior of the whooping crane, and potential impacts of climate change.
