The goal of this study is to understand the morphometric substrate of ASYMAD subjects compared with mild cognitive impairment and definite AD cases. We used designed-based stereology to measure the volumes of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in 4 cerebral regions: anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, primary visual cortex, and CA1 of hippocampus. We examined and compared autopsy brains from 4 groups (n = 15 each) of participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging: ASYMAD, mild cognitive impairment, AD, and age-matched controls. We found significant hypertrophy of the neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli of CA1 of hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus neurons in ASYMAD subjects compared with control and mild cognitive impairment cases. In the posterior cingulate gyrus and primary visual cortex, the hypertrophy was limited to the nuclei and nucleoli. The hypertrophy of cortical neurons and their nuclei and nucleoli in ASYMAD may represent an early reaction to the presence of neurotoxic AA or tau, or a compensatory mechanism that prevents the progression of the disease into dementia."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) are A-amyloid deposits, neuritic plaques (AA plaques), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuropil threads, and the degeneration of vulnerable neurons and their synapses (1Y7). These pathologic changes accumulate gradually over decades before becoming clinically evident. Thus, it is not uncommon to find substantial numbers of AA plaques and NFTs in the autopsy brains of older subjects with normal cognition documented shortly before death (8Y13). These observations have suggested 2 explanations: 1) that AD has a Bsilent phase[ preceding by years or decades the appearance of any cognitive impairment until the functional threshold for effective neuronal functioning is overwhelmed by the AD pathology (14) ; or, alternatively, 2) the Bcognitive reserve hypothesis[, which postulates that some individuals have brains that are able to compensate for or resist the neuronal and synaptic derangements of AD (15Y17). In the present study, we defined asymptomatic AD (ASYMAD) as the status of subjects with preserved cognition assessed less than a year before death but with identifiable AD pathology at autopsy, that is, a Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer_s Disease (CERAD) neuritic plaque score of A or higher (18) and a Braak NFT score of III or higher (19) . Subjects with similar status have been described in the past as Bpreclinical[ AD stage (20) or Bhigh pathology control[ state (21) . We prefer the term ASYMAD because we do not know a priori whether these subjects would have remained cognitively intact or eventually would have progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia if they had lived longer.\nIn a previous study (22) , we showed that ASYMAD is characterized by nuclear hypertrophy of the CA1 of hippocampus (CA1) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) neurons compared with age-matched controls, and that the nuclear hypertrophy of neurons was not present in the brains of patients with MCI or definite AD. In the present study, one goal was to determine whether the hypertrophy of neuronal nuclei is limited to the ACG and hippocampus or is also present in other regions by studying a larger sample of brains. We tested the hypothesis that the nuclear hypertrophy of cortical neurons has a hierarchic distribution consistent with the morphologic progression of AD, that is, as demonstrated by neuropathologic (18) and neuroimaging studies (23Y28), there is early involvement of anterior cingulate and late involvement of occipital cortex in AD. A second goal was to examine whether the neuronal changes in ASYMAD are limited to the nucleus or involve other neuronal compartments such as the cell body and nucleolus. Therefore, we extended our analysis to the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and the primary visual cortex (PVC) of age-matched controls, ASYMAD, MCI, and definite AD subjects. Specifically, we examined the ACG (Brodmann Area 24), the PCG (Brodmann Area 23), the PVC (Brodmann Area 17), and the CA1. In each of these regions, we used designed-based stereology to measure the mean volumes of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli throughout the entire thickness of the cortical mantle. Our measurements did not address changes in specific cortical layers or cytoarchitectonic subregions such as those described in the cingulate cortex (29, 30) ."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and Autopsy Program", "text": "The subjects examined in this study were all participants in the autopsy program of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (31) .

The evaluation included a neuropsychological battery (32) , neurologic examination, medication review, and informant-/subject-structured interview.

Neurons were measured irrespective of their shape and cortical layer localization, that is, the entire cortical thickness, including all cortical layers and all types of neurons (pyramidal and nonpyramidal), was sampled.

These intervals are short and are similar for the last 3 groups and allow rigorous clinicopathologic correlations. The statistical analysis of the CERAD and Braak NFT scores using the Fisher test shows that the ASYMAD group is not significantly different from the AD group in CERAD neuritic plaque classification, whereas it is different in the Braak NFT staging. In contrast, the ASYMAD group is significantly different from the AD group for the Braak stages but shows the same scores distribution as the MCI group. Notably, the ASYMAD group, although comparable to MCI on Braak NFT staging, shows a more severe neuritic plaque score. Thus, it seems that the severity of AD lesions in ASYMAD is comparable to or even more severe than in MCI.\nAD, Alzheimer disease; ASYMAD, asymptomatic AD; CERAD, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer_s Disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; NFT, neurofibrillary tangle; NP, neuritic plaque.

The NFT scores, however, were similar in ASYMAD and MCI. Based on these scores, the levels of AD neuropathology in ASYMAD seem comparable to those in MCI. Table 4 displays the percentage variations of the volumes for the cell body, nucleus, and nucleolus in ASYMAD, MCI, and AD groups compared with controls. In general, in the ASYMAD group, there was a significant increase in the volume of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli of the anterior regions (CA1 and ACG) compared with controls (p G 0.0001 for cell bodies in CA1 and ACG; p G 0.0001 for nuclei in CA1 and ACG; p G 0.0001 for nucleoli in CA1 and ACG). In the MCI group, expanded volumes relative to controls were present only in the posterior regions (PCG and PVC). Accordingly, in ASYMAD, we observed a significant increase in the volumes of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in ACG and CA1 compared both with control and MCI groups. In more posterior regions (i.e. PCG and PVC), significant increases in volume were present only in the nuclei (p G 0.01 for PCG; p G 0.01 for PVC) and nucleoli (p G 0.001 for PCG; p G 0.01 for PVC) of ASYMAD compared with controls but were absent in the cell bodies.

In the present study, we focus on morphometric differences between ASYMAD and MCI. Our observations demonstrate striking differences in neuronal volumes in ASYMAD and MCI. These findings occur in different brain regions at different stages, however, in a manner that is consistent with the progression of AD lesions throughout the cerebral cortex (18, 19) . In this context, it is important to emphasize that, although the ASYMAD and MCI groups diverge in cognitive performance, their pathologic changes of AD are similar with respect to neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (Table 1) . Moreover, these 2 groups are comparable in age, and the time lapse between the last clinical evaluation and death was less than 8 months in both groups."}, {"section_title": "Group Differences in Cell Body Volume", "text": "Our data confirm that in ASYMAD, there is hypertrophy of the nuclei in neurons of the ACG and CA1 compared with age-matched controls and MCI cases (22) . The most remarkable observation in differences in cell body volumes was the marked hypertrophy of the neuronal somata in ASYMAD compared both with MCI and controls. This finding may reflect the neuronal adaptations that allow subjects with ASYMAD to maintain normal cerebral function despite comparable numbers of AD lesions as in MCI cases. In ASYMAD, there are larger volumes of the neuronal somata both in ACG and CA1 but not in PCG or PVC. In contrast, a significant enlargement of the neuronal soma was only detected in PVC in MCI brains.\nOne possible interpretation of an increase in the mean volume of cell bodies in ACG and CA1 neurons in ASYMAD is that there is a selective loss of small neurons. However, because we know that the number of neurons in these subjects is stable at least in CA1 (51), true neuronal hypertrophy seems more likely. A caveat in the interpretation of the regional differences in neuronal hypertrophy, however, is the baseline size of neurons. To address this issue, we measured and compared the cell bodies of neurons in the 4 regions examined in controls. The mean volumes of neurons in ACG and PCG were not significantly different. Therefore, the presence of neuronal hypertrophy found in ACG, but not in PCG, cannot be attributed to differences in baseline neuronal size, and a more likely explanation is that differences in neuronal size reflect the regional progression of the pathologic processes of AD. We also observed a significant atrophy of the neuronal cell bodies in CA1 in AD but not in any of the other regions.\nThe lack of atrophy in 3 of the regions examined is surprising, but it may be attributable to the relatively early stage of AD cases in our sample, that is, the mean period between diagnosis of dementia and death was 3 years. Notably, although most AD cases had Braak NFT scores between IV and VI, the brain weights were not significantly different compared with controls. Our observations are consistent with a previous stereological study that found no significant difference between the sizes of the neuronal perikaryon in the neocortex of AD cases compared with controls (50)."}, {"section_title": "Group Differences in Nuclear Volume", "text": "Our results indicate that in ASYMAD, the hypertrophy of neuronal nuclei is not limited to CA1 and ACG, as we reported previously (22) , but is also present in more posterior cortical regions (i.e. the PCG and PVC). In contrast, in MCI, there is significant nuclear hypertrophy only of the PCG and PVC but not in the ACG or CA1. Notably, in ASYMAD, the neuronal nuclei are significantly larger not only compared with controls but also to MCI. Different patterns in MCI and ASYMAD are remarkable because both groups have comparable AD pathologic changes. Thus, it seems that in ASYMAD, the nuclear enlargement is somehow related to the preservation of cognitive function despite the presence of AA plaques and neurofibrillary changes. Moreover, the difference in the regional expression of nuclear hypertrophy among ASYMAD, MCI, and controls is consistent with the notion that the pathologic changes of AD occur earlier in the ACG and CA1 than in the more posterior cortical regions (18) ."}, {"section_title": "Group Differences in Nucleolar Volume", "text": "Although larger in magnitude, the differences in the volume of nucleoli parallel those of the nuclei and cell bodies. In ASYMAD, the nucleoli were significantly larger in ACG and CA1 but not in the posterior cortical regions. In MCI, a different pattern was observed, with nucleolar hypertrophy limited to PCG and PVC. The only instance of nucleolar atrophy was in cases of AD, in which there was significant atrophy of all neuronal compartments in CA1 but not in other regions."}, {"section_title": "Relations Among the Volumes in Neuronal Compartments", "text": "Consistent with a previous study of nuclear size in cortical neurons in AD (50), we observed a general concordance among the group differences in volumes of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli. In ASYMAD and MCI, we identified expansion of these volumes, whereas in AD, we observed the opposite in the hippocampus. Changes in the 3 compartments, however, may not occur at the same time. For example, the hypertrophy of nuclei and nucleoli seems to precede the enlargement of the cell bodies. This is illustrated in the PCG and PVC in ASYMAD, in which we detected hypertrophy of neuronal nuclei and nucleoli in the absence of differences in cell body size. There is growing evidence in the literature that in neurons, there is a positive linear correlation among the size of the nucleolus, nucleus, and cell body (52) . Furthermore, the nucleolar volume appears as a sensitive indicator of the transcriptional and metabolic activities (53, 54) . Because we found a strong positive linear correlation among the volumes of the 3 neuronal compartments (Figs. 4B, C) , our analyses are consistent with these notions. In particular, nucleoli had the highest percent differences in volumes. Because the nucleolus is a key organelle for the synthesis, assembly, and production of ribosomes (55) , the nucleolar hypertrophy may reflect enhanced transcriptional and biosynthetic activities. Therefore, our observations of enlarged neuronal nucleoli, nuclei, and cell bodies in ASYMAD suggest that neurons in these subjects might have been able to enhance their metabolism and delay the pathologic effects of AD. The exact nature of this adaptation and its resilience over time is uncertain. In terms of the relation among specific AD lesions and changes in neuronal morphometry, the hypertrophy of nuclei and nucleoli in PVC cortex neurons occurs at a time when AA deposition and neurofibrillary/tau changes in that region are minimal or nonexistent. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the exposure of these neurons to AD changes not directly by their perikarya in the PVC but by their projections in other cortical regions where AA and tau changes are already severe. The enlargement of the neuronal nucleolus, nucleus, and cell body in ASYMAD can be interpreted as the morphologic counterpart of cellular mechanisms that prevent the development of cognitive decline in some individuals despite the neurotoxic effects of AD lesions."}, {"section_title": "Neurobiologic Perspectives", "text": "The neurobiologic mechanisms underlying the observed hypertrophy of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in ASYMAD are unclear and are beyond the scope of this study. We can, nevertheless, formulate some possible explanations drawing from previous studies in experimental animals and humans. Studies in animal models have shown that the cell body sizes of neurons and their nuclei and nucleoli are plastic and can be influenced by exposure to sexual hormones (56, 57) , chemotherapeutic drugs (58) , and regeneration after axonotomy (59) or brain trauma (60) , as well as by learning and enriched environmental experiences (61) . Based on these observations, we postulate that in ASYMAD and MCI, the enlargement of nuclei and nucleoli is the expression of enhanced DNA and RNA synthesis necessary to sustain the repair of injured neurons and their processes and synapses. This latter notion is further supported by a recent study showing that in the frontal cortex of patients with MCI, there is a paradoxical upregulation of presynaptic boutons (62) . To sustain such synaptic upregulation, neurons may have to enhance their overall metabolism and expand the various compartments. Once neurons cannot sustain synaptic remodeling or upregulation, functional and clinical deficits may then emerge. A second possibility is that in ASYMAD, some neurons and circuits are damaged by the AD pathology, and alternative circuits become operative (63Y67). The development of these new circuits would also require additional biosynthetic activities. In this way, the circuitry of the cerebral cortex may remain functional despite the presence of AD lesions. Another alternative explanation for the enlarged neuronal compartments in ASYMAD is that these changes are a reaction to the neurotoxic effects of intracellular or extracellular AA-amyloid (68), or hyperphosphorylated-tau protein (69) . A final, although less likely, explanation for the observed morphometric findings can be that neurons are reentering the cell cycle, a phenomenon that has been proposed in AD (70, 71) ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We have shown that in ASYMAD, cortical and hippocampal neurons undergo significant hypertrophy of their cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli. Furthermore, these hypertrophic changes have a topographic gradient that follows the accepted progression of pathologic changes of AD throughout portions of the cerebral cortex. Hypertrophy of neurons in ASYMAD may represent a reaction to AA or tau long before the onset of cognitive decline or may constitute a surrogate for the activation of cellular processes in an attempt to forestall the progression of AD. Future understanding of the changes in gene or protein expression underlying the neuronal hypertrophy in ASYMAD may provide valuable clues to the pathogenesis and eventual therapy of AD."}]
