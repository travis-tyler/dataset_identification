Methods: Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging underwent cervical and ocular VEMP testing. VEMP latency, amplitude, asymmetry ratios, and prevalence of absent responses were compared across demographic and cardiovascular risk groups. Results: In 257 participants (mean age 72.9, 57% female), ocular VEMP (oVEMP) n10 latency increased by 0.12 ms/decade while amplitude decreased by 2.9 lV/decade. Black participants had better oVEMP function (shorter latency, increased amplitude, and decreased odds of absent responses) relative to white participants. In 250 participants (mean age 72.6, 54% female), EMG-corrected cervical VEMP (cVEMP) amplitude decreased by 0.14 lV/decade and p13 latency was 0.38 ms longer in males. The odds of absent responses were significantly higher in individuals age P80 for oVEMPs, and age P70 for cVEMPs. Cardiovascular risk factors had no association with VEMP parameters. Conclusions: We confirmed age-related declines in otolith function, and observed a protective effect of black race on oVEMP latency and amplitude. Significance: These results illustrate how measures of otolith function change with age in communitydwelling adults. Further investigations are needed to ascertain whether better otolith function in blacks might contribute to a lower risk of mobility disability and falls."}, {"section_title": "h i g h l i g h t s", "text": "Black race was associated with better oVEMP function (shorter n10 latency and greater peak-to-peak amplitude) across the age range.

Epidemiologic analyses of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found a 35% prevalence of vestibular impairment in over 5000 US adults age P40, and the prevalence was found to increase steeply with age (Agrawal et al., 2009) . Additionally, odds of vestibular impairment were 70% higher in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Vestibular impairment in NHANES was defined as the inability to maintain balance on a foam-padded surface with eyes closed for 30 s (Agrawal et al., 2009) . Although this study provides strong epidemiologic support for a loss of vestibular function associated with aging, the postural tests used in NHANES are limited in the specificity with which they measure vestibular function, given that "}]
