[{"section_title": "List of Figures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "List of Table", "text": "Chapter 1: Introduction Alaska, often referred to as \"The Last Frontier\", is a vast geographically diverse landscape covering 665,384 square miles (US Census Bureau 2010). With a population of about 741,000 (2016) the average population density comes out to just 1.1 person per square mile (Parker 2018). Although many popular reality shows tend to exaggerate and dramatize life in Alaska, they do point to an important fact: when an emergency occurs or someone experiences serious health complications, immediate access to sufficient medical services may not be available. Much of the state's population faces barriers to accessing needed medical care due to large distances between communities, diverse landscapes, and limited road networks. Human right to health not only benefits the individual but also communities at large and relies on individuals having adequate access to medical services. This right to health is set out in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (CESCR), stating that participants agree to \"recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\" (United Nations 1976,4). This mandate also tasks participants to insure \"The creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness\" (United Nations 1976,4). This directive poses challenges in Alaska where connectivity and availability of resources are limited and concentrated in larger communities across the state. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" (World Health Organization 2014,1). By these standards, health is not just about the condition of the mind and body, but since humans are social creatures this also includes the health of those around them. In rural, geographically isolated areas, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) contributes to overall health by providing reliable transport to outside communities where advanced medical services can be accessed if needed. Due to Alaska's rural status \u0336 characterized by its low population density, diverse landscape, and lack of an extensive connected road system \u0336 health care access should be perceived as adequate, and comparative to other communities, by all parties involved in providing and receiving services. Due to the complexity of managing a health network over a large and remote area, such as Alaska, standard health network structures struggle to accommodate existing geographic, social, and infrastructural variability. What may work in urban communities such as Anchorage or Juneau may not be applicable to rural communities such as Savoonga, Nakiski, Adak, or Hyder. Therefore, understanding the regional variability of health care services and accessibility to those services is vital in maintaining and improving a health care system that ensures the health of all residents. This thesis explores factors affecting access to local medical services and emergency air transportation in the region of Southeast Alaska. A combination of interviews with local health care providers, medevac personnel, field observations, and other qualitative data sources sets out to answer the following questions: 1) How does access to health care services vary between rural communities and the regional center in While this thesis focuses on one region, its framework and methodologies could be applied to other regions throughout the state. The results of such a study could provide valuable information regarding access to medical services in Alaska's diverse economic, cultural, and geographic landscapes. Chapter 2: Southeast Alaska Chapter 2: Southeast Alaska, will cover a series of brief overviews discussing various characteristics of the region on which this research focuses. The characteristics discussed include: Physical landscape; the wide array of marine and terrestrial flora and fauna; regional transportation networks; economy; and population, demographics, and culture. Understanding the makeup and current infrastructure of the Southeast region is vital when studying access to health care services. Southeast Alaska, the focus of this thesis, is also known by its nickname the \"Panhandle\". This temperate rainforest region consists of 33,500 square miles of towering mountains cleaved by glaciated valleys, winding rivers, glacial ice fields, and island networks, sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean and British Columbia, Canada  Most of the communities in the region are located either on islands or coastal shoreline. Only two towns, Skagway and Haines, are connected to highways that intersect the Alaskan Hwy, which connects Alaska via Canada with the lower 48. Since most of the communities are not connected by road, residents must travel and move goods by air or marine transport. Living in a large island and coastal region, transportation is an important aspect of life in Southeast Alaska. There are a few different types of transportation upon which residents rely for living and working in the region. For the larger communities, regular jet service is provided by Alaska Airlines. Otherwise transportation is reliant on small plane service and the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system. The ferry system is important because for many rural communities it is the most economical way to transport supplies, resources, and vehicles (Image 1 Appendix). However, increasing cuts to the ferry system budget has had heavy impacts on the frequency of service to these communities. The ferry system also plays an important role in transporting passengers between communities for work, to visit family, and access services such as grocery and hardware stores and medical services. For example, traveling or part-time medical providers utilize ferry service to travel between medical clinics in various communities. Regional air and marine transport also provide opportunities for economic stimulus. Particularly during the summer months, independent travelers utilize the ferry system and bush plane services to access Glacier National Park and the multitude of hunting and fishing lodges in the region. In Southeast, transportation plays a vital role in transporting people, supplies, resources, and sources of economic stimulus to hard-to-reach places. The mixed economy of Southeast Alaska includes government, commercial fishing, resource extraction, tourism, and services. The three major classes of workers in the workforce being private (57.1%), government (33.3%), and self-employed (9.2%) (U.S Census Bureau 2017). These numbers are supported by a recent report which states that the top three employers for the region are government, tourism, and commercial fishing (Rain Coast Data 2018). Of these three sectors, although not the largest, tourism is the fastest growing industry in Southeast. Every year, popular Alaskan cruises bring hundreds of thousands of visitors through five communities (Ketchikan, Juneau, Sitka, Skagway, and Icy Strait Point just outside of Hoonah). This does not include the hundreds of workers who relocate to Alaska for seasonal work in the industry. According to the most recent Rain Coast Data Southeast by the Numbers report, the industry shows no sign of slowing down as the number of visitors which is predicted to increase 17% between 2018 and 2019 (Rain Coast Data 2018). Unlike other states in the US, Alaska is split up into boroughs and census areas. In Southeast, approximately 33 communities are organized into seven boroughs, two census areas, and one municipality (Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs n.d.; US Census Bureau 2017). With a total population of 72,915 (2017), 75% of the population lives within the three largest communities: Juneau (32,269), Ketchikan (13,754), and Sitka (8,748) (Rain Coast Data 2018). Juneau, the largest community in the region, plays a dual role as both the Southeast regional center and state capitol. The capitol was moved to Juneau in 1959, when Alaska became a state, from Sitka which had served as the administrative center when owned by Russia and during Alaska's territorial days (Bill 2018). The basic breakdown of demographics in Southeast, according to the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates are: 66.2% White, 15.6% Alaskan Native, 6.1% Asian, 1.1% Black, 0.5% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; 9.4% self-identified as two ethnicities (US Census Bureau 2017). Culture plays a large role in everyday community life. Southeast Alaska is the traditional land of the Alaska Native Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian people. Local native cultural influences can be seen and observed in many aspects of life throughout Southeast, including art, architecture, ceremony during events, dance groups, the biennial Celebration festival, and many more. Although Alaska was no exception to past mistreatment of its indigenous peoples, it has made attempts to righting those wrongs. A recent landmark event was the passage of House Bill 216 in 2014 into law, which added Alaska Native Languages to the list of official state languages (Smith 2014). The Pilipino and Tongan Samoan communities in Juneau and Norwegian community in Petersburg (Image 2 Appendix) are two additional cultural influences in the region.

In their article for the American Journal of Public Health, Hart, Larson, and Lishner (2005) identify five common taxonomies for defining rural. Each theme reflects the focus and objectives of the organization or federal agency that designed it. Two of these themes, from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), are frequently utilized. The Rural Urban Continuum Codes, developed by the USDA (Figure 2a), categorizes counties into nine classes based on their population size and adjacency to a metropolitan county. The OMB classification categorizes counties into one of three classes (metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore) based on the urban center population and its economic or commuting relationship to nearby communities ( Figure 2b) (Gesler et al. 2006; RTC:Rural 2015; US Census Bureau 2018). Micropolitan and noncore counties make up the nonmetropolitan US often considered to be rural America. Based on the 2013 OMB codes, 72% of the US land area is classified as rural (Cromartie 2017). According to the latest census, approximately 19-20% of the US population live and work in these rural areas (Ratcliffe et al. 2016). Regrettably, rural areas of the US have some of the highest rates of chronic illness and frequency of emergency room visits (Ricketts 2000;Jones, L\u00f3pez-Carr, and Dalal 2011;Mueller et al. 2016). Studies show that rural areas experience 27-35% higher rates of hospitalization than urban areas (Ricketts 2000;Staloch 2015). However, a review by Starfield, Shi, and Macinko (2005) verifies that access to medical care, particularly primary care, result in better health outcomes. This would suggest that by increasing access to medical services in rural areas, rates of chronic illness and hospitalization would decrease. There are multiple types of health care facilities in rural areas. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) provide a majority of medical services in rural areas; relying heavily on public insurance reimbursements for their operational budget (Staloch 2015). Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) provide primary care to those in the most isolated areas of the country (Staloch 2015 Richards et al. 2016). Therefore, despite the vital services that emergency departments provide, these services tend to be located large distances apart and in overall short supply in rural areas. Geographic isolation and distance between physicians is a serious concern when discussing rural health care. Due to declining rural populations, changes in public insurance, and the shrinking availability of resources, hospitals in rural regional centers have been forced to scale back their services or close their doors altogether (Ricketts 2000(Ricketts , 2016Staloch 2015;Kaufman et al. 2016). This decline in health services not only affects health care access for rural residents but impacts the local economy as well. For many moderate sized rural communities, the local economy is reliant on local government, the service sector, and health care to provide jobs and economic stimulus (Ricketts 2016). Limiting health services also affects those in surrounding areas who must travel further to obtain primary and specialized health services. increasing geographic isolation and cost of providing services contribute to a persistent divide between rural and urban health care (Ricketts 2000(Ricketts , 2016. Another challenge faced by many rural health care facilities are chronic staffing shortages. With less than 20% of the population living in rural areas, only a fraction of medical providers work in rural areas (Ricketts 2000 (Hart et al. 2002;McGrail et al. 2017)."}, {"section_title": "Emergency Medical Services (EMS)", "text": "In rural areas emergency medical services (EMS) transportation provides a vital role in connecting rural and remote areas with higher level medical services in urban communities. At its core, the EMS field is the \"intersection between public health, public safety, and healthcare\" (Mears et al. 2010,85), and covers a wide variety of services from ambulance transport to natural disaster response. This broad spectrum of services makes assigning EMS to any one regulatory or administrative body a difficult task. As a result, the federal government is responsible for EMS regulations and monitoring through the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA). However, the everyday operations and administration duties are assigned to various local and state departments. EMS transportation can take the form of ground ambulances or air transportation, also known as air medevac. In most emergency situations ambulances will be used to transport patients. However, in instances where access to the patient is limited and the injuries are time sensitive, air medevac (helicopter, fixed wind, or jet) will be used to reach, stabilize, and transport the patient (von Recklinghausen 2011  (Arcury et al. 2005;Brems et al. 2006;Johnson et al. 2006;Brundisini et al. 2013). Brems et al. (2006)  In Alaska, no 'managed care organizations' exist in the private sector, and formal provider networks are lacking. However informal referral patterns, and 'panels' of preferred providers associated with a variety of insurance programs, result in some structured relationships, and some facilities and groups are affiliated or jointly managed (Alaska Health Care Commission 2010, A5). In the absence of formal organization, Alaskan medical providers manage this disconnect by coming together and forming their own networks through social and professional connections.    (Kellar 2017). This increase is evidence to the essential and growing role medevac services play in health care delivery for the people of Southeast Alaska."}, {"section_title": "Theory of Access", "text": "Access to health care services is a major theme throughout public health research. Topics range from access to primary care to the availability of mental health services, obstetrics resources, and qualified personnel (Ricketts 2000 individual and a service\" (Penchansky and Thomas 1981,128). The framework is structured around five major components that influence a patient's ability and choice to enter the health care system. These categories are Accessibility, Availability, Acceptability, Affordability, and Accommodation (Penchansky and Thomas 1981; Saurman 2016) ( Table 1). In previous research, data were gathered from individuals on how these five categories influenced their health care experience, with a rating system usually employing a Likert scale. This type of data collection can be beneficial for examining how access varies for different sub-populations such as persons with disabilities, those suffering from chronic illness, and minority groups (Karikari-Martin 2010). An accessible service is within reasonable proximity to the consumer in terms of time and distance"}, {"section_title": "Availability", "text": "An available service has sufficient services and resources to meet the volume and needs of the consumers and communities served."}, {"section_title": "Acceptability", "text": "An acceptable service responds to the attitude of the provider and the consumer regarding characteristics of the service and social or cultural concerns. For instance, a patient's desire to see a medical provider who speaks the same language and share the same culture may determine whether a service is acceptable or not."}, {"section_title": "Affordability", "text": "Affordable services examine the direct costs for both the service provider and the consumer.\nAffordability concerns are, as revealed through interviews, mainly linked to the cost of medevac services and the role of insurance in paying for said services. First, similar to other medical services rendered in Alaska, the cost of a medevac is high. Estimates from interviewed providers stated that an air medevac from Skagway to Juneau cost about $30,000; a medevac from Juneau to Anchorage or Seattle could range anywhere from $45,000-50,000 depending on the distance to the destination. However, that figure may not include medical costs (personnel, medical procedures, and medical supplies [medically]\". Government and native health insurance plans cover much of the cost but there still may be residual out-of-pocket expenses. Private insurance plan may include medevac transportation but there may still be a co-pay, of typically 20%. Additionally, medevac coverage does not ensure that the patient will fly with a medevac company that has a contract with their insurance provider. While medical providers will try and match a patient's insurance with a covered medevac company, the availability of aircraft and the time sensitivity of the emergency may not allow for it. It is this uncertainty that motivates many people to buy supplemental insurance provided by the medevac companies. Several, of the medical providers interviewed emphasized the importance of having this additional coverage especially considering the characteristics of the area they live in and the potential need for a medevac. One provider said that they recommend at-risk patients -patients who have a serious chronic medical condition or are pregnant -that they purchase additional medevac coverage, \"I do talk to patients that are [pregnant] on bed rest or they are preterm and at risk of delivering early\u2026300 dollars is a lot cheaper than, what's 20% of 40,000?\" Even if individuals are not at-risk patients, two interviewees providers stressed the importance of planning for the unexpected despite the extra costs of medevac insurance because of the potential financial benefits in event that an emergency does occur. As one of these providers mentioned, \"Although it is an additional cost, for many the annual cost of additional insurance that covers the whole family is worth it compared to the potential co-pay of an air medevac.\" This sentiment is strong, that as another provider mentioned, some people even receive supplemental medevac insurance as gifts. An example provided was parents gifting supplemental medevac insurance to their young adult children. "}, {"section_title": "Accommodation (Adequacy)", "text": "An adequate service is well organized to accept clients, and clients are able to use the services. Considerations of adequacy include hours of operation (after-hour services), referral or appointment systems, and facility structures (wheelchair access).  An early version of the interview guide consisted of eighteen questions. However, feedback from pilot interviews revealed that the time required for the interview would be too long for some interviewees, who may be responding at work, during a lunch break, after work, or otherwise be operating under a time constraint. The question guide was modified by eliminating some of the original questions from the guide. This resulted in an interview guide that allowed for more flexibility in the time required and formality of the interview while still addressing all the components (Table 2). For example, if a participant had more time available the interview tended to be more conversational. While on the other hand if the participant was short on time, a more direct Q&A structure allowed for time to be used efficiently. Due to the involvement of human subjects in the research all questions and the overall research project were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Montana (IRB case #118-17). Overall, twelve interviews were conducted out of twenty-two attempted contacts. Specifics regarding attempts and successes in recruiting are as follows: Six initial contacts in Juneau were made, and successfully recruited, based on personal connections. From that pool, nine potential participants from both Juneau and rural communities were "}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Interviews", "text": "Of twelve responses from participants, eight were conducted by telephone. Four participants chose to submit written interview responses. Prior to engaging in the phone interview questions, an explanation was given about the purpose of the research, how the interview would proceed, and how the data collected would be used. For the written responses the same information was included with a copy of the interview questions. Lastly, for audio recordings, permission to record the interview for transcription purposes was requested. The phone interviews lasted 15-30 minutes and were recorded on two different audio recording devices. One was a call recording application on the phone being used, the other being a laptop recording software. This was to ensure that there were two copies of the interview to reduce the risk of recording malfunction. Nonetheless, the recording of one interview, from a Skagway respondent, failed. As a result, the participant's responses were paraphrased from interviewer's recollection and were later supported by the responses from the other Skagway interview. Other Data Sources In addition to interviews with medical providers and medevac personnel, field observations, and other qualitative data sources were utilized to provide additional context to interview responses. In August 2018, during a three-week visit to Alaska, field observations were recorded in writing and visual imagery were taken of the landscape and transportation methods in Southeast Alaska. During this visit, observations were made, essentially as \"windshield tours\", involving Juneau and three daytrips to four rural Southeast communities outside of Juneau. The day trips were taken to observe marine transportation routes, infrastructure, and other demographic and geographic characteristics. Communities sought out for these day trips were chosen for their varying population sizes, geographic location, and differing location on the rural Alaska geographic hierarchy. The Alaska State Marine Highway was chosen for two of the day trips for its important role in connecting the many coastal geographically isolated communities in the region, while a catamaran was used for an additional day trip.

By utilizing the five categories of the framework, a template was created for the initial coding.

Providers at these clinics may work as full-time staff, traveling staff, or have their own independent practice but travel to provide services in SEARHC locations. In the case of an air medevac, the patient may be sent to the SEARHC hospital in Sitka versus Juneau. One provider interviewed suggested that when operating within the SEARCH system, Sitka may be chosen over Juneau as a preferred destination for medevacs, \"I believe SEARHC may send many of their patients by plane to their hospital in Sitka to contain costs within their In the instance a patient does travel for emergency or non-emergency reasons, interviewed providers mentioned a service not being locally available, a lack of confidence in the local provider, and the patient's preference to see specialist as contributing factors. A lack of specialists was noted by providers as reasons for both nonemergency travel and emergency medevacs."}, {"section_title": "Accessibility", "text": "According to Penchansky and Thomas, accessibility is to be measured in geographic terms that captures how reasonably close a service is (Penchansky and Thomas 1981;Saurman 2016). However, when working at the regional scale -in this case Southeast Alaska -the definition of \"reasonable\" varies depending on the community, available services, and transportation. In rural Alaska, for example, accessibility is going to be different between Tenakee Springs and Sitka. Not only are these two communities' different sizes but they also have different available medical services and modes for travel, both locally and between communities. For instance, local transportation to the nurse clinic in Tenakee Springs (Image 4 Appendix) may consist of walking down the street or a short drive on a four wheeler. While in Sitka, local transportation may require a taxi, bus, or personal vehicle to access services. This makes accessibility to local services better in Tenakee Springs than in Sitka. However, as with many rural Alaska communities there are occasions where needed medical services are not available locally and travel to another community is required. In this case whether the patent needs emergency or nonemergency transport, Sitka has a higher level of accessibility due to access several daily commercial jets (direct flights to both Juneau and Seattle) and a small plane service, a locally stationed medevac jet, and ferry service to Juneau three times a week. Compared to Tenakee Springs where they receive float plane service 1-2 times a day, ferry service twice a week, and, due to the lack of infrastructure, medevac service has to be provided by a non-wheel air craft (float plane or helicopter). Overall, reasonable access to medical services in rural Alaska is not only a matter of accessing services locally but in other communities as well. In Juneau, accessibility is tied to access of local transportation more so than the access of services. As a micropolitan community, Juneau has a wide variety of medical services available most of which are clustered together throughout town. These medical service clusters can be accessed by private vehicle, taxi, scheduled Care-A-Van service, and the public bus system. However, despite Juneau being a relatively urban community, there are challenges with accessibility to transportation. When using transportation other than a personal vehicle, cost and service timetables must be considered. For example, while the public bus system operates throughout Juneau, service is limited to major roads and does not extend out to residents who live on the fringes of town. Despite the variability in accessibility to services between rural communities and Juneau, the cost of travel between communities is a significant factor in determining accessibility to health services. Cost not only being the monetary cost of a plane or ferry ticket, but also transportation schedules, cost of time taking off work or being away from family, and, in the case of emergencies, available infrastructure to support medevac aircraft. For those who make the deliberate choice to live on the fringes of communities or in rural communities, an important question remains to be asked: What level of comfort with risk and measure of decreased access to services is required to live a certain lifestyle? Accommodation An important component of access to medical services is the ability to utilize them. This includes wait time to see a provider, hours of operation, and being able to physically enter the building among others (Penchansky and Thomas 1981;Saurman 2016). In Juneau and Skagway, where interviewed participants lived, medical clinics tended to have extended hours outside of the normal \"9 to 5\" weekday hours. For many, these extended weekday hours of operation allow patients to make appointments before and after school or work. Additional weekend hours were limited but did provide flexibility for those with commitments during the week. Wait time to receive an appointment varies depending on location and service. For example, in Juneau, a patient can get an appointment quicker with a family or primary care provider than a physical therapist. In the case of emergencies, services in rural Alaskan communities vary. Emergency services may be provided by a community hospital, a 24-hour on call nurse, or a volunteer fire fighter/EMT. In Juneau, there are two options for emergency care. During business hours, Juneau Urgent and Family Care provides a wide range of medical services and lab tests. Otherwise there is the 24-hour emergency room at Bartlett Regional Hospital."}, {"section_title": "Medevac", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Medevac Procedure", "text": "Mobilizing an air medevac is a complex process involving several individuals at multiple organizations. Based on responses from participants, that had experience with the process of ordering a medevac, the process is executed in three phases: 1) the need for a medevac is established, 2) medevac aircraft and patient are prepped for transportation, and 3) the flight and transfer of the patient to the receiving hospital. First, a medical professional determines that the patient's medical condition is beyond the capabilities of local resources available. Often the person to make this call will be a physician or the ranking medical provider present. Next, that medical provider must find a hospital where a doctor is available and willing to take the patient. Once a receiving doctor has been secured, the patient's physician-or medical provider-contacts the medevac company's hotline to determine which company has the first available aircraft. At this stage the process is turned over to the medevac company, and the process goes one of two ways depending on whether the patient is local or in a community outside of Juneau. If the patient is in Juneau, once a request has been processed three things happen. First, the flight nurses are notified, and they ride in the ambulance, from the fire station at the airport, to the hospital to prepare the patient for transportation. Second, the pilot begins flight checks and prepare the plane for the flight. Third, the office processes the patients' health insurance. While a lack of medevac insurance will not prevent a patient from receiving a medevac service, efforts are made to have all possible administrative work completed at the time of flight departure. Once the ambulance returns to the airport, where the medevac bases are located, the patient is transferred to the aircraft with the flight nurses and the plane takes off. If the patient is in a community outside of Juneau, for example Sitka, after the medevac hotline receives a call requesting a medevac, the office will determine if there is an available aircraft and the pilot will assess the weather conditions in the area. Once an aircraft is available and the pilot gives the green light, the air craft is prepped and the plane departs approximately thirty-five minutes after the final 'ok' is given. Upon arrival at the airport the flight nurse either takes a taxi or an airport vehicle to the hospital to prep the patient for transport and, if possible, make arrangements for a family member to travel with. Then an ambulance transports the patient, flight nurse, and family member back to the airport where the aircraft is fueled and ready to take off. Island. An interview with an experienced medevac pilot stated that Petersburg was consistently the most difficult community to access due to frequent socked-in conditions. The combination of weather and physical geography had, on more than one occasion, prevented a patient from getting out for several days. \"So trying to get a patient out of Petersburg sometimes can take days\u2026there have been quite a few times where a patient we picked up from Petersburg where they had been waiting a couple of days to head south\". The same participant continued to explain, how in such scenarios, medevac companies sometimes coordinate with the local US Coast Guard (USCG). Unlike the medevac's jet/fixed-wing aircraft, the USCG MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter, based in Sitka, can fly in more challenging weather conditions and have technology that helps facilitate low visibility navigation operations. Due to the alternative aircraft type and additional technology, the USCG are able to extract patients from Petersburg and rendezvous with a medevac aircraft in a nearby community."}, {"section_title": "Seasonality and Tourism", "text": "The effects of seasonality on the number of medevacs performed addressed the role tourism plays in the region, particularly in smaller rural communities. For four to five months of the year throughout the Southeast region, many local populations increase with tourism workers. In communities along the cruise ship route, this increase in local population is felt acutely. For example, Skagway increases from a winter population of 200-300 to a summer population of 800-900. This additional work force provides goods and services to the hundreds of thousands of visitors that sail through. The large influx of people can put strain on local medical services that are designed to serve a much smaller population. This increase in patient volume is reflected in the number of medevacs conducted. Skagway saw 80-100 medevacs flown in 2017 which is higher than the estimated 50 flights conducted in 2016. Both summer estimates are vastly larger than the average 10 medevac flights flown during the winter. Unfortunately, the number of medevac aircraft remains the same year-round leading to occasional aircraft shortages. A large increase in the number of medevac cases, combined with challenges caused by weather, on occasion lends to a shortage in available medevac aircraft. One interviewee gave an example where all the aircraft, including the Coast Guard, were unavailable. Fortunately, they were able to get a medevac flown down from Anchorage and the patient was stable enough to wait. Despite the challenges faced by medevacs, one interviewee made it a point to mention that improvements have been made to the system over the years. \"I have been doing this for about 10 years now, and before we would often have to wait hours, frequently we still have to overnight patients we simply can't get them out. \u2026 with two flight services out of Juneau it has really cut down of the flight time and how long it takes for medevac services to get there so overall services have improved.\" This is encouraging because while little control can be had over weather conditions and patient volume, increased efficiency in air medevac transport can make all the difference in an medical emergency scenario."}, {"section_title": "Medevac Government Policy", "text": "Despite the complex process of organizing a medevac, the process is routinely executed smoothly with only minor setbacks when dealing with weather, availability of aircraft, and stability of the patient. As appropriate, FAA policy gives departure priority to medevac flights over private and commercial flights. However, one comment given by an interviewee brought up a valid concern when it comes to medevac flights in the event of a state of emergency: \"on 9/11\u2026 we had never been attacked like that before except for Pearl Harbor so they closed down the airspace system\u2026then they shut it down even more and our plane \u2026wasn't able to get back to Juneau. And it left us vulnerable, we knew we were safe\u2026but the government bureaucracy they just didn't know what to do so they have theses blanket rules\u2026.\" The situation described above occurred on 9/11, which resulted in a total shut down of US airspace. While this decision is understandable, up until the final shutdown several medevac flights were conducted that day between Juneau and Seattle. Being cut off from advanced medical services is a serious concern in the context of Alaska. An inability to travel is an important issue especially when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lists EMS services as a Critical Infrastructure Sector. Air service in general is an essential service in geographically isolated regions. According to the DHS Emergency Services Sector -Specific Plan, emergency health care is dependent on local services, and transportation services are expected to be able to transport people and supplies locally and nationally. \"The ESS (Emergency Service Sector) depends on a resilient transportation network in order to effectively respond to emergencies. Response vehicles must be able to transport people, goods, and services to and from incident areas. This includes the movement of ESS assets to other geographical locations throughout the Nation\" (U.S Department of Homeland Security 2015, 9). In the event of another complete airspace shut down the above mentioned tasks would become difficult to conduct in Alaska. While these requirements could be conducted by boat, there are limitations in the number vessels capable of large mobilization and the areas that can be accessed considering the lack of road networks in the region. The time it takes to travel between communities by boat also needs to be taken into consideration. For example, it takes a minimum of three days to travel by ferry from Juneau to Bellingham WA, the nearest US port in the lower 48. Government policy needs to take the importance of emergency air travel, in geographically isolated areas, into consideration when developing national emergency procedures. Chapter 6: Summary and Conclusion"}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "There is a lack of published, centralized, and current information on the Southeast Alaska health care system, opportunities and challenges in accessing that health care, and on the role of medevac services. This knowledge gap provided an excellent opportunity for this research to take place. Using a qualitative research approach, multiple resources were used including: online resources, personal lived experience and field observations, and most importantly, interviews with health care and medevac providers. Originally, geared towards looking at the utilization of local medical services and the role of air medevac in the health care system of Southeast Alaska, it became clear that a need for understanding how medical services were provided, how those services varied between communities, and the role that medevac services played in accessing those medical services were fundamental questions that needed to be answered. As the section on 'Providing Health Care in Alaska' reveals, the In this setting, primary care providers have, as was noted by interviewees, remarkably comprehensive expertise in diagnosing and providing health services. In some instances, their efforts are aided by communicating with specialists in Anchorage or Seattle to reduce the need for medical travel. Despite the comprehensive knowledge base of many primary care providers, many of the reasons cited for the need of health care travel were based on the lack of a specialty provider, procedure, or facility capabilities. To support additional access to local medical services several clinics provide scheduling options for outside normal business hours. This helps by providing opportunities for those who cannot afford time off work or families to have more flexibility in receiving care. As mentioned previously, many primary providers possess a broad spectrum of knowledge and experience lending them more capabilities then similar providers in urban areas. This additional knowledge and ties with local communities lends to general acceptability. In the case that a patient does travel to receive medical services in another community, interview participants noted lack of confidence and desire for a specialist as the most common factors. Despite high numbers of recent health insurance enrollment, it does not always cover the high medical costs experienced in Alaska. Medical costs that do not include the additional travel costs incurred by receiving needed medical services in other communities."}, {"section_title": "Caveats", "text": "While the interviews conducted for this thesis revealed a great wealth of information there are limitations that should be addressed. First, due to the relatively small number of interviews, and the partial loss of one interview, the results provide only a snapshot of a much larger picture. While the health care and medevac providers who responded to requests for interviews mainly worked in Juneau, many of them had varied experiences that offered comprehensive insight into health care in surrounding rural areas. Some of the clinical nurses had previously worked as flight nurses, others were raised in rural Alaskan communities, while some had EMS training and work experience in rural Alaska. The participants that were interviewed therefore provided insight from multiple perspectives. Second, users of the health care system were not included in this research, simply because their inclusion would go beyond the scope of a master's thesis. Third, this research was focused on determining the Southeast health system as a whole. As such factors that influence access to individual health systems were not addressed. Opportunities Alaska, can make it difficult to attract outside health care providers who do not possess personal or cultural ties to the area. One could argue that limited access to services is part of the cost of living in isolated communities. However, where one lives is not always a matter of choice, for many in Alaska there are significant cultural and social ties associated with the community and the land around it. While it does make ensuring adequate access to health care challenging, it should not be a reason to neglect those areas. By promoting programs, like CHAP and telehealth, policy makers would be supporting a health care system that acknowledges that to many Alaskans living in the \"The Last Frontier\" is not just a quirk, it is a way of life."}]
