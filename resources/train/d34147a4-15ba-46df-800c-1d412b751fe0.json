[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Whole-body hybrid PET/MR imaging has been used since its introduction in 2010 in clinical and research settings for diagnosis, staging and restaging, assessment of response to treatment, and radiation therapy planning. However, the quantitative potential of PET/MRI is challenged by the lack of reliable and accurate MRI-guided attenuation correction (MRAC) owing to the lack of direct relationship between MRI signal, reflecting proton density and relaxation time properties, and electron density, which is linked to photon attenuation properties of biological tissues. Despite the progress made during the last decade, MRAC is still in its infancy and remains problematic particularly in whole-body imaging. While some think that current techniques implemented on commercial systems for MRAC do not constitute a viable solution and are hampering the wider acceptance of PET/MRI technology in the clinic, others think that, despite their limitations, these techniques provide adequate correction fulfilling the requirements of the different clinical applications of this technology. This is the topic of this month's Point/Counterpoint debate.\nArguing for the Proposition is Ciprian Catana, MD, PhD. Dr. Catana received his MD degree from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Targu-Mures, Romania in 2001. Subsequently, he conducted his Ph.D. research in Biomedical Engineering at the University of California Davis, where he designed and built an MR-compatible PET insert for a small animal 7-Tesla MRI system. For his postdoctoral training, he moved to the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital in 2007 and started to focus on translating integrated PET/MRI from the preclinical to the clinical arena. Dr. Catana is now the Director of Integrated MR-PET imaging at the Martinos Center and an Associate Professor in Radiology at Harvard Medical School. Over the last decade, he has concentrated on further developing and validating this novel technology, identifying and implementing methods to best exploit the combined data, and developing quantitative PET/MRI for human use.\nWorking closely with dozens of basic science researchers and physician-scientists, Dr. Catana is currently applying these advanced tools to the study of normal brain and neuropsychiatric diseases as well as exploring the clinical potential of this technology for wholebody oncological applications.

Quick Opening Statement MRAC has always been very challenging because bone and lung tissue cannot easily be imaged using MRI; motion introduces attenuation-emission data mismatches; truncations are present due to differences between the MRI and PET fields of view; and metallic implants lead to susceptibility artifacts. 1 Even using the latest techniques, significant quantification bias and artifacts can be introduced. 2 Nevertheless, many studies have shown that this bias does not have a substantial impact on the data interpretation in numerous clinical scenarios. Similarly, the clinical impact of artifacts can be minimized by carefully analyzing the nonattenuationcorrected PET images or correlated morphological MR images. However, to increase its clinical acceptance, PET/ MRI has to be used for advanced applications for which accurate MRAC is a requirement that still has to be met, such as quantitative longitudinal therapy monitoring studies. For many of these applications, the MRAC-related quantification bias and variability are comparable to or exceed the expected effect sizes.\nHead MRAC appears to be the most advanced and therefore closest to routine clinical use. Perhaps, motivated by several early reports that demonstrated spatial biases, 3 improved methods to generate head attenuation maps are now commercially available. However, are these sufficient and widely accepted in the clinic? Scanner qualification for multicenter trials would demonstrate the data obtained are of sufficient quality and comparable to PET/CT devices. Unfortunately, no PET/MRI scanner is used for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) or other similar multicenter clinical trials, in spite of the obvious advantages in terms of patient convenience and opportunity to properly address other factors that bias the PET data quantification. 4, 5 There are several additional explanations for this situation: PET/MRI control databases are not available and those derived from PET/ CT have not been validated for analyzing PET/MRI data; MRAC methods developed for human tissue fail when used to generate attenuation maps for the image quality phantom and dedicated acquisition and processing protocols are needed 6 ; widely accepted methods and metrics for assessing the accuracy of different MRAC methods are lacking. Encouragingly, head MRAC methods proposed by several academic groups are very accurate 7 and could potentially be used to address many of these issues but need to be adopted and disseminated by vendors before they can be used in the clinic.\nArguably the bar is set unreasonably high (e.g., using PET/ CT-specific criteria for qualifying an integrated PET/MRI scanner) and even CT-based attenuation correction (AC) is only the silver standard approach. However, just like numerous studies (including those aimed specifically at validating CT against transmission-based AC) were needed for optimizing and establishing this approach and educating and convincing the clinicians of its utility, 8 similar efforts are still required in the PET/MRI field. Until this happens, MRAC will considerably slow down the clinical acceptance of this promising technology, especially for whole-body applications.\nAGAINST THE PROPOSITION: Harald H. Quick, Ph.D."}, {"section_title": "Opening Statement", "text": "In the year 2010, the first two whole-body PET/MR hybrid systems reached product status and became commercially available. In 2014, a third PET/MR model was introduced to the market. Since then, the number of worldwide installations of integrated PET/MR systems has steadily increased to 145 installations worldwide today (March 2018). While clinical application today is at full swing, on the methodological side, PET/MR demanded for new techniques and innovative solutions. 9 From the beginning, particularly attenuation correction (AC) has been a hot topic of debate and it continues to be.\nThe initial method for MRAC used fast MR imaging sequences, such as Dixon-VIBE to obtain images of patient tissue distribution and for subsequent tissue class segmentation. 10 This general method of tissue segmentation from MR images today is established in all currently available PET/MR systems. 11 Although MRAC techniques generally provide robust and reproducible results in most clinical applications, initial clinical studies have indicated a small but systematic underestimation of PET quantification in PET/MR studies when compared to PET/CT. 12 These differences mostly can be attributed to three methodological challenges of MRAC. 9, 13 First, MRAC lacks information about the attenuating properties of bone. Second, MRAC often shows signal truncations along the patient arms that are then not considered in MRAC. Third, the use of ancillary hardware components, such as radiofrequency coils in the field of view of the PET detector, causes additional attenuation of photons.\nNumerous innovative solutions for attenuation, truncation, and motion correction have been suggested and scientifically evaluated during the past years. Of these, some of the most accurate and practical developments have found their way from research into commercial product applications of all PET/MR systems. Recent studies have demonstrated the technical feasibility, accuracy, and robustness of the following new MRAC features: (a) inclusion of bone by implementation of a bone model 14 ; (b) implementation of MR-based truncation correction 15 ; (c) improved MRAC featuring higher spatial resolution, a bone model and truncation correction. 16 Not only general improvements but also only relatively minor quantitative effects on PET quantification have been reported in these studies when applying each of these new MRAC strategies. 14, 1516 This indicates that the initial MRAC methods using Dixon-VIBE already performed well in a clinical setting and, furthermore, this reflects that the initial limitations of MRAC have now been overcome.\nTo come back to the opening statementcurrent commercial available attenuation correction techniques across all PET/MR systems have matured today to provide fast, accurate, and robust PET quantification in PET/MR. Thus, I do not see MRAC or other technical factors as a limiting factor for wider acceptance of PET/MR in the clinic. In my opinion, the wider acceptance of PET/MR is potentially limited by the fact that PET/MR examinations are inherently more complex than PET/CT examinations, which have implications on imaging workflow and long examination times. Furthermore, PET/MR often requires reading by an experienced nuclear medicine and a radiology-trained specialists. Not least, PET/ MR systems compared to PET/CT are more expensiveand reimbursement in some countries is still challenging.\nRebuttal: Ciprian Catana, MD, Ph.D.\nI agree with Dr. Quick that substantial progress has been made to address many of the initial MRAC methodological challenges. While certainly sufficient for numerous clinical applications, current approaches unfortunately still fail in some scenarios. To give just one example beyond the brain studies already mentioned, let us consider a lung or liver cancer patient who undergoes serial PET/MRI examinations before and after significantly losing weight due to surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy. Can we confidently state truncation artifacts did not bias the initial PET estimates? Or that respiratory motion-induced attenuation-emission mismatches did not introduce artifacts in the follow-up data as the patient lost the ability to perform breathholds? Have signal voids around surgical clips biased the regional estimates? Were the same MR image and bone mask pairs selected from the database at the two visits to eliminate bone misclassification bias when using the model-based method 14 ? Without larger studies to thoroughly test these recently proposed approaches we cannot answer in the affirmative, which suggests the current commercial MRAC methods do not yet provide the level of accuracy required for longitudinal whole-body PET studies.\nDr. Quick mentioned several additional factors that could limit the wider acceptance of PET/MR in the clinic. In my opinion, the relative impact of these factors is hard to assess. While PET/MRI are indeed more complex than PET/CT examinations (albeit not more so than two separate PET/CT and MR examinations), they also provide a much richer dataset that could considerably help clinicians and improve patient management. 17 Joint readings are often performed at many institutions even for PET/CT examinations and are required when additional MR examinations are needed. PET/ MRI is indeed expensive. However, to justify the higher costs compared to PET/CT and convince the larger community (beyond the early adopters) to embrace this promising technology and fully exploit its unique capabilities (e.g., to obtain in a single imaging session temporally and spatially matched quantitative multiparametric measurements of metabolism, morphology, function, etc.), 18 the data obtained from these devices have to be at least as reliable, which underscores the need to further improve MRAC methods.\nRebuttal: Harald H. Quick, Ph.D.\nI agree with Dr. Catana that the bar for MRAC in integrated PET/MR is set unreasonably high, especially when considering that CT-based AC in PET/CT compared to PET transmission scans is only a silver standard. Regarding the ongoing discussions within the PET/MR community, the expectations on the role of MRAC seem to exceed the expectations on CT-based AC in PET/CT. At this point, lets remind us what is really clinically needed; AC shall deliver fast, accurate, robust, and repeatable correction of PET data for a broad range of clinical applications.\nAdmittedly, the variety of currently available algorithms for MRAC challenges the clinical users. Unlike in PET/CT, where a single, fast \"push-button\" whole-body CT scan provides all the necessary information required for AC, similar corrections in PET/MR resemble a \"LEGO construction kit\": multiple \"building blocks\" are needed to form a whole-body dataset for MRAC in PET/MR. As listed in my opening statement, this includes Dixon and UTE sequences, bone models, MR-and PET-guided truncation correction, and CT-based templates to correct for RF coils and other hardware. This rather complex approach leads to a certain inhomogeneity when using different MRAC methods, as not only one single version of AC exists, as is the case for PET/CT. Thus, at single PET/MR sites, the latest version of current MRAC methods is available, while others use different methods, different vendors, and different AC applications.\nDespite the outlined complexity of the topic, I like to conclude with a statement from the 6 th T\u20ac ubingen International Workshop on PET/MR 19 : \"There was general agreement between the participants and many clinical users that MRAC has been solved to the degree required for clinical use based on accepted image metrics.\" This statement is supportive of my view: we have the tools and methods for accurate and robust clinical use of PET/MR already at hand. Given the mentioned broad variety of MRAC methods, there is, however, further need toward quality control and standardization efforts in PET/MR AC. 6 This is an ongoing process also in PET/CTeven 18 yr after its clinical introduction. 20, 21 "}, {"section_title": "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST", "text": "Dr. Catana and Dr. Quick have no relevant conflicts of interest."}]
