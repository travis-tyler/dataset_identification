AD is currently undergoing a conceptual transformation from a clinicopathological to a clinicobiological entity [3] . Such an approach enables the identification of AD in its oligosymptomatic stage, which is commonly termed mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD) [4] [5] [6] , or even before the onset of symptoms (i.e., the preclinical stage).\n\u03a4he clinical usefulness of the established \u0391D biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b2 42 ), total tau (tTau), phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau) [7, 8] and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) [9, 10] , decreases when it comes to the identification of early or atypical AD, especially in unselected populations which are not enriched with relatively pure AD cases [11, 12] . Moreover, established AD biomarkers reflect events of AD pathogenesis which are downstream of the cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (A\u03b2PP) by the \u03b2-site A\u03b2PP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the initial phase of the amyloid cascade [11] . As a consequence, developing new biomarkers has become one of the main aims of AD research, especially within the framework of the growing interest in accurate detection of preclinical or oligosymptomatic AD.\nPeptides implicated in the initial phase of AD pathogenesis, such as CSF BACE1 activity and the CSF levels of soluble A\u03b2PP \u03b2 (sA\u03b2PP\u03b2), have recently attracted attention as potential AD biomarker candidates [11, 13] . However, the published findings are inconsistent or even contradictory. Even though a number of studies revealed significant differences of BACE1 activity between MCI-AD [14, 15] and/or dementia due to AD (dementia-AD) [15] [16] [17] [18] in comparison to controls, no significant differences were detected in other studies [19] [20] [21] [22] . Similar inconsistencies are reported for sA\u03b2PP\u03b2. In a number of studies, no differences were observed for CSF sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 concentrations between dementia-AD patients and controls [19-21, 23, 24] . Nonetheless, in other studies, CSF sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 levels were found to be higher in patients with MCI-AD compared to healthy controls and in patients with dementia-AD compared to patients suffering from other dementias [23, 25] . The observed discrepancies could be attributed to differences in CSF processing (e.g., storage and handling) [26] , the employed laboratory methods and techniques (different enzyme kits -enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] vs. multiplex assay), but also to the fact that the diagnoses of the study samples were in most cases exclusively based on clinical criteria and on the clinicians' assessment. It is noteworthy that clinical diagnoses are not always confirmed at autopsy [27, 28] . Thus, a study, based on biomarker-underpinned clinical diagnoses, may shed new light on the utility of CSF BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 levels as potential biomarker candidates of AD.\nThe aims of the present study were (i) to explore differences in CSF BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 concentrations between cognitively impaired and cognitively intact older individuals with unambiguous CSF biomarker profiles; and (ii) to compare the contribution of BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 concentration to the diagnostic classification of study participants to that of the established AD imaging biomarker FDG PET."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Design and Participants", "text": "The study encompasses data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) databank.

For the analyses, a group of ROIs consisting of brain areas that typically show hypometabolism in patients with AD was generated (bilateral angular gyrus, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and inferior temporal cortex of both hemispheres).

Age and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 levels did not differ across all groups. There were no BACE1 activity differences between AD-dementia and any of the other groups, whilst BACE1 activity was significantly higher in MCI-AD patients compared to both controls (p < 0.001) and MCI-nonAD patients (p = 0.02). No sex distribution differences between controls and both MCI-AD and dementia-AD patients were observed. All other covariates showed significant differences when comparing dementia-AD patients with controls and MCI-nonAD patients. Of note, FDG PET did not significantly differ between MCI-AD and MCI-nonAD. As expected, no differences were detected in routine CSF biomarker levels between controls and MCI-nonAD patients, as well as between MCI-AD and dementia-AD patients (Table 1) .\nRegarding BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2, the correlation analysis indicated weak to moderate correlation in controls and MCI-nonAD patients (r = 0.465, p = 0.001 and 0.325, 0.043, respectively), but not in MCI-AD and dementia-AD patients (r = 0.080, p = 0.490 and 0.065, 0.632, respectively). Since no strong association between these two biomarkers was detected, they were both included in the following steps of the analysis even though sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 levels were not found to differ between the diagnostic groups.\nIn Table 2 , the estimates and the summary statistics for the regression models are presented. Both models give an overall significant improvement over the intercept-only model (p values < 0.001, likelihood ratio tests) and make predictions similar to the actual data (p values > 0.999, Pearson goodness-of-fit). The Nagelkerke pseudo-R 2 , being higher than 71% for both models, indicates an acceptable quality of the regression models. While the Nagelkerke pseudo-R 2 of the model which included FDG PET data is 73.7%, the model which included BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 concentration yields the best proportion of correct classification."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study is in accordance with current biomarker-underpinned diagnostic guidelines for AD [2, 36] which approach AD as a clinicobiological entity. The observations of the study clearly point to significantly higher BACE1 activities in patients with MCI-AD compared to both controls and MCI-nonAD. The presence of AD pathology in MCI as indicated by abnormal routine CSF biomarkers pertains to higher BACE1 activity. However, BACE1 activity does not seem to differentiate between dementia-AD patients and either MCI-nonAD patients or controls, which casts doubt on the clinical utility of this biomarker candidate. Even though the difference did not attain statistical significance, BACE1 activity was found to be lower in dementia-AD patients than in MCI-AD patients in line with a previous report [15] . Possible explanations include the higher loss of neuronal cells in more advanced disease stages, an increase in CSF volume because of more intense brain atrophy or alternatively, a higher burden of neuroinflammation and/or cerebrovascular alterations in dementia-AD compared to MCI-AD [37] [38] [39] . Before final conclusions on the clinical utility of BACE1 activity can be drawn, further studies including individuals with preclinical AD and patients with dementia due to other etiologies and studies with larger cohorts and with a longitudinal design are necessary for an in-depth investigation of the potential of BACE1 activity as an AD biomarker candidate.\nThe potential utility of BACE1 activity as AD biomarker candidate is reflected in the findings of the regression analyses. In a head-to-head comparison, BACE1 activity was not shown to be inferior to FDG PET, being an established AD imaging marker, in contributing to correct diagnostic categorization. However, neither BACE1 activity nor FDG PET alone or in interaction with MMSE score significantly affected the classification of study participants. Of note, FDG PET in MCI-AD was unexpectedly not found to be lower in comparison to MCInonAD [9, 10] . Thus, it could be speculated that our analyses may have been biased not only by the relatively small sample size, but also by the employed FDG PET data analysis, which relied on automated techniques even though it has been recently shown that visual analysis of FDG PET by experts is superior to automated analyses [40] .\nThe levels of sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 did not differ between the studied groups. Despite the detected differences in BACE1 activity and A\u03b2 42 levels, the presence of AD pathology as mirrored by abnormal routine CSF biomarkers, is not associated with significantly altered CSF concentrations of sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 either in MCI or dementia. Interestingly, BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 levels correlated only in controls and MCI-nonAD patients and not in MCI-AD and dementia-AD patients. This discrepancy could be related to the fact that the pathogenesis of sporadic AD does not exclusively rely on increased BACE1 activity, but embodies the result of a complex interplay between clearance across the blood-brain barrier, plaque formation, proteolysis, and brain atrophy [41] [42] [43] . Thus, the presence of AD pathology seems to pertain to a dissociation between CSF BACE1 activity and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2.\nAPOE contribution to correct diagnostic classification seems to have been masked by the consideration of APOE interaction covariates in the regression models. Unexpectedly, the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele was not found to contribute significantly to the prediction of the diagnostic status of participants, despite the fact that it is the most important genetic factor of sporadic AD [44] . This finding could be attributed to the inclusion of APOE interaction factors in the models, which has possibly resulted in an attenuation of the impact of APOE as one of the main predictive covariates. Indeed, the findings of regression models with no interaction covariates and either CSF markers or FDG PET point to a significant impact of APOE (in both cases p < 0.001, data not shown). Of note, the Nagelkerke pseudo-R 2 values and percentages of correct classification of the alternative models were lower in comparison to the models with the interaction factors.\nThe present study should be viewed in the light of the relatively small sample size, recruited at specialized research centers, so that the findings are not generalizable to the wider population of interest. Moreover, biomarker-based diagnoses are not always confirmed by postmortem brain tissue autopsy results [45, 46] . Furthermore, we have not included data of amyloid imaging in the analyses, despite its high utility in detecting A\u03b2 pathology early in the course of AD [47] . Nevertheless, taking into account the role of CSF A\u03b2 42 in the inclusionary/exclusionary criteria of the present study and its relatively high agreement with amyloid imaging with regard to indication of AD pathology [48, 49] , amyloid imaging could not have been treated as an independent marker in our comparison analyses. In addition, even though the regression models included both biological markers and MMSE scores in line with the current clinicobiological conceptualization of AD, it should be underscored that MMSE is an instrument of limited utility in assessing cognitive performance, especially in detecting mild cognitive deficits [50, 51] . Nonetheless, the aim of the regression analyses was to compare BACE1 activity with the established AD biomarker FDG PET and not to seek the most efficient combination of predictive factors.\nTo summarize, the key conclusion emerging from our results is that it is worth to keep investigating the potential of BACE1 activity as AD biomarker candidate in MCI within the framework of the clinicobiological conceptualization of the disease."}]
