Memantine was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the indication of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer disease."}, {"section_title": "The Cholinergic Hypothesis and Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "text": "The use of cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer disease is based on the cholinergic hypothesis of memory impairment. 1, 2 The hypothesis implies that cholinergic deficits are responsible for cognitive and behavioral changes in patients with dementia and age-related memory impairment and, further, that pharmacologic augmentation of central cholinergic function will improve cognitive function. The cholinergic hypothesis is supported by observations of marked decline of the cholinergic corticobasal projections, loss of cholinergic cell bodies in the nucleus basalis, and reduced choline acetyltransferase activity, which is needed for acetylcholine synthesis. Further support for the hypothesis includes correlations between the above cholinergic deficits and neuritic, amyloid-\" (A\") peptideYcontaining plaques and decline in cognitive test performance.\nHistorically, the targeted cholinergic treatment approaches have included (1) using acetylcholine precursors with the expectation that more acetylcholine will be produced; (2) using direct cholinergic agonists to mimic and replace the effects of acetylcholine; and (3) using cholinesterase inhibitors to inhibit the enzyme-induced metabolism of intrasynaptic acetylcholine. The first two approaches, using several different drugs, have shown no significant or meaningful clinical effects. 3 In addition, barriers to the successful development of muscarinic agonists include the difficulty in finding a drug with clear M 1 subtype agonismVnot affecting other muscarinic receptor subtypesVand with few adverse effects. 4 Tacrine. Tacrine is very rarelyVif at allVused and is not actively marketed as it requires administration 4 times per day, a complicated four-step dose titration, and is associated with reversible direct hepatotoxicity requiring regular monitoring of serum transaminases. It is historically important as the first drug approved for Alzheimer disease, setting the roadmap for Alzheimer drug development, but will not be discussed further.\nDonepezil. Donepezil is a longacting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Two phase 3 clinical trials showed evidence of efficacy for FDA approval. Additional randomized clinical trials were completed and include trials of 6 and 12 months' duration and in severely impaired and nursing home patients, as reviewed in a Cochrane review. 5 One nonYindustry-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled trial followed patients over several years and reported modest cognitive effects over 2 years but no significant effects on loss of function, nursing home placement, or health economic measures. 6 Pharmacokinetics and drug interactions. Oral bioavailability approaches 100%, with peak concentration occurring in 3 to 4 hours (T max ). It is both metabolized extensively in the liver and excreted unchanged in the urine. Donepezil has a long elimination halflife of 70 hours, and steady state occurs in approximately 2 weeks. A 23-mg extended-release formulation has been marketed, indicated for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease who have been maintained on 10 mg/d and who might benefit from an increased dose. This formulation's T max is approximately 8 hours, with peak plasma concentrations about twice as high compared to the 10 mg/d dose.\nRivastigmine. Rivastigmine is a pseudoirreversible cholinesterase inhibitor that is selective for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. In the two published trials showing efficacy, doses were titrated weekly over 7 weeks to one of two dosage ranges, 1 mg/d to 4 mg/d or 6 mg/d to 12 mg/d, and dose decreases were not permitted, possibly contributing to less tolerability and seemingly more side effects. 7, 8 A transdermal patch formulation has been marketed based on a placebocontrolled study comparing a 17.4-mg patch, 9.5-mg patch, and 6 mg of orally administered rivastigmine twice per day in 1195 patients with moderately severe Alzheimer disease (ie, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] scores of 10 to 20) over 6 months. All formulations showed efficacy, but fewer adverse events occurred with the patch formulations. 9"}, {"section_title": "KEY POINTS", "text": "h The cholinergic hypothesis of memory impairment implies that cholinergic deficits are responsible for cognitive and behavioral changes in patients with dementia and age-related memory impairment, and that augmentation of central cholinergic function will improve cognitive function.\nh Historically, the targeted cholinergic treatment approaches have included using (1) acetylcholine precursors; (2) direct cholinergic agonists; and (3) cholinesterase inhibitors.\nPharmacokinetics and drug interactions. Rivastigmine has little protein binding and is well absorbed. Although the elimination half-life is less than 2 hours, enzyme inhibition lasts about 9 hours. The drug is not metabolized by the liver. It is slowly hydrolyzed and then excreted by the kidneys. The pharmacokinetics of the transdermal patch shows maximum concentration in 8 to 16 hours and a 3-hour elimination halflife after the patch is removed. Its extrahepatic metabolism makes it unlikely to have significant pharmacokinetic interactions.\nGalantamine. Galantamine is a reversible competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with relatively less butyrylcholinesterase inhibition compared to rivastigmine. Competitive inhibitors potentially are less active in brain areas that have remaining high acetylcholine levels and more active in other areas. Galantamine also functions as an allosteric modulator of nicotinic receptors, possibly enhancing cholinergic transmission by presynaptic nicotinic stimulation.\nEfficacy of galantamine has been demonstrated at doses of 8 mg twice a day and 16 mg twice a day, with fewer adverse effects at the lower dose, in at least four randomized trials of 3 and 6 months' duration. A Cochrane review concluded that galantamine shows consistent positive effects of 3 to 6 months' durationVwith no additional improvement with doses over 16 mg/dVand that the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events is similar to other cholinesterase inhibitors. 10 Pharmacokinetics and drug interactions. Galantamine is well absorbed with approximately 90% bioavailability. Peak concentrations occur in approximately 1 hour. The half-life of the compound is approximately 7 hours. A sustained-release form is also available. It is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine. Galantamine does not inhibit CYP 2D6 or 3A4 and has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs; however, inhibitors of CYP 2D6 or 3A4, such as paroxetine and ketoconazole, respectively, may decrease clearance and increase the bioavailability and plasma levels of galantamine. Some other CYP 2D6 inhibitors include amitriptyline, fluoxetine, and quinidine.\nAdverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors. The most common adverse events due to cholinesterase inhibitors are cholinergically mediated and include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss ( Table 2-1) . Muscle cramps are common with donepezil. Early cholinergic effects are frequently related to the initial dosing and titration of the medications. Reducing the dose temporarily and retitrating may reduce the reemergence of acute cholinergic adverse events. Many patients tend to become tolerant to the adverse events. Weight loss, fatigue, and anorexia may occur over time and be tolerated by patients and family and, hence, may not be recognized as adverse events induced by cholinesterase inhibitors. Few trials have directly compared cholinesterase inhibitors with respect to adverse events. 3 More adverse events are observed, however, with 23 mg/d donepezil than with 10 mg/d of donepezil in a direct comparison, with many patients experiencing nausea and vomiting, 11 and fewer adverse events are seen with transdermal rivastigmine compared to orally administered rivastigmine.\nAnorexia varies in incidence from 8% to 25% at higher doses of cholinesterase inhibitors compared with 3% to 10% in patients on placebo and may be dose related. Similarly, the proportion of patients with weight loss in clinical trials (ie, losing greater than 7% of their weight) ranges from 10% to 24% in patients taking higher doses compared to 2% to 10% of patients treated with placebo.\nGeneral precautions, listed in the prescribing information for the drugs, should be considered when using cholinesterase inhibitors. These include increased gastric acid secretion; increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in patients concurrently using antiinflammatories; sinus bradycardia, especially in patients with sick sinus and other supraventricular conduction delays; exacerbation of obstructive pul-monary disease and asthma; urinary outflow obstruction; and risk of seizures. Bradycardia may lead to syncope, falls, and injury. Finally, cholinesterase inhibitors may prolong the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants.\nh Only three of 14 trials showed significant effects for cholinesterase inhibitors improving behavior; none of these effects was large. Trivial effects were reported in the more mildly cognitively impaired patients, but no effect was reported in the more severely impaired.\nh Regulatory criteria for marketing symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies require demonstrating improvements in cognition and activities of daily living, overall improvements compared to placebo, and adequate safety.\nCholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and small molecules that are considered to have symptomatic effects are tested over 6 months. Drugs in development that are considered as modifiers of illness progression have been tested generally in more mildly impaired patients and over 18 months.\nh The gist of the amyloid cascade hypothesis is that amyloid-\" deposition drives tau phosphorylation, tangle formation, and neuron death.\nh There are several amyloid-\"Ytargeted experimental approaches, including modulation of amyloid-\" production, inhibition of amyloid-\" aggregation, enhancement of amyloid-\" degradation, and use of passive and active immunization to raise antibodies that target and remove amyloid-\".\nAnti-tau therapeutic strategies. The range of therapeutic approaches under development include inhibiting tau kinases; enhancing phosphatase activity in an effort to enhance microtubule stability; blocking or inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation, tau aggregates, and filament formation; and enhancing clearance of aggregates with drugs or antibodies. A few of these approaches have progressed from preclinical to phase 2 clinical trials. 79, 80 Tau pathology is not specific to Alzheimer disease, however, and occurs in several other disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy; any ''anti-tau'' approach could be considered for any of the tauopathies."}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Safety of Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "text": "The long-term safety of cholinesterase inhibitors has not been systematically studied.

Overall, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors involves balancing the modest expectations for benefit with the potential for adverse effects due to the drugs, and considerable clinical judgment."}, {"section_title": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors for Severe Alzheimer Disease", "text": "Donepezil is the only cholinesterase inhibitor specifically labeled for patients with severe Alzheimer disease (ie, with MMSE scores of 10 or less).

In the only clinical trial to document its efficacy, 1467 patients with Alzheimer disease with MMSE scores from 20 to 0 who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/d were randomized to 23 mg/d or to continue their 10 mg/d dose for 6 months. 11 A significant 2.2 mean drug-placebo difference on the SIB was not supported by efficacy on the clinician's global assessments, and dropouts were substantially greater with the higher dose compared to continuing the 10 mg dose, 30% versus 18%. A post hoc analysis indicated that the more severe patients showed a somewhat greater 3.1 effect on the SIB and significance on the global assessment of 0.09 points on a scale from 1 to 7. The 23-mg formulation was approved for marketing by the FDA despite recommendations for nonapproval by two FDA officers. A citizen watchdog group has expressed concern about the added risks of the higher dose and has sued the FDA for its removal.

A 13.3-mg (15 cm 2 ) patch was recently approved, allowing for a further increase after 4 weeks at the 9.5-mg dose. The maintenance doses are 4.6 mg/d, 9.5 mg/d, or 13.3 mg/d. Initial dosing for galantamine is 4 mg twice a day, raised to 8 mg twice a day after 4 weeks. The dose can be raised to 12 mg twice a day after another 4 weeks if patients are tolerating the medication but do not appear to be benefiting from it. The initial dose of the extendedrelease formulation is 8 mg/d, raised to 16 mg/d after 4 weeks, and can be increased to 24 mg/d based on tolerability and benefit. With all cholinesterase inhibitors, raising the dose too soon increases risks for cholinergic adverse events.\nCholinesterase Inhibitors for Mild Cognitive Impairment Cholinesterase inhibitors are not indicated for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), yet their use may be common practice, and nearly half of patients so diagnosed in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were receiving them. 15 The several randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cholinesterase inhibitors for MCI used the typical doses for Alzheimer disease, tended to be long-term (from 2 to 4 years), and the onset of Alzheimer dementia as main end points. Nevertheless, the two 2-year galantamine trials, 16 one 4-year rivastigmine trial, 17 and one over-3-year donepezil trial 18 were not positive on their primary outcomes and showed an excess in adverse events (summarized in at least three systematic reviews 10, 19, 20 ) . Uncertainty regarding definitions of MCI limit inferences that can be drawn from the outcomes of these trials as there were broad variations in cognitive impair-ment and progression to Alzheimer disease. The two galantamine trials, when combined, were particularly concerning for an excess in deaths associated with the drug. In some trials, nominally significant drug-placebo differences on the ADAS-Cog were observed at earlier time points during the first year. The effects were not sustained, however, and appeared more evident in the patients with more severe cognitive impairment and in APOE*E4 carriers."}, {"section_title": "MEMANTINE", "text": "Memantine was approved by the FDA in late 2003 for moderate to severe Alzheimer disease. It is characterized as a moderate-affinity, uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist; a rationale for its use is that it may protect against overstimulation of NMDA receptors that may occur in Alzheimer disease as well as consequent glutamate-and calciummediated neurotoxicity.\nThe basis for approval was positive outcomes on two 6-month-long placebocontrolled clinical trials. In one trial cholinesterase inhibitors were not allowed, 21 and in the other trial, all patients had been taking donepezil for at least 6 months (over 2 years on average) before being randomized to memantine or placebo. 22 A third moderate to severe Alzheimer disease trial did not show significant effects for memantine, however. 23 The trials were similar to the design of cholinesterase inhibitors trials but included only patients with MMSE scores less than 15Vhence the moderate to severe Alzheimer disease indicationV whereas mild to moderate Alzheimer disease trials are usually operationalized as MMSE 10 to 26, and for memantine as 10 to 22.\nThe SIB, a global assessment, and an activities of daily living (ADLs) inventory were primary outcome measures. The SIB is used as the cognitive outcome measure instead of the ADAS-Cog because the patients are too severely impaired to perform on the latter. Although the outcomes are different, the standardized statistical magnitudes of benefit from memantine in two of the three moderate to severe Alzheimer disease trials is similar to modest effect sizes seen in cholinesterase inhibitors trials with patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.\nIt is important to note that only one of three trials of memantine in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease that were of similar design to cholinesterase inhibitor trials showed statistically significant improvement on the ADAS-Cog and global assessment. 24 Two others did not show significant drug-placebo differences, 25Y27 and in pooled analyses did not show efficacy for mild Alzheimer disease. 28 Hence, memantine has not been approved by the FDA for patients with mild Alzheimer disease. 28 A once-per-day 28-mg sustainedrelease formulation was approved by the FDA in 2010 but has not yet been marketed. The basis for FDA approval was a 6-month, placebo-controlled, Alzheimer disease trial involving 677 patients with MMSE scores between 3 and 12 (completed in 2010 but unpublished), in which there were statistically significant effects favoring sustainedrelease memantine on the SIB and global assessment but not on ADLs.

Memantine could be viewed as a modulator of glutamatergic activity. As this hypothesized mechanism is apparently neuroprotective, it is not clear what exactly is involved in memantine's short-term and symptomatic effect in 6-month trials.

Some clinicians, however, start memantine along with or very soon after a cholinesterase inhibitor, an off-label use. Its duration of effectiveness is not known beyond the 6-month length of the clinical trials; however, it tends to be prescribed for indefinite periods. Some open-label observations from clinic cohorts have suggested that therapy with a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine together may ameliorate the course of Alzheimer disease, 31, 32 while observations from clinical trial extensions and ADNI suggest that any effects may wane over 6 to 12 months of treatment. 15, 33, 34 The practical issue of how long to treat is particularly challenging in patients with severe dementia and poor quality of life, especially when the clinician is uncertain as to whether or not an individual patient is benefiting."}, {"section_title": "CEREBROLYSIN AND GINKGO BILOBA", "text": "Cerebrolysin and Ginkgo biloba standardized extract are mentioned because they are licensed or on medication formularies of many countries (not the United States).

This controversy is played out between two positions: either that the drugs are effective and should be considered the standard of care for Alzheimer disease, or that they are ineffective and not worthwhile in terms of cost and adversity. Hence, the overarching controversy is whether or not their use yields clinically meaningful or therapeutically useful outcomes, and for whom. As examples, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) stated that ''treatment of dementia with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can result in statistically significant but clinically marginal improvement in measures of cognition and global assessment of dementia.'' 47 The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and a health assessment group initially concluded in 2006 that the cholinesterase inhibitors can delay cognitive impairment for 6 months, 48 but that they are not cost-effective. 49 Additional concerns raised included the fact that the real impact of treatment is difficult to assess because of the limited methodologic quality of the trials, a lack of generalizability, the fact that patients with medical comorbidities were not included in the trials, and that the mean scores are difficult to interpret. 48 NICE is less restrictive, however, in their revised opinion.\nPharmaceutical advertising campaigns, some of which have resulted in FDA warnings for overstating efficacy, have contributed to the perception of effectiveness that influences both physicians and caregivers. 50, 51 Efficacy Versus Effectiveness The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors is illustrated and discussed in Figure 2 -2. 52 Despite trends showing clear statistical significance, it can be seen that there is substantial overlap in outcomes between drug and placebo patients. Even the patients who improve to the greatest extent on the ADAS-Cog are still in the moderately severe dementia range. This illustrates the meaning of the ''small'' or ''modest'' cognitive effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and makes inferences about this effect, indicating improved health outcomes, difficult.\nIt is difficult to identify the individual patient who benefits from cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine because the outcome measures and mean changes on scale scores do not identify responders. Further, most trials have not taken caregiver views into account, although one that did shows that important aspects of the treatment response are missed by current measures. 53 "}, {"section_title": "Duration of Treatment", "text": "Placebo-controlled clinical trials with marketed cholinesterase inhibitors generally have lasted 6 months, with a few exceptions lasting up to 12 months or longer. Inferences are made that if the drugs are effective over this period then they will continue to be beneficial far longer, perhaps indefinitely. Over the long term, however, as patients inevitably worsen, it becomes even more difficult to determine whether any given individual is benefiting from the drugs. In some 3-month-long and 6-monthlong trials, after medication has been discontinued patients on average return to the cognitive level of the patients contemporaneously treated with placebo within 6 weeks. Such findings are taken to indicate that the drugs have overall symptomatic effects and that continuous use is required to maintain benefits.\nSome observational studies using clinic databases or open-label extensions of clinical trials suggest that patients who continue cholinesterase inhibitors over at least 1 year have a delay in nursing-home placement compared to those who cannot tolerate or do not take them, and that the addition of memantine could further contribute to the delay. 31, 32, 54, 55 These observations, however, are not controlled and are subject to the potential bias that patients who experience a lessprogressive course continue their medications, while patients who are destined to progress more quickly do not continue, resulting in apparent therapeutic effects that are illusory. Moreover, comparisons are made between cohorts from time periods both before and after the ready availability of the cholinesterase inhibitors. 56 These observational studies, however, contrast with the long-term controlled trials in MCI and with observations from the ADNI 15 and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle datasets, 57 where the use of cholinesterase inhibitors over the long term is associated with faster decline.

This effect was evident in a clinical trial in which donepezil was stopped after a fixed period of 12 weeks and patients were then randomized to continuing drug or to placebo 58 as well as when patients were discontinued from some 6-month trials. Yet worsening of behavior and confusion do not appear common when the drugs are stopped in clinical practice, as is frequently done. In clinical practice only 19% to 23% of patients continued to take donepezil or rivastigmine for more than 1 year, and about one-third discontinued the drugs within 2 months. 59 Tapering and withdrawal of donepezil after maintenance treatment for an average of 2 to 3 years was formally tested in a randomized controlled trial of severely impaired patients with Alzheimer disease; continuing donepezil was compared with discontinuing it, and, simultaneously, starting memantine was compared with not starting it. 60 Over the 1-year follow-up period, continuing donepezil was associated with better cognitive scores and ADLs, and adding memantine when donepezil was discontinued was better than not adding it. Many patients, however, discontinued donepezil without difficulty; notably, only half of the patients who were assigned to continue donepezil actually continued treatment beyond the 1-year follow-up, suggesting that many patients perceived that continuing donepezil, at least under doubleblinded conditions, was not effective. Thus, the outcomes support decisions either to continue medication or to taper and discontinue it when physicians are uncertain of continuing benefit. 61 This trial also did not support the typical use for memantine as an add-on to donepezil, showing that the add-on was not better than continuing donepezil alone, a finding that adds to the controversy of whether the drugs taken together are better than either alone. It is generally good practice to taper these medications before discontinuing, even KEY POINTS h Discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitors has been associated with worsening of cognition and confusion in some patients in trials. Yet worsening of behavior and confusion do not appear common when the drugs are stopped in clinical practice. In clinical practice, 19% to 23% of patients continued to take donepezil or rivastigmine for more than 1 year, and about one-third discontinued the drugs within 2 months.\nh In a withdrawal trial after maintenance treatment with donepezil for 2 to 3 years in severely impaired patients with Alzheimer disease, continuing donepezil was associated with better cognitive scores and activities of daily living. Many patients discontinued donepezil without difficulty, and only half of the patients assigned to continue donepezil actually continued treatment beyond the 1-year follow-up. Thus, the outcomes support decisions either to continue medication or to taper and discontinue it when physicians are uncertain of continuing benefit. though both donepezil and memantine have long terminal half-lives."}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness for Treatment of Disruptive Behaviors", "text": "The evidence base for advocating cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for treating disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer disease consists of post hoc analyses of individual items on behavior rating scales from randomized trials. In a summary analysis of 14 cholinesterase inhibitor trials that assessed effects on behavior in post hoc analyses, only three showed significant effects for improving behavior 62 ; none of these effects was large. 13 Another meta-analysis reported significant but trivial effects on behavior in the more mildly cognitively impaired patients, but no effect in the more severely impaired. 63 The fact that patients were not chosen for having behavior problems and their symptom ratings were rather low at baseline limits reasonable inferences about clinical efficacy.\nOne randomized placebo-controlled trial prospectively assessed donepezil's efficacy for improving behavior in patients who had clinically important agitation and did not find an effect for donepezil over placebo, which itself had a moderate effect. 64 Of considerable importance was that donepezil did improve cognitive function in this trial, suggesting that the effects on cognition do not necessarily affect behavior. A similarly designed randomized controlled trial, but with memantine, did not demonstrate its efficacy at improving behavior, either. 65 As many patients with disruptive behaviors are treated with both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, the opportunities to use the drugs specifically to treat agitation and disruptive behavior are limited, however. Finally, a clinician would want to be sure that the cholinesterase inhibitor is not ex-acerbating restlessness, agitation, or sleeplessness."}, {"section_title": "OVERVIEW OF ALZHEIMER DISEASE DRUGS IN DEVELOPMENT", "text": "Not for the want of trying over the past 2 decades, and despite substantial progress in understanding pathogenetic processes associated with Alzheimer disease, no new practical treatments have been developed.

The many drugs under development can be grouped into approaches directed at A\" and tau proteins; at neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms; and at various neuroreceptors.

Hyperphosphorylation of tau might disrupt microtubules and axonal transport and lead to the formation of soluble tau aggregates and insoluble paired helical filaments, and could contribute to neurodegeneration.\nA current hypothesis is that Alzheimer pathology starts as pretangles in proximal axons of the noradrenergic locus ceruleus that spreads by neuronto-neuron and trans-synaptic transport of tau aggregates to the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and neocortex. 78 This prionlike, protein-templating crossneuronal propagation hypothesis suggests several interventions aimed at tau and also small-molecule interventions targeted toward midbrain monoaminergic systems."}, {"section_title": "Other Approaches and Small Molecules", "text": "Most of the ''small molecules'' approaches target neurotransmitter receptors.

It is possible that newer approaches to prevention trials, earlier interventions, interventions aimed at particular clinical and biological subtypes of Alzheimer disease, and smaller phase 2a trials to gain early signals of potential efficacy may be helpful.
