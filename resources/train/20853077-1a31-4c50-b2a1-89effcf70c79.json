[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Currently, the world has been experiencing a newly emerged pandemic causing outbreaks and global catastrophes Li and De Clercq, 2020; Malik et al., 2020) . The etiological agent of this pandemic is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while the disease has named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) . The virus causes a severe form of respiratory illness, including pneumonia, fever, diarrhea, breathing difficulty, lack of smell/test, and lung dysfunctions with 4.5% of global mortality rate (Adhikari et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Syal, 2020) . As of April 25, 2020, COVID-19 has attributed with a total of 2,832,441 confirmed cases and has claimed 197,342 lives worldwide (https://worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Apart from the casualties, another primary concern is to deal with the ongoing global socio-economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Gangopadhyaya and Garrett, 2020; Joo et al., 2019) . By considering the spread and severity of COVID-19 with the alarming levels of global loss, the world health organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 situation as a pandemic and announced an event called public health .

The rate of severity and recovery from the COVID-19 is involved with the age, biological sex, and other health conditions of the infected patients (Syal, 2020) . For instance, the majority of the COVID-19 patients are male (54.3%), while the fatality is more frequent (15%) in older age groups (above 80 years old) than in the younger population (Syal, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Furthermore, asymptomatic patients may play a critical role in the transmission process (Shen et al., 2020) . Moreover, studies suggest that various comorbidities (i.e., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease) might influence the COVID-19 progression (Chan et al., 2020; Heymann and Shindo, 2020; .\nScientists are actively trying to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as its pathogenic nature to develop an efficient antiviral drug or vaccine (Amanat and Krammer, 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Syal, 2020) . To date, however, no antiviral drugs or vaccines have found to be effective against SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 (Cascella et al., 2020; .\nFor now, therefore, our best interest lies in subduing the symptoms/complications with available medications and controlling the viral spread through different control measures at national and global scales (Cascella et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020) . In response to COVID-19, many countries have already taken such initiative such as epicenter lockdown, identifying the carrier and patients, maintaining social distances, restriction on visa and traveling, limiting public gathering, extending medical facilities, and so on (Bedford et al., 2020; Raoult et al., 2020) .\nHowever, the costs of these measures for a prolonged period would be very high, resulting in an unparalleled socio-economic loss in the history of humanity. According to UNDP, the estimated revenue loss for developing countries would be at least US$220 billion (https://.covid19detectprotect.org/). Besides, domestic violence and other psychological disorders may have increased due to the prolonged period of quarantine (van Gelder et al., 2020) .\nHowever, the actual consequences of COVID-19 remain to observed. Alternatively, some scientists also suggested developing herd immunity, an epidemiological term describing a sufficient number of immune individuals, through mass infection/vaccination (Horton, 2020) . In support, some pointed out that social isolation/disconnection could heighten the risk of .

In their opinion, developing herd immunity without vaccination will result in a catastrophic outcome since the infections cover ~70% of all populations with a 0.25-3% case fatality rate (Kwok et al., 2020) .\nMoreover, acquiring herd immunity will not be effective against SARS-CoV-2 due to the continuous evolution of its genome . Therefore, it is high time to evaluate the effectiveness of the preventive measure in containing the situation and to value if they evaluate outweigh the costs involved. To the best of our knowledge, however, no such studies have not done yet.\nIn this study, we used different statistical methods to understand the relationships between the control measures and the country-wise infection index. Besides, the association of different comorbidities with the severity of the COVID-19 disease also evaluated in this limited scope.\nBased on our findings, we might find the crucial factors in containing the situation more rationally, and we will be suggesting the law enforcement personnel and policymakers accordingly. Moreover, this study will be able to shed light on the essential aspects that if specific comorbidities could have worsened the severity of COVID-19 and vice-versa.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 13, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096255 doi: medRxiv preprint 5 | P a g e nurses, and hospital beds have obtained from the Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/). Furthermore, we evaluated the association of life expectancy, number of physicians, nurses, and hospital beds with the COVID-19 case fatality rate. Later on, the non-linear relationships between COVID-19 case fatality rate and health care resources have been measured with their respective adjusted p-value using nlcor R-package (Ranjan, 2020) . Moreover, we assessed the correlation of fatal diseases with the progression of COVID-19 complications by using prevalence and death rates in several prevalent diseases and risk factors and COVID-19. In this case, the data regarding country-wise disease death rates and life expectancy were collected from World Life Expectancy (https://worldlifeexpectancy.com/) while prevalence rates and smokingrelated statistics obtained from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/).

Though few countries like Iran, Turkey, Switzerland, and Peru take abrupt action to limit public gathering, deferring in other health provision care, make their situation worse than others. Additionally, reliable decisions identically military deployment, partial lockdown, and curfew to limit public gathering have implemented latterly by most of the country, excluding Russia, Iran, and Turkey. Our findings also suggest that the scientific education-based public awareness, intense health care systems preparation, limitation of large-scale public gathering, isolation, social distancing, testing, lockdown, and other preventive measures to prevent the pandemic. These findings supported by several studies those were applicable for the previous epidemic (Bedford et al., 2020; CDC, 2020b CDC, , 2020a Kandel et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2020; Platform, 2020; Qualls et al., 2017; Xiao and Torok, 2020) .\nHowever, there is a scope of further study for identifying the real fact of spreading the disease in Iran as it takes almost every health care measure prior and immediately. On the contrary, the country with the least deaths and infections find their first infected person at minimum seventyfour days later than its origin at Wuhan, excluding Nepal. Almost all the countries found a colossal time to take immediate action and preventive measures for individuals. Most of them starting visa restriction, Administrative emergency, limit public gathering, isolation policy, and partial lockdown before the identification of the first case.\n.

Conversely, Nepal takes almost every preventive measure lately, but still, there is a shortage of COVID-19 patients, which may indicate the successful implication of testing policy as they have done the highest number of tests. Moreover, according to the taken steps of different countries, this study marks a few countries as in danger based on the analysis of the preventive measure of the top twenty burdening. Among the least affected countries Gambia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Namibia, and Nepal are in a state of danger as they have taken most of the preventive measures lately than others. Only a few health care preventive measures have taken before having first confirmed cases by the selected countries, where they could take precautionary measures more conveniently than others as they get enough time. Marked countries do not implement the testing policy correctly, and three of them even do not implement the full lockdown policy also, which indicates their chance to become a saddling country.\nFurthermore, a positive finding of our research is that almost every country starts its awareness campaign more swiftly as the first patient identified. However, still, they are in the peak of affected countries, which makes the robust validation of claiming the scientific evidence less public awareness, and a recent study (Xiao and Torok, 2020) also have similar findings.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 13, 2020. In a recent study, Ji et al. (2020) reported that the COVID-19 mortality correlates with the health care resources in China; and they concluded that the insufficient health care resources increase the COVID-19 mortality (Ji et al., 2020) . In a previous study, Farahani et al. (2016) showed the association between the number of doctors, hospital beds, and nurses and midwives with the outcome of HIV-infected patients. They revealed that death from HIV would reduce by 27%, 28%, and 9% if doctors could have double, nurses can increase from 20 to 25, and five hospital beds per 10,000 people, respectively (Farahani et al., 2016) . The shortage of the selected health system resources results in the delay of care and affects the quality of care that eventually leads to more critical patients and case fatality (Drayi, 2019).

These altogether may lead to an unusual scenario we observed in this study. However, breast cancer, leukemia, smoking, and lung cancer have found to affect the COVID-19 significantly (Figure 3 ). Most importantly, the observation was quite similar when analyzed with the country-wise prevalence of several diseases. For example, countries of highly prevalent diabetes, AIDS, tuberculosis, breast cancer, and smoking showed a lower amount of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 4 ). In the case of asthma, however, COVID-19 cases were higher in prevalent asthma countries, which are unlike the countries with higher death cases from asthma.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted . . https://doi.org/10.1101 13 | P a g e death rates from asthma, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes exhibited a significantly lower amount of COVID-19 cases, which is more interesting as well as violate the pre assumptions.

In most countries among the 20 profoundly affected countries, the visa restriction policy has employed after a couple of weeks of the first COVID-19 case report, except for Iran and Switzerland. Congruently, many of the countries showed their apathy to prioritize the screening in airport and border. In contrast, the starting of declaring a state of emergency has seen distinctly by the top burdening. Figure 1 shows that excluding the USA, Iran, and India, all the top burdening shows aloofness in the solidification of the public health structure. Among twenty top burdening USA, Italy, Iran, and Canada seem to take immediate action to stimulate emergency administrative structure afterward, the first confirmed cases of the epidemic compatibly. It is a scandalous finding that most of the top saddling countries introduce isolation and quarantine policies a minimum sixteen days later except few countries.

Those nations who have shown the apathy of taking immediate health care actions after the first identified case brand their circumstances more dreadful.

The evidence of the study also validates that the increasing number of doctors, hospital beds, and nurses will result in a decline in the number of deaths from COVID-19.
