[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract The cardiovascular response to ,-adrenergic stimulation is markedly blunted with advancing age, and this blunting may underlie some of the prominent age-associated changes in the hemodynamic profile during dynamic exercise. To examine this hypothesis, we administered the nonselective l3-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol (0.15 mg/kg IV) to 25 healthy normotensive men ages 28 to 72 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) immediately before maximal upright cycle ergometry with 9'Tc gated cardiac blood pool scintigraphy. Their hemodynamic responses to exercise were compared with those of 70 agematched healthy unmedicated male BLSA control subjects. The maximal cycle work rate achieved was similar in propranolol-treated men (158\u00b132 W) and control subjects (148\u00b132 W) and declined similarly with age in both groups. Hemodynamics at seated rest were not age-related in either group; however, propranolol-treated men had lower heart rates (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), ejection fraction, and cardiac index than control subjects but higher end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) "}, {"section_title": "", "text": "25 healthy normotensive men ages 28 to 72 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) immediately before maximal upright cycle ergometry with 9'Tc gated cardiac blood pool scintigraphy.

Pharmacological blockade of the ,-adrenergic receptors offers one approach toward evaluation of the specific role of this system on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise. In the present study, we investigated the effect of age on the importance of (-adrenergic stimulation during maximal upright cycle exercise in carefully screened healthy male volunteers by examining cardiovascular performance in the presence and absence of intravenous propranolol.

In 25 men, the contribution of ,f-adrenergic stimulation to exercise-induced changes in left ventricular performance was studied. These men received 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous propranolol over a 10-minute period before undergoing the rest and exercise gated blood pool study. The ability of this propranolol dose to produce ,3-blockade was confirmed in the first 10 subjects by demonstrating the absence of an increase in heart rate during a stepwise isoproterenol infusion up to a dose that had produced an increase of 25 to 30 beats per minute (BPM) in heart rate before propranolol administration. Control subjects underwent the identical protocol without drug infusion. Left ventricular volumes were determined by standard methods.12,22 Briefly, the end-diastolic count rate was obtained from a large, manually drawn region of interest and corrected for background activity with the use of a region of interest drawn lateral and inferior to the left ventricle in the endsystolic frame. Attenuation correction was determined individually in each subject by the use of an opposed static view to measure the attenuation distance from a chest wall marker to the count center of the left ventricle, assuming that the linear attenuation coefficient was equal to that of water. A blood sample was drawn at the end of exercise, counted with the same camera/collimator system used for the scintigraphic study, and corrected for time delay between the scintigram and the counting of the blood sample.

The relation between MWR and age is shown in Fig 1 for the two groups. Within each group, there was a significant decline in MWR with age; the slopes and intercepts were similar for the groups. Thus, acute 63-adrenergic blockade did not appear to significantly affect the physical work capacity of these untrained men. In the control group, SVI at maximal effort was not age related ( Fig 2D) . In propranolol-treated men, however, a significant decline in SVI with age was present. (r= -.50, P=.001). In these younger men, peak HR (P<.001) but not the drug group (propranolol versus control) was a significant independent determinant of EDVI by covariance analysis. However, in men older than 50 years, neither HR nor group assignment was related to EDVI.\nMaximal EF declined similarly with age in both control subjects and propranolol-treated men (Fig 4B) . Left ventricular contractility, as indexed by the peak SBP/ESVI ratio, declined significantly with age in the control subjects but not the propranolol group (Fig 4C) . By ANCOVA, the SBP/ESVI ratio across the age span was higher in the former group than the latter. SBP was unrelated to age in either the control or propranolol group at maximal effort ( Fig 5A) ; however, SBP was lower in the p-blocked men than in control subjects across the age span. DBP showed no relation either to age or treatment group. MBP followed a pattern similar to that of SBP. SWI, the product of SBP and SVI, increased with age in control subjects but declined with age in propranolol-treated men (Fig SC) , primarily reflecting the effect of the drug on SVI. TSVR at maximal effort increased similarly across age in both groups, as shown in Fig SB.

At 50% of maximal effort (81.1+18.3 W in control subjects and 84.0\u00b117.5 W in propranolol-treated men, P=NS), the effect of acute ,1-blockade was very similar to that at maximal work rate ( Table 5 ). The only exceptions are CI and EF, which were lower in propranolol-treated men across age, whereas there was no intergroup difference for these variables at maximal effort. At a common external load of 100 W (not shown), results were very similar to those at 50% of maximal effort; exceptions were a lower HR with propranolol across age and the lack of an intergroup difference in SVI at this work rate.\nThe hemodynamic response across fixed work rates from rest to 100 W in subjects above and below the median age of 50 years is depicted in Fig 6. Although HR is lower in both younger and older propranololtreated men than their respective control groups (Fig 6,  A and B) , the absolute intergroup differences appear somewhat larger in the younger men. Fig 6, C (Fig 6, E and F) ; however, older men given propranolol tended to have lower SVI than older control subjects. A similar but more pronounced age-drug interaction was observed for SWI (Fig 6, G and H), which was unaffected by propranolol in younger men from rest through 100 W but was lower in older propranolol-treated men than in older control subjects. This was due to a greater effect of propranolol on both SBP and SVI in older men. In both age groups, propranolol-treated men demonstrated lower SBP, EF, and CI responses and higher ESVI than their corresponding controls across these common external work rates."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Abundant experimental evidence has shown that the cardiovascular response to f3-adrenergic agonists is blunted with advancing age.1-10 In view of this blunted response to infused 3-adrenergic agonists, it has been hypothesized that the age-associated deficit in HR and the increase in left ventricular volumes and reduction in contractility index at maximal exercise are manifestations of an age-associated decrease in the efficacy of the cardiac sympathetic response during exercise stress. 16 Thus, we hypothesized that the responses to acute 13- Tables 2 and  3 for corresponding regression equations and covariance statistics.\nobserved in unblocked subjects. Propranolol reduced the anticipated age-associated decrease in HR and eliminated the age-associated increase in EDVI at peak effort; indeed, EDVI actually tended to decline with age in these men in contrast to the increase observed in control subjects. As a result, SVI at exhaustion declined significantly with age in propranolol-treated men, whereas it was not age related in control subjects. The specific reasons for these shifts in the age relations after , observed, although resting SBP declined by 7 mm Hg. Our findings of lower resting HR, SBP, EF, and CI and higher EDVI and ESVI in propranolol-treated men closely parallel those of the former study25 and were observed in both younger and older men. Because cardiac function at rest is primarily under parasympathetic control, the lack of any apparent differential age effect of propranolol on resting cardiac function is not surprising.\nTo our knowledge, only one prior investigation34 has examined the effect of age on the cardiovascular response to acute 83-adrenergic blockade during dynamic exercise. This study compared the hemodynamic response to upright cycle ergometry in 12 young (20 to 35 years) and 15 older (50 to 65 years) men and women before and after the administration of 0.12 mg/kg of intravenous propranolol. It was observed that propranolol reduced maximal HR and cardiac output similarly in both age groups while causing identical increases in Acute P-blockade lowered resting EF similarly across the age span due to an increase in ESVI. The resting SBP/ESVI ratio, ie, CTI, was also reduced in propranolol-treated subjects, regardless of age. Although at maximal effort propranolol reduced the SBP/ESVI ratio at all ages, the effect was greater in young subjects (Fig  4) . As a result, the age-associated decline in the CTI observed in control subjects was not significant in p-blocked men (Table 3) , suggesting a greater reduction of left ventricular contractility in younger than older individuals during intensive adrenergic stimulation. This differential age effect on the SBP/ESVI ratio was secondary to a larger ESVI in younger p-blocked men, paralleling their larger EDVI and SVI. Thus, not only maximal HR but also maximal myocardial contractile function appears to be blunted more by acute p-blockade in younger than in older individuals.\nAcross fixed external work rates through 100 W, propranolol-treated men had lower HR, SBP, EF, and CI responses but higher ESVI responses than control subjects across age, similar to resting findings. A noteworthy observation, however, was that younger men given propranolol showed 10 to 20 mL/m2 larger EDVI than their age-matched control subjects, whereas P-blockade had no apparent effect on EDVI in older men. Parallel age-drug interactions were seen across these fixed work rates for SVI and SWI, with no significant drug effect in younger men but a reduced SVI and SWI in older propranolol-treated men (Fig 6) "}]
