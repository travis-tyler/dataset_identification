It has even been hypothesized that AD might be 'type 3 diabetes' . The present review summarizes some of the evidence for the possible link, putative biochemical pathways and ongoing clinical trials of antidiabetic drugs in AD patients. The primary and review literature were searched for articles published in peer-reviewed sources that were related to a putative connection between T2DM and AD. In addition, public sources of clinical trials were searched for the relevant information regarding the testing of antidiabetic drugs in AD patients. The evidence for a connection between T2DM and AD is based upon a variety of diverse studies, but definitive biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. Additional study is needed to prove the existence or the extent of a link between T2DM and AD, but sufficient evidence exists to warrant further study. Presently, AD patients might benefit from treatment with pharmacotherapy currently used to treat T2DM and clinical trials of such therapy are currently underway."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both more prevalent with ageing, but it has generally been assumed that this is coincidental, not a reflection of co-morbidity. However, evidence suggests that patients with T2DM are at an increased risk of getting AD and that hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance -hallmarks of T2DM [1-3] -can lead to memory impairment. Animal models of T2DM have reduced insulin transport to the brain, reduced insulin uptake and reduced neuronal insulin [4] [5] [6] , consistent with reported reduced insulin levels, insulin receptor expression and insulin resistance in brains of AD patients [7] [8] [9] . Recently, Takeda et al. [10] reported studies in which they crossed two wellestablished mouse models of T2DM (viz. ob/ob and NSY mice) into an APP23 transgenic mouse background. They found that in both APP + -ob/ob and APP + -NSY mice, diabetes exacerbated cognitive dysfunction, which supports impairment in insulin signalling as a mechanistic link underlying these seemingly disparate disorders. From a clinical perspective, a link would suggest that currently available 'antidiabetic' drugs might be beneficial in treating AD patients. The present review summarizes the two disorders, the postulated common biochemical links, and the clinical trials of 'antidiabetic' drugs in AD."}, {"section_title": "Diabetes", "text": "It is estimated that almost 8% (24 million) of the US population has diabetes [11] . Another estimated 57 million or more have prediabetes, defined as an intermediate state of altered glucose metabolism (blood glucose between 110 and 126 mg dl -1 ), placing them at increased risk for diabetes [12] . Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a condition in which a high blood glucose level results from increased hepatic glucose production, impaired insulin production by pancreatic b-cells, impaired insulin release in response to hyperglycaemic stimuli or 'insulin resistance' (inadequate response to insulin by target cells).Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounts for about 90-95% of diagnosed cases of diabetes [13] . Inadequate glucose control leads to medical complications and, possibly through defective leptin signalling, includes effects on the central nervous system (CNS) [14, 15] . Although T2DM affects persons 60 years and older disproportionately, the number of cases in the younger population is on the rise [13] . Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a variety of risk factors (including a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, poor diet, obesity and physical inactivity [16] ) and affects men and women about equally [13] . Both genetics and lifestyle play significant roles [17] .\nAbout 60-70% of diabetics also exhibit mild to severe forms of nervous system damage [13] . This manifests as impaired sensation or pain in the feet or hands (diabetic neuropathy), slowed digestion of food in the stomach, carpal tunnel syndrome, erectile dysfunction and other peripheral nerve problems.Central nervous system complications can include stroke and possibly cognitive impairment [15] . Persistent blood glucose elevation contributes to atherosclerosis that impairs blood flow to the brain. Individuals with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (a test that indicates blood glucose levels over the previous 3 months) greater than 7% are nearly three times as likely to have a stroke compared with people who have an HbA1c level less than 5% [18] . Other CNS complications may result from changes in blood-brain barrier or transport functions of the cerebral microvasculature [19] . Such damage might be associated with vascular dementia. Studies also suggest that diabetics are at greater risk of depression than nondiabetics [15] , but the mechanistic link is not clear.

Some of these are highlighted below."}, {"section_title": "Insulin processing", "text": "Insulin (two peptidic chains joined by two disulfide bonds) is primarily secreted by b-cells of the pancreas and normally is released into the circulation through the portal vein in response to a rise in blood glucose. Insulindegrading enzyme (IDE) catalyses the catabolism of insulin in the liver, kidneys and muscles [45, 46] . It is generally agreed that insulin located within the brain is mostly of pancreatic origin, having passed through the blood-brain barrier, although there is debate about the amount that is produced de novo within the CNS [47] . Insulin has a significant function in the hypothalamus and probably other brain regions. Major known actions of insulin in the brain include control of food intake (via insulin receptors located in the olfactory bulb and thalamus) and effects on cognitive functions, including memory [48, 49] .\nPossible common or interactive processes in T2DM and AD have been reviewed [50] [51] [52] .Within brain, insulin binds to the a-subunit of the insulin receptor, activates tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of the b-subunit of the receptor, and leads to activation of several second-messenger transduction pathways. The neural Shc/MAP (Src homology collagen mitogen-activated protein) kinase pathway activates gene expression required for neuronal cell and synapse growth, maintenance and repair processes. It also serves as a modulator of hippocampal synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory [53] . Another pathway involves binding of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2) to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is necessary for synaptic plasticity and memory con- "}, {"section_title": "Insulin receptors", "text": "Insulin receptors located in the brain (InsRb) differ from insulin receptors found in the periphery (InsRp) in size (a-subunits are smaller in InsRb), glycosylation and insulinbinding specifics (absence of negative co-operativity in InsRb) [66] . The InsRb are widely and irregularly distributed throughout the CNS in distinct patterns, with higher concentrations in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and choroid plexus [67, 68] . The distribution of InsRb mRNA is similar [69] .\nAnother receptor from the same protein kinase receptor family is the structurally similar receptor for human insulin-like growth factor (IGF1R) "}, {"section_title": "ApoE-e4", "text": "Diabetes is not only characterized by insulin/glucose abnormalities, but also by dyslipidaemia [76] . As key players in lipid metabolism [77] , apolipoproteins are receiving growing attention for their involvement in T2DM [78] .\nOf particular interest in the area of AD is ApoE, owing to a well-established positive correlation between an increased risk and earlier onset of AD with expression of apoE-e4 isoform [79, 80] . Along with proteoglycans and serum amyloid, ApoE is a nonfibrillar component of cerebral and systemic amyloid deposits [79] . Compared with other ApoE isoforms, apoE-e4 displays an enhanced ability to deposit the neurotoxic Ab while simultaneously contributing to decreased clearance of plaque. While isomeric differences in the CNS have yet to be entirely elucidated, apoE-e4 exerts less protection against oxidative stress and contributes to cholinergic dysfunction in AD [80] . Furthermore, the lipid-binding capacity of ApoE, influenced by the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, may have implications in AD. Poor lipidation of ApoE, which can result from "}, {"section_title": "Amyloid and tau", "text": "Deposition of amyloid in brain and pancreatic islet cells represents a pathogenic similarity between AD and T2DM [84] . Pancreatic amyloid is produced in b-cells and is coreleased with insulin [85] . A study of transgenic mice found that excess accumulation of pancreatic amyloid leads to b-cell dysfunction, disruption in glucose homeostasis and T2DM [86] . In humans, on autopsy islet amyloid polypeptide and hyperphosphorylated tau were found in pancreatic islet cells of patients with T2DM [87] . An increased amount of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the hippocampus have been found on autopsy in patients with diabetes [88] .\nA community-based study investigated whether there is greater prevalence of pancreatic amyloid in patients with AD and greater prevalence of cerebral amyloid in patients with T2DM. Islet amyloid was more frequent and extensive in AD patients than in non-AD control subjects, but there was no increased frequency of brain amyloid in T2DM patients compared with non-diabetic control subjects. However, when cerebral amyloid was present, the extent of accumulation correlated with the duration of T2DM [89] .\nIt is well established that Ab results from cleavage of APP precursor by secretases (a, b, g) [90] . Senile plaques develop from the release and accumulation of Ab peptide [91] . The Ab interacts with signalling pathways that regulate the phosphorylation of the tau protein, leading to hyperphoshorylation of tau and aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons [92] . Tau phosphorylation in both AD and T2DM involves activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), which phosphorylates glycogen synthase in the rate-limiting step of glycogen biosynthesis [93] [94] [95] . Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is a crucial step in formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and therefore, GSK-3 inhibition could be a common target treatment of both AD and T2DM [96, 97] . Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is regulated by the PI3K pathway discussed in the section Insulin processing above.\nAnother potential link involves a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway [98] . JNK activity is induced in conditions of chronic hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, leading to oxidative stress and programmed cell death (apoptosis) of pancreatic b-cells [99] . Induction of the JNK pathway also leads to phosphorylation of c-Jun and tau found in brains of AD patients [100] [101] [102] . The protein JIP-1 [JNK-interacting protein 1; also known as 'islet brain 1' (IB1) protein because it is primarily expressed in brain and islet cells] is a key regulator of the JNK pathway [84] . Co-localization of JNK, IB1/JIP-1, hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid deposits in neurofibrillary tangles in the brain and pancreatic islets suggests another possible link between the pathogenesis of AD and T2DM [84] ."}, {"section_title": "Inflammation", "text": "Insulin resistance, a key aspect of T2DM, is associated with inflammation [45], specifically with elevated levels of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein and a-1-antichymotrypsin [103-105]. It is postulated that elevated levels of acute-phase inflammatory products are linked with immunological dysfunction, which leads to insulin resistance [106] .\nLikewise, there is evidence that AD is associated with inflammatory processes [107-109]. Inflammatory products accumulate at different rates in Alzheimer's patients compared with healthy control subjects [110] , the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is present in senile plaques of AD patients [111] , and elevated immunoreactivity to IL-6 is found in lumbar and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid in patients with AD [112] . At least two studies link C-reactive protein with an increased risk of AD [113, 114] . There are also reports of reduced incidence of AD in people who take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for chronic pain [115, 116] .\nInterestingly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARg) agonists, a class of antidiabetic drugs that reduce insulin resistance, appear to have antiinflammatory effects [117] . Such drugs should reduce the levels of IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators [45] and might be beneficial in treating or preventing AD."}, {"section_title": "Mitochondria and oxidative stress", "text": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play key roles in the pathogenesis of both AD and T2DM, and represent a possible link [118] . There is increased oxidative stress in T2DM, with reduced antioxidant capacity [119] , which has been suggested can lead to neuronal injury with mitochondria as specific targets [120] . In a rat model of T2DM, brain mitochondria display age-related impairment of the respiratory chain and an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation [121] , which is vital for ATP production. Since mitochondria provide about 90% of the ATP required for normal functioning of neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction results in neural degeneration and loss of metabolic control. As the CNS is heavily dependent upon ATP production, it is more susceptible than other systems [122, 123] . According to the 'mitochondrial cascade hypothesis' , the rate of accumulation of mitochondrial damage is deter-mined by the basal rate of production of reactive oxygen species by the electron transport chain, which in turn is determined by genetics. Oxidative changes in nucleic acids, lipids and mitochondrial proteins amplify production of reactive oxygen species and trigger cells to generate Ab, tau phosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles [124] ."}, {"section_title": "Obesity and metabolic syndrome", "text": "Obesity, especially central body obesity, is an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome, a disorder of dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and hypertension. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are important risk factors for the development of T2DM [125] . The following evidence suggests that there may also be a link with AD: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging found that men with weight gain between the ages of 30 and 45 years and women with a body mass index >30 at ages 30, 40 and 45 years had an increased incidence of AD [2, 126] ; a Swedish study found that AD risk increased by 36% for every 1.0 increase in body mass index at age 70 years [127] ; men and women with a midlife body mass index >30 kg m -2 have a greater risk for AD [33] ; and patients with AD have a significantly larger mean waist circumference, higher mean plasma concentration of triglycerides and glucose, and lower mean plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [128] .The significant role of leptin in regulating brain function might also be involved. As recently suggested by Han & Li [129] , the proposed link between T2DM and AD would be advanced by studying defective leptin signalling in the absence of perturbed insulin signalling [129] ."}, {"section_title": "Advanced glycation end-products", "text": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are created when reducing sugars react nonenzymatically with the amino groups of proteins and then undergo further reactions, such as rearrangement, dehydration and condensation, to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous derivatives [130] . Advanced glycation end-products were originally identified in 1912 as end-products of the Maillard reaction [131] . Advanced glycation end-products accumulate in various cells due to normal ageing, but the rate of accumulation is significantly elevated in DM [132, 133] . Increased formation of AGEs is also found in AD. However, extracellular accumulation of AGEs in AD is more likely to be caused by the accelerated oxidation of glycated proteins, e.g. by redox-active iron bound to proteins in amyloid plaques [134, 135] . Intracellular accumulation of AGEs in both AD and DM is caused by the presence of phosphates and reactive sugars, such as fructose. The metabolic consequences include oxidative stress, glucose hypometabolism and impaired cell function [135] . Advanced glycation end-products have been found in the CNS of diabetic patients, which could provide a mechanistic link [136] ."}, {"section_title": "Clinical trials of antidiabetic drugs in Alzheimer's patients", "text": "If there is, in fact, some biochemical link between T2DM and AD, then could it be possible that a drug currently approved for T2DM could also be useful for treating AD?

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g plays a role in multiple processes thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and AD, including inflammatory and metabolic processes, cell growth and differentiation [138] . Initially, the role of PPARg was explored through the class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones (in particular, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone). Their mechanism involves the stimulation of PPARg action in response to changes in insulin, thereby triggering a drop in serum glucose [139] . These drugs improve insulin resistance [45] , promote cholesterol homeostasis [140] and neuronal Ca 2+ homeostasis in hippocampus [141] , and reduce cerebral inflammation through inhibition of IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor [117] . Such actions are hypothesized to control the proliferation of b-amyloid peptide and improve cognitive function in AD patients [45] .\nWe found 12 studies (three pilot studies and nine clinical trials) that were designed to explore the potential benefits of PPARg agonists.Of the 12,three were terminated early and one is currently ongoing. The remaining eight studies were all placebo controlled (three open label, five double blind). Seven evaluated placebo vs. rosiglitazone 2, 4 and/or 8 mg (monotherapy or concomitant with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, frequently donepezil); one assessed cognitive efficacy of donepezil compared with rosiglitazone and placebo; and two evaluated pioglitazone 15-30 mg vs. placebo. The mean age range of patients across the eight studies was 50-90 years. Subjects with T2DM were only included in the three pilot studies. [145] demonstrate a positive correlation between insulin levels and cognitive improvement (increase in recall and lower error rate) at month 6 with rosiglitazone compared with placebo. Plasma Ab levels remained stable throughout rosiglitazone Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease treatment. Although Risner et al. [146] did not initially observe statistically significant differences between treatment groups, subgroup analysis revealed that improvement in cognitive function was related to ApoE genotype, in particular, to the apoE-e4 negative allele. Subsequent larger studies were unable to confirm such a connection, except for one study that reported a small potential benefit with rosiglitazone 2 mg and donepezil across all ApoE genotypes. However, two recent pilot studies [144, 147] agreed with the results of Watson et al. [145] . Sato et al. [144] reported that the pioglitazone cohort had an increase in regional cerebral blood flow in the right and left parietal lobe and some degree in the frontal lobe at month 6. The adverse effects most commonly noted in these studies were peripheral oedema with rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.\nIn summary, based on the eight studies reviewed, the use of thiazolidinediones might confer some therapeutic benefit as an adjunctive agent in select patients in the pre-initial to initial stages of AD, especially if AD is a consequence of insulin dysregulation and/or the patient has a prior medical condition of T2DM."}, {"section_title": "Intranasal insulin", "text": "Another therapeutic strategy is intranasal administration of insulin [148] . Insulin is able to enter the brain within a short time via transport across olfactory and trigeminal perivascular channels and axonal pathways [149] .Two randomized, placebo-controlled studies that explored the effects of intranasal insulin on memory in individuals with MCI or mild AD have been reported [150, 151] . Baseline characteristics were similar for the insulin group and placebo group with respect to age (mean range 60-80 years) and fasting glucose/insulin levels. Participants were either diagnosed with AD (NINCDS-ARDA criteria) or had amnestic MCI. In the study of Reger et al. [151] , participants were further subdivided based on ApoE genotype (apoE-e4 -/+ allele), and cognitive function was measured 45 min postadministration of treatment agent. The participants treated with intranasal insulin (20 IU twice daily) displayed greater improvement in memory and attention on day 21. Participants with apoE-e4 negative allele displayed significant improvement in story recall at both 20 and 40 IU doses compared with the saline group and apoE-e4 positive group. In the assessment for word list recall, patients in the apoE-e4 negative group taking 40 IU of insulin performed better than patients in other groups, while no significant difference was observed between insulin groups and between insulin and placebo in the parameters of attention and working memory. In the apoE-e4 positive group, cognitive function (working and verbal memory) was reduced with treatment. Plasma insulin levels were unchanged. Given what is known about AD and diabetes, it is not surprising that intranasal insulin could have different effects depending on the apoE-e4 genotype. Adverse effects were minor and included headache, nosebleed and nose soreness. Although the results reveal statistically and clinically significant differences between intranasal insulin vs. placebo, the studies were preliminary. They provide a direction for larger studies."}, {"section_title": "Metformin", "text": "Metformin (N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide) is an orally active biguanide that lowers blood glucose levels by suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Critical evaluation of some aspects of the cited studies reveals potential areas for further verification or elaboration. For example, because several of the changes in markers of insulin homeostasis occur increasingly in old age, AD as type 3 DM should be balanced within the ageing spectrum; Takeda et al. [10] suggest that the cognitive dysfunction noted in the T2DM \u00a5 APP cross mice was probably caused by cerebrovascular changes (this has implications for treatment where brain vascular lesions have to be considered); overall, studies have found little or no influence of T2DM on the progression of AD lesions, but as the recent work of Sonnen et al. [156] shows, increased risk of dementia or even AD (where there might be mixed pathology) is associated with microvascular pathology or small vessel disease rather than AD increased pathology (this would be relevant to future therapeutic approaches). Furthermore, while the epidemiological studies are quite convincing, the observations regarding decreases in insulin, insulin receptors and insulin/IGF-1 signalling in the AD brain are open to interpretation. For example, it is possible that the decrease is in fact protective and is reflective of what is occurring in the nerve cells that survive, consistent with recent results showing that decreases in insulin or IGF1 signalling in AD mice prolong lifespan, reduce Ab deposition and enhance cognitive function [157] [158] [159] . Likewise, several studies have noted a connection between diabetes and AD only in apoE-e4 negative individuals (e.g. [160] ) and that intranasal insulin transiently enhances cognitive function in normal individuals as well as AD patients [148] , suggesting that the effect is unrelated to the AD phenotype. Finally, safety concerns have arisen about the use of the PPARg agonist rosiglitazone for treating patients with diabetes (e.g. [161] ). In relation to this topic, rosiglitazone increases weight gain, and obesity is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and AD."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease have traditionally been thought to be independent disorders. However, the results of recent epidemiological and basic science investigation have suggested possible associations and some common pathophysiological mechanisms. If true, common pharmacotherapy should be effective. There are currently clinical trials testing the effectiveness of 'antidiabetic' drugs in AD patients. The results will not only be important for potential new pharmacotherapy for AD patients, but will also shed light on a connection between these otherwise seemingly disparate serious disorders."}]
