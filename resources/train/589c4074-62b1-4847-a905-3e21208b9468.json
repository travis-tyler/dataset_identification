Adolescence is a time that can set the course of alcohol abuse later in life. Sensitivity to reward on multiple levels is a major factor in this development. We examined 736 adolescents from the IMAGEN longitudinal study for alcohol drinking during early (mean age = 14.37) and again later (mean age = 16.45) adolescence. Conducting structural equation modeling we evaluated the contribution of reward-related personality traits, behavior, brain responses and candidate genes. Personality seems to be most important in explaining alcohol drinking in early adolescence. However, genetic variations in ANKK1 (rs1800497) and HOMER1 (rs7713917) play an equal role in predicting alcohol drinking two years later and are most important in predicting the increase in alcohol consumption. We hypothesize that the initiation of alcohol use may be driven more strongly by personality while the transition to increased alcohol use is more genetically influenced."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Adolescence is a phase with a high risk for first alcohol consumption and the transition to future alcohol abuse (e.g. Kim et al., 2011) . The risk for prospective development of alcohol abuse increases the younger adolescents are when having their first drink (e.g. Behrendt et al., 2009 ). This suggests that the early identification of risk factors and subsequent interventions could best prevent alcohol abuse. Several factors contribute to the initiation of alcohol use. One aspect is the social environment with family and peer factors strongly influencing substance use initiation (e.g. Oxford et al., 2001) . Besides these external factors, several individual aspects have been identified. Among them sensitivity to reward has been assumed to play a major role. In a previous study , we showed that neural responses to reward, reward-related personality traits, and rewardrelated behavioral data are correlated with alcohol consumption in early adolescence. This study suggested that personality correlates are more strongly related to alcohol drinking behavior than neural activation or behavior . However, in this study, we neither tested genetic effects nor modeled the development of alcohol drinking behavior over time. In the present study we therefore extended our previous findings using follow-up data assessed two years after the first study and we also analyzed the effects of candidate genetic variations in a considerably enlarged sample compared to our first study.\nReward processing associated with alcohol use can be examined using several individual interrelated traits including the levels of personality, behavior, brain responses, and genetic variations. Reward sensitivity on all these connected levels has been shown to be related to the initiation of drinking or the development of alcohol abuse. To build up on the model of our first study and thus determine the additional influence of genetic factors and changes in alcohol consumption over time, we used all previously examined variables, i.e. the variables representing reward-related personality traits, reward-related behavior, and brain responses to reward were the same as in our first study . Likewise, we used the total score of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993) as outcome variable to account for the fact that even lower levels of alcohol consumption during adolescence might indicate hazardous drinking (e.g. Chung et al., 2000) . For personality, sensation seeking, novelty seeking, impulsivity and extraversion are the most important components describing reward-related personality and have been found to be strongly associated with early initiation of hazardous alcohol use and as predictors for later alcohol abuse (e.g. Ayer et al., 2011; Cloninger, 1987; Hittner and Swickert, 2006) . On a behavioral level, risk taking has been related to increased alcohol use as well as impaired control over alcohol use (Leeman et al., 2012; MacPherson et al., 2010) . Here, the increased preference of a smaller immediate reward towards a larger delayed reward (de Wit, 2009) clearly shows its connection with reward sensitivity. An increased responsiveness in the brain reward system is also associated with reward sensitivity (Hahn et al., 2009 ) which makes the involved structures essential for the investigation of reward sensitivity in the context of alcohol consumption. The anterior cingulate cortex, the ventral pallidum, the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the dopaminergic midbrain neurons are key structures of this network, and the amygdala, thalamus, orbital prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are also involved in the regulation of reward (Haber and Knutson, 2010) . We analyzed brain responses to a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task (Knutson et al., 2001) . We included regions of interest in our analysis which have been shown to be associated with reward sensitivity during an MID task on the one hand and with alcohol consumption on the other hand. Hence, we included the striatum, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus, thalamus, insula, putamen, cerebellar vermis, and the prefrontal cortex which all met these criteria (Gilman et al., 2012; Haber and Knutson, 2010; Hahn et al., 2009; Nees et al., 2012; Oberlin et al., 2012) and have been shown to be valid predictors in our previous study .\nGenetic factors play an important role in the development of alcohol abuse and several genetic risk factors for alcoholism have been identified (e.g. Morozova et al., 2012) . Regarding our aim to establish a model on alcohol consumption specifically in the context of reward sensitivity, it has to be considered that reward sensitivity per se is also genetically influenced (Nees et al., 2013; Richter et al., 2013; Rietschel et al., 2010; Stacey et al., 2012) . This suggests that the appropriate genetic factors might also contribute to alcohol drinking behavior via modifying reward sensitivity. To determine the effects of various domains including genetic variations on any mental symptom, specific hypotheses on single chosen variables are mandatory to exclude the risk of false positive results. Thus, one selection criterion was that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be included in our analysis had to be associated with reward sensitivity. The second criterion for the selected SNPs was that they should be associated with alcohol use or addiction not only in our sample but in patient studies to ensure the clinical relevance of the selected SNPs. This led to the following candidate genes and specific SNPs: ANKK1 (rs1800497), RASGRF2 (rs26907), and a regulatory region of HOMER1 (rs7713917) (Richter et al., 2013; Rietschel et al., 2010; Stacey et al., 2012) . ANKK1 encodes a protein belonging to a protein kinase family, which is involved in signal transduction and may influence dopaminergic signaling in the striatum (Klein et al., 2007; Neville et al., 2004) . As striatal dopamine responses to salient alcohol cues may be an inherited risk factor for alcoholism (Oberlin et al., 2013) this directly implies ANKK1 in the formation of alcoholism. The TaqIA SNP (rs1800497) in ANKK1 is one of the most widely examined genetic variations in mental disorders and its TaqIA A1 polymorphism is associated with alcoholism and other addiction disorders (Ponce et al., 2009 ). An imaging genetics study has shown that a variation in rs1800497 interacts with motivation in a reward flanker task (Richter et al., 2013) , indicating a link between ANKK1 and reward deficiency. Homer proteins regulate extracellular glutamate levels in cortical-limbic brain regions as well as signal transduction, synaptogenesis and receptor trafficking (Szumlinski et al., 2006) . Homer isoforms seem to influence the processing of reward anticipation; especially carriers of the A-allele of rs7713917 (located in a regulatory region of HOMER1) seem to be at a higher risk for a dysregulation of cognitive and motivational processes by influencing prefrontal activity during anticipation of reward . HOMER1 has also been explicitly implicated in the formation of alcoholism (Szumlinski et al., 2006) . RASGRF2 encodes a protein that mediates Ca 2+ -dependent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway and has been shown to be associated with reward sensitivity and alcohol intake via a hypothesized regulation of mesolimbic dopamine neuron activity (Stacey et al., 2012) .\nThe first aim of the present study was to expand previous findings on the relative contribution of reward-related variables on the levels of personality, behavior, and brain responses to alcohol drinking behavior now additionally examining candidate genetic factors. Secondly, we conducted follow-up analyses on alcohol drinking behavior two years later and established predictive models with longitudinal data identifying risk factors for the subsequent development of hazardous alcohol drinking. By the use of factor analyses we developed different categories (personality, behavior, brain responses, and candidate genetic variations). Using structural equation modeling these categories were correlated with alcohol drinking behavior at early adolescence and we established a predictive model for alcohol drinking behavior at late adolescence, and a model on increase of alcohol consumption between these time points."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Within the IMAGEN study (Schumann et al., 2010) adolescents were recruited from the general public in Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France.

We analyzed the association of personality variables, behavioral data, fMRI data and candidate genetic variants of adolescents (mean age = 14.37 years, sd = 0.68 years; henceforth named early adolescence) and AUDIT score at the same time point and again two years later in the same adolescents (mean age = 16.4, years, sd = 0.51 years; henceforth named late adolescence). Out of the IMAGEN sample 736 (389 female) subjects provided complete data sets on all relevant variables and thus were included in the analysis. This sample includes 185 participants of our previous study who provided complete data sets in the follow up examination. The newly added subjects (N=551) showed the same results as in our previous study with personality being the most important factor explaining alcohol drinking behavior in early adolescence (see supplemental Figure S1 ).

These subscales describe reward-related personality traits and are strongly associated with early initiation of hazardous alcohol use and as predictors for later alcohol abuse (e.g. Ayer et al., 2011; Cloninger, 1987; Hittner and Swickert, 2006) . Furthermore, risk adjustment, risk taking, and delay aversion were surveyed using the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) from the Cambridge Cognition Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB; Cambridge Cognition). Altering numbers of red and blue boxes were presented on a screen and adolescents had to guess whether a yellow token was hidden in either a blue or a red box.

Forty slices (2.4 mm, 1-mm gap) were obtained using a T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging sequence (EPI) and the following image parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2200 msec; echo time (TE) = 30 msec; inplane voxel size = 64 * 64 pixels over a 21.8 cm field of view. The plane of acquisition was sloped to the anterior-posterior commissure line (rostral > caudal).

Individual analyses included slice time correction, spatially realignment correcting for head movement, and non-linearly warping on the Montreal Neurological Institute space via a norm echo planar imaging template relying on the average of the mean images of 400 adolescents. This norm template image (53*63*46 voxels) was applied to all functional T2* data and voxels were resampled at a resolution of 3*3*3 mm. Functional data were smoothed for group analysis with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (5 mm full-width at half-maximum).\nWithin the first-level statistics regressors were modeled. We distinguished between reward magnitudes of no win, small win, and big win as subject-specific regressors in the MID task and modeled reward anticipation as predictor variable. Modeling took place using the general linear model on a voxel by voxel basis with an autoregressive noise model against a design matrix. Estimated movement was implied by 18 additional columns (three translational, three rotations, three quadratic and three cubic translations, three translations shifted 1 TR before, and three translations shifted 1 TR later). The second-level analysis included a non-spherity correction to address the problem of non-independent data within subjects and error variance heterogeneity. We analyzed weighted mean blood oxygenation level dependent signal change in regions of interest (ROIs) with probabilistic anatomical masks (Nielsen and Hansen, 2002) thresholded with a fractional intensity of \u2265 0.5. We followed the established literature on reward processing (e.g. Knutson et al., 2001) , which suggests the analyses of the weighted mean BOLD signal change of designated regions of interests for the anticipation of big versus small win as a measure of reward sensitivity. We decided to use the contrast big versus small win over big versus no win, because we aimed at examining brain responses when subjects are engaged in a rewarding context, i.e. when they are faced with different reward magnitudes instead of without reward. This second situation includes some components of punishment, which was not the focus of the present study (cf. Nees et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction and genotyping", "text": "DNA extraction was operated in a semi-automated manner (Nees et al., 2013; Schumann et al., 2010) .

The exploratory factor analysis aimed on the one hand to confirm the a priori hypothesized constructs personality, behavior, brain responses, and candidate genetic variations, and to exclude that variables within one category have stronger associations with variables out of another category. This would cause problems in the subsequent structural equation modeling by not representing separated constructs. On the other hand we aimed to test how many factors are constituted by the included SNPs. Thus, we implemented variables that have previously shown to be involved in reward processing (Gilman et al., 2012; Nees et al., 2012; Nees et al., 2013; Oberlin et al., 2012; Richter et al., 2013; Rietschel et al., 2010; Stacey et al., 2012) : Personality (novelty seeking, impulsivity, extraversion, sensation seeking), behavior (risk adjustment, delay aversion, risk taking), brain responses (reward anticipation in the striatum, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus, thalamus, insula, putamen, cerebellar vermis, and prefrontal cortex), and genetic variation (rs7713917, rs26907, rs1800497). An exploratory factor analysis was conducted including all participants (N=736) using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 to obtain underlying latent variables. To be sure not to enforce the formation of the hypothesized four domains personality, behavior, brain responses, and genetic variations, the chosen variables could load freely to any latent variable, i.e. variables were not forced to load by domain. The analyses comprised orthogonal rotation and the Kaiser Criterion with Eigen values \u02c3 1 as well as the Scree test were used to determine the number of latent variables."}, {"section_title": "Structural equation modeling", "text": "We performed structural equation modeling using IBM SPSS AMOS 21 to determine the impact of the latent variables (ROIs for brain responses, personality, behavior, and genetic variations) on AUDIT score. We used three models: one with AUDIT at early adolescence score as outcome variable (basic model), one with AUDIT score two years later (prediction model), and one model involved the difference in the AUDIT scores between early and late adolescence to uncover relations that might specifically determine the increase of alcohol consumption. In addition, we tested mediational models, examining the indirect influence of genetic variations via personality, behavior, and brain responses to reward on AUDIT score for all three models. We tested the influence of the applied genetic variations on the other latent variables separately as well as simultaneously as we had no a priori hypotheses about the possible pathways in our models. This approach was chosen because one could assume that genetic variations might not directly influence drinking behavior but through altering behavioral, neural, and / or personality-related traits.\nInclusion criteria for model fit were goodness of fit indices \u2265 0.9 and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) not significantly exceeding 0.05. When modeling was impossible because single variables did not explain sufficient variance in AUDIT score, these variables were removed from the model. This had to be done in one step for rs26907, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus. A new factor analysis without the omitted variables was conducted to ensure validity of the latent variables. We report the final factor analysis in the results section.\nUsually the effects of single genetic variations are quite small and large sample sizes are needed to detect them. Therefore, we initially conducted our analysis with the entire sample to be able to detect small effects. Nevertheless, in neuroimaging in mental disorders the problem of inflated predictions has been raised (Whelan and Garavan, 2014) . Although our sample seems to be large enough to exclude inflated predictions, the question has come up whether an overestimation of effects had occurred. Therefore, we randomly chose half of our sample and repeated the analyses. We chose this validation approach as the best way to avoid multiple testing. In order to test for center effects of our multi-center study, we applied the \"dropping one site\" approach for fMRI multicenter studies (Friedman et al., 2008) . Using this approach, we repeated the analyses three times, each time leaving out one randomly chosen examination site. To test for sex effects, we conducted the models separately for male and female adolescents.\nUsing the latent variables ROIs, personality, behavior, and candidate genes as predicting factors, three models could be established on alcohol drinking behavior as measured by AUDIT score at early adolescence, late adolescence and on the increase (difference of scores at these two time points) (see Figures 2-4 ). For the model explaining alcohol drinking behavior at early adolescence (R 2 = 0.13), reward-related personality traits were the most important factor with a standardized regression weight of 0.35 (Figure 2 ). In predicting alcohol drinking behavior two years later (R 2 = 0.14), rewardrelated personality traits and the candidate genetic variations contributed almost equally with standardized regression weights of 0.26 and 0.27, respectively (Figure 3 ). Within the model predicting the increase in AUDIT score (R 2 = 0.11), the contribution of the factor containing rs7713917 and rs1800497 was most important with a standardized regression weight of 0.33 ( Figure  4 ). Overall, there was a very good model fit with squared multiple correlations of 0.13, 0.14, and 0.11, goodness of fit indices were 0.944 and the RMSEA did not significantly exceed 0.05 (p > 0.05). The mediational models (examining the indirect influence of genetic variations via personality, behavior, and brain responses) failed to reach the inclusion criteria for model fit.\nThe models conducted separately for male and female adolescents showed comparable effects (see supplemental Table S1 )."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "A detailed sample description and the distribution of AUDIT scores can be found in Table 1 and Figure  1 .

About two years later they were reassessed again at a mean age of 16.45 years (sd = 0.47, range: 14.64-18.23). As the most significant change in AUDIT scores occurred around a score of 4 ( Figure 1 ) and as it has previously been shown that much lower cut off values for AUDIT scores indicating hazardous drinking should be applied for adolescents than for adults (Chung et al., 2000) we contrasted adolescents with an AUDIT score of 4 or lower with adolescents scoring higher in order to classify the results (Table 1) . Of the 736 participants, 448 scored 4 or lower at the second study time point. Significant differences between adolescents scoring 4 or lower and those who score higher occurred in extraversion, impulsivity, sensation seeking, novelty seeking, and risk taking (Table  1) ."}, {"section_title": "Factor analysis", "text": "The factor analysis revealed four latent variables explaining 54.85% of variance with the following factor loadings: Factor 1 (insula: 0.925, putamen: 0.918, caudate nucleus: 0.856, amygdala: 0.758, cerebellar vermis: 0.729, prefrontal cortex: 0.628), factor 2 (novelty seeking: 0.825, impulsivity: 0.661, extraversion: 0.602, sensation seeking: 0.512), factor 3 (risk adjustment: 0.701, delay aversion: 0.657, risk taking: 0.651), and factor 4 (rs7713917: 0.792, rs1800497: 0.584).

Using genetic variations as a predictor for alcohol consumption is novel as is the comprehensive prediction with longitudinal data. In all three models, reward-related behavior and brain responses to reward seem to constitute the least important factors. The most remarkable result is the shifting contribution of reward-related personality traits and genetic variations in rs7713917 and rs1800497. At early adolescence, novelty seeking, impulsivity, extraversion, and sensation seeking build the most important factor in explaining alcohol drinking behavior (Figure 2 ). This is consistent with previous findings and could now be extended to a larger sample. For the prediction of alcohol drinking behavior at late adolescence using longitudinal data the above mentioned personality traits and genetic variations in ANKK1 and a regulatory region in HOMER1 played an almost equal role (Figure 3 ). Considering the increase in AUDIT score from early to late adolescence (Figure 4 ), genetic variations in ANKK1 and a regulatory region on HOMER1 is the most important factor. At first sight it seems surprising that the contribution of these factors varies over this small amount of time. However, these data are in line with adoption studies (e.g. Cadoret et al., 1996) which have shown a far more important role of genetic factors in the transition from drug use to abuse than in drug use itself. Whereas the initiation of alcohol use may be driven by personality traits, which are associated with choosing certain peers and environments, the further development of alcohol misuse might be more strongly influenced by genetic factors. Accordingly, several studies reported that the influence of alcohol-specific genetic risk factors increased slowly through mid-adulthood while the environmental moderation was more pronounced in early and mid-adolescence than in later periods (Kendler et al., 2011) . It is likely that our sample can be used for the prediction of alcohol misuse, as 386 (reflecting 52.4%) of the participants at late adolescence score 4 and higher in the AUDIT, which indicates harmful alcohol use for adolescents (Chung et al., 2000) . Thus, with the model on increase of AUDIT score we identified the risk of transition to (more) hazardous alcohol use between early and later adolescence for adolescents who did not show a high AUDIT score in early adolescence or who's AUDIT score further increased from an already risky stage.\nThe genetic variations analyzed in this study only represent a very small part of the overall genetic variations. We chose those candidate genes based on strong a priori hypotheses. One of the implied SNPs failed to predict alcohol drinking behavior in our model (rs26907). Probably, this variation is not involved in altering drinking behavior regarding reward sensitivity. Another explanation might be that the three initially implemented SNPs do not have comparable effects, i.e. rs26907 could still have an impact on alcohol drinking behavior, but via pathways that differ from the other two candidate genes. Although rs1800497 and rs7713917 form one latent variable, it has to be noted that their standardized regression weights of 0.1 and 0.2 for the latent variable \"genetics\" are quite small. This is likely a consequence of their location on two different chromosomes (11 and 5, respectively) resulting in a largely independent inheritance. Nevertheless, to ensure not to over-estimate the impact of single genetic variations, we chose the approach of building one category \"candidate genetic variations\" rather than analyzing the impact of each distinct SNP separately.\nThe factor \"candidate genetic variations\" seems not to influence alcohol drinking behavior via the factors personality, behavior, or brain responses in our model. These three factors are built on specific variables (novelty seeking, impulsivity, extraversion, and sensation seeking; risk adjustment, delay aversion, and risk taking; BOLD signal change for the anticipation of big versus small win in the insula, putamen, caudate nucleus, amygdala, cerebellar vermis, and prefrontal cortex), derived from previous work. However, they did not represent all the pathways that influence drinking behavior. Therefore, it is possible that the genetic variations analyzed in this study might impact on drinking behavior via other pathways which are not accounted for in our models. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that our mediational models, which aimed to examine the influence of the genetic variations via personality, behavior, and brain responses on AUDIT score, failed to reach the inclusion criteria for model fit. Although the present study implicates a strong influence of rs1800497 and rs7713917 on alcohol drinking behavior it has to be prospectively examined via which routes, particularly on a molecular level, their genetic influence becomes manifest. Especially those pathways including D1 and D2 receptors regulating reward would be of great interest for further studies as they have been shown to enhance the brain's reactivity to drug cues (Volkow and Morales, 2015) especially in adolescents (Perreault et al., 2014) . The previously mentioned points emphasize the fact that our findings of genetic and personality-related effects have to be considered within the context of our specific model. With our model we cannot determine a particular impact of a distinct variable on alcohol consumption, but highlight the relationship between the implemented factors. Furthermore, although we have accounted for possible center effects using a \"dropping one site\" approach for multi-center studies (Friedman et al., 2008) , it cannot be completely ruled out that the effect is not of the same magnitude in the different assessment sites of our multi-center project. One further limitation of this study is that we did not assess hormone status. Although our models do not significantly differ between male and female participants (see supplemental Table S1 ), it has to be considered that some adolescent typical behaviors are influenced by gonadal steroids (e.g. Joinson et al., 2012; Temple et al., 2014; Varlinskaya et al., 2013) . Regarding the processing of reward, emotion, and (social) stress, also in the context of learning and memory, sex differences have been shown during the past years (e.g. Andreano and Cahill, 2009; Cahill, 2006; Caldu and Dreher, 2007; Hamann and Canli, 2004; Kajantie and Phillips, 2006; Kudielka and Kirschbaum, 2005) . Hence, in the context of our models, the association between ovarian hormone level and structural changes of the brain across the menstrual cycle (Sakaki and Mather, 2012) as well as the influence of HOMER1 on the steroidogenic function of the adrenal glands (Grinevich et al., 2011) , where gonadal steroids are synthesized in adolescents (Kiezun et al., 2015) could be of interest, for example. However, as the influences of gonadal hormones on alcohol intake and alcohol preference have been shown to be relatively modest (Varlinskaya et al., 2013) and as our models did not show sex-specific differences, we hypothesize that the mechanisms leading to an increased consumption might be comparable for boys and girls.\nOur study strengthens the hypothesis that reward sensitivity plays a major role in the development of alcohol abuse, especially on the levels of personality (novelty seeking, extraversion, sensation seeking, and impulsivity) as well as genetic susceptibility.\nTaken together, we highlighted that personality and candidate genetic variations are most important in predicting alcohol use and that the impact of these two factors develops differentially over the years of adolescence. This model is unique in that it includes longitudinal data of adolescents on reward sensitivity-related factors on the levels of personality, behavior, brain responses, and candidate genetic variations. Future research should focus on the potential for prevention strategies in this context. The authors report no financial relationships with commercial interests in relation to this study. "}]
