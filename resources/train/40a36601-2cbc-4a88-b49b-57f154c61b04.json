The southern boundary is the Washita River ( fig. 2) , which drains most of the study area and the northern boundary is the Canadian River, which drains the far northern part of the study area.\nThe Rush Springs aquifer is the most important source of ground water for irrigation, livestock and domestic uses in Caddo County. The total estimated ground-water withdrawals in 1995 for Caddo County was 32.10 million gallons per day. About 29.27 million gallons per day were withdrawn for irrigation and 1.15 million gallons per day were withdrawn for water supply (Tortorelli, 1999 , tables 1 and 4).\nThe study area lies in the rolling plains of westcentral Oklahoma. Agriculture is the primary land use. In 1998, about 46 percent of the land in Caddo County was used for cropland, about 8 percent of which was irrigated; about 23 percent of the land was used for pasture land; and about 20 percent was used for rangeland (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1999d) (table  1) . Wheat, sorghum, peanuts, and smaller amounts of soybeans, cotton, and corn are the principal crops.\nThe Rush Springs aquifer in the study area comprises the Rush Springs Formation, and overlying terrace and alluvial deposits along parts of the Canadian and Washita Rivers. Underlying the Rush Springs Formation is the Marlow Formation, a confining unit composed of interbedded sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, gypsum-anhydrite, and dolomite (Decker and Runkle, 1998) . The Rush Springs Formation is described as a massive to highly cross-bedded sandstone with some interbedded dolomite or gypsum (Becker, and Runkle, 1998, p. 7) . The terrace and alluvial deposits are composed of unconsolidated layers of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. The thickness of the Rush Springs Formation increases in a south-southwesterly direction and is thinnest along the northeastern boundary of the study area, where it has been truncated by erosion. The southwestern boundary of the aquifer is defined as the Washita River (Becker and Runkle, 1998, p. 3) because a high dissolved mineral content in the ground water limits use southwest of the river."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author thanks the Caddo Indian Tribe of Oklahoma for their cooperation."}, {"section_title": "VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT METHODS AND SELECTION CONSIDERATIONS", "text": "Assessment methods can be divided into two general categories: aquifer sensitivity and groundwater vulnerability (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). Considerations when selecting an assessment method include: the scale and size of the area to be assessed, intended use of the results, availability and suitability of data required by assessment method, availability of software and hardware, and technical expertise available to conduct the assessment.\nAquifer sensitivity methods provide information about aquifer susceptibility or risk of pollution. These assessment methods usually consider the following geohydrologic components: depth to water, land slope, net recharge, soil characteristics, vadose zone characteristics, and aquifer lithology. Ground-water vulnerability methods consider additional components, including pesticide characteristics and soil properties. Pesticide characteristics include solubility, water to organic carbon partitioning ratio, and half-life. Organic carbon content and infiltration rate are the most important soil properties affecting the movement of pesticide into the ground water. Other components used by ground-water vulnerability methods may include: agricultural practices and method of pesticide application. Some of the documented aquifer sensitivity and ground-water vulnerability assessment methods, the data requirements, and a description of the method are shown in Appendices 1 and 2. The scale and size of area to be assessed should be considered when selecting an assessment method. Aquifer sensitivity methods are generally more appropriate for screening large areas (more than one county) or comparing the sensitivity of one aquifer to another. The data required for aquifer sensitivity methods are commonly small scale and generalize broad areas. At a subcounty level, ground-water vulnerability assessment methods may be more suitable. These methods focus on smaller areas and account for chemical and physical properties of soil and pesticide usage. The two methods can be used together in steps and at different scales. For example, an aquifer sensitivity method can be used to assess large areas. After sensitive areas have been located, large-scale data layers can be constructed that describe soil properties and pesticide usage to assess the ground-water vulnerability to contamination. The advantage of making separate maps is the ability to update the data layers for the ground-water vulnerability maps as information is collected or changed.\nThe use of the end product is considered when selecting an assessment method. The results should be easily interpreted and provide the information needed to manage a pesticide program. Some methods, for example DRASTIC (Aller and others, 1987) , show relative numerical scores that represent degree of potential for contamination. Other methods use a specific number of classes with sensitivity ratings. The VULPEST model produces a set of probability results (Villeneuve and others, 1990) .\nThe availability and suitability of data required for the assessment method is another important consideration. Some methods require data available from publications or data bases, such as depth to water, aquifer lithology, or slope of the land surface. Other models require crop management, transpiration, or hydrologic processes, which may be difficult to define or understand. Additionally, the format, accuracy, completeness, and scale of the data must be suitable to use.\nComputer software and knowledge about geographic information systems is needed to construct most assessment models; and the ability to understand and interpret data that may relate to hydrogeology, soils, pesticides, and agronomic practices."}, {"section_title": "PREVIOUS AQUIFER SENSITIVITY ASSESSMENT OF THE RUSH SPRINGS AQUIFER", "text": "The aquifer sensitivity assessment method DRASTIC (Aller and others, 1987) was used by Osborn and others (1998) to assess the sensitivity of major aquifers in Oklahoma, including the Rush Springs.

The WTRLVL.TXT file in the DOCUMENT directory on the CD-ROM contains more information about the WTRLVL.DAT file."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working with the Caddo Indian tribe to develop a Pesticide Management Plan to prevent contamination of ground water that may result from the registered use of pesticides. An important component in the development of a Pesticide Management Plan is ascertaining where the Rush Springs aquifer may be sensitive and where ground water may be vulnerable to contamination.\nThe purpose of this report is to provide information on aquifer sensitivity and ground-water vulnerability assessment methods and to provide a CD-ROM with previously published digital data and other information that can be used to develop assessment maps for the study area.\nAssessment methods can be divided into two general categories: aquifer sensitivity and groundwater vulnerability. Considerations when selecting an assessment method include: the scale and size of the area to be assessed, intended use of the results, availability and suitability of data required by assessment method, availability of software and hardware, and technical expertise available to conduct the assessment.\nThe CD-ROM associated with the report contains six data files that describe various hydrologic components of the aquifer: aquifer boundaries, ground-water level elevations, hydraulic conductivity, net recharge, surficial geology, and land-surface elevations, and eight data files that describe physical and cultural features and boundaries in the study area. Additionally, the CD-ROM contains files of nitrogen concentration in ground water and depth to groundwater measurements, retrieved from the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System data base.\nCounty-level pesticide use information is available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Geological Survey, and Oklahoma State University County Extension Service. In 1998, herbicides were applied on 131,757 acres of crops and pasture land and insecticides were applied on 48,719 acres of hay and other crops in Caddo County. Pesticide use estimates show that 2,4-D and chlorsulfuron were applied to the largest number of acres and 2,4-D and metolachlor were used in the largest amounts in Caddo County in 1989.\nCurrently (2000), there have been few groundwater samples analyzed for pesticides in Caddo County. Consequently, the extent and scope of pesticides in ground water is unknown. Pesticides have been detected in creeks and streamside seeps in the Fort Cobb Reservoir watershed. The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture detected atrazine in North Eakley Creek in April 1990, and at four sites along Lake Creek in June 1990. Oklahoma Conservation Commission sampled five streamside seeps and five surface-water locations along Lake Creek between August 1998 and September 1999. The four most commonly detected pesticides in surface water were aldicarb, alachlor, triclopyr, and carbofuran. The four most commonly detected pesticides in streamside seeps were aldicarb, alachlor, carbofuran, and 2,4-D.\nThe National Land Cover datasets are high resolution digital data describing land cover for the conterminous United States. Land cover was mapped using 21 general land cover classes and is based upon 30-meter Landsat thematic mapper satellite data. The data are organized by state and can be downloaded from the Internet.\nTwo digital soil geographic data bases containing soil property data are available for the study area. The Map Information Assembly and Display System/Map Unit Interpretation Database and State Soil Geographic Database were developed by and are available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Resource Conservation Service. od a c c o u n t s for whe t he r the pot ent i al s o u r c e of c o n t a mi n a n t i"}, {"section_title": "SELECTED REFERENCES", "text": "; nt r a t e d or di s pe r s e d. me t hod e v a l u a t e s soil a t t e n u a t i o n pot e nt i a l s wi t hi n s e l e c t e d onsi n c o u n t i e s .
