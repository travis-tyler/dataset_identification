[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006;Goldstein, Young, and Boyd 2008). Establishing reliable indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators are important in ensuring the safety of our nation's students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety. Executive Summary iv"}, {"section_title": "Spotlights", "text": "\u2022 The percentage of public schools reporting the presence of security staff was higher during the 2015-16 school year than during the 2005-06 school year (57 vs. 42 percent). The percentage of schools reporting the presence of sworn law enforcement officers was also higher in 2015-16 than in 2005-06 (48 vs. 36 percent), as was the percentage of schools reporting the presence of a School Resource Officer (42 vs. 32 percent; Spotlight 1). \u2022 Among secondary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer present at least once a week, a lower percentage of schools in cities reported having an officer who carried a firearm (87 percent) compared with schools in towns (97 percent) and schools in suburban and rural areas (95 percent each; Spotlight 1). \u2022 Among public schools with any sworn law enforcement officers, a lower percentage of primary schools (51 percent) than of secondary schools (70 percent) reported their school or district had any formalized policies or written documents (such as a Memorandum of Use or Memorandum of Agreement) that outlined the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of sworn law enforcement officers at school (Spotlight 1). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, about 76 percent of public schools reported providing training for classroom teachers or aides on recognizing physical, social, and verbal bullying behaviors, 48 percent reported providing training on recognizing early warning signs of student violent behavior, and 30 percent reported providing training on recognizing signs of students using/abusing drugs and/or alcohol (Spotlight 2). \u2022 A greater percentage of public middle schools than of high schools and primary schools reported providing training on discipline policies and practices for cyberbullying and bullying other than cyberbullying in 2015-16. Similarly, a greater percentage of middle schools than of high schools and primary schools reported providing training on recognizing physical, social, and verbal bullying behaviors (Spotlight 2). \u2022 The percentage of schools that reported providing training on classroom management for classroom teachers and aides was higher in 2015-16 (84 percent) than in 2013-14 (78 percent) and 2003-04 (72 percent; Spotlight 2). \u2022 In 2015, some 46 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by student truancy. This percentage was higher than the OECD average percentage (34 percent; Spotlight 3). \u2022 In 2015, about 19 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by student use of alcohol or illegal drugs, which was higher than the OECD average percentage (9 percent; Spotlight 3). \u2022 In 2015, some 14 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by students intimidating or bullying other students, which was not measurably different from the OECD average percentage (11 percent; Spotlight 3).\n"}, {"section_title": "Violent Deaths", "text": "\u2022 A total of 47 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated violent deaths occurred between July 1, 2014, andJune 30, 2015, which included 28 homicides, 17 suicides, and 2 legal intervention deaths 5 (Indicator 1). \u2022 Between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, a total of 20 of the 1,168 homicides of school-age youth (ages 5-18) occurred at school. 6 During the same period, there were 9 suicides of school-age youth at school, compared with 1,785 total suicides of school-age youth that occurred in calendar year 2014 (Indicator 1)."}, {"section_title": "Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization", "text": "\u2022 In 2016, students ages 12-18 experienced 749,400 victimizations (theft and nonfatal violent victimization) at school and 601,300 victimizations away from school. 7 These figures represent total crime victimization rates of 29 victimizations 5 A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by a law enforcement agent in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest a lawbreaker, suppressing a disturbance, maintaining order, or engaging in another legal action. 6 This finding is drawn from the School-Associated Violent Death Surveillance System, which defines deaths \"at school\" as those that occur on the property of a functioning primary or secondary school, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while attending or traveling to or from a school-sponsored event. 7 \"Students\" refers to youth ages 12-18 whose educational attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school or away from school. Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2017 v per 1,000 students at school and 24 per 1,000 students away from school (Indicator 2). \u2022 Between 1992 and 2016, total victimization rates for students ages 12-18 declined both at school and away from school. Specific crime typesthefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent victimizations-all declined between 1992 and 2016, both at and away from school (Indicator 2). \u2022 In 2016, the rate of total victimization at school was higher for males than for females. The total victimization rate for males was 38 per 1,000 male students, and the rate for females was 20 per 1,000 female students. This difference was primarily driven by a higher rate of violent victimization at school for males (25 per 1,000) than for females (10 per 1,000; Indicator 2). \u2022 In 2015, approximately 3 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. About 2 percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and less than one-half of 1 percent reported serious violent victimization (Indicator 3). \u2022 Between 1995 and 2015, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months decreased overall (from 10 to 3 percent). During this period, the percentage of students who reported being victimized at school also decreased for both male (from 10 to 3 percent) and female students (from 9 to 3 percent), as well as for White (from 10 to 3 percent), Black (from 10 to 2 percent), and Hispanic students (from 8 to 2 percent; Indicator 3). \u2022 In 2015, about 6 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property 8 during the previous 12 months. The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was lower in 2015 than in every survey year between 1993 and 2011; however, there was no measurable difference between the percentages in 2013 and 2015 (Indicator 4). \u2022 In each survey year from 1993 to 2015, a lower percentage of female students than of male students in grades 9-12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in the previous 12 months (Indicator 4). \u2022 In 2015, lower percentages of Asian students (4 percent) and White students (5 percent) than of Black students (8 percent) and Pacific Islander students (20 percent) reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months ( Indicator 4). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, a higher percentage of elementary public school teachers than of secondary public school teachers reported being threatened with injury (11 vs. 9 percent) or being physically attacked (9 vs. 2 percent) by a student (Indicator 5). \u2022 The percentage of public school teachers reporting that they had been physically attacked by a student from their school in 2015-16 (6 percent) was higher than in all previous survey years (around 4 percent in each survey year) except in 2011-12, when the percentage was not measurably different from that in 2015-16 (Indicator 5)."}, {"section_title": "School Environment", "text": "\u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, 79 percent of public schools recorded that one or more incidents of violence, 9 theft, or other crimes 10 had taken place, amounting to 1.4 million crimes, or a rate of 28 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. During the same year, 47 percent of schools reported one or more crime incidents to the police, amounting to 449,000 crimes, or 9 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled (Indicator 6). \u2022 The percentages of public schools recording incidents of crime and reporting incidents to the police were lower in 2015-16 than in every prior survey year (Indicator 6). \u2022 In 2015-16, about 69 percent of schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 15 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, 11 39 percent recorded one or more thefts, and 59 percent recorded one or more other incidents. Thirty-three percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to the police, 10 percent reported at least one serious violent incident to the police, 18 percent reported at least one theft to the police, and 34 percent reported one or more other incidents to the police (Indicator 6). \u2022 The percentage of public schools that reported that student bullying occurred at least once a week decreased from 29 percent in 1999-2000 to 12 percent in 2015-16. Similarly, the percentage of schools that reported the occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers at least once a week decreased from 13 percent in 1999-2000 to 5 percent in 2015-16 (Indicator 7). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, the percentage of public schools that reported student bullying occurred at least once a week was higher for middle schools (22 percent) than for high schools (15 percent), combined schools (11 percent), and primary schools (8 percent; Indicator 7). \u2022 In 2015-16, about 12 percent of public schools reported that cyberbullying had occurred among students at least once a week at school or away from school. Seven percent of public schools also reported that the school environment was affected by cyberbullying, and 6 percent of schools reported that staff resources were used to deal with cyberbullying (Indicator 7). \u2022 Between 2001 and 2015, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that gangs were present at their school decreased from 20 to 11 percent. The percentage who reported gangs were present at their school was also lower in 2015 than in 2013 (12 percent; Indicator 8). \u2022 A higher percentage of students from urban areas (15 percent) reported a gang presence than of students from suburban (10 percent) and rural areas (4 percent) in 2015. Additionally, a higher percentage of students attending public schools (11 percent) than of students attending private schools (2 percent) reported that gangs were present at their school in 2015 (Indicator 8). \u2022 In 2015, higher percentages of Black (17 percent) and Hispanic (15 percent) students reported the presence of gangs at their school than of White (7 percent) and Asian (4 percent) students (Indicator 8). \u2022 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 22 percent in 2015 (Indicator 9). \u2022 In 2015, lower percentages of Asian students (15 percent), White students (20 percent), and Black students (21 percent) than of Hispanic students (27 percent) reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property (Indicator 9). \u2022 During the 2014-15 school year, the rate of illicit drug-related discipline incidents was 389 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of jurisdictions had rates between 100 and 1,000 illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2014-15 school year. Three states had rates of illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students that were below 100: Wyoming, Texas, and Michigan, while Kentucky had the only rate that was above 1,000 (Indicator 9). \u2022 The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being the target of hate-related words at school during the school year decreased from 12 percent in 2001 (the first year of data collection for this item) to 7 percent in 2015 (Indicator 10). \u2022 The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year decreased from 36 percent in 1999 (the first year of data collection for this item) to 27 percent in 2015 (Indicator 10). \u2022 In 2015, lower percentages of White (6 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) students than of Black (9 percent) students and students of other racial/ ethnic groups (11 percent) reported being called a hate-related word at school during the school year. Also in 2015, a lower percentage of Asian students than students of any other race/ethnicity reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year (Indicator 10). \u2022 In 2015, about 21 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school year. A higher percentage of female than of male students reported being bullied at school during the school year (23 vs. 19 percent; Indicator 11). \u2022 In 2015, about 33 percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that they were bullied at least once or twice a month during the school year. The percentage of students who reported notifying an adult after being bullied at school was higher for those who reported being bullied once or twice a week than for those who reported being bullied once or twice a year (63 vs. 37 percent; Indicator 11). Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2017 vii \u2022 Of students who reported being bullied at school during the school year in 2015, about 19 percent reported that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on how they felt about themselves, 14 percent each reported that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on their relationships with friends or family and on their school work, and 9 percent reported that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on their physical health (Indicator 11). \u2022 Between 2005 and 2015, the percentage of students reporting being bullied at school during the school year decreased from 28 to 21 percent. During this period, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school also decreased for students in suburban and rural areas as well as for those in public schools (Indicator 11). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, 43 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 38 percent agreed or strongly agreed that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. A higher percentage of secondary school teachers than of elementary school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (48 vs. 32 percent; Indicator 12). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, 67 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 84 percent agreed or strongly agreed that the principal enforced the school rules (Indicator 12). \u2022 The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated between 1993-94 and 2015-16; however, the percentage of teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching increased over this time period (from 28 to 38 percent; Indicator 12).\n"}, {"section_title": "Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances", "text": "\u2022 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased between 1993 and 2015 (from 42 to 23 percent), and the percentage who reported being in a physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 16 to 8 percent; Indicator 13). \u2022 In 2015, a higher percentage of 9th-graders than of 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders reported being in a physical fight, either anywhere or on school property, during the previous 12 months (Indicator 13). \u2022 The percentages of students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school property during the previous 30 days were higher for self-identified gay, lesbian, or bisexual students (28 and 11 percent, respectively) and students who were not sure about their sexual orientation (35 and 15 percent, respectively) than for their self-identified heterosexual peers (22 and 7 percent, respectively; Indicator 13). \u2022 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days decreased from 22 percent in 1993 to 16 percent in 2015, and the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days decreased from 12 percent in 1993 to 4 percent in 2015 (Indicator 14). \u2022 During the 2015-16 school year, there were 1,600 reported firearm possession incidents at schools in the United States, and the rate of firearm possession incidents was 3 per 100,000 students. Three states had rates above 10: Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri (Indicator 14). \u2022 The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that they had access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year decreased from 7 percent in 2007 to 4 percent in 2015 (Indicator 14). \u2022 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days decreased from 48 to 33 percent between 1993 and 2015 (Indicator 15). \u2022 In 2015, a higher percentage of self-identified gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than of self-identified heterosexual students reported consuming alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days (40 vs. 32 percent; Indicator 15). \u2022 During the 2014-15 school year, the rate of alcohol-related discipline incidents was 45 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of jurisdictions had rates between 10 and 100 alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2014-15 school year. Two states had rates of alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students that were below 10: Texas and Wyoming, while six \u2022 In 2015, some 22 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent) but not measurably different from that reported in 2013 (Indicator 16). \u2022 In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher percentages of male students than of female students reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days; in 2013 and 2015, however, there were no measurable differences in the percentages reported by male and female students (Indicator 16). \u2022 A higher percentage of self-identified gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than of self-identified heterosexual students reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days (32 vs. 21 percent; Indicator 16).\n\n\nBlack (3 percent) and Asian (2 percent) students reported that they had carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days. The percentage of students reporting that they carried a weapon on school property was also higher for Pacific Islander students (15 percent), students of Two or more races (6 percent), and Hispanic students than for Asian students. There were no measurable differences by grade in the percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days in 2015: about 16 percent of students in each grade reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. Additionally, no measurable differences were observed by grade in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property, except the percentage was higher for 11th-graders than for 9th-graders (5 vs. 3 percent). In 2015, the YRBS added a new question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 68 In 2015, there were no measurable differences by sexual orientation in the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. However, a higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than of heterosexual students reported that they had carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days (6 vs. 4 percent; table 14.3). In 2015, data on percentages of public school students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere were available for 27 states and the District of Columbia (table 14.4). Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 9 percent in California to 30 percent in Wyoming. There were also 33 states that had 2015 data available on the percentages of students reporting that they carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days; the percentages ranged from 2 percent in Pennsylvania to 11 percent in Montana and Wyoming. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school. State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2015-16 school year, there were 1,600 reported firearm possession incidents at schools in the United States (table 14.5). 69 The number of incidents varies widely across jurisdictions, due in large part to their differing populations. Therefore, the rate of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across jurisdictions. During the 2015-16 school year, the rate of firearm possession incidents was 3 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of jurisdictions had rates between 1 and 10 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students during the 2015-16 school year. Two states, Hawaii and Maine, reported no firearm incidents and therefore had a rate of 0 firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students. Five other states had rates of firearm possession incidents per 100,000 students below 1: New Jersey, Iowa, New Hampshire, Maryland, and North Dakota, while three states had rates above 10: Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri. Information about students' access to firearms can put student reports of carrying a gun anywhere and on school property into context. In the SCS survey, students were asked if they could have gotten a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year. In 2015, about 4 percent of students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, during the current school year (figure 14.3 and table 14.6). The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that they had access to a loaded gun without adult permission decreased from 7 percent in 2007 (the first year of data collection for this item) to 4 percent in 2015. However, there was no measurable difference between 2013 and 2015 in the percentage of students who reported having such access to a loaded gun. In every survey year from 2007 to 2015 (except in 2013), a higher percentage of male students than of female students ages 12-18 reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school. In 2015, about 5 percent of male students reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, compared with 3 percent of female students. The percentages of male and female students who reported having such access to a loaded gun were both lower in 2015 than in 2007 (5 and 8 percent for males; 3 and 5 percent for females), but there were no measurable differences between the percentages in 2013 and 2015. In 2015, higher percentages of 11th-and 12th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, either at school or away from school, than did 6th-, 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders. About 7 percent of 12th-graders and 6 percent of 11th-graders reported having access to a loaded gun without adult permission, compared with 3 percent each of 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-graders and 2 percent of 6th-graders. The percentage of 10th-graders reporting that they had access to a gun without adult permission (5 percent) was also higher than the percentage of 6th-graders reporting such access. This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to examine the percentage of students who had consumed alcohol during the previous 30 days. The indicator also uses state data from the EDFacts data collection to look at the number of discipline incidents resulting in the removal of a student for at least an entire school day that involved students' possession or use of alcohol on school grounds. Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. In the 2015 YRBS, students in grades 9-12 were asked if they had consumed alcohol on at least 1 day during the previous 30 days. Until 2011, students were also asked if they had consumed alcohol on school property 70 during the previous 30 days. Because this item was dropped from the YRBS after 2011, this indicator primarily discusses students' reports of alcohol consumption anywhere using data up to 2015 and then briefly discusses students' reports of alcohol consumption on school property using data up to 2011. Between 1993 (the first year of data collection) 71     In 2015, the YRBS added a new question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure. In 2011 and earlier years, data were also collected on student alcohol consumption on school property during the previous 30 days. In 2011, some 5 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported consuming alcohol on school property on at least 1 day, which was not measurably different from the percentage in 1993 (table 15.1). About 3 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on 1 or 2 of the previous 30 days in 2011 (table 15.2). One percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on 3 to 29 of the previous 30 days, and less than 1 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on all of the previous 30 days. Discipline incidents that result from possession or use of alcohol at school reflect disruptions in the educational process and provide a gauge for the scope of alcohol use at school. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of discipline incidents involving students' possession or use of alcohol on school grounds that result in the removal of a student for at least an entire school day. State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. During the 2014-15 school year, there were 22,500 reported alcohol-related discipline incidents in the United States (table 15.5). 73 The number of alcoholrelated incidents varies widely across jurisdictions, due in large part to their differing populations. Therefore, the rate of alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across jurisdictions. During the 2014-15 school year, the rate of alcohol-related discipline incidents was 45 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of jurisdictions had rates between 10 and 100 alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2014-15 school year. Two states had rates of alcohol-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students that were below 10: Texas and Wyoming, while six states had rates above 100: Arkansas, Alaska, Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, and Colorado.  Students' Use of Marijuana In 2015, some 22 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent) but not measurably different from the percentage reported in 2013. The 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) asked students in grades 9-12 whether they had used marijuana during the previous 30 days. Until 2011, students were also asked whether they had used marijuana on school property 74 during the previous 30 days. Due to this change in the questionnaire, this indicator primarily discusses students' reports of marijuana use anywhere using data up to 2015 and then briefly discusses students' reports of marijuana use on school property using data up to 2011. In 2015, some 22 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days, which was higher than the percentage reported in 1993 (18 percent; the first year of data collection) 75 but not measurably different from the percentage reported in 2013 (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). Specifically, in 2015 about 7 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana 1 or 2 times during the previous 30 days, 10 percent reported using marijuana 3 to 39 times during the previous 30 days, and 4 percent reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (table 16.2). In every survey year between 1993 and 2011, higher percentages of male students than of female students reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days; in 2013 and 2015, however, there were no measurable differences in the percentages reported by male and female students (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). In 2015, a higher percentage of males (5 percent) than of females (3 percent) reported using marijuana 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (figure 16.2 and table 16.2). 74 In the question about using marijuana at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. 75 1991 was the first year of data collection for marijuana use anywhere and 1993 was the first year of data collection for marijuana use on school property. In 2015, some differences in the percentages of students who reported marijuana use were observed by race/ethnicity and grade level. The percentage of Asian students (8 percent) who reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days was lower than the percentages reported by White students (20 percent), students of Two or more races (23 percent), Hispanic students (24 percent), American Indian/Alaska Native students (27 percent), and Black students (27 percent; figure 16.3 and table 16.1). The percentage for White students was also lower than the percentages for Hispanic and Black students. In addition, the percentage of students in 9th grade (15 percent) who reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days was lower than the percentages of students in 10th grade (20 percent), 11th grade (25 percent), and 12th grade (28 percent) who reported doing so. The percentage for students in 10th grade was also lower than the percentages for students in 11th and 12th grade. The 2015 YRBS added a new question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 76 In 2015, a higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than of heterosexual students reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days (32 vs. 21 percent; table 16.3). The percentage who reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days was higher for students who were not sure about their sexual orientation than for heterosexual students (26 vs. 21 percent). 76 In this indicator, students who identified as \"gay or lesbian\" or \"bisexual\" are discussed together as the \"gay, lesbian, or bisexual\" group. Although there are likely to be differences among students who identify with each of these orientations, small sample sizes preclude analysis for each of these groups separately. Students were not asked whether they identified as transgender on the YRBS. This indicator repeats information from the Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2016 report, but the text has been revised to include additional breakouts that were previously included in a Spotlight feature.

In 2015, state-level data for students who reported using marijuana at least one time during the previous 30 days were available for 36 states and the District of Columbia (table 16. 4). Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported using marijuana ranged from 12 percent in South Dakota to 29 percent in the District of Columbia. Until 2011, data were also collected on students' marijuana use on school property during the previous 30 days. Some 6 percent of students reported using marijuana at least one time on school property in 2011; this was not measurably different from the percentage reported in 1993 (table 16. 1). In 2011, about 3 percent of students reported using marijuana on school property 1 or 2 times during the previous 30 days, 2 percent reported using marijuana on school property 3 to 39 times during the previous 30 days, and 1 percent reported using marijuana on school property 40 or more times during the previous 30 days (table 16.2).

Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Brookmeyer, Fanti, and Henrich 2006;Goldstein, Young, and Boyd 2008). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998;Crick and Grotpeter 1996;Nansel et al. 2001;Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001;Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004;Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996;MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002;Smith and Smith 2006). For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Organization of This Report", "text": "Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2017 is the 20th in a series of reports produced since 1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. Although the data presented in this report are the most recent available at the time of publication, the most recent two or more school years are not covered due to data processing timelines. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public. Crime and Safety: 2017 is organized into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers. The sections cover violent deaths; nonfatal student and teacher victimization; school environment; fights, weapons, and illegal substances; fear and avoidance; discipline, safety, and security measures; and campus safety and security. This year's report also includes a spotlight section on topics related to security staff in K-12 public schools, teacher training on school safety and discipline, and school environment and student learning. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison. 1 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A reference section and a glossary of terms appear at the end of the report."}, {"section_title": "Indicators of School", "text": "This edition of the report contains updated data for ten indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school (Indicator 1); incidence of victimization at school and away from school (Indicator 2); teachers threatened with injury or physically attacked by students (Indicator 5); violent and other criminal incidents at public schools, and those reported to the police (Indicator 6 ); discipline problems reported by public schools (Indicator 7); teachers' reports on school conditions (Indicator 12); serious disciplinary actions taken by public schools (Indicator 19); safety and security measures taken by public schools (Indicator 20); criminal incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 22); and hate crime incidents at postsecondary institutions (Indicator 23). In addition, it includes three spotlight indicators: prevalence, type, and responsibilities of security staff in K-12 public schools (Spotlight 1); teacher training on school safety and discipline (Spotlight 2); and national and international perspectives on school environment and student learning (Spotlight 3). Also included in this year's report are references to publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses. These references can be found in the \"For more information\" sidebars at the bottom of each indicator. The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2015-16 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12-through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2015; however, they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent victimization at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of victimization, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Table A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report. Several indicators in this report are based on selfreported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005;Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is \"bounded\" or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to \"self-determine\" a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors can affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys. Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, making it impossible to discuss any trend. Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the \"margin of error\" for these estimates. Introduction 4 the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation [CV] for this estimate is between 30 and 50 percent). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on 10 or fewer cases or the coefficient of variation was greater than 50 percent. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the standard error was 50 percent or greater of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed, with a note stating, \"Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation [CV] is 50 percent or greater.\" See appendix A for more information. The appearance of a \"!\" symbol (Interpret data with caution) in a table or figure indicates a data cell with a high ratio of standard error to estimate, alerting the reader to use caution when interpreting such data. These estimates are still discussed, however, when statistically significant differences are found despite large standard errors. Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not require statistical testing, with the exception of linear trends. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the comparison being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used to examine changes in percentages over a range of values such as time or age. Linear trend tests allow one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. Percentages reported in the tables and figures are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), while percentages reported in the text are generally rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to one decimal place, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates. Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

A higher percentage of primary schools reported the presence of security staff in 2015-16 than in 2005-06 (45 vs. 26 percent). Similarly, secondary schools reported a higher percentage of security staff present at school in 2015-16 than in 2005-06 (72 vs. 63 percent). The use of school-based security personnel not only affects the level of reported school crime, it may also affect the school environment. For example, the presence of security staff may be associated with schools' reporting of crime incidents, and with staff and students' perceptions of the school environment (Na and Gottfredson 2011;Jackson 2002). Schools employ different types of security staff, and the responsibilities of these security staff vary. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of school security staff provides important context for evaluating school crime and safety. This spotlight uses data from the 2015-16 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2016) to examine the prevalence and types of security staff in K-12 public schools. 2 It also provides information on the specific roles and responsibilities of security staff while at school. As in previous administrations, SSOCS:2016 collected information on the number of different types of security staff present at school. However, the 2015-16 questionnaire only asked respondents to provide additional information on the roles and responsibilities of sworn law enforcement officers at school, such as whether they carry a firearm and whether they perform other specific activities like security enforcement and patrol. Sworn law enforcement officers include School Resource Officers (SROs) 3 and officers who are not SROs. In this spotlight, the analysis on the roles and responsibilities 2 The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is a nationally representative sample of the nation's public schools designed to provide estimates of school crime, discipline, disorder, programs, and policies. SSOCS:2016 was supported by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) as part of its Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, which was developed in response to a 2014 congressional appropriation to conduct research about school safety. At the request of NIJ, the security staff section on the 2016 questionnaire was re-designed. The revised section focuses specifically on sworn law enforcement officers (including SROs) and was expanded to collect data on emerging areas of interest, such as whether schools formally outline the responsibilities of these officers while at school. 3 School Resource Officers (SROs) are career sworn law enforcement officers with arrest authority who have specialized training and are assigned to work in collaboration with school organizations. of sworn law enforcement officers is restricted to schools that reported having at least one sworn law enforcement officer present at school at least once a week. Officers' roles and responsibilities are discussed in four contexts below: (1) the times they are present at school; (2) the items they routinely wear or carry; (3) the activities they participate in; and 4any formalized policies or written documents schools or districts have that outline their roles, responsibilities, and expectations. The SSOCS:2016 questionnaire asked schools to report the number of SROs, sworn law enforcement officers who were not SROs, and other security staff who were present at their school at least once a week. During the 2015-16 school year, 57 percent of public schools reported having any security staff present at school and 48 percent reported having any sworn law enforcement officers present (table S1.1). Forty-two percent of public schools reported that they had an SRO present, while 11 percent reported that they had a sworn law enforcement officer who was not an SRO present. Twenty percent of public schools reported having security guards or other security personnel present.

SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2005-06 and2015-16 School Survey on Crime andSafety (SSOCS), 2006 and Earlier years of the SSOCS survey also included some questions about school security staff, allowing for an examination of change over time. The percentage of public schools reporting the presence of any security staff at least once a week was higher during the 2015-16 school year than during the 2005-06 school year (57 vs. 42 percent). The percentage of schools reporting the presence of any sworn law enforcement officers was also higher in 2015-16 than in 2005-06 (48 vs. 36 percent), as was the percentage of schools reporting the presence of an SRO (42 vs. 32 percent). Similar patterns were observed over time at both primary and secondary schools. For example, higher percentages of primary schools reported the presence of any security staff in 2015-16 than in 2005-06 (45 vs. 26 percent; figure S1.1 and table S1.1). Primary schools also reported higher percentages in 2015-16 than in 2005-06 of any sworn law enforcement officer (36 vs. 21 percent), any officer who was an SRO (30 vs. 18 percent) and any officer who was not an SRO (9 vs. 5 percent).

The presence of security staff in primary and secondary schools can be further examined by school characteristics. Among primary schools, few measurable differences in the percentages of the various security staff present at least once a week were seen by school characteristics during the 2015-16 school year. However, there was some variation by enrollment size (figure S1.2 and table S1.1): the percentage of primary schools with less than 300 students who reported having an SRO present was lower than the corresponding percentages for primary schools with 300 to 499 students and 500 to 999 students. Among secondary schools, there was greater variation observed by school characteristics. During the 2015-16 school year, higher percentages of secondary schools with larger enrollments reported having security staff, any sworn law enforcement officers, and officers who were SROs present at least once a week compared with schools with smaller enrollments. For example, 84 percent of secondary schools with 1,000 or more students reported having an SRO present compared with 30 percent of schools with less than 300 students, 51 percent of schools with 300 to 499 students, and 65 percent of schools with 500 to 999 students. Additionally, higher percentages of secondary schools in suburbs and cities (82 and 86 percent, respectively) reported having any security staff present, compared with schools in rural areas and towns (55 and 69 percent, respectively). Looking at the percent combined enrollment of minority students, 6 higher percentages of secondary schools with 20 to 50 percent minority students or more than 50 percent minority students reported the presence of any security staff at least once a week (73 and 82 percent, respectively), compared with secondary schools with less than 5 percent minority students or 5 to 20 percent minority students (58 and 63 percent, respectively).  The questionnaire provided the following examples of selected school activities: athletic and social events, open houses, and science fairs. 2 Primary schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 8. 3 Secondary schools include both middle and high schools as well as combined schools. Middle schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. High schools are defined as schools in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 12. Combined schools have any combination of grades (including K-12) that is not defined specifically as primary, middle, or high school. NOTE: Sworn law enforcement officers include School Resource Officers as well as other sworn law enforcement officers who are not School Resource Officers. School Resource Officers are sworn law enforcement officers with arrest authority who have specialized training and are assigned to work in collaboration with school organizations. Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. \"At school\" was defined to include activities happening in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Schools could answer \"yes\" to more than one question about the presence of officers at various times. Schools indicating the presence of officers at multiple times are included in each applicable category. For example, a school that indicated officers were present at any time during school hours at least once a week and also indicated officers were present for all instructional hours every day would be included in both of these categories. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2015-16 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), 2016. In addition to the prevalence and type of security staff present in schools, it is also important to know at what times these officers were actually present at school. During the 2015-16 school year, primary and secondary schools reported using sworn law enforcement officers at various times during and outside of school hours. For example, among primary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer present at least once a week, the percentage of schools that reported having an officer present when school activities were not occurring (37 percent) was lower than the percentage of schools reporting that an officer was present at selected activities 7 (60 percent) and when students were arriving or leaving (67 percent; figure S1.3 and table S1.2). The same pattern was observed for secondary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer: 45 percent of secondary schools reported that a sworn law enforcement officer was present when school activities were not occurring 7 The questionnaire provided the following examples of selected school activities: athletic and social events, open houses, and science fairs. compared with 87 percent that reported that officers were present at selected activities and 88 percent that reported that officers were present while students were arriving or leaving. For all specific times asked about on the survey, a lower percentage of primary schools than of secondary schools reported having an officer present. Additionally, 13 percent of primary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer had an officer present for all instructional hours every day that the school was in session compared with 46 percent of secondary schools. 8 8 Respondents were instructed to include officers who are used as temporary coverage while regularly assigned officers are performing duties external to the school (such as attending court) or during these officers' personal leave time.

The types of items routinely carried or worn by sworn law enforcement officers (e.g., stun guns, chemical aerosol sprays, firearms, body cameras) while at school during the 2015-16 school year varied by school level. Among schools with any sworn law enforcement officer present at least once a week, a lower percentage of primary schools than of secondary schools reported having an officer who routinely carried a firearm (86 vs. 93 percent) and chemical aerosol sprays (59 vs. 72 percent; figure S1.4 and table S1.3). However, among the items carried or worn by sworn law enforcement officers, a firearm was the most common item routinely carried or worn by officers at both primary and secondary schools. Conversely, the item least commonly carried or worn by officers in both primary and secondary schools was a body camera; 13 percent of primary schools and 19 percent of secondary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer had an officer who wore a body camera. In terms of officers carrying firearms while at school, there was some variation by school characteristics for both primary and secondary schools. For example, among secondary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer present at least once a week, a lower percentage of schools in cities reported having an officer who carried a firearm (87 percent) compared with schools in towns (97 percent) and schools in suburban and rural areas (95 percent each). Additionally, a lower percentage of secondary schools where 76 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported having an officer who routinely carried a firearm (89 percent) than schools where 25 percent or less of the students or 26 to 50 percent of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (95 percent each). 9 Figure S1.5.

SSOCS:2016 also asked schools with any sworn law enforcement officer present at least once a week whether sworn law enforcement officers participated in ten specific activities while at school during the 2015-16 school year. With the exception of teaching a law-related education course, a lower percentage of primary schools than of secondary schools reported having an officer who participated in each activity (figure S1.5 and table S1.4). The most common activities that officers participated in varied by school level; however, when comparing the five most prevalent officer activities reported by primary schools and secondary schools, there were three activities common across both school levels: coordinating with local police and emergency teams, enforcing security/patrolling, and identifying problems in the school and proactively seeking solutions. Among primary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer present at least once a week, 73 percent had an officer who coordinated with local police and emergency teams; 67 percent had an officer who enforced security/patrolled; and 64 percent had an officer who identified problems in the school and proactively sought solutions. The other two most common activities in primary schools were mentoring students and controlling motor vehicle traffic (both 59 percent). Among secondary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer, 93 percent had an officer who coordinated with local police and emergency teams; 88 percent had an officer who enforced security/patrolled; and 81 percent had an officer who provided information to school authorities about legal definitions. The other two most common activities in secondary schools were identifying problems in the school and proactively seeking solutions (81 percent) and recording or reporting discipline problems to school authorities (79 percent). Among both primary and secondary schools with any sworn law enforcement officer, the least common activity reported was having an officer who taught a law-related education course or training for students. Schools that reported having any sworn law enforcement officers present at their school at least once a week were asked if, during the 2015-16 school year, their school or district had any formalized policies or written documents (such as a Memorandum of Use or Memorandum of Agreement) that outlined the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of sworn law enforcement officers at school. Among schools with any sworn law enforcement officers, a lower percentage of primary schools (51 percent) than of secondary schools (70 percent) reported their school or district had such policies or documents (table S1.5). Of primary schools with these policies, 56 percent of schools reported that the policy defined the role of officers related to school discipline, 53 percent reported it defined the role of officers related to reporting criminal offenses to a law enforcement agency, 48 percent reported it defined the role of officers related to making arrests on school grounds, 38 percent reported it defined the role of officers in the use of physical restraints, and 32 percent reported it defined the role of officers in the use of firearms.

Classroom teachers and aides have frequent interaction with students and can play an important role in helping to ensure that students are safe and healthy. Additionally, teachers and aides need to know school policies and procedures for disciplining students in order to implement these procedures appropriately. Between 2003-04 and 2009-10, as well as in 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked principals of public schools whether their school or school district provided specific types of safety and discipline training for classroom teachers or aides. Additionally, in 2013-14, the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) \"School Safety and Discipline: 2013-14\" survey, comprised of a subset of items from the full SSOCS questionnaire, collected data on safety and discipline training for classroom teachers and aides. During the 2015-16 school year, about 93 percent of public schools reported that they provided training on safety procedures (e.g., how to handle emergencies) for classroom teachers or aides, and 84 percent of schools reported providing training on classroom management (figure S2.1 and table S2.1). Schools also reported providing training to classroom teachers and aides on schoolwide discipline policies and practices related to cyberbullying 10 (67 percent), bullying other than cyberbullying 11 (79 percent), violence 12 (69 percent), and alcohol and/or drug use (42 percent). Recognizing warning signs of potential safety or discipline problems for students is one way teachers and schools can lessen the impact of these problems on students who may be struggling with them. About 76 percent of public schools reported providing training for classroom teachers or aides on recognizing physical, social, and verbal bullying behaviors, 10 The questionnaire defined cyberbullying as occurring \"when willful and repeated harm is inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, or other electronic devices.\" 11 The questionnaire defined bullying as \"any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated.\" 48 percent reported providing training on recognizing early warning signs of student violent behavior, and 30 percent reported providing training on recognizing signs of students using/abusing drugs and/or alcohol in 2015-16. Additionally, intervention strategies can help inform teachers on how to appropriately intervene in various safety-related scenarios involving students. About 82 percent of schools reported providing training on positive behavioral intervention strategies, 71 percent reported providing training on crisis prevention and intervention, and 53 percent reported providing training on intervention and referral strategies for students with signs of mental health disorders. 13 There were differences in the percentages of public schools that reported providing safety and discipline training for classroom teachers and aides by school characteristics during the 2015-16 school year. For example, a greater percentage of high schools than of middle and primary schools reported providing training on discipline policies and practices related to alcohol and/or drug use as well as for recognizing student abuse of alcohol and/or drugs (figure S2.2 and table S2.1). Additionally, a greater percentage of high schools than of primary schools reported providing training on discipline policies and practices related to violence, training for recognizing early warning signs of students likely to exhibit violent behavior, and training on intervention and referral strategies for students with signs of mental health disorders. During the 2015-16 school year, a greater percentage of public middle schools than of high schools and primary schools reported providing training on discipline policies and practices for cyberbullying and bullying other than cyberbullying.

A higher percentage of schools located in cities (60 percent) than in suburbs (52 percent), rural areas (50 percent), and towns (48 percent) reported providing training on intervention and referral strategies for students with signs of mental health disorders. The percentage of schools providing training on safety procedures and crisis prevention and intervention was higher in cities than in rural areas, and the percentage providing this training was also higher in the suburbs than in rural areas. The percentages of schools that reported providing training for discipline policies and practices related to cyberbullying and bullying other than cyberbullying were higher for cities and suburbs than for towns. The percentage of schools that reported providing training on discipline policies and practices related to violence was higher in cities than in towns, and the percentage providing training on recognizing student use/abuse of alcohol and/or drugs was higher in suburbs than towns. Finally, the percentage of schools providing training on positive behavioral interventions was higher in cities (90 percent) and suburbs (86 percent) than in towns (75 percent) and rural areas (73 percent). The percentage of public schools that reported providing safety and discipline training during the 2015-16 school year differed, in some cases, by the percentage of students in those schools who were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. For instance, a higher percentage of schools with 76 percent or more of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch than of those with 26 to 50 percent of students eligible reported that they provided training in the following areas: recognizing early warning signs of students likely to exhibit violent behavior; recognizing physical, social, and verbal bullying behaviors; intervention and referral strategies for students displaying signs of mental health disorders; positive behavioral intervention strategies; and crisis prevention and intervention strategies (table S2.1).

In addition, the percentage of schools that reported providing training on safety procedures was higher in schools with 26 to 50 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than in those with 51 to 75 percent of students eligible. Five questionnaire items on topics relating to safety and discipline training-namely, classroom management, recognizing warning signs of alcohol or drug use/abuse, safety procedures, positive behavioral intervention strategies, and recognizing warning signs of violent behavior-appeared on all administrations of SSOCS from 2003-04 to the present, as well as on the 2013-14 FRSS survey; thus, responses to the items on these topics can be compared over time. The percentage of schools that reported providing training on classroom management for classroom teachers and aides was higher in 2015-16 (84 percent) than in 2013-14 (78 percent) and 2003-04 (72 percent; figure S2.4 and table S2.2). The percentage of schools that reported providing training on safety procedures was higher in 2015-16 (93 percent) than in 2003-04 (88 percent), but not measurably different in 2015-16 than in 2013-14. This same pattern emerged for the percentage of schools that reported providing training on positive behavioral intervention strategies.

However, the percentages of U.S. students who attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered by students skipping classes, students intimidating or bullying other students, and students lacking respect for teachers were not measurably different from the corresponding OECD average percentages. Research has found that aspects of the school environment such as levels of bullying, classmate relationships, and teacher support have an impact on students' cognitive and noncognitive outcomes, including students' social-emotional skills, attitudes about self and others, social behaviors, and academic performance (Robinson et al. 2016;Strom et al. 2013). Recognizing the importance of school environment, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and an increasing number of countries around the world have provided funding for school environment reform efforts (UNICEF 2012). Using data from the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey (the most recent administration of PISA), this spotlight presents school-reported data from across the OECD countries and in the United States on the extent to which learning is influenced by school environment. In addition, the spotlight examines the change in the extent to which learning is influenced by school environment between 2000 and 2015. 14"}, {"section_title": "Coordinated by the Organization for Economic", "text": "Cooperation and Development (OECD), PISA has measured the performance of 15-year-old students in mathematics, science, and reading literacy every 3 years since 2000. In addition to these assessments, each administration of PISA contains student and school questionnaires, which collected information on school environment and student learning across countries. This spotlight uses PISA school questionnaires to examine two aspects of school environment: the disciplinary environment and the safety and respectfulness of the environment. The school disciplinary environment is composed of two elements: the extent to which the learning of students is hindered by (i) student truancy and (ii) student class skipping. The safety and respectfulness of the school environment is composed of three elements: the extent to which student learning is hindered by (i) student use of alcohol or illegal drugs; (ii) students intimidating or bullying other students; and (iii) students lacking respect for teachers. 15 In 2015, some 46 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by student truancy (figure S3.1 and table S3.1). This percentage was higher than the OECD average 16 (34 percent). Among the 35 OECD countries reporting these data, the percentages ranged from 10 percent in the United Kingdom to 56 percent in Canada. The percentage was higher in the United States than in 21 OECD countries and lower in the United States than in 2 OECD countries. The 2012 and 2015 percentages of U.S. 15-yearold students who attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered by student truancy were not measurably different. 17 However, among 35 OECD countries that had valid school environment data in 2012 and 2015 the percentage of students who attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered by student truancy was higher in 2015 than in 2012 in 5 countries and lower in 2015 than in 2012 in 1 country.

Among the 34 OECD countries that had valid data in 2015, the percentages ranged from 2 percent in Luxembourg to 35 percent in the Netherlands. 19 The percentage was higher in the United States than in 15 OECD countries and lower in the United States than in 3 OECD countries. The 2000 and 2015 percentages of 15-year-old students in the United States who attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by students intimidating or bullying other students were not measurably different. Among the 28 OECD countries that had valid data for both 2000 and 2015, the percentages in 4 OECD countries were higher in 2015 than in 2000, and the percentages in 4 other OECD countries were lower in 2015 than in 2002. Student respect for teachers contributes to a positive school environment. In 2015, some 18 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by students lacking respect for teachers, which was not measurably different from the OECD average percentage (20 percent; figure S3.5 and table S3.5). Among the 35 OECD countries with valid data in 2015, the percentages ranged from 8 percent in New Zealand to 33 percent in Finland and the Republic of Korea. The percentage of students in the United States who attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered due to students lacking respect for teachers was higher than the percentages in 2 OECD countries and lower than the percentages in 5 OECD countries. Similar to the 2000 and 2015 percentages of 15-year-old students in the United States who attended schools that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by students intimidating or bullying other students, the 2000 and 2015 percentages of U.S. 15-year-old students who attended school that reported that student learning was hindered, to some extent or a lot, by students lacking respect for teachers were not measurably different. Among the 29 OECD countries that had valid data in 2000 and 2015, the percentage was higher in 2015 than in 2000 in 5 OECD countries and lower in 2015 than in 2000 in 7 OECD countries.

Victims of school-associated violent deaths may include not only students and staff members, but also others at school, 21 such as students' parents and community members. The most recent data released by the SAVD-SS cover the period from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015. During this period, there were a total of 47 student, staff, and other nonstudent school-associated violent deaths in the United States, which included 28 homicides, 17 suicides, and 2 legal intervention deaths 22 (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Of these 47 schoolassociated violent deaths, 20 homicides and 9 suicides 20 A legal intervention death is defined as a death caused by a law enforcement agent in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest a lawbreaker, suppressing a disturbance, maintaining order, or engaging in another legal action. 21 \"At school\" includes on the property of a functioning primary or secondary school, on the way to or from regular sessions at school, and while attending or traveling to or from a schoolsponsored event.

When instances of homicide and suicide of school-age youth at school were combined, there was approximately 1 student homicide or suicide at school for every 1.9 million students enrolled. 23 Data on total violent deaths, consisting of those occurring at school and away from school, were included as a point of comparison for violent deaths occurring at school. The most recent data available for total suicides of school-age youth are for the 2014 calendar year; the most recent data available for total homicides of youth are for the 2014-15 school year. 24 During the 2014-15 school year, there were 1,168 youth homicides in the United States (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2014 calendar year, there were 1,785 youth suicides. The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 3 percent of the total number of youth homicides between 1992-93 (when data collection began) and 2014-15, even though the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at school varied across the years. 25 Between 1992-93 and 2014-15, a range of 1 to 10 schoolage youth died by suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years. 23 The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade during the 2014-15 school year was 55,635,322 (see table 105.30 in Snyder and Dillow 2018). 24 Data on total suicides are from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal and data on total homicides are from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these differences in reference periods, please use caution when comparing total suicides to other categories. 25 Single incidents occurring at school with a large number of school-age victims could result in large variations in the number of homicides of school-age youth at school between two years. Please use caution when making comparisons over time. This indicator has been updated to include 2014-15 data for school-associated violent deaths and total homicides among youth in the United States, and 2014 data for total suicides among youth in the United States.

The total victimization rate for males was 38 per 1,000 male students, and the rate for females was 20 per 1,000 female students. This difference was primarily driven by a higher rate of violent victimization at school for males (25 per 1,000) than for females (10 per 1,000). The rate of theft at school for males did not differ measurably from the rate for females in 2016.

This difference was primarily due to a higher rate of violent victimizations at school for students ages 12-14 (24 victimizations per 1,000) than for students ages 15-18 (12 victimizations per 1,000). The rate of theft at school did not differ measurably between students ages 12-14 and students ages 15-18 in 2016. Away from school, the rates of total victimization, theft, and violent victimization for students ages 12-14 did not differ measurably from the rates for students ages 15-18 in 2016.

In 2015, about 6 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was lower in 2015 than in every survey year between 1993 (7 percent; the first year of data collection) and 2011 (7 percent). However, there was no measurable difference between the percentages in 2013 and 2015. In each survey year from 1993 to 2015, a lower percentage of female students than of male students in grades 9-12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months. In 2015, approximately 5 percent of female students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, compared with 7 percent of male students. The percentage of female students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was lower in 2015 than in 2013 (5 vs. 6 percent); however, the percentage for male students was not measurably different between these two years. The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school 36 \"On school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. property differed by race/ethnicity and grade level. In 2015, lower percentages of Asian students (4 percent) and White students (5 percent) than of Black students (8 percent) and Pacific Islander students (20 percent) reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). In addition, the percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was lower for White students than for Hispanic students (5 vs. 7 percent). In 2015, lower percentages of 12th-(4 percent) and 11th-graders (5 percent) than of 9th-graders (7 percent) reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. In 2015, the YRBS added a new question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 37 In 2015, a higher percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students than of heterosexual students reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months (10 vs. 5 percent; table 4.2). In addition, the percentage of students reporting being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was higher for students who were not sure about their sexual orientation than for heterosexual students (13 vs. 5 percent). 37 In this indicator, students who identified as \"gay or lesbian\" or \"bisexual\" are discussed together as the \"gay, lesbian, or bisexual\" group. Although there are likely to be differences among students who identify with each of these orientations, small sample sizes preclude analysis for each of these groups separately. Students were not asked whether they identified as transgender on the YRBS.

Students in grades 9-12 were asked how many times they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months. In 2015, about 94 percent of students reported that they had not been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (table 4.1). In contrast, 3 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property once during the previous 12 months, and 1 percent each reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property 2 or 3 times, 4 to 11 times, and 12 or more times (figure 4.3). In 2015, data on the percentage of public school students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the previous 12 months were available for 30 states and the District of Columbia. Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property ranged from 4 percent in Massachusetts to 11 percent in Arkansas (table 4.3).

Students are not the only victims of intimidation and violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit these offenses. In 2015-16, the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) asked public school teachers 38 whether they were threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12 months. These questions were also asked in the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) administered between 1993-94 and 2011-12. The NTPS was designed to allow comparisons with SASS data. However, because the 2015-16 NTPS was only administered to public school teachers whereas SASS was administered to both public and private school teachers, this indicator focuses on public school teachers only. During the 2015-16 school year, 10 percent of public school teachers reported being threatened with injury by a student from their school (figure 5.1 and table 5.1). This percentage was lower than in 1993-94 (13 percent), but higher than in 2003-04 (7 percent) and 2007-08 (8 percent). There was no measurable difference between the percentages of public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury by a student in 2011-12 and 2015-16. The percentage of public school teachers reporting that they had been physically attacked by a student from their school in 2015-16 (6 percent) was higher than in all previous survey years (around 4 percent in each survey year) except in 2011-12, when the percentage was not measurably different from that in 2015-16. During the 2015-16 school year, there was no measurable difference between the percentages of male and female public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury by a student (10 percent each; figure 5.2 and table 5.1). However, a higher percentage of female public school teachers than of 38 Includes teachers in both traditional public schools and public charter schools. male public school teachers reported being physically attacked by a student (6 percent vs. 4 percent). There were some differences in the percentages of public school teachers who reported being threatened by a student or being physically attacked by the race/ ethnicity of the teacher. In the 2015-16 school year, a higher percentage of Black public school teachers (12 percent) than of White (10 percent) and Hispanic (8 percent) public school teachers reported being threatened by a student. A higher percentage of public school teachers of other racial/ethnic groups 39 (7 percent) than of Hispanic public school teachers (5 percent) reported being physically attacked by a student. The percentages of public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury or being physically attacked by a student also varied by the instructional level of the teacher. During the 2015-16 school year, a higher percentage of elementary public school teachers than of secondary public school teachers reported being threatened with injury (11 vs. 9 percent) or being physically attacked (9 vs. 2 percent) by a student (figure 5.3 and table 5.1). The 2011-12 school year was the most recent survey year for which state-level data on public school teachers' reports of being threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student were available. During the 2011-12 school year, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury by a student ranged from 5 percent in Oregon to 18 percent in Louisiana (table 5.2).

Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. In the YRBS, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey. 50 The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported that illegal drugs were made available to them on school property decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 22 percent in 2015 (figure 9.1 and table 9.1).

In 2015, public school students' reports of the availability of illegal drugs on school property varied across the 32 states for which data were available (table 9.3). Among these states, the percentages of students reporting that illegal drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property ranged from 15 percent in Maine and Oklahoma to 30 percent in Nevada. Discipline incidents that result from illicit drugrelated activities at school reflect disruptions in the educational process and provide a gauge for the scope of drug use at school. As part of the EDFacts data collection, state education agencies report the number of discipline incidents resulting in the removal of a student for at least an entire school day that involve students' possession or use of illicit drugs on school grounds. 52 State education agencies compile these data based on incidents that were reported by their schools and school districts. 52 Includes tobacco. During the 2014-15 school year, there were 195,000 reported illicit drug-related discipline incidents in the United States (table 9.4). 53 The number of illicit drugrelated incidents varied widely across jurisdictions, due in large part to their differing population sizes. Therefore, the rate of illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students can provide a more comparable indication of the frequency of these incidents across jurisdictions. During the 2014-15 school year, the rate of illicit drug-related discipline incidents was 389 per 100,000 students in the United States. The majority of jurisdictions had rates between 100 and 1,000 illicit drug-related discipline incidents per 100,000 students during the 2014-15 school year.

A higher percentage of female than of male students reported being bullied at school during the school year in 2015 (23 vs. 19 percent). The 2015 School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey collected data on bullying 56 by asking students ages 12-18 if they had been bullied at school 57 during the school year. Students were also asked about the types and frequencies of bullying they had been subjected to, the specific characteristics related to the bullying, and whether bullying had a negative effect on various aspects of their life.

These data are also presented for crimes that were reported to the police. During the 2015-16 school year, 79 percent of public schools recorded that one or more incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place, amounting to 1.4 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1).

Similarly, a lower percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent incidents (9 percent) than middle and high schools (23 and 30 percent, respectively), a lower percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of theft (23 percent) than middle and high schools (55 and 76 percent, respectively), and a lower percentage of primary schools recorded other incidents (43 percent) than middle and high schools (77 and 88 percent, respectively). A similar pattern was observed for public schools that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police. The percentages of primary schools that reported incidents of these types of crime to the police were lower than the percentages of middle schools and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.3). Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported by public schools in 2015-16 were categorized by frequency range as well. For example, 31 percent of schools did not record a violent crime, whereas 14 percent of schools recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and table 6.4). Sixty-seven percent of schools did not report a violent crime to the police, while 3 percent of schools reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police .

Ninety percent of schools did not report a serious violent crime to the police; in contrast, less than 1 percent of schools reported 10 or more serious violent crimes to the police. The number of crimes recorded and reported by schools by frequency range also varied by school characteristics. For instance, a larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more violent incidents in 2015-16 (21 percent) than suburban schools and rural schools (14 and 7 percent, respectively; table 6.4). With regard to violent incidents reported to the police, larger percentages of town (4 percent), city (4 percent), and suburban schools (2 percent) reported 20 or more such crimes to the police than rural schools (1 percent). The percentage of schools recording 20 or more violent incidents in 2015-16 was also higher for schools where 76 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (23 percent) than for schools where a smaller percentage of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (ranging from 6 to 14 percent). However, the percentage of schools reporting 20 or more such incidents to the police did not differ measurably by percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. 44 Indicator 7"}, {"section_title": "Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools", "text": "The percentage of public schools that reported student bullying occurred at least once a week decreased from 29 percent in 199929 percent in -200029 percent in to 12 percent in 201529 percent in -16. Between 199929 percent in -200029 percent in and 2009, as well as in 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked public school principals how often certain disciplinary problems happened in their schools 45 during the school year. In 2013-14, school principals were asked to provide responses to a similar set of questions on the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school safety and discipline. 46 Using data from both surveys, this indicator examines whether the following discipline problems were reported by public schools to have occurred at least once a week: student racial/ethnic tensions, student bullying, student sexual harassment of other students, student harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity, student verbal abuse of teachers, student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the classroom. SSOCS also looked at the occurrence of gang activities during the school year; however, this item was not collected in the FRSS survey. In 2015-16, about 12 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students at least once a week (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). About 5 percent of public schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 10 percent reported acts of student disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, 2 percent each reported widespread disorder in the classroom and student racial/ethnic tensions, and 1 percent each reported sexual harassment of other 45 \"At school\" was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities.

However, respondents to the 2013-14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013-14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and difference in survey administration may have impacted 2013-14 results. students and harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity. About 10 percent of public schools reported that gang activities had happened at all during the 2015-16 school year. The percentage of public schools that reported student bullying occurred at least once a week decreased from 29 percent in 1999-2000 to 12 percent in 2015-16 (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). Similarly, the percentage of schools that reported the occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers at least once a week decreased from 13 percent in 1999-2000 to 5 percent in 2015-16. There was no measurable difference in the percentage of schools reporting student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse in 2007-08 (the first year of data collection for this item) and 2015-16. Similarly, there was no measurable difference in the percentage of schools that reported widespread disorder in the classroom in 1999-2000 and 2015-16. In 2015-16, the percentage of public schools that reported the occurrence of student racial/ethnic tensions at least once a week was lower than in most prior survey years. For example, 2 percent of schools in 2015-16 reported student racial/ethnic tensions, compared to 3 percent of schools in 1999-2000. The percentage of public schools that reported the occurrence of student sexual harassment of other students at least once a week decreased from 4 percent in 2003-04 (the first year of data collection for this item) to 1 percent in 2015-16. The percentage of public schools reporting student harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity at least once a week was lower in 2015-16 (1 percent) than in 2009-10 (3 percent; the first year of data collection for this item); however, it was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013-14.

Student bullying was the most commonly reported discipline problem among public schools across survey years. During the 2015-16 school year, the percentage of public schools reporting student bullying varied by school characteristics. For instance, the percentage of public schools that reported student bullying occurred at least once a week was higher for middle schools (22 percent) than for high schools (15 percent), combined schools (11 percent), and primary schools (8 percent). The percentage for high schools was also higher than the percentage for primary schools (figure 7.2 and table 7.1).

Public schools' reports on the occurrence of cyberbullying at school and away from school at least once a week varied by school characteristics in 2015-16. Higher percentages of middle schools and high schools reported cyberbullying among students (26 percent each) than combined schools (11 percent) and primary schools (4 percent). The percentage of public schools that reported cyberbullying among students was generally higher for schools with larger enrollment sizes. For instance, 27 percent of schools with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more students reported cyberbullying among students, compared to 13 percent of schools with 500 to 999 students enrolled and 9 percent of schools with 300 to 499 students enrolled. In 2015, a higher percentage of students from urban areas (15 percent) reported a gang presence at their school than of students from suburban (10 percent) and rural areas (4 percent). The percentage of students from urban areas who reported a gang presence at their school was lower in 2015 than in every survey year between 2001 (29 percent) and 2011 (23 percent). However, there was no measurable change in this percentage between 2013 and 2015. The same pattern was observed for students from suburban and rural areas, with lower percentages of students reporting a gang presence in 2015 than in all years from 2001 to 2011, but no measurable change between 2013 and 2015. A higher percentage of students attending public schools (11 percent) than of students attending private schools (2 percent) reported that gangs were present at their school in 2015. The percentage of public school students who reported a gang presence was lower in 2015 than in 2013 (13 percent). However, the percentage of private school students reporting a gang presence at their school in 2015 was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013. In 2015, higher percentages of Black (17 percent) and Hispanic (15 percent) students reported the presence of gangs at their school than of White (7 percent) and Asian (4 percent) students (figure 8.2 and table 8.1). In addition, a higher percentage of White students than of Asian students reported a gang presence. The percentage of students who reported a gang presence was lower in 2015 than in 2013 for both Hispanic (15 vs. 20 percent) and Asian (4 vs. 9 percent) students, while the percentages reported in 2015 by White and Black students and students of other racial/ ethnic groups were not measurably different from the percentages reported in 2013. The percentages of students in 9th through 12th grade who reported a gang presence at their school were higher than the percentages for students in 6th through 8th grade in 2015. About 13 percent each of 9th-, 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders reported the presence of gangs, compared with 7 percent each of 7th-and 8th-graders and 6 percent of 6th-graders.

The percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school was higher in 2015 than in 2013 (25 percent). The percentage of students who reported being the target of hate-related words at school in 2015 was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013. The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on students' reports of being the target of hate-related 54 words and seeing hate-related graffiti at school. 55 Specifically, students ages 12-18 were asked whether someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. Additionally, students were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their school-that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, or hallways or on the outside of the school building. In 2015, about 7 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being the target of hate-related words at school during the school year, which represented a decrease from 12 percent in 2001 (the first year of data collection for this item; figure 10.1 and table 10.1). The percentage of students who reported being the target of hate-related words at school in 2015 was not measurably different from the percentage in 2013. In 2015, about 27 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year, representing a decrease from 36 percent in 1999, when data for students' reports of seeing hate-related graffiti at school were first collected. However, the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school in 2015 was higher than the percentage in 2013 (25 percent). The percentage of male students who reported being called a hate-related word during the school year did not differ measurably from the percentage for female students in any survey year from 2001 to 2015. During this period, the percentage of male students who reported being called a hate-related word decreased from 13 to 8 percent and the percentage 54 \"Hate-related\" refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students' personal characteristics. 55 \"At school\" includes in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school. for female students decreased from 12 to 7 percent. However, for both male and female students, there were no measurable differences in the percentage of students who reported being called a hate-related word between 2013 and 2015. The percentage of male students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year did not measurably differ from the percentage for female students in most survey years from 1999 to 2015. During this period, the percentage of male students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school decreased from 34 to 26 percent and the percentage for female students decreased from 39 to 28 percent. However, for both male and female students, no measurable differences were observed between the two most recent survey years (2013 and 2015) in the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. In 2015, lower percentages of White (6 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) students than of Black (9 percent) students reported being called a haterelated word at school during the school year. Also in 2015, a lower percentage of Asian students than students of any other race/ethnicity reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year. About 17 percent of Asian students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school, compared with 25 percent of Black students, 27 percent of Hispanic students, and 29 percent of White students. The percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students who reported being called a hate-related word at school decreased between 2001 and 2015. Similarly, the percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school also decreased between 1999 and 2015.   1 Race categories exclude persons of Hispanic ethnicity. \"Other\" includes American Indians/Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and persons of Two or more races.

Some measurable differences were observed across grades in students' reports of being called a haterelated word at school. In 2015, lower percentages of 11th-and 12th-graders (6 and 5 percent, respectively) than of 6th-and 8th-graders (10 and 9 percent, respectively) reported being called a hate-related word at school. There were no measurable differences by grade, however, in the percentages of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school in 2015. In each data collection year between 1999 and 2015, a higher percentage of public school students than of private school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. For instance, in 2015, approximately 28 percent of public school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school, compared with 12 percent of private school students. The percentage of public school students who reported being called a hate-related word in 2015 was also higher than the percentage of private school students who reported so (8 vs. 3 percent). Students who reported being the target of haterelated words at school in 2015 were asked to indicate whether the derogatory word they were called referred to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. In 2015, a lower percentage of male students than of female students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their gender (1 vs. 2 percent; figure 10.2 and table 10.2). Race was the most frequently reported characteristic referred to by hate-related words. A lower percentage of White students than students of any other race/ ethnicity reported being the target of a hate-related word referring to their race in 2015. Specifically, 2 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word referring to their race, compared with 4 percent of Hispanic students, 5 percent of Black students, and 9 percent of Asian students.  Students who reported being called hate-related words were asked which specific characteristics these words were related to. If a student reported being called more than one type of hate-related word-e.g., a derogatory term related to race as well as a derogatory term related to sexual orientation-the student was counted only once in the total percentage of students who were the target of any hate-related words.

The SCS also asked students ages 12-18 who reported being bullied at school to indicate the location where they had been victimized. In 2015, of students who reported being bullied during the school year, 42 percent reported that the bullying occurred in the hallway or stairwell at school, 34 percent reported being bullied inside the classroom, and 22 percent reported being bullied in the cafeteria (figure 11.2 and table 11.2). About 19 percent of students who were bullied reported that the bullying occurred outside on school grounds, 11 percent reported that it occurred online or by text, 10 percent reported that it occurred on the school bus, 9 percent reported that it occurred in the bathroom or locker room, and 1 percent reported that it occurred somewhere else in school.  In 2015, about 67 percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that they were bullied once or twice in the school year and 33 percent indicated that they were bullied at least once or twice a month during the school year. Specifically, 19 percent reported being bullied once or twice a month, 10 percent reported being bullied once or twice a week, and 4 percent reported being bullied almost every day (figure 11.3 and table 11.3). Of all students who reported being bullied at school in 2015, about 43 percent reported notifying an adult at school 61 about the incident. Higher percentages of 6th-and 7th-graders than of 9th-through 12thgraders and a higher percentage of 8th-graders than of 10th-and 12th-graders reported notifying an adult after being bullied at school. In addition, the percentage of students who reported notifying an adult at school after being bullied was higher for those who reported being bullied once or twice a week than for those who reported being bullied once or twice a year (63 vs. 37 percent). In the 2015 SCS, students who reported being bullied at school during the school year were asked to indicate how much bullying had a negative effect on various aspects of their life. About 19 percent of students who reported being bullied at school reported that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on how they felt about themselves, 14 percent each reported that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on their relationships with friends or family and on their school work, and 9 percent reported that bullying had somewhat or a lot of negative effect on their physical health (figure 11.4 and table 11.4).  Students were also asked whether they had been subjected to bullying about a specific characteristic in the 2015 SCS. About 39 percent of students who reported being bullied at school indicated that the bullying was related to at least one of the following characteristics: physical appearance (27 percent), race (10 percent), ethnicity (7 percent), gender (7 percent), disability (4 percent), religion (4 percent), and sexual orientation (3 percent; table 11.5). Between 2005 and 2015, the percentage of students reporting being bullied at school during the school year decreased from 28 to 21 percent (table 11.1). 62 However, there was no measurable difference between 62 Prior data are excluded from the time series due to a significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005. the percentages in 2013 and 2015. A declining trend between 2005 and 2015 in the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school was also observed for some of the student and school characteristics examined. For example, the percentage of male students who reported being bullied at school decreased from 27 percent in 2005 to 19 percent in 2015. During the same period, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at school decreased for students in both suburban (from 29 to 21 percent) and rural areas (from 29 to 18 percent), as well as for students in public schools (from 29 to 21 percent; figure 11.5 and table 11.1). Between the 2013 and 2015 SCS data collections, it was determined that cyberbullying is best classified as a means of bullying; thus, the 2015 instrument included \"online or by text\" in the list of locations where bullying could have occurred, as discussed earlier in this indicator. In 2013 and earlier years, the SCS included a separate series of questions on cyberbullying experiences that occurred anywhere. In 2013, approximately 7 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being cyberbullied anywhere during the school year (table 11.6). About 3 percent of students reported that another student had posted hurtful information about them on the Internet, and 3 percent reported being the subject of harassing text messages. Some 2 percent reported being the subject of harassing instant messages and 1 percent each reported having their private information purposely shared on the Internet, being the subject of harassing e-mails, being harassed while gaming, and being excluded online. About 73 percent of students who reported being cyberbullied anywhere in 2013 indicated that they were cyberbullied once or twice in the school year and 27 percent indicated that they were cyberbullied at least once or twice a month during the school year: 15 percent reported being cyberbullied once or twice a month, 8 percent reported being cyberbullied once or twice a week, and 4 percent reported being cyberbullied almost every day (table 11.3). Of all students who reported being cyberbullied in 2013, about 23 percent reported notifying an adult at school about the incident. As mentioned in the introduction, the YRBS collects data on bullying and electronic bullying for students in grades 9-12. In 2015, data on the percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported being bullied on school property during the previous 12 months were available for 35 states and the District of Columbia (table 11.7). Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported being bullied on school property ranged from 12 percent in the District of Columbia to 26 percent in Michigan, Idaho, and Nebraska. On this survey, 20 percent of students in the United States reported being bullied on school property in 2015. Data on the percentages of students who reported being electronically bullied during the previous 12 months in 2015 were also available for 36 states and the District of Columbia. Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported being electronically bullied ranged from 8 percent in the District of Columbia to 21 percent in Idaho. About 16 percent of students in the United States reported being electronically bullied in 2015."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 12", "text": "Teachers' Reports on School Conditions During the 2015-16 school year, 43 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 38 percent agreed or strongly agreed that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. A higher percentage of secondary school teachers than of elementary school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (48 vs. 32 percent). Managing inappropriate behaviors and classroom disruptions is time-consuming and takes away from instructional time and student engagement in academic behaviors (Riley et al. 2011). In the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) administered in 2015-16, public school teachers were asked whether student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching as well as whether school rules were enforced by other teachers and by the principal at their school. These questions were also asked in previous administrations of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) from 1993-94 to 2011-12. The NTPS was designed to allow comparisons with SASS data. However, because the 2015-16 NTPS was only administered to public school teachers whereas SASS was administered to both public and private school teachers, this indicator focuses on public school teachers only. During the 2015-16 school year, 43 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 38 percent agreed or strongly agreed that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). These percentages varied by teacher and school characteristics. For instance, the percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching was higher for teachers with 3 years or fewer of teaching experience (47 percent) than for those with more years of teaching experience (ranging from 41 to 43 percent). The percentage was also higher for teachers in towns (44 percent) than for those in suburban and rural areas (40 and 37 percent, respectively). The same patterns by years of teaching experience and locale were observed for the percentage of teachers who reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching. A higher percentage of public secondary school teachers than of public elementary school teachers reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (48 vs. 32 percent). Additionally, a higher percentage of teachers in schools with 1,000 or more students enrolled (46 percent) reported these behaviors than of teachers in schools with smaller enrollment sizes (ranging from 34 to 38 percent). The percentage of public school teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated between 1993-94 and 2015-16. The percentage in 2015-16 (43 percent) was lower than in 1993-94 (44 percent) but higher than in the intervening survey years (ranging from 36 to 41 percent; figure 12.2 and table 12.1). The percentage of public school teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching increased between 1993-94 and 2015-16 (from 28 to 38 percent); however, there was no measurable difference between the two most recent survey years (2011-12 and 2015-16). During the 2015-16 school year, 67 percent of public school teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 84 percent agreed or strongly agreed that the principal enforced the school rules (figure 12.3 and table 12.2). These percentages also varied by school characteristics. For instance, a lower percentage of secondary school teachers than of elementary school teachers reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers (53 vs. 75 percent) and by the principal (82 vs. 85 percent), and a lower percentage of teachers in suburban areas than in rural areas reported so.

The 2011-12 school year was the most recent survey year for which state-level data on public school teachers' reports on various aspects of school conditions were available. In 2011-12, data were available for 45 states and the District of Columbia. Among these jurisdictions, the percentage of public school teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching ranged from 31 percent in Wyoming to 55 percent in Louisiana, and the percentage who reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching ranged from 25 percent in Kansas to 57 percent in Alaska (table 12.3).

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), students in grades 9-12 were asked about their involvement in physical fights in general (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this indicator), 63 as well as their involvement in physical fights on school property, during the 12 months preceding the survey. 64 In this indicator, percentages of students reporting involvement in a physical fight occurring anywhere are used as a point of comparison with percentages of students reporting involvement in a physical fight occurring on school property. Overall, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased between 1993 (the first year of data collection) and 2015 (from 42 to 23 percent), and the percentage of students in these grades who reported being in a physical fight on school property also decreased during this period (from 16 to 8 percent; figure 13.1 and table 13.1).

From 1993 to 2015, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere, as well as the percentage of those who reported being in a physical fight on school property, decreased for all four grade levels. The percentages of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight differed by race/ ethnicity. For example, in 2015 a higher percentage of Black students (32 percent) reported being in a physical fight anywhere during the previous 12 months than did Hispanic students (23 percent), White students (20 percent), and Asian students (15 percent; figure 13.2 and table 13.1). In addition, the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere was higher for American Indian/Alaska Native students (30 percent), students of Two or more races (28 percent), Hispanic students, and White students than for Asian students. With regard to physical fights on school property, higher percentages of Pacific Islander students (21 percent) and Black students (13 percent) reported being in a physical fight on school property in 2015 than did Asian students and White students (6 percent each). The percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property was also higher for American Indian/Alaska Native students (13 percent), students of Two or more races (9 percent), and Hispanic students (9 percent) than for White students.

During the same period, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight on school property decreased for White students (from 15 to 6 percent), Black students (from 22 to 13 percent), and Hispanic students (from 18 to 9 percent). Separate data on Asian and Pacific Islander students' involvement in a physical fight have been available since 1999. Between 1999 and 2015, the percentages of Asian students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school property both decreased (from 23 to 15 percent for anywhere and from 10 to 6 percent for on school property). The percentage of Pacific Islander students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere also decreased between 1999 and 2015 (from 51 to 29 percent). Students in grades 9-12 were asked how many times they had been in a physical fight anywhere or on school property during the previous 12 months. In 2015, about 17 percent of students in these grades reported being in a physical fight anywhere 1 to 3 times, 4 percent reported being in a physical fight anywhere 4 to 11 times, and 2 percent reported being in a physical fight anywhere 12 or more times during the previous 12 months (figure 13.3 and table 13.2). When students in these grades were asked about the incidence of physical fights on school property during the previous 12 months, 7 percent reported being in a physical fight on school property 1 to 3 times, 1 percent reported being in a physical fight on school property 4 to 11 times, and less than 1 percent reported being in a physical fight on school property 12 or more times. In 2015, a higher percentage of male than of female 9th-to 12th-graders reported being in a physical fight anywhere during the previous 12 months (28 vs. 16 percent; figure 13.3 and table 13.1). The reported frequency of fights involving students in these grades was also higher for male students than for female students (figure 13.3). Specifically, a higher percentage of male than of female students reported being in a physical fight anywhere 1 to 3 times (21 vs. 14 percent), 4 to 11 times (5 vs. 2 percent), and 12 or more times (2 vs. 1 percent) during the previous 12 months. Similarly, in 2015 a higher percentage of male students than of female students in grades 9-12 reported that they had been in a physical fight on school property (10 vs. 5 percent). In addition, a higher percentage of male than of female students reported being in a physical fight on school property 1 to 3 times (9 vs. 4 percent), 4 to 11 times (1 percent vs. less than 1 percent), and 12 or more times (1 percent vs. less than 1 percent) during the previous 12 months. The percentages of both male and female students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school property decreased between 1993 and 2015 (table 13.1). About 28 percent of male students reported being in a physical fight anywhere in 2015, compared with 51 percent in 1993; and 10 percent of male students reported being in a physical fight on school property in 2015, compared with 24 percent in 1993. About 16 percent of female students reported being in a physical fight anywhere in 2015, compared with 32 percent in 1993; and 5 percent of female students reported being in a physical fight on school property in 2015, compared with 9 percent in 1993. In 2015, the YRBS added a new question to identify students' sexual orientation by asking students in grades 9-12 which of the following best described them-\"heterosexual (straight),\" \"gay or lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"not sure.\" 65 In 2015, higher percentages of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students and students who were not sure about their sexual orientation reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school property during the previous 30 days than did heterosexual students. About 28 percent of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students and 35 percent of students who were not sure about their sexual orientation reported being in a physical fight anywhere, compared with 22 percent of heterosexual students (table 13.3). Similarly, 11 percent of gay, lesbian, or bisexual students and 15 percent of students who were not sure about their sexual orientation reported being in ! Interpret data with caution.

Data for the percentage of public school students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere in 2015 were available for 31 states and the District of Columbia. Among these jurisdictions, the percentages of students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere ranged from 15 percent in Hawaii and Maine to 32 percent in the District of Columbia (table 13.4). In 2015, data for physical fights on school property involving these students were available for 33 states and the District of Columbia; the percentages of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property ranged from 5 percent in Maine, North Dakota, and Indiana to 14 percent in the District of Columbia. This indicator uses data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to examine the percentages of students who carried a weapon on school property and anywhere, then uses state data from the EDFacts data collection to look at the numbers of incidents involving students with firearms at school by state. It concludes with a discussion of data from the School Crime Supplement (SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey on students' access to firearms at school or away from school. Readers should take note of the differing data sources and terminology. In the YRBS, students in grades 9-12 were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club anywhere during the previous 30 days and if they had carried such a weapon on school property during the same time period. 66 In this indicator, the percentage of students carrying a weapon \"anywhere\" 67 is included as a point of comparison with the percentage of students carrying a weapon on school property. In 2015, about 16 percent of students reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere at least 1 day during the previous 30 days: 8 percent reported carrying a weapon anywhere on 6 or more days, 5 percent reported carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 3 percent reported carrying a weapon on 1 day (tables 14.1 and 14.2). Also in 2015, about 4 percent of students reported carrying a weapon on school property at least 1 day during the previous 30 days. This percentage included 2 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 6 or more days, 1 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 2 to 5 days, and 1 percent of students who reported carrying a weapon on 1 day during the previous 30 days. 66 The term \"anywhere\" is not used in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) questionnaire; students were simply asked how many days they carried a weapon during the past 30 days. In the question asking students about carrying a weapon at school, \"on school property\" was not defined for survey respondents. 67 \"Anywhere\" includes on school property. The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days decreased from 22 percent in 1993 (the first year of YRBS data collection) to 16 percent in 2015, and the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days decreased from 12 percent in 1993 to 4 ercent in 2015 (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the previous 30 days was lower in 2015 than in 2013 (5 percent). However, there was no measurable difference between 2013 and 2015 in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. In every survey year from 1993 to 2015, a higher percentage of male students than of female students reported that they had carried a weapon, both anywhere and on school property, during the previous 30 days. In 2015, for example, 24 percent of male students reported carrying a weapon anywhere, compared with 8 percent of female students. In addition, 6 percent of male students reported carrying a weapon on school property, compared with 2 percent of female students. In 2015, higher percentages of American Indian/ Alaska Native students (22 percent), students of Two or more races (21 percent), and White students (18 percent) reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days than did Hispanic students (14 percent), Black students (12 percent), and Asian students (7 percent; figure 14.2 and table 14.1). Additionally, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere was higher for Pacific Islander (26 percent), Hispanic, and Black students than for Asian students. With respect to carrying a weapon on school property, a higher percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students (10 percent) than of Hispanic (5 percent), White (4 percent), This indicator repeats student-reported information from the Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2016 report, but the text has been revised to include additional breakouts that were previously included in a Spotlight feature. This indicator has also been updated to include 2015-16 data on discipline incidents related to weapons possession.

During the 2015-16 school year, 37 percent of public schools (31,100 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action-including out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services for the remainder of the school year, and transfers to specialized schools-for specific offenses (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or fights prompted the largest percentage of schools (27 percent) to respond with at least one serious disciplinary action. In response to other offenses by students, 19 percent of schools reported that they took disciplinary actions for the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 10 percent took actions for the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device; 8 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 2 percent did so for the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device. The percentage of schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action was lower in 2015-16 than in 2003-04 across all specific offense types except the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol, for which there was no measurable difference between the two years. 83 In addition, the percentage of schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action was lower in 2015-16 than in 2009-10 for the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (8 vs. 9 percent) and for use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device (10 vs. 13 percent), but there were no measurable differences between these two years for any other offenses, including the total number of offenses.

During the 2015-16 school year, a higher percentage of high schools (78 percent) took at least one serious disciplinary action than did middle schools (61 percent) and primary schools (18 percent; figure 19.2 and table 19.2). This pattern by school level was generally observed for disciplinary actions taken in response to specific offenses as well. For example, 62 percent of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs, compared with 31 percent of middle schools, and 2 percent of primary schools. A higher percentage of schools with 76 percent or more of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch took at least one serious disciplinary action (44 percent) than did schools with 0 to 25 (25 percent) and 26 to 50 percent (34 percent) of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. 84 The percentage was also higher for schools where 51 to 75 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced price lunch (41 percent) than for schools where a lower percentage of students were eligible.  A total of 305,700 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during the 2015-16 school year for specific offenses (table 19.1). The largest number of these reported disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical attacks or fights (178,000 actions). Of the serious disciplinary actions taken during the 2015-16 school year, 72 percent were out-of-school suspensions for 5 days or more, 24 percent were transfers to specialized schools, and 4 percent were removals with no services for the remainder of the school year (figure 19.3 and table 19.1). Greater percentages of out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 days or more were imposed upon students in response to physical attacks or fights (79 percent) than were imposed in response to the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (68 percent), and drugs (59 percent), and the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive (63 percent). Greater percentages of removals with no services for the remainder of the school year were imposed upon students in response to the distribution, possession, or use of drugs (7 percent) than were imposed in response to the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (4 percent), and physical attacks or fights (3 percent). Greater percentages of transfers to specialized schools were imposed in response to the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (29 percent), and drugs (34 percent), and the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive (31 percent) than were imposed in response to physical attacks or fights (18 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 20", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools", "text": "The percentage of schools that had a plan in place for procedures to be performed in the event of a shooting increased over time, from 79 percent in 2003-04 to 92 percent in 2015-16. Schools use a variety of practices and procedures to promote the safety of students, faculty, and staff. Certain practices, such as locking or monitoring doors and gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as the use of metal detectors and security cameras, are intended to monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on campus. Between 1999-2000 and 2009-10, as well as in 2015-16, the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) asked principals of public schools about their schools' use of safety and security measures and procedures. Principals were also asked to report whether their school had a written plan for procedures to be performed in selected scenarios. In 2013-14, data on safety and security measures and procedures and written plans for selected scenarios were collected from the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of school safety and discipline. 85 In the 2015-16 school year, 94 percent of public schools reported that they controlled access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (table 20.1). Other safety and security measures reported by public schools included the use of security cameras to monitor the school (81 percent), a requirement that faculty and staff wear badges or picture IDs (68 percent), and the enforcement of a strict dress code (53 percent). In addition, 25 percent of public schools reported the use of random dog sniffs to check for drugs, 21 percent required that students wear uniforms, 7 percent required students to wear badges or picture IDs, and 4 percent used random metal detector checks. 85 The 2013-14 Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey was designed to allow comparisons with School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) data. However, respondents to the 2013-14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The 2013-14 survey also relied on a smaller sample. The smaller sample size and difference in survey administration may have impacted 2013-14 results. Use of various safety and security procedures differed by school level during the 2015-16 school year (figure 20.1 and table 20.2). For example, greater percentages of public primary schools and public middle schools than of public high schools controlled access to school buildings and required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs. Additionally, a greater percentage of primary schools than of middle schools required students to wear uniforms (25 vs. 20 percent), and both percentages were greater than the percentage of high schools requiring uniforms (12 percent). The percentage of schools reporting the enforcement of a strict dress code was greater for middle schools (70 percent) than for high schools (55 percent) and primary schools (46 percent). The percentage of schools reporting the use of security cameras to monitor the school was greater for high schools (94 percent) than middle schools (89 percent), and both of these percentages were greater than the percentage for primary schools (73 percent). The same pattern was evident for the use of random dog sniffs and the use of random metal detector checks. A greater percentage of high schools (16 percent) and middle schools (13 percent) than of primary schools (3 percent) required students to wear badges or picture IDs.  1 For example, locked or monitored doors.

In 2015-16, the use of various safety and security procedures also differed by school size. A greater percentage of public schools with 1,000 or more students enrolled than of those with fewer students enrolled reported the use of security cameras, a requirement that students wear badges or picture IDs, the use of random dog sniffs, and the use of random metal detector checks (table 20.2). A smaller percentage of schools with less than 300 students enrolled than of schools with higher numbers of students enrolled reported that they required faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs. A greater percentage of schools with 300-499 students (23 percent) and 500-999 students (25 percent) than of schools with less than 300 students or 1,000 or more students (both 16 percent) required students to wear uniforms. A similar pattern was evident for controlled access to school buildings. A greater percentage of schools with 500-999 students and 1,000 or more students (both 58 percent) than of schools with 300-499 students (49 percent) or less than 300 students (47 percent) reported the enforcement of a strict dress code. A greater percentage of public schools located in cities than of those located in suburban areas, towns, and rural areas reported in 2015-16 that they used random metal detector checks, required students wear badges or picture IDs, and required students to wear uniforms (table 20.2). A greater percentage of schools located in cities (61 percent) and rural areas (54 percent) than of those located in suburbs (46 percent) reported that they enforced a strict dress code. A greater percentage of schools in suburban areas (81 percent) than of those in towns (66 percent), cities (64 percent), and rural areas (56 percent) required faculty or staff to wear badges or picture IDs. Random dog sniffs were reported by a greater percentage of public schools in rural areas (37 percent) and towns (31 percent) than in suburban areas (19 percent) and cities (15 percent). A greater percentage of schools in rural areas (84 percent) than of those in suburbs (78 percent) reported the use of security cameras, and a greater percentage of schools in cities (96 percent) than of those in rural areas (91 percent) reported controlled access to school buildings. Many safety and security measures tended to be more prevalent in schools where 76 percent or more of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than in schools where a lower percentage were eligible (table 20.2). A greater percentage of schools where 76 percent or more of students were eligible than of schools where lower percentages were eligible reported that they enforced a strict dress code, required school uniforms, and used random metal detector checks. A smaller percentage of schools where 76 percent or more of students or 25 percent or less were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (17 and 18 percent, respectively) reported the use of random dog sniffs than of schools where 26 to 50 percent of students and 51 to 75 percent of students (both 30 percent) were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. A greater percentage of schools where 25 percent or less of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (78 percent) than of schools where higher percentages of students were eligible reported requiring faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs. A smaller percentage of schools where 26 to 50 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced price lunch (4 percent) than of schools where any other percentage of students were eligible reported requiring students to wear badges or pictures IDs.  1 For example, locked or monitored doors. NOTE: Responses were provided by the principal or the person most knowledgeable about crime and safety issues at the school. Data for 2013-14 were collected using the Fast Response Survey System, while data for other years were collected using the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS). The 2013-14 survey was designed to allow comparisons with SSOCS data. However, respondents to the 2013-14 survey could choose either to complete the survey on paper (and mail it back) or to complete the survey online, whereas respondents to SSOCS did not have the option of completing the survey online. The percentages of public schools reporting the use of various safety and security measures in 2015-16 tended to be higher than in prior years (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). For example, the percentage of public schools reporting the use of security cameras increased from 19 percent in 1999-2000 to 81 percent in 2015-16. Similarly, the percentage of public schools reporting that they controlled access to school buildings increased from 75 percent to 94 percent during this period. From 1999-2000 to 2015-16, the following safety and security measures also increased: requiring faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs, use of random dog sniffs, requiring school uniforms, and requiring students to wear badges or picture IDs. Conversely, the percentage of schools that reported using random metal detector checks decreased from 7 percent in 1999-2000 to 4 percent in 2015-16. The percentage of schools reporting that they enforced a strict dress code increased from 47 percent in 1999-2000 to 58 percent in 2013-14, but the percentage in 2015-16 (53 percent) was lower than the percentage in 2013-14. Another aspect of school safety and security is ensuring that plans are in place to be enacted in the event of specific scenarios. In 2015-16, about 96 percent of public schools reported they had a written plan for procedures to be performed in the event of a natural disaster (figure 20.3 and table 20.3). 86 Ninety-four percent of public schools reported they had a plan for procedures to be performed in the event of bomb threats or incidents. The percentage of schools that had a plan in place for procedures to be performed in the event of a shooting increased over time, from 79 percent in 2003-04 to 92 percent in 2015-16. 87 In 2015-16, schools were also asked whether they had drilled students during the current school year on the use of selected emergency procedures. About 95 percent of schools had drilled students on a lockdown procedure, 88 92 percent had drilled students on evacuation procedures, 89 and 76 percent had drilled students on shelter-in-place procedures. 90 86 For example, earthquakes or tornadoes. 87 On the 2015-16 questionnaire, the wording was changed from \"Shootings\" to \"Active shooter.\" 88 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure that involves occupants of a school building being directed to remain confined to a room or area within a building with specific procedures to follow. A lockdown may be used when a crisis occurs outside of the school and an evacuation would be dangerous. A lockdown may also be called for when there is a crisis inside and movement within the school will put students in jeopardy. All exterior doors are locked and students and staff stay in their classrooms.\" 89 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure that requires all students and staff to leave the building. While evacuating to the school's field makes sense for a fire drill that only lasts a few minutes, it may not be an appropriate location for a longer period of time. The evacuation plan should encompass relocation procedures and include backup buildings to serve as emergency shelters, such as nearby community centers, religious institutions, businesses, or other schools. Evacuation also includes 'reverse evacuation,' a procedure for schools to return students to the building quickly if an incident occurs while students are outside.\" 90 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure similar to a lockdown in that the occupants are to remain on the premises; however, shelter-in-place is designed to use a facility and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily separate people from a hazardous outdoor environment. Everyone would be brought indoors and building personnel would close all windows and doors and shut down the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC). This would create a neutral pressure in the building, meaning the contaminated air would not be drawn into the building.\"  Indicator 21"}, {"section_title": "Students' Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at School", "text": "In 2015, about 83 percent of students ages 12-18 reported observing one or more security cameras to monitor the school, and 78 percent of students reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day at their schools. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked whether their schools used certain safety and security measures. 91 Students were asked about the presence of metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or assigned police officers, other adults supervising hallways, badges or picture identification for students, a written code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2015, nearly all students ages 12-18 (rounds to 100 percent) reported that they observed the use of at least one of the selected safety and security measures at their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1). In 2015, about 96 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that their schools had a written code of student conduct, higher than the percentages for all other safety and security measures examined. Most students also reported a requirement that visitors sign in and the presence of school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway (90 percent each). About 83 percent of students reported the use of one or more security cameras to monitor the school, 78 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day, 70 percent reported the presence of security guards or assigned police officers, 53 percent reported locker checks, and 24 percent reported that students were required to wear badges or picture identification at their schools. Approximately 12 percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their schools, representing the least observed of all selected safety and security measures in 2015. 91 Readers should note that this indicator relies on student reports of safety and security measures and provides estimates based on students' awareness of the measure rather than on documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the use of various safety and security measures as reported by schools. The percentage of students who reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day increased between 1999 and 2015 (from 38 to 78 percent), as did the percentages of students who reported the presence of metal detectors (from 9 to 12 percent) and the presence of security guards or assigned police officers (from 54 to 70 percent). However, no measurable differences were found between the two most recent survey years (2013 and 2015) in the percentages of students reporting these three safety and security measures. The percentage of students who reported observing school staff (other than security guards or assigned police officers) or other adults supervising the hallway was higher in 2015 (90 percent) than in 1999 (85 percent), but the percentage was not measurably different between 2013 and 2015. In 2015, the percentage of students who reported a requirement that visitors sign in (90 percent) was higher than in 1999 (87 percent) but lower than the percentage in 2013 (96 percent). Beginning in 2001, students were asked whether they observed the use of one or more security cameras to monitor the school at their schools. From 2001 to 2015, the percentage of students who reported the use of security cameras at their schools increased from 39 to 83 percent.

The number of on-campus crimes reported per 10,000 full-time-equivalent students also increased, from 18.0 in 2014 to 18.5 in 2015. Since 1990, postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV federal student financial aid programs have been required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires institutions to distribute timely warnings about crime occurrences to students and staff; to publicly report campus crime and safety policies; and to collect, report, and disseminate campus crime data. Since 1999, data on campus safety and security have been reported by institutions through the Campus Safety and Security Survey, sponsored by the Office of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education. These reports include on-campus criminal offenses and arrests involving students, faculty, staff, and the general public; and referrals for disciplinary action primarily dealing with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, and other staff). In 2015, there were 27,500 criminal incidents against persons and property on campus at public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions that were reported to police and security agencies, representing a 2 percent increase from 2014, when 26,900 criminal incidents were reported (table 22.1). The number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 fulltime-equivalent (FTE) students 92 also increased, from 18.0 in 2014 to 18.5 in 2015 (table 22.2).

In addition, 2,300 aggravated assaults and 1,000 robberies 94 were reported. These estimates translate to 8.3 burglaries, 5.4 forcible sex offenses, 2.2 motor vehicle thefts, 1.5 aggravated assaults, and 0.7 robberies per 10,000 FTE students (table 22.2). Between 2001 and 2015, the overall number of reported crimes decreased by 34 percent (figure 22.1 and table 22.1). During this time, the number of reported on-campus crimes first increased by 7 percent between 2001 and 2006 (from 41,600 to 44,500). The number of reported on-campus crimes then decreased by 40 percent between 2006 and 2014 (from 44,500 to 26,900), before increasing by 2 percent between 2014 and 2015 (from 26,900 to 27,500). The number of on-campus crimes reported in 2015 was lower than the number reported in 2001 for every category except forcible sex offenses and murder. 95 The number of reported forcible sex offenses on campus increased from 2,200 in 2001 to 8,000 in 2015 (a 262 percent increase). 96 More recently, the number of reported forcible sex offenses increased by 18 percent between 2014 and 2015 (from 6,800 to 8,000).

In 2014 and 2015, schools were asked to report the numbers of two different types of forcible sex offenses, rape and fondling, and these were added together to reach the total number of reported forcible sex offenses. In years prior to 2014, schools only reported a total number of reported forcible sex offenses, with no breakouts for specific types of offenses. About 5,100 rapes and 2,900 fondling incidents were reported in 2015.

Crimes include incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus crimes even if they involve college students or staff. Between 2006 and 2014, the number of reported on-campus crimes decreased, enrollment increased, and the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students decreased from 33.3 to 18.0. Between 2014 and 2015, the number of reported on-campus crimes increased, enrollment decreased, and the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 students increased from 18.0 to 18.5. The rate per 10,000 students was lower in 2015 than in 2001 for all types of reported on-campus crimes except forcible sex offenses and murder. In the case of forcible sex offenses, the rate increased from 1.9 per 10,000 students in 2001 to 5.4 per 10,000 students in 2015. The number of murders per 10,000 students was higher in 2015 than in 2001 (0.02 vs. 0.01). In 2015, the number of crimes committed on college campuses differed by type of institution, although to some extent this reflects the enrollment size of the types and the presence of student residence halls. Crimes involving students on campus after normal class hours, such as those occurring in residence halls, are included in campus crime reports, while crimes involving students off campus are not. In 2015, institutions with residence halls reported higher rates of on-campus crime than institutions without residence halls (24.0 vs. 6.0 per 10,000 FTE students; table 22.2). Rates for most types of crime were also higher for institutions with residence halls. For example, more burglaries were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without residence halls (10.8 vs. 2.5 per 10,000 students), and more forcible sex offenses were reported at institutions with residence halls than at institutions without them (7.4 vs. 0.8 per 10,000 students).

Arrests include incidents involving students, staff, and on-campus guests. Excludes off-campus arrests even if they involve college students or staff. Although data for different types of institutions are difficult to compare directly because of the differing structures of student services and campus arrangements, overall there were decreases in the numbers of on-campus crimes at all institution types between 2006 (when the overall number of reported on-campus crimes reached its peak since data collection began) and 2015. For example, the number of on-campus crimes decreased over this period from 20,600 to 13,500 for public 4-year institutions, from 16,900 to 10,400 for nonprofit 4-year institutions, and from 5,700 to 3,000 for public 2-year institutions (table 22.1). The decreases in the number of on-campus crimes per 10,000 FTE students over the period were from 35.5 to 19.5 for public 4-year institutions, from 57.7 to 30.8 for nonprofit 4-year institutions, and from 15.4 to 8.3 for public 2-year institutions (table 22.2). As part of the Clery Act, postsecondary institutions are also required to report the number of arrests made on campus for illegal weapons possession and drug and liquor law violations. Between 2001 and 2011, the number of on-campus arrests reported increased (from 40,300 to 54,300; figure 22.2 and table 22.1). Since 2011, the number of on-campus arrests has decreased, although the number of on-campus arrests in 2015 (40,600) was still higher than the number in 2001. The number of arrests for drug law violations increased from 11,900 to 19,400 between 2001 and 2015. Also, there was an increase in the number of arrests for liquor law violations between 2001 and 2007 (from 27,400 to 35,100); however, the number decreased between 2007 and 2015, and the 2015 figure (20,000) was lower than in any year between 2001 and 2014. There was no clear pattern of change in the number of arrests for illegal weapons possession between 2001 and 2015; the number of arrests ranged from 1,000 to 1,300 each year during this time span. The number of arrests per 10,000 FTE students for drug law violations increased from 10.2 in 2001 to 13.1 in 2015 (figure 22.2 and table 22.2). In contrast, the number of arrests per 10,000 students for liquor law violations decreased from 23.5 to 13.5 and the number of arrests per 10,000 students for illegal weapons possession decreased from 0.9 to 0.8 during this period.  In addition to reporting on-campus arrests, institutions report referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations. Disciplinary action counts only include incidents for which there was a referral for institutional disciplinary action, but no arrest. In 2015, there were 242,100 referrals for disciplinary action for cases involving illegal weapons possession, drug law violations, and liquor law violations, with most of the referrals (91 percent) involving violations in residence halls (table 22.1). The largest number of disciplinary referrals (184,700) involved liquor law violations. Similar to the number of on-campus arrests for drug law violations, the number of disciplinary referrals for these incidents increased between 2001 and 2015 (from 23,900 to 56,000, for a 134 percent increase; figure 22.3 and table 22.1). The number of referrals for liquor law violations also increased, from 130,000 in 2001 to 184,700 in 2015 (a 42 percent increase). The number of referrals for illegal weapons possession varied somewhat from year to year with no clear pattern of change, but the number of such referrals in 2015 (1,400) was higher than the number in 2001 (1,300). Part of the increase in the number of disciplinary referrals over time may be associated with increases in the number of students on college campuses over time. However, the number of referrals per 10,000 FTE students for illegal weapons possession decreased from 1.1 to 0.9 between 2001 and 2015 (figure 22.3 and table 22.2). The number of referrals per 10,000 students for drug law violations increased between 2001 and 2015 (from 20.5 to 37.7). And while the number of referrals per 10,000 students for liquor law violations increased between 2001 and 2006 (from 111.3 to 141.6), the number per 10,000 students was lower in 2015 than in 2006 (124.3 vs. 141.6). In 2015, there were 860 criminal incidents classified as hate crimes that occurred on the campuses of public and private 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions which were reported to police and security agencies (table 23. 1). The most common type of hate crime reported by institutions was destruction, damage, and vandalism (363 incidents; hereafter referred to as \"vandalism\" in this indicator), followed by intimidation (357 incidents), simple assault (79 incidents), larceny (25 incidents), aggravated assault (19 incidents), forcible sex offenses (6 incidents), burglary (4 incidents), robbery (3 incidents), and arson and motor vehicle theft (2 incidents each; figure 23.1). For murder and nonforcible sex offenses, there were no incidents classified as hate crimes in 2015."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 23", "text": "The distribution of reported on-campus hate crimes in 2015 was similar to the distributions in previous years. Vandalism, intimidation, and simple assault constituted the three most common types of hate crimes reported by institutions in every year from 2011 to 2015. Also similar to 2015, there were no reported incidents of murder and nonforcible sex offenses classified as hate crimes in any year from 2011 to 2014. Four out of five of the total reported on-campus hate crimes in 2015 were motivated by race, religion, or sexual orientation. Race was the reported motivating bias in 39 percent of hate crimes (339 incidents); religion was the reported motivating bias in 22 percent of hate crimes (187 incidents); and sexual orientation was the reported motivating bias in 19 percent of hate crimes (163 incidents) in 2015. The other one-fifth of hate crimes were motivated by ethnicity (75 incidents), gender (52 incidents), gender identity (34 incidents), and disability (10 incidents).

Similar to the overall pattern, the most frequent categories of motivating bias associated with the three most common types of hate crimes reported in 2015-vandalism, intimidation, and simple assaultwere also race, religion, and sexual orientation. Race was the most frequent category of motivating bias associated with all three types of hate crimes, accounting for 42 percent of reported vandalisms classified as hate crimes (151 incidents), 40 percent of reported intimidations (142 incidents), and 49 percent of reported simple assaults (39 incidents; figure 23.2 and table 23.1). Sexual orientation was the second most frequent motivating bias reported for intimidations (21 percent; 74 incidents) and simple assaults (23 percent; 18 incidents). Religion was the second most frequent motivating bias reported for vandalisms (30 percent; 108 incidents). While the number of hate crimes reported in 2015 was highest at 4-year public and 4-year private nonprofit postsecondary institutions (352 and 347 total incidents, respectively), to some extent this reflects their larger enrollment size and number of students living on campus. Public 2-year institutions, which also enroll a large number of students, had the third highest number of reported hate crimes (143 incidents). The frequency of crimes and the most commonly reported categories of motivating bias were similar across these types of postsecondary institutions.

A lockdown may be used when a crisis occurs outside of the school and an evacuation would be dangerous. A lockdown may also be called for when there is a crisis inside and movement within the school will put students in jeopardy. All exterior doors are locked and students and staff stay in their classrooms.\" 8 Defined for respondents as \"a procedure similar to a lockdown in that the occupants are to remain on the premises; however, shelter-in-place is designed to use a facility and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily separate people from a hazardous outdoor environment.

Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data collections include a census of all known entities in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. Differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, some questions from different surveys may appear the same, but were asked of different populations of students (e.g., students ages 12-18 or students in grades 9-12); in different years; about experiences that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere). Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the text, figures, and tables are rounded from original estimates, not from a series of rounding.

The system contains descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all homicides, suicides, or legal intervention deaths for which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school; while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school; or while attending or on the way to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of such incidents include students, as well as nonstudents (e.g., students' parents, community residents, and school staff). SAVD-SS includes data on the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). SAVD-SS uses these data to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent deaths in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The SAVD-SS has collected data from July 1, 1992 through the present. The SAVD-SS uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a systematic search of the LexisNexis newspaper and media database. Then law enforcement officials from the office that investigated the deaths are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full law enforcement report is also sought for each case.

Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans and American households each year. The survey measures both crimes reported to police and crimes not reported to the police. NCVS estimates reported in Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2013 and beyond may differ from those in previous published reports. This is because a small number of victimizations, referred to as series victimizations, are included in this report using a new counting strategy. High-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, refer to situations in which six or more similar but separate victimizations that occur with such frequency that the victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe each event in detail. As part of ongoing research efforts associated with the redesign of the NCVS, BJS investigated ways to include high-frequency repeat victimizations, or series victimizations, in estimates of criminal victimization, which would result in more accurate estimates of victimization. BJS has decided to include series victimizations using the victim's estimates of the number of times the victimization occurred over the past 6 months, capping the number of victimizations within each series at 10. This strategy balances the desire to estimate national rates and account for the experiences of persons who have been subjected to repeat victimizations against the desire to minimize the estimation errors that can occur when repeat victimizations are reported. Including series victimizations in national rates results in rather large increases in the level of violent victimization; however, trends in violence are generally similar regardless of whether series victimizations are included. For more information on the new counting strategy and supporting research, see Methods for Counting High Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey (Lauritsen et al. 2012) at https:// www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mchfrv.pdf. Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's standards for classifying federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is now followed by a new question about race. The new question about race allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. An analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new race question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of NCVS respondents, with one exception: There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution. Every 10 years, the NCVS sample is redesigned to reflect changes in the population. In the 2006 NCVS, changes in the sample design and survey methodology affected the survey's estimates. Caution should be used when comparing 2006 estimates to estimates of other years. For more information on the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization, 2006 (Rand andCatalano 2007) at https://bjs.gov/content/pub/ pdf/cv06.pdf, the technical notes at http://www. bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06tn. pdf, andCriminal Victimization, 2007 (Rand 2008) at https://www.bjs. gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf. The sample redesign also impacted the comparability of 2016 victimization estimates to estimates for earlier years. Caution should be used when making comparisons to earlier years. For more information, see Criminal Victimization, 2016 (available at https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ pdf/cv16.pdf). The number of NCVS-eligible households in the 2016 sample was approximately 173,289. Households were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interviews. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for households constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, the U.S. Census Bureau interviewer attempts to interview all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. All persons age 12 and older are interviewed every 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. Since the survey's inception, the initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of bounding and have been included in the survey estimates. After a household has been interviewed its seventh time, it is replaced by a new sample household. In 2016, the household response rate was about 78 percent, and the completion rate for persons within households was about 84 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more information about the NCVS, contact: Barbara A.

This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist policymakers, as well as academic researchers and practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The survey asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from school. Students are asked additional questions about security measures used by their school, students' participation in afterschool activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school. Students are also asked attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period from January through June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003). Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6-12, and were not homeschooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was changed and household members who attended school sometime during the school year of the interview were included. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview has always been included in analysis of the SCS data and may result in the reporting of events outside of the requested reference period. The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the SCS data files of the same year. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened (at school) and what the victim was doing when it happened (attending school or on the way to or from school) were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. Only incidents that occurred inside the United States are included. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, \"at school\" was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the definition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis using the data may be released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005,2007,2009,2011,2013, and 2015, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has several key student or school characteristic variables for which data are known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, age, race/ethnicity, household income, region, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000-$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500-$14,999, $15,000-$24,999, and $25,000-$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem. In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other races/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other races/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting that the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. In 2011, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age variable. Respondents 12 to 17 years old had higher response rates than did 18-year-old respondents in the NCVS and SCS interviews. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse. The weighting adjustments that correct for differential response rates are created by region, age, race, and sex, and should have reduced the effect of nonresponse. In 2013, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the age, region, and Hispanic origin variables in the NCVS interview response. Within the SCS portion of the data, only the age and region variables showed significant unit nonresponse bias. Further analysis indicated only the age 14 and the west region categories showed positive response biases that were significantly different from some of the other categories within the age and region variables. Based on the analysis, nonresponse bias seems to have little impact on the SCS results. In 2015, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for age, race, Hispanic origin, urbanicity, and region in the NCVS interview response. For the SCS interview, the age, race, urbanicity, and region variables showed significant unit nonresponse bias. The age 14 group and rural areas showed positive response biases that were significantly different from other categories within the age and urbanicity variables. The northeast region and Asian race group showed negative response biases that were significantly different from other categories within the region and race variables. These results provide evidence that these subgroups may have a nonresponse bias associated with them. Response rates for most SCS survey items in all survey years were high-typically 95 percent or more, meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in all SCS data years.

In each survey, the target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size."}, {"section_title": "Rachel Hansen", "text": "The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9-12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. In surveys conducted before 2013, three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high minority enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of Black or Hispanic enrollment. In 2013 and 2015, only selection of two classes per grade was needed to achieve an adequate precision with minimum variance. Approximately 16,300 students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900 participated in t he 1995 su r ve y, 16 ,30 0 pa r t icipated i n the 1997 survey, 15,300 participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600 participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200 participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900 participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000 participated in the 2007 survey, 16,400 participated in the 2009 survey, 15,400 participated in the 2011 survey, 13,600 participated in the 2013 survey, and 15,600 participated in the 2015 survey. The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, 71 percent for the 2009 survey, 71 percent for the 2011 survey, 68 percent for the 2013 survey, and 60 percent for the 2015 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are generally required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. A school nonresponse bias analysis, however, was done for the 2015 survey. This analysis found some evidence of potential bias by school type and urban status, but concluded that the bias had little impact on the overall estimates and would be further reduced by weight adjustment. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page (http:// nccd.cdc.gov/YouthOnline/). Each state and district school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9-12 in their jurisdiction. All except one state sample (South Dakota), and all district samples, include only public schools, and each district sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area). In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9-12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9-12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. In 2015, a total of 37 states and 19 districts had weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained in the 37 states. For example, Texas was not one of the 37 states that obtained weighted data but it contained two districts that did. For more information on the location of the districts, please see http://www.cdc. gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation.htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and district YRBS ranged from 1,052 to 55,596. School response rates ranged from 70 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 64 to 90 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 88 percent. Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2007,2009,2011,2013, and 2015 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) \"Are you Hispanic or Latino?\" (response options were \"yes\" and \"no\"), and (2) \"What is your race?\" (response options were \"American Indian or Alaska Native,\" \"Asian,\" \"Black or African American,\" \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,\" or \"White\"). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as \"Hispanic\" if they answered \"yes\" to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as \"More than one race.\" Students who answered \"no\" to the first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered \"no\" to the first question but did not answer the second question. CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ ethnicity among high school students. Eaton et al. (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

Data reported by districts, schools, principals, teachers, and library media centers provide a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States that may be used by policymakers and the general public. The SASS system covers a wide range of topics, including teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, teachers' and principals' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher and principal compensation, district hiring and retention practices, general conditions in schools, and basic characteristics of the student population. SASS data are collected through a mail questionnaire with telephone and in-person field follow-up. SASS has been conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for NCES since the first administration of the survey, which was conducted during the 1987-88 school year. Subsequent SASS administrations were conducted in 1990-91, 1993-94, 1999-2000, 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12. SASS is designed to produce national, regional, and state estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, school districts, principals, teachers, and school library media centers; and national and regional estimates for public charter schools, as well as principals, teachers, and school library media centers within these schools. For private schools, the sample supports national, regional, and affiliation estimates for schools, principals, and teachers. From its inception, SASS has had five core components: school questionnaires, teacher listing forms, teacher questionnaires, principal questionnaires, and school district (prior to 1999-2000, \"teacher demand and shortage\") questionnaires. A sixth component, school library media center questionnaires, was introduced in the 1993-94 administration and has been included in every subsequent administration of SASS. School library data were also collected in the 1990-91 administration of the survey through the school and principal questionnaires. Although the five core questionnaires and the school library media questionnaires have remained relatively stable over the various administrations of SASS, the survey has changed to accommodate emerging issues in elementary and secondary education. Some items have been added, some have been deleted, and some questionnaire items have been reworded. During the 1990-91 SASS cycle, NCES worked with the Office of Indian Education to add an Indian School Questionnaire to SASS, and it remained a part of SASS through 2007-08. The Indian School Questionnaire explores the same school-level issues that the Public and Private School Questionnaires explore, allowing comparisons among the three types of schools. The 1990The -91, 1993The -94, 1999The , 2003The -04, and 2007 administrations of SASS obtained data on Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools (schools funded or operated by the BIE), but the 2011-12 administration did not collect data from BIE schools. SASS estimates for all survey years presented in this report exclude BIE schools, and as a result, estimates in this report may differ from those in previously published reports. School library media center questionnaires were administered in public, private, and BIE schools as part of the 1993-94 and 1999-2000 SASS. During the 2003-04 administration of SASS, only library media centers in public schools were surveyed, and in 2007-08 library media centers in public schools and BIE and BIE-funded schools were surveyed. The 2011-12 survey collected data only on school library media centers in traditional public schools and in public charter schools. School library questions focused on facilities, services and policies, staffing, technology, information literacy, collections and expenditures, and media equipment. New or revised topics included access to online licensed databases, resource availability, and additional elements on information literacy. The Student Records and Library Media Specialist/Librarian Questionnaires were administered only in 1993-94. As part of the 1999-2000 SASS, the Charter School Questionnaire was sent to the universe of charter schools in operation in 1998-99. In 2003-04 and in subsequent administrations of SASS, charter schools were included in the public school sample as opposed to being sent a separate questionnaire. Another change in the 2003-04 administration of SASS was a revised data collection procedure using a primary in-person contact within the school intended to reduce the field follow-up phase. The SASS teacher surveys collect information on the characteristics of teachers, such as their age, race/ethnicity, years of teaching experience, average number of hours per week spent on teaching activities, base salary, average class size, and highest degree earned. These teacher-reported data may be combined with related information on their school's characteristics, such as school type (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, private other religious, and private nonsectarian), community type, and school enrollment size. The teacher questionnaires also ask for information on teacher opinions regarding the school and teaching environment. In 1993-94, about 53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, about 56,300 public school teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003-04, about 52,500 public school teachers and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007-08, about 48,400 public school teachers and 8,200 private school teachers were sampled. In 2011-12, about 51,100 public school teachers and 7,100 private school teachers were sampled. Weighted overall response rates in 2011-12 were 61.8 percent for public school teachers and 50.1 percent for private school teachers. The SASS principal surveys focus on such topics as age, race/ethnicity, sex, average annual salary, years of experience, highest degree attained, perceived influence on decisions made at the school, and hours spent per week on all school activities. These data on principals can be placed in the context of other SASS data, such as the type of the principal's school (e.g., public traditional, public charter, Catholic, other religious, or nonsectarian), enrollment, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch. In 2003-04, about 10,200 public school principals were sampled, and in 2007-08, about 9,800 public school principals were sampled. In 2011-12, about 11,000 public school principals and 3,000 private school principals were sampled. Weighted response rates in 2011-12 for public school principals and private school principals were 72.7 percent and 64.7 percent, respectively. The SASS 2011-12 sample of schools was confined to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, the Department of Defense overseas schools, the BIE schools, and schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded Crime statistics are collected and disseminated by campus security authorities. These authorities include campus police; nonpolice security staff responsible for monitoring campus property; municipal, county, or state law enforcement agencies with institutional agreements for security services; individuals and offices designated by the campus security policies as those to whom crimes should be reported; and officials of the institution with significant responsibility for student and campus activities. The act requires disclosure for offenses committed at geographic locations associated with each institution. For on-campus crimes, this includes property and buildings owned or controlled by the institution. In addition to on-campus crimes, the act requires disclosure of crimes committed in or on a noncampus building or property owned or controlled by the institution for educational purposes or for recognized student organizations, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. There are three types of statistics described in this report: criminal offenses; arrests for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws; and disciplinary referrals for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws. Criminal offenses include homicide, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assaults, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Only the most serious offense is counted when more than one offense was committed during an incident. The two other categories, arrests and referrals, include counts for illegal weapons possession and violation of drug and liquor laws. Arrests and referrals relate to only those that are in violation of the law and not just in violation of institutional policies. If no federal, state, or local law was violated, these events are not reported. Further, if an individual is arrested and referred for disciplinary action for an offense, only the arrest is counted. Arrest is defined to include persons processed by arrest, citation, or summons, including those arrested and released without formal charges being placed. Referral for disciplinary action is defined to include persons referred to any official who initiates a disciplinary action of which a record is kept and which may result in the imposition of a sanction. Referrals may or may not involve the police or other law enforcement agencies. All criminal offenses and arrests may include students, faculty, staff, and the general public. These offenses may or may not involve students that are enrolled in the institution. Referrals primarily deal with persons associated formally with the institution (i.e., students, faculty, staff). Campus security and police statistics do not necessarily reflect the total amount or even the nature of crime on campus. Rather, they reflect incidents that have been reported and recorded by campus security and/or local police. The process of reporting and recording alleged criminal incidents involve some well-known social filters and steps beginning with the victim. First, the victim or some other party must recognize that a possible crime has occurred and report the event. The event must then be recorded, and if it is recorded, the nature and type of offense must be classified. This classification may differ from the initial report due to the collection of additional evidence, interviews with witnesses, or through officer discretion. Also, the date an incident is reported may be much later than the date of the actual incident. For example, a victim may not realize something was stolen until much later, or a victim of violence may wait a number of days to report a crime. Other factors are related to the probability that an incident is reported, including the severity of the event, the victim's confidence and prior experience with the police or security agency, or influence from third parties (e.g., friends and family knowledgeable about the incident). Finally the reader should be mindful that these figures represent alleged criminal offenses reported to campus security and/ or local police within a given year, and they do not necessarily reflect prosecutions or convictions for crime. More information on the reporting of campus crime and safety data may be obtained from: The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting (U.S. Department of Education 2016) http://www2. ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/campus.html#handbook. or school districts. EDFacts does not collect studentlevel records. The entities that are required to report EDFacts data vary by data group but may include the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense (DoD) dependents schools, the Bureau of Indian Education, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. More information about EDFacts file specifications and data groups can be found at http:// www.ed.gov/edfacts. EDFacts is a universe collection and is not subject to sampling error, but nonsampling errors such as nonresponse and inaccurate reporting may occur. The U.S. Department of Education attempts to minimize nonsampling errors by training data submission coordinators and reviewing the quality of state data submissions. However, anomalies may still be present in the data. Differences in state data collection systems may limit the comparability of EDFacts data across states and across time. To build EDFacts files, state education agencies rely on data that were reported by their schools and school districts. The systems used to collect these data are evolving rapidly and differ from state to state. For example, there is a large shift in California's firearm incident data between 2010-11 and 2011-12. California cited a new student data system that more accurately collects firearm incident data as the reason for the magnitude of the difference. In some cases, EDFacts data may not align with data reported on state education agency websites. States may update their websites on different schedules than those they use to report to ED. Further, ED may use methods to protect the privacy of individuals represented within the data that could be different from the methods used by an individual state. EDFacts firearm incidents data are collected in data group 601 within file 094. EDFacts collects this data group on behalf of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. The definition for this data group is \"The number of incidents involving students who brought or possessed firearms at school.\" The reporting period is the entire school year. Data group 601 collects separate counts for incidents involving handguns, rifles/shotguns, other firearms, and multiple weapon types. The counts reported here exclude the \"other firearms\" category. For more information about this data group, please see file specification 094 for the relevant school year, available at http://www2.ed.gov/ about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html. EDFacts discipline incidents data are collected in data group 523 within file 030. EDFacts collects this data group on behalf of the Office of Safe and Healthy Students and the School Improvement Grant program in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. The definition for this data group is \"The cumulative number of times that students were removed from their regular education program for at least an entire school day for discipline.\" The reporting period is the entire school year. For more information about this data group, please see file specification 030 for the relevant school year, available at http://www2. ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html.

PISA also includes measures of general, or cross-curricular, competencies such as learning strategies. PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling. PISA is a 2-hour exam. Assessment items include a combination of multiple-choice questions and openended questions that require students to develop their own response. PISA scores are reported on a scale that ranges from 0 to 1,000, with the OECD mean set at 500 and a standard deviation set at 100. In 2015, literacy was assessed in science, reading, and mathematics through a computer-based assessment in the majority of countries, including the United States. Education systems could also participate in optional pencil-and-paper financial literacy assessments and computer-based mathematics and reading assessments. In each education system, the assessment is translated into the primary language of instruction; in the United States, all materials are written in English. Forty-three education systems participated in the 2000 PISA; 41 education systems participated in 2003; 57 (30 OECD member countries and 27 nonmember countries or education systems) participated in 2006; and 65 (34 OECD member countries and 31 nonmember countries or education systems) participated in 2009. (An additional nine education systems administered the 2009 PISA in 2010.) In PISA 2012, 65 education systems (34 OECD member countries and 31 nonmember countries or education systems), as well as the U.S. states of Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts, participated. In the 2015 PISA, 73 education systems (35 OECD member countries and 31 nonmember countries or education systems), as well as the states of Massachusetts and North Carolina and the territory of Puerto Rico, participated. To implement PISA, each of the participating education systems scientifically draws a nationally representative sample of 15-year-olds, regardless of grade level. In the PISA 2015 national sample for the United States, about 5,700 students from 177 public and private schools were represented. Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico also participated in PISA 2015 as separate education systems. In Massachusetts, about 1,400 students from 48 public schools participated; in North Carolina, about 1,900 students from 54 public schools participated; and in Puerto Rico, about 1,400 students in 47 public and private schools participated. The intent of PISA reporting is to provide an overall description of performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years, and to provide a more detailed look at each domain in the years when it is the major focus. These cycles will allow education systems to compare changes in trends for each of the three subject areas over time. In the first cycle, PISA 2000, reading literacy was the major focus, occupying roughly twothirds of assessment time. For 2003, PISA focused on mathematics literacy as well as the ability of students to solve problems in real-life settings. In 2006 PISA focused on science literacy; in 2009, it focused on reading literacy again; and in 2012, it focused on mathematics literacy. PISA 2015 focused on science, as it did in 2006. PISA also includes questionnaires that elicit contextual information for interpreting student achievement. For example, principals in participating schools are asked about school climate, specifically, the extent to which student learning at the school is hindered by student truancy, students skipping classes, student use of alcohol or illegal drugs, students intimidating or bullying other students, and students lacking respect for teachers, among other circumstances.

Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) technique. The coefficient of variation (CV) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. With the exception of Indicator 2, the CV was calculated for all estimates in this report, and in cases where the CV was between 30 and 50 percent the estimates were noted with a \"!\" symbol (interpret data with caution). In Indicator 2, the \"!\" symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases or the CV was greater than 50 percent. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the CV was 50 percent or greater, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons in the text based on sample survey data have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Findings described in this report with comparative language (e.g., higher, lower, increase, and decrease) are statistically significant at the .05 level. Comparisons based on universe data do not require statistical testing, with the exception of linear trends. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula: \u221ase 2 + se 2 -(2 * r * se 1 * se 2 ) where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared to the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is rejected. Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and betweengroup variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared to published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables. Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by another resulting from interpersonal violence. Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more offenders. Instructional level Teachers are divided into elementary or secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of their classes. Those with only ungraded classes become elementary level teachers if their main assignment is Early childhood/preK or Elementary, or they teach either special education in a self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, elementary level teachers generally teach any of grades preK-5; report a main assignment in an Early childhood/preK, Elementary, Self-contained special education, or Elementary enrichment program; or report that the majority of grades taught are K-6. In general, secondary level teachers instruct any of grades 7-12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7-12 than lower level grades. Legal intervention death A death caused by a law enforcement agent in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest a lawbreaker, suppressing a disturbance, maintaining order, or engaging in another legal action."}, {"section_title": "Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)", "text": "Geographic entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing federal statistics. Middle school A school in which the lowest grade is not lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 9. Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is more than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn within that sample. For example, at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, households are sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks. On school property On school property is included in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey question wording, but was not defined for respondents. Physical attack or fight An actual and intentional touching or striking of another person against his or her will, or the intentional causing of bodily harm to an individual. Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based upon specific information elicited directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts.
