The prevalence of dementia doubles every 5 years from the age of 65 so that around 40% in the age group 90-95 years are affected. With increasing life expectancy across the world, dementia is a rapidly growing socio-economical and medical problem. 1 The pathogenic process of AD probably starts decades before the clinical onset of the disease. 2 During this pre-clinical period there is a gradual loss of axons and neurons and at a certain threshold the first symptoms, most often impaired episodic memory, appear. These patients do not fulfil the criteria for dementia and may be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, MCI is a very common syndrome in elderly and the aetiology is heterogeneous. Even though around 40 to 60% of the MCI patients develop AD during the first 5 years, many subjects have a stable form of memory impairment. 3, 4 Moreover, early stages of e.g. vascular dementia (VaD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can be preceded by MCI. 4 Depression may also mimic the condition. To date, there is no established method to predict progression to AD among individuals with MCI. Hence, new tools to aid in the diagnostic work-up of individuals with MCI would be of fundamental public health importance. Such tools would be of even greater significance if new drug candidates such as \u03b2-sheet breakers, \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretase inhibitors and\nA\u03b2 immunotherapy prove to have disease-arresting effects. These types of drugs are likely to have the best efficacy in the early or even pre-clinical phase of the disease, when the synaptic and neuronal loss has not become too widespread. 5, 6 In fact, lack of tools to detect pre-clinical AD has been suggested to be one of the main obstacles for the development of new anti-AD therapeutics. 7 Earlier studies indicate that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers may be useful for defining a subgroup of MCI patients at especially high risk of developing AD. 5, 8, 9 However, the clinical follow-up in these studies has been short, generally only around 1 to 2 years. 5, 8, 9 Given that 8-15% of the MCI cases progress to AD each year, a very extensive follow-up period (>4-5 years) would be needed to ascertain whether a stable MCI patient really does not suffer from incipient AD. 5 Moreover, when assessing the accuracy of a diagnostic test, the study should preferably include a consecutive series of patients from a relevant clinical population. [10] [11] [12] However, the MCI subjects included in CSF studies have generally been highly selected, e.g.\nby inclusion of only those MCI patients that progress to AD and exclusion of MCI subjects with signs of cerebrovascular disease or depression. 5 Furthermore, so far only one CSF study has investigated a consecutive series of MCI patients, in which 57 MCI subjects were followed for an average of 2 years. 9 In that study, only CSF T-tau was analysed.\nIn order to study the association between CSF biomarkers and incipient AD in a clinically relevant, heterogeneous population of MCI subjects, we evaluated a consecutive series of 180 patients with MCI. Out of these, 137 (76%) underwent lumbar puncture at baseline, and were included in the study. The MCI patients were followed clinically at least until they developed a certain type of dementia or until they had been cognitively stable for a median of 5\u00b72 (range 4\u00b70-6\u00b78) years. The ability of CSF biomarkers at baseline to predict AD was assessed.\nFurthermore, the predictive value of CSF biomarkers was compared to other known risk factors for AD. To our knowledge, this is the largest study, with the longest average follow-up time, evaluating CSF biomarkers in MCI patients. Furthermore, the MCI patients were recruited consecutively in order to reduce ascertainment and participation bias. Patients with other causes of cognitive impairment, including brain tumour, subdural haematoma, CNS infection, and current alcohol abuse were excluded. However, it is very important to include a clinically relevant population of subjects with MCI, which reflects the normal clientele in a memory clinic 10 , even though such an MCI population is heterogeneous."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MCI subjects at baseline", "text": "Therefore, the MCI subjects were allowed to exhibit white matter changes or silent brain infarcts, because these changes are common in elderly subjects with or without cognitive deficits. 18 Similarly, depressive symptoms and low plasma concentrations of vitamin B12 or folate were treated at baseline, but we did not exclude these patients from the study. 19 All patients gave informed consent to participate in the study.

Total-tau (T-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau 181 ) and \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b242) levels were determined using the xMAP technology and the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 kit (Innogenetics) as previously described in detail. 24 In brief, this technology is based on flow cytometric separation of antibody-coated microspheres that are labelled with a specific mixture of two fluorescent dyes. After binding of a biotinylated reporter antibody, quantification is made by binding of a third fluorochrome coupled to streptavidin. The technique allows for simultaneous measurement of several analytes in the same tube. The CSF levels of T-tau, P-tau 181 and A\u03b242 are highly correlated to the levels obtained by conventional ELISA measurements. 24 The bestcutting values for the different combinations of the CSF biomarkers were established in the whole control and MCI patient material as those giving the highest Youden index. 25 "}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": "To compare demographic, clinical and CSF baseline data between groups, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was performed followed by Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables.

People's awareness of the availability of drug treatment has resulted in patients seeking medical advice at an earlier stage of the disease, making the percentage of MCI cases at memory disorder clinics increase.\nTo date there is no diagnostic method to determine if MCI in a certain patient will progress to AD with dementia, remain stable or deteriorate to other dementia types. 5, 7 Such diagnostic tools will be very important when evaluating the effects of potentially disease-arresting treatments, since such therapies will probably be more efficient if initiated before widespread neuronal death and dysfunction is already established. Interestingly, two recent studies, using transgenic mice, have shown that tau pathology is only reversible if intervention occurs early in the disease process. 26, 27 Thus, there is a great need to find diagnostic tools to identify incipient AD among subjects with MCI.\nIn this clinically based study, a consecutive series of 137 patients with MCI were included and CSF was obtained at baseline. The MCI patients were followed clinically for an average of more than five years. A combination of baseline CSF T-tau and A\u03b242 yielded a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83% for detection of incipient AD among MCI patients. When using combination of T-tau and the A\u03b242/P 181 -tau ratio, 28,29 the specificity was slightly higher. However, more studies are needed to answer the question which combination has the best performance, since the differences in our study were subtle. The predictive power of all the different combinations of CSF biomarkers was much stronger than, and independent of, other established risk factors such as age, gender, education, APOE genotype, plasma homocysteine, blood pressure and low performance on brief cognitive tests.\nCorroborating earlier data, 5, 8, 30 MCI patients with progression to AD had an increased baseline level of T-tau and P-tau 181 , while the level of A\u03b242 was decreased. However, our study differs from previous studies in that both the MCI patients and controls were followed for a long time. Thus, the diagnosis of stable MCI is more reliable in this study compared to previous investigations. 5, 8, 9 However, an even more extensive follow-up time (>5 years) of the stable MCI subjects than in our study might increase the specificity of CSF biomarkers further, because some of the stable MCI cases with pathological CSF might still develop AD later on.\nThe specificity of the combination of CSF T-tau and A\u03b242 was 92% in our control group, and 90% when the same cut-off levels were applied in a previously published control population consisting of 53 healthy subjects. 24 This specificity level may be acceptable considering that approximately 5-10% of control subjects might develop AD within 10 years time. 31 It is important to note that the cut-off levels differ between different studies. This is a general problem, probably caused by the lack of external control programmes for CSF biomarkers, resulting in unsatisfactory standardization of biomarker levels between different laboratories.\nAnother problem is the use of different principles for establishing cut-offs between studies.\nThus, there are no accepted cut-off values for MCI (or AD) populations. An external control programme is under planning as a part of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging (ADNI)\nproject both in the US and in Europe.\nTo our knowledge, this study has the largest sample size and the most extensive clinical follow-up, including many different diagnostic modalities. Further, the study population was recruited consecutively, which reduces the risk of ascertainment and participation bias."}, {"section_title": "10-12", "text": "The study also reflects the heterogeneity of MCI patients in the clinic, because MCI patients with depressive symptoms or vascular risk factors at baseline were also included. 18, 19 The inclusion of MCI patients with vascular risk factors, e.g. silent brain infarcts, might account for the fact that some MCI subjects developed VaD during follow-up. Last, we compare the predictive power of CSF biomarkers with other established risk factors for AD. It should be noted, however, that although some selected variables were controlled for, there might still be factors confounding the association between CSF biomarkers and incipient AD. Nevertheless, the achieved results are relevant both to clinicians working with MCI patients and to researchers designing clinical trials of anti-AD drugs with possible disease-arresting effects.\nNeuroimaging methods and cognitive tests might aid in detection of incipient AD among MCI cases. However, a crucial problem with these methods is that the reliability of each is a function of disease severity, and therefore as we attempt to identify individuals at progressively earlier stages of the disease there is a risk of increasing overlap between subjects with incipient AD and those with normal aging, psychiatric illness or incipient vascular dementia. 32 Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies indicate that brain atrophy is associated with increased risk of conversion from MCI to AD, with hazard ratios of around 1\u00b75-3\u00b70. 33, 34 However, the overlap in these studies between cases with or without AD at follow-up indicates that MRI is unlikely to provide absolute prognostic information for individual MCI patients. 33, 34 On the contrary, as our study indicates, molecular changes that can be measured in the CSF are probably well underway when the earliest symptoms of AD become clinically manifest.\nTaken together, our results show that CSF analyses of T-tau, P-tau 181 open squares = cognitively stable controls."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2", "text": "Example of Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rate of progression to AD in MCI subjects with either normal CSF or pathological CSF at baseline using the combination of T-tau and A\u03b242.\nCut-off values for pathological CSF was >350 ng/L for T-tau and <530 ng/L for A\u03b242.
