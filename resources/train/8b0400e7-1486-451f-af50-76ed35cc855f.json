In particular, the phenotypes of the frontotemporal dementias (FTD), 17, 18 vascular dementia syndromes, 19, 20 and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 21 are not easily or well-identified with DSM dementia criteria. 22 For each of these disorders there have been recently operationalized criteria proposed through consensus meetings with resultant publications that are allowing the phenotypes to be tested. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] As some of these disorders require primary or secondary treatment interventions and differential pharmacological management, familiarity will be imperative for primary care physicians and specialists who are involved in the care of dementia. The era where such distinctions were only of academic significance is over."}, {"section_title": "DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES", "text": "Amongst the primary degenerative dementias is DLB, a disorder that has been proposed to have both distinctive phenotypic and neuropathological features. 28 Nosologically it has been referred to variably as senile dementia of the Lewy body type, dementia associated with cortical Lewy bodies, diffuse Lewy body disease, and the Lewy body variant of AD. 21, [29] [30] [31] The Lewy body, a neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion, is the pathological hallmark of the dementia with distribution about the brain stem, cortex, and limbic pathways.\nClinically the phenotype of DLB includes a cognitive disorder that is prominent and progressive. There are fluctuations in the cognitive disorder that can occur over periods of hours, days or weeks. During fluctuations, cognitive function can range from near normal to markedly impaired. However, the decline is THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES Suppl. 1 -S18 progressive with time. The patterns of fluctuations can suggest a state of recurrent or chronic delirium, yet workup for toxic/metabolic causes, cerebrovascular events, and intercurrent illness is negative. The cognitive deficits particularly involve attention and executive functions, with a particular prominence of visuospatial impairments. Memory can be relatively preserved early on. Behaviorally there are usually prominent and persistent visual hallucinations, with recurrent and well-formed features often of people and animals coming into the home. In comparing the visual hallucinations between DLB and AD, it has been reported that in DLB they are more prevalent, more likely to be multiple, to speak, and to be persistent. 32 Mild Parkinsonism is often identified in DLB and may be the presenting symptom with rigidity and bradykinesia but not commonly resting tremor. DLB can also overlap clinically with classical Parkinson's disease with dementia, as well as with AD with Parkinsonism.\nNeurochemically there is a more significant regional diminution of acetylcholine (Ach) in DLB than in AD. The neuronal losses in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in DLB has been reported to be larger than the corresponding losses in AD. 33 The combination of neuronal loss and Lewy body formation in the nucleus basalis of Meynert likely contribute to the reduction in cortical choline acetyltransferase in DLB. 33 The combination of deep cholinergic deficits in DLB, coupled to Lewy body pathology, support the contention that it is a distinct disorder. 34, 35 There are distinctive pharmacological management considerations for this dementia. Management of behavioral manifestations is challenging, as there is an important neuroleptic hypersensitivity with this disease. The use of traditional neuroleptics has been associated with severe complications, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome 36 and shortened survival, and should be avoided. The safety of the newer atypical neuroleptics, such as respiridone, olanzepine and quetiapine, has not been established in DLB and must also be used with great caution until data to the contrary is reported. There are recent data emerging that the symptoms of DLB can be treated effectively with cholinesterase inhibitors. 37, 38 A recently reported randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study of rivastigmine for the treatment of DLB reported both cognitive and behavioral benefits for rivastigmine during a 12 week trial. 38 Though there is theoretical concern about AchEIs worsening Parkinsonian signs in DLB, this did not emerge as a problem in this rivastigmine study. 38 An international consensus paper was published in 1996 21 providing a proposed clinical and neuropathological framework for diagnosis (Appendix C). These proposed diagnostic criteria have since been shown to have very good specificity in the range of 85-90%. However, they have had a much lower sensitivity (20-40%) in some reports. 2 7 , 3 9 The coexistence of mixed pathologies in 1/3 of cases has limited the diagnostic sensitivity of the DLB diagnostic criteria. 39, 40 The pathological diagnostic criteria for DLB emphasize the presence of Lewy Bodies in cortical, limbic, and brain stem structures, frequently but not always associated with senile neuritic plaque scores sufficient to meet CERAD AD diagnostic criteria. [41] [42] [43] There are a minority of reported cases of DLB where senile neuritic plaques are not present and CERAD criteria are not met. 30 Given that these consensus criteria are relatively recent it has not been possible to assess the prevalence of DLB in population based samples. In a survey of selected Canadian dementia research centers (C5R) there was a reported range of prevalence of 1-10% of referred subjects with DLB across the eight centers."}, {"section_title": "PICK COMPLEX OR FRONTOTEMPORAL DEGENERATIONS", "text": "In contrast to AD, individuals with dementia resulting from frontotemporal degeneration may have no significant memory impairment initially. Rather they present with behavioral changes or language disorders. Such patients, on the basis of this relative sparing of memory, may not fulfil the general dementia criteria as they are specified in the DSM criteria, yet it is clinically apparent that they have a dementia nonetheless. If, in fact, more comprehensive and increasingly difficult memory tests are given, it is usually possible to show changes even in early cases of FTD in underlying attention or concentration abilities. Frontotemporal dementia is defined by a progressive loss of behavioral control that, as a rule, is frequently accompanied by impaired expressive language commencing in the presenium (under age 65). The presenting features of the FTDs allow some clinical phenotypic fractionation. However, such etiologic subclassification is not always possible. The Lund Manchester working group on FTD has proposed a checklist approach to a rather lengthy list of clinical features. 17 Over time this checklist seems likely to evolve into a validated set of diagnostic criteria. The core neurobehavioral features of FTD include apathy, loss of personal hygiene, loss of social awareness, disinhibition, mental rigidity, inflexibility, h y p e r o r a l i t y, perseverative behavior, utilization behavior, distractibility and loss of insight. The presenting apathy, indifference, remoteness, inertia and aspontaneity are often mistaken for depression. The progressive impairment of expressive language that develops, with reduced speech, eventually mutism, with the concomitant disinhibition, clearly indicates to clinicians that there is more than a depressive episode at hand.\nThe approaches to the classification of the FTDs have been based either on clinical or pathological features, which has tended to create a nosological dichotomy. Pick originally described the clinical syndrome of FTD and progressive aphasia that came to be known as Pick's disease. However, this disease was subsequently defined by the histopathology of Pick bodies, the round, silver staining inclusions in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontotemporal cortex. It was more recently recognized that the majority of clinical Pick's disease do not have actual Pick body pathology thereby creating nosological confusion. 44 The authors feel that a histologically based definition of Pick's disease cannot provide an acceptable framework for clinicians. It fosters the idea that this disease is rare and it is not diagnosable in vivo, neither of which is correct.\nThough there has not yet been consensus on the classification of this spectrum of degenerative dementias that aff e c t frontotemporal regions, a broader based framework called Pick complex is proposed to encompass the clinical syndromes of FTD, including the FTD of motor neuron disease (MND), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), semantic dementia and corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) 45, 46 (Table 1) .\nPrimary progressive aphasia was initially identified as a unique disorder in 1982 by Mesulam et al. 47 It is characterized by the initial loss of language without dementia. The dementia becomes apparent with longer term follow-up when there are also accompanying behavioral and extrapyramidal components. The aphasia may be nonfluent with stuttering and verbal apraxia but, in most cases, it is a progressive anomia and logopenia. Later all patients with this disorder become less and less fluent with eventual mutism.\nIn semantic dementia the meaning of concrete nouns and perceived objects initially is lost in a dramatically isolated fashion, with dementia and progressive mutism emerging with time. Behavioral and personality changes are part of this evolving dementia as well.\nThe CBDS is characterized by an extrapyramidal-apraxic motor disorder that typically includes asymmetrical limb rigidity and akinesia, with dystonia and myoclonus. There is a later gait disorder and disequilibrium. There are often prominent cortical sensory signs, particularly an alien hand disorder with apraxia. Cognitively there is frequently a progressive language impairment with anomic, Broca's, or transcortical motor aphasia in about 50% of cases. 48 It has been noted that depression is particularly common in this disorder. 49 The nosology of 'Pick Complex' is supported by the overlap of clinical and pathological features of these entities as well as by the emerging genetic data on the chromosome 17 linked FTD. 46 Tau gene mutations on chromosome 17 have been described with many of the clinical syndromes of FTDs. [50] [51] [52] [53] In these autosomal dominant \"tauopathies\" there are tau positive intraneuronal and glial pathologies. The clinical variants associated with tau mutations include FTD, PPA and CBDS. 5 4 Beyond these tauopathies, there is overlap as well in the tau negative pathologies. Tau negative, ubiquitin positive, intracytoplasmic inclusions, that were formerly associated with the MND form of FTD, are now recognized to present with clinical features of either FTD, CBDS or PPA without MND. 55 It has been reported that the spectrum Pick complex may actually account for 15-25% of degenerative dementias. 56 Therefore Pick complex, including both classical Pick's disease and these related disorders, is one of the largest nosological entities after AD to cause dementia, particularly under the age of 65. This has important implications in future research of the biology and treatment of the dementias."}, {"section_title": "VASCULAR DEMENTIA", "text": "Vascular dementia remains an elusive entity defying a precise definition. The definitions that emerged during the 1990s were developed specifically for VaD, including the NINDS-AIREN and California Criteria. 19, 20 Some of their core features are in conflict with the DSM-IV definition. 4 DSM-IV specifies that for VaD, as for AD, there must be memory impairment, as a core feature. The NINDS-AIREN and California criteria by contrast, define the cognitive deficits for diagnosis as involving multiple domains of cognition without a stipulation for memory impairment. 4, 19, 20 The DSM-IV allows a diagnosis of VaD to be made on the basis of either clinical signs or neuroimaging, while the NINDS-AIREN \"clinically probable\" VaD and the California criteria describe a relationship and co-existence between clinical signs, neuroimaging and the diagnosis. 19, 20 This distinction is particularly important with the recognition that it may be either cognitive changes, personality or mood changes that often signal the prelude of a cerebrovascular syndrome. 57 The debate over definition ranges from the earliest concepts of multiple infarct dementia 58 to a more recent perspective which urges abandoning the concept of VaD in favour of a syndrome of \"vascular cognitive impairment\" (VCI) where the brain injury and syndrome is understood on the basis of the location and extent of cerebrovascular mechanisms. 59, 60 Despite the disagreements over definitions, it is widely appreciated that there is a range of vascular syndromes that can be considered as associated with VCI and dementia as it is variably defined. In addition to multiinfarct dementia (large vessel), lacunar strokes, Binswanger's disease, watershed ischemia, anoxic encephalopathy, amyloid a n g i o p a t h y, cerebral angiitis and, more recently, described CADASIL(syndrome of autosomal dominant subcortical strokes with leukoariosis and notch three defects in chromosome 19 in some cases), 61, 62 can all cause VCI or dementia as it is variably defined. There is also the important link between vascular lesions and AD, both where lesions of both diseases coexist as well as for their pathogenetic interrelationships. Snowdon et al 63 have reported that small, and apparently clinically silent, lacunes and periventricular white matter lesions have a significant role in unmasking AD.\nOne of the cerebrovascular syndromes, that of subcortical VaD, is gaining particular importance as a proposed phenotype that might serve to test emerging vascular therapies. 6 4 , 6 5 Clinically, in subcortical VaD there is often a history of small strokes or of multiple transient ischemic attacks without residual symptoms. On the elemental neurological exam, abnormal findings may be limited to minor focal features such as reflex asymmetries, or drift. There may be a disorder of gait, with shuffling and apraxic features. Cognitively, there is often a dysexecutive syndrome that includes an impairment in frontal lobe cognitive functioning [e.g. initiation, planning, organizing, set shifting, abstraction, impairments]. The memory deficits can be mild, with impaired free recall and with benefits from cued recall. Recognition memory often remains relatively intact and there is less severe forgetting, a pattern that would be atypical for AD. Behavioral and psychological symptoms often include depression, personality change, emotional incontinence and psychomotor retardation. 64, 65 Other behavioral manifestations may include inattention, abulia and disinhibition. This clinical entity of subcortical VaD incorporates small vessel diseases such as Binswanger's disease and lacunar disease, with the primary brain lesions being either lacunar infarctions or ischemic white matter lesions subcortically. Neuroimaging is evidently required to support the clinical diagnosis of subcortical VaD. It has been proposed that subcortical VaD will show a predictable clinical picture, natural history, outcome and treatment responses and that it will be suitable for clinical trials research. Further empirical data will be required to validate this approach.\nOut of the debates over VaD some additional concepts have become widely accepted. Whereas in the original descriptions of Tomlinson et al 66 infarct volumes of 50-100 cc were considered the minimum to produce VaD, it is now recognised that \"strategic infarctions\" as small as 10 cc can cause a dementia syndrome with significant memory loss and confusion with, or without, an evident focal neurological deficit. Such strategic lesions may occur in the thalamus, left posterior parietal lobe, basal forebrain in the territory of the anterior communicating artery, or angular gyrus."}, {"section_title": "EPIDEMIOLOGYAND RISK FACTORS FOR DEMENTIA", "text": "The current rapid and projected growth of the population above age 65 in Canada has been emphasized in demographic studies. The segment of the population over the age of 85 is the most rapidly growing one within Canadian society. 67 In the face of these changing demographics, the population based CSHAset out in 1990-91 to estimate the prevalence of dementia over age 65, 10 the risk factors for dementia 68 and the estimated costs of dementia. 69 This study, (CSHA I) laid the groundwork for an incidence study, CSHA II, that was performed in 1996. CSHAII additionally included an investigation of the clinical progression of dementia, a prospective study of risk factors, and a study of the outcomes of mild cognitive impairment nosologically referred to as \"Cognitively Impaired Not Demented\" in CSHA. 70 In CSHA-I there were 9008 community and 1255 institutionalized subjects sampled in the prevalence study. 10 Between ages 65-74 there was an estimated 2% prevalence of dementia that increased to 12% between ages 75-84 and further increased to 35% over age 85. The incidence rates from CSHA-II demonstrated roughly a doubling of incident rates each five years after age 65 in both males and females. 70 Risk factor data were collated for AD 68 and VaD 71 from a case control study from CSHA-I. These risk factors are outlined in Tables 3 and 4 respectively."}, {"section_title": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RISK FACTORS", "text": "For AD the most significant risk factors include age, then a positive family history of first degree relatives with either AD or other dementia, a formal education of 6 years or less, and a prior history of head injury (Table 3 ). These risk factors have been consistently identified, not only from the case control study of CSHA, but also from other major epidemiological studies such as the European based EURODEM. 7 2 -8 0 There was no confirmation from CSHA of the EURODEM finding that smoking and thyroid disease were inversely related to the risk of A D 7 6 , 7 8 or that wine drinking was protective. 8 1 In both epidemiological studies there was a noted decreased risk of AD associated with the presence of arthritis and with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with potential implications for dementia prevention. There was a suggestion that there were associations between occupational exposure to glues, pesticides and fertilizers in CSHA but they were noted to require more detailed prospective study. 68 In addition to the risk factors elicited in CSHAthere has been an emerging awareness of the potential role of estrogens in reducing the risk of acquiring AD. Estrogens are neurobiologically active, crossing the blood brain barrier and interacting with estrogen receptors on neurons including those at the basal forebrain. 82 Estrogens have a putative role on neuronal plasticity, synaptogenesis and repair while physiologically they enhance long-term potentiation. 83, 84 In epidemiological studies there have been several case control studies which have reported a lowered use of postmenopausal estrogens in AD than control subjects. 85, 86 Paganini-Hill et al 87 reported an odds ratio of 0.69 of developing AD in women using estrogens in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. The risk reduction was associated with both increased dose and duration of estrogen use. Similar findings of relative risk reduction, associated with the use of estrogens, have been noted in the prospective studies of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 88 and the northern Manhattan study, 89 though a prospective study by an HMO in Puget Sound did not find this same association.\nThis research on risk factors for AD has kindled interest in preventive trials of both postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy for women and NSAIDs. Thal 90 has hypothesized that \"Given that the prevalence doubles every five years, delaying the onset of appearance of disease by five years would result in a 50% reduction in prevalence in one generation. Delaying onset by ten years would halve the prevalence again, reducing it by 75% in a generation. Thus, primary prevention would have maximal cost benefit.\" It is anticipated that, over the next five to ten years, the long-term prospective cohort studies, that will be required to allow clinicians the evidence about long-term preventive therapies, will be obtained.\nAmongst the biological genetic markers for AD, it has been the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) that to date has been associated with the most identifiable risk of acquiring either sporadic or familial late onset AD. 91 ApoE is a plasma lipoprotein which is involved in cholesterol transport and regulation. In brain, it is produced by astrocytes and, amongst its functions, it appears to be involved in synaptogenesis and neuronal repair. Its gene is found on the long arm of chromosome 19, where it exists in 3 alleles (ApoE2, ApoE3 or ApoE4). The alleles encode different forms of the apolipoprotein, which have different amino acids at one or both of two sites resulting in different physical and biochemical properties of each lipoprotein. 92 One such allele is inherited from each parent with six possible genotypes resulting. The presence of the E4 allele is associated with an increased risk of AD and a decreased age of disease onset. 91 One E4 allele is associated with an increased risk of 2.2-4.4 while the E4/E4 genotype increases the risk to 5.1-17.9. [93] [94] [95] Persons with the E4 genotype carry a LE JOURNAL CANADIEN DES SCIENCES NEUROLOGIQUES Suppl. 1 -S21 higher risk as well, if there are relatives who have been diagnosed with AD. However, this is only a risk marker, as some ApoE4 carriers survive to old age and can remain cognitively normal. From population studies it is clear that there are E4 individuals who remain cognitively normal. 96 Hence having the E4 genotype attributes a risk relationship only. There has been some suggestion that the E4 genotype is associated with a lack of response to cholinesterase inhibitors, though these preliminary observations require more detailed study. On the basis of currently available information, the Lancet consensus conference 92 concluded that use of Apo E genotyping was not recommended for asymptomatic individuals and should not be used as the sole diagnostic test in symptomatic patients. Additionally, genotype disclosure can have adverse effects on insurability, employability and psychosocial status. The Lancet consensus group also made the recommendation that genotyping was not appropriate to be used in routine clinical practice. 92"}, {"section_title": "VASCULAR DEMENTIA RISK FACTORS", "text": "For VaD, CSHA 71 risk factors included a history of arterial hypertension, history of alcohol abuse, history of heart disease, use of ASA, education less than six years and occupational exposures including pesticides and herbicides, liquid plastic and rubber. Table 4 outlines these risk factors.\nOther epidemiological studies have shown that hypertension is a risk factor for late life cognitive impairment as well as AD. 97, 98 In CSHA, a history of diabetes mellitus and smoking were not associated with an increased VaD risk as reported by other groups. 99 A basal metabolic index (wt in kgs/height in m 2 ) of <20 was associated with a near significant increased risk to VaD, extending an observation from other studies. 100 The potential for treatment of hypertension to reduce the incidence of dementia has been suggested by the promising results of the SYST-EUR trial 1 0 1 where the incidence of dementia was halved treating with nitredine, a calcium channel blocker, supplemented with enalapril and a thiazide as required for BP control. Other studies have made contradictory findings. 102 Further replication of these beneficial results of SYST-EUR will be required."}, {"section_title": "NATURAL HISTORY OF THE DEMENTIAS", "text": "Alzheimer's disease, being the most frequent dementia, has also been the best characterized in naturalistic studies. [103] [104] [105] Unfortunately at present, despite the claims, there is no biological marker, neuroimaging study, or blood test that can reliably determine rates of decline in an individual patient. [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] Without such a biological marker, the course of the disease must be assessed through clinical evaluation. There have been a variety of disease staging instruments that have been developed to assist such longitudinal evaluation. Some, such as the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) 104 and Functional Assessment Scale (FAST), 112 can be easily done in an office setting. They cover key elements of AD and other dementias by tapping into cognitive, behavioral and functional domains affected in the disease. Using these staging scales Reisberg et al 113 have plotted the course of AD onto a natural history grid which can be used for reference in the follow-up assessments of patients. The Figure, adapted from Reisberg, 114 shows the typical course of AD over time according to some of the common staging instruments. Such a grid can be effective in setting expectations of patients, caregivers and families for the road that is ahead at the time of diagnosis and in follow-up assessments.\nIn framing expectations for the survival of AD patients from the time of diagnosable AD, in general terms the estimated survival will be an average of 8-12 years. It must be emphasized, however, that such rates of decline are quite heterogeneous with both rapid and slow decliners, outside of the predicted rates. 28, 115 Amongst the rapid decliners have been those individuals with early and prominent aphasia, 116, 117 extrapyramidal signs, 118, 119 and early age of onset. 120 One of the current challenges, with the advent of therapy for AD, is to gauge treatment response against a background of the natural history of the disease. The current approved medications for AD, the cholinesterase inhibitors, have targeted symptomatic benefits as their indication for use, while longer-term effects on THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES Suppl. 1 -S22 disease progression have not actually been determined. This deficiency will leave uncertainty for clinicians about the duration of therapy once initiated, as well as the longer-term effects on disease progression. Post regulatory approval, such information will likely be quite difficult to acquire, particularly as the opportunity for placebo controlled settings diminishes.\nIn the absence of well-validated and agreed upon diagnostic criteria it has been difficult to study naturalistic data for the non-Alzheimer dementias. With the advent of the newly proposed criteria, it may become possible to have better epidemiological and naturalistic data."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The phenotypes of both AD and other degenerative dementias are becoming better understood, with operational diagnostic criteria for a wider spectrum of the dementias now available.
