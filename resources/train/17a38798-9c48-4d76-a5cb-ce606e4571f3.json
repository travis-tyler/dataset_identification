These findings, together with many other reports 2, 3 indicate that clinical assessment alone has limited utility to detect early AD pathology in many individuals. Whether these individuals will later develop cognitive decline and dementia due to AD remains unknown; however, evidence of brain Ab accumulation increases the risk for progression from clinical dementia rating (CDR) 0 to CDR 0.5 status by fivefold, and conversion from MCI to AD by threefold. 4 Therefore, earlier, more accurate, biomarker-based detection of AD-related Ab pathology is crucial and could potentially offer a greater opportunity for initiation of disease-modifying therapies prior to the advanced stages of AD.\nBrain Ab deposition can be detected by molecular imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) using an Ab-specific radioligand, or through measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab concentration. Both of these measures show high correlations with postmortem measures of fibrillar Ab. [5] [6] [7] Lumbar puncture, required for CSF sample collection, carries a 4% risk of a clinically significant adverse event (e.g., post-lumbar puncture headache, moderate atypical headache, moderate low back pain, vasovagal episode) 8 and is, therefore, unattractive as a population screening tool, particularly in early-stage individuals. Neuroimaging has the advantage of being less invasive and PET tracers have been changing the field by enabling in vivo Ab plaque detection. However, PET is relatively expensive with limited availability and contributes to the patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk of cancer. 9 There is an emerging literature investigating Ab-related brain changes using structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) describing an association between Ab burden (e.g., low CSF Ab or high Ab-PET binding) and atrophy, especially of the parietal and posterior cingulate regions, extending into the precuneus and medial temporal regions including hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Although not as substantial as the structural studies, arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI studies also show Ab-related cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes including reduced CBF in the cingulate, supramarginal gyrus, thalamus, and midbrain, as well as increased CBF in the medial and inferior frontal, precuneus, and inferior parietal regions. [17] [18] [19] These findings suggest that Ab accumulation is associated with structural and CBF changes, both of which can be detected with MRI.\nThe primary goal of this study was to develop a method to predict which subjects with early MCI have Ab deposition, by using MRI-detected changes of brain structure and CBF.\nThe study cohort consisted of 67 individuals with early MCI between the ages of 60 and 85 years and 33 Ab-negative cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals, to model the normal confounding effects of age, gender, and education, all recruited by ADNI. Global Ab burden, determined by Ab PET using 18 F-AV45 radioligand (florbetapir), served as outcome variable in primary hypotheses testing. The predictors included high-dimensional measures of anatomical shape variations from structural MRI and regional CBF from ASL-MRI, as well as demographics and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. Our central hypothesis was that even the earliest Ab-related structural and CBF changes could be detected in vivo using clinically viable metrics to construct a robust mathematical Ab prediction model. This will help to develop clinically viable early surrogate biomarkers of AD pathology in prodromal individuals. This will have a broad use in early diagnosis, facilitating initiation of prevention strategies in those at risk, and boost the power of anti-Ab immunotherapy trials by selecting those at greatest risk of AD. As a secondary goal, we assessed the relative importance of imaging modalities in classification of 18 F-AV45-positive versus 18 F-AV45-negative early-MCI individuals."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as to lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date, these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research, consisting of CN older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.\nData for this study were limited to baseline scans from ADNI-GO/2 participants in the ASL-MRI substudy as of June 2013. This cohort included 33 CN elderly individuals (CN) and 67 early-MCI subjects, representative of the broader ADNI-GO/2 CN and early-MCI participants (cf Tables S1-S2). Full inclusion and exclusion criteria for ADNI are described at www.adni-info.org. In brief, CN subjects had mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores between 24 and 30, a CDR of 0, no evidence of depression, and no memory complaints. Individuals with MCI were classified essentially in the manner described by Petersen, 20 but were then further divided into an \"early\" and \"late\" group based on performance on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory II (WMS-LM). The early-MCI group was defined based on scores between the cutoff of CN and that of the late-MCI group.\nBaseline MRIs of CN subjects were used to model the normal confounding effects of age, gender, and education on anatomical shape variation and CBF measures. Previous studies reported that the cumulative and regional Ab burden in CN subjects correlate with regional brain atrophy and CBF changes. 10, 17, 21 Furthermore, CN subjects at genetic risk for AD by virtue of the ApoE e4-allele demonstrated regional brain atrophy and CBF differences relative to e4-noncarriers.\n22,23 Therefore, we included only the ApoE e4-noncarrier CN subjects who were identified as Ab-negative using 18 F-AV45-PET. Furthermore, ApoE e2-allele carrier CN and early-MCI subjects were excluded due to sample size limitations. Study group demographics are summarized in Table 1 .

Structural MRIs were segmented into cortical regions using FreeSurfer version 4.5.0 (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). These cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were used to extract 18 F-AV45-PET uptake from gray matter (GM) in lateral and medial frontal, anterior, and posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal cortex. Values were normalized to florbetapir-PET uptake in the whole cerebellum. The averaged cortical uptake in this composite ROI was used as the index of florbetapir-PET uptake, that is, standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), in each subject.

To avoid bias toward a particular subject's geometry in analysis of anatomical shape variations, we used the data from CNs to create a study-specific unbiased large deformation brain image template (ULDtemplate) by applying a framework of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) as described in full elsewhere. 28 ULD-template generation incorporated an unbiased approach where all brain images were first simultaneously affine transformed to adjust for global variations in brain positioning and scale, and then simultaneously deformed. Structural MRI of each early-MCI subject was first affine aligned and then nonlinearly warped to this ULD-template using the LDDMM framework. The LDDMM was modeled as an evolution in time, with an associated smooth velocity vector field controlling this evolution. A scalar initial momentum map parameterized the entire geodesic with which the optimal trajectory emanated from the ULD-template to reach a subject brain image on a Riemannian manifold of diffeomorphism. 28 These momentum maps uniquely encoded the anatomical shape variations of individual brains relative to the ULD-template."}, {"section_title": "Cerebral blood flow", "text": "ASL-MRI processing was performed to obtain partial volume-corrected maps of CBF, as previously described.

The dynamic ASL data were fitted voxel-by-voxel to a dual compartment perfusion model, which takes into account variable transit times, bolus durations, distributed concentrations of capillary water and restricted brain-blood barrier permeability. 35 This model yielded a parametric map for CBF. The ASL reference scan signal without background suppression was rigidly coregistered, first to T2-weighted and then to MPRAGE-MRI, to map the parametric CBF measures to the structural-imaging space, where anatomical tissue compartments were defined by an adaptive fuzzy c-means algorithm. 36 Variations of CBF due to partially volumed GM voxels were accounted for by voxel-wise analysis of covariance, in which the tissue compartment estimates were entered as regressors. To account for global variations in CBF between and within individuals, CBF maps were intensity normalized by average CBF in the motor cortex, which is spared in AD.

Taken together these results demonstrate that structural MRI and ASL-MRI can be used to predict the Ab status of individuals with early MCI.\nWe previously pursued the use of structural MRI in predicting widespread brain Ab deposition in individuals with MCI. 38 Although the overall objective of this study is similar to our previous work, the contribution of this study is twofold: First, the primary goal of this study was to develop a method to predict which subjects with early MCI have brain Ab deposition, by using MRI-detected changes of brain structure and CBF. Expected smaller effect size estimates for both functional and structural brain changes make it challenging to adequately power to construct a robust mathematical Ab prediction model for early-MCI. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first neuroimaging study showing the value of structural MRI and ASL-MRI as predictors of the likelihood of significant Ab accumulation, both independently and jointly. According to our findings, the added value of multimodal MRI is incremental yet significant especially in terms of the PPV of the proposed early-MCI Ab-positivity predictor. We demonstrated that with multimodality MRI, basic demographics, and ApoE genotype data, we could achieve an 83% CA with an 87% PPV and an 85% NPV in identifying 18 F-AV45-positive early-MCI. This multimodality/multidisciplinary classification model outperformed other classifiers considered in this study using either nonimaging factors or unimodality neuroimaging data. Such an Ab-positivity classifier would greatly improve the efficiency of clinical trials targeting the early disease stages by reducing the number of subjects needed to be screened with Ab-PET scans or lumbar punctures. Specifically, based on the 87% PPV, to enroll 100 18 F-AV45-positive early-MCI participants, screening on structural and CBF variations in addition to age, gender, education, and ApoE genotype can reduce the number needed to screen by 47%, resulting in screening of only 15 additional participants than the targeted number. According to our analyses, the added value of multimodality neuroimaging data to age, gender, education, and ApoE genotype information is a 14% increase in the CA, as well as in PPV and NPV of the final Ab-positivity prediction model. The 14% difference in PPV and NPV metrics translates to a 20% difference in both the number of subjects needed to screen for recruitment and the number of subjects needed to screen with Ab-PET scans.\nThere is an emerging literature investigating Ab-related brain changes using structural MRI describing an association between Ab burden (e.g., low CSF Ab or high Ab-PET binding) and atrophy, especially of the parietal and posterior cingulate regions, extending into the precuneus and medial temporal regions including hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. This parietotemporal dominant pattern of Ab-atrophy association is even evident at mild stages of cognitive deficits. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [39] [40] [41] A surprising finding of this study showed that in early MCI, Ab-related anatomical shape variations were widespread, and showed a superior-inferior gradient with anatomical shape variations in the parietal and frontal regions exhibiting greater associations with Ab-burden than temporal and occipital regions. This early-MCI anatomical shape variation signature of brain Ab is mainly in agreement with the Ab-accumulation patterns reported for elderly individuals, 2, 42 affecting predominantly parietal and frontal brain regions more than temporal and occipital brain regions with a superior-inferior gradient. 2, 42 This suggests a localized effect of Ab pathology on brain structure in early-MCI individuals. In contrast to the structural-Ab association pattern, the early-MCI CBF signature of brain Ab involved several AD-related neurodegeneration brain regions, in agreement with many previous reports of altered tempero-parietal CBF in AD continuum. 30, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] Our finding of spatial pattern CBF-Ab association being distributed rather than being localized to Ab accumulation sites suggests a greater involvement of a memory network including hippocampal complex in Ab-related CBF changes in early MCI. Future studies examining the temporal dynamics of Ab accumulation, atrophy, and CBF changes could further our understanding of pathophysiological processes in early disease stages.\nThe strength of this study is the approach we used to predict the likelihood of significant Ab accumulation in early MCI. We applied a combination of state-of-the-art, yet clinically feasible, 3T neuroimaging techniques for quantification of voxel-based brain anatomical and CBF changes, and modern multivariate statistical analysis methods that allow simultaneous testing of variations across modalities and brain regions to maximally exploit information and to relate these high-dimensional brain alterations to measure of global brain Ab accumulation. Although neuroimaging research has made major progress in linking Ab and AD-related neurodegeneration, the majority of these studies have analyzed each neuroimaging modality in isolation, ignoring relationships between the measures that might carry important predictive information for Ab-positivity. Moreover, aside from a small number of studies, 38, 40, 53 most neuroimaging studies and especially those using structural MRI, evaluate variations in the brain region-by-region, ignoring the network connectivity changes that could reflect the pathological footprint of Ab accumulation.\nA potential limitation of this study is that findings from the ADNI may not precisely generalize to general population. In particular, ADNI population represents a clinical trial population and not an epidemiologically selected real life population. Other study limitations include the inherent limitations of the ASL technique, namely that it has low signal-to-noise ratio, and is susceptible to motion artifacts. Finally, our study does not explain the mechanisms behind the detected Ab-related structural and CBF variations. Furthermore, the neuroimaging signature of brain amyloidosis estimated by the PLS regression approach represents the parsimonious set of neuroimaging variables (i.e., anatomical shape variation or CBF measures from a subset of brain tissue voxels) that cumulatively explain the variance in Ab burden maximally. These parsimonious set of neuroimaging voxels identified as good predictors of Ab burden is expected to be smaller than the set of neuroimaging voxels potentially with significant Ab-association based on conventional voxel-based analysis.\nIn conclusion, MRI is a very attractive candidate for the identification of inexpensive and noninvasive surrogate biomarkers of Ab deposition because it is widely available, and routinely assessed in clinical practice. Exploring biomarkers from a range of modalities and/or disciplines already well established in AD research and clinical practice may also provide a less invasive, less expensive, and more practical way to identify individuals with Ab pathology. Several lines of evidence suggest that clinical measures, genetic risk factors, and peripheral blood protein levels can also reflect the likelihood of having elevated Ab accumulation and can potentially be useful for assessing the risk for future conversion into AD. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] Together with the work of others, our findings could result in development of multidisciplinary and multimodality biomarkers of brain amyloidosis that are reliable, minimally invasive, simple to perform, and widely available. These may include detailed demographic characteristics such as family history, cognitive performance, and high-throughput biomarker technologies such as genomics and proteomics. Our approach is expected to have value for the identification of individuals likely to be Ab+ in circumstances where cost or logistical problems prevent Ab detection using CSF analysis or amyloid PET. This can be used in clinical settings and clinical trials, aiding subject recruitment and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Imputation of the Ab-positivity status could also complement Ab-PET by identifying individuals who would benefit the most from this assessment.
