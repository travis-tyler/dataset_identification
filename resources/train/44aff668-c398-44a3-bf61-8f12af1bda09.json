They might affect readiness to seek diagnosis, predict disease progression, determine treatment compliance, or affect the ability to sign informed consent. [1] [2] [3] Nevertheless, lack of awareness may not be a uniform phenomenon across cognitive domains, 4 with possible differences between awareness of cognitive and noncognitive symptoms, as well as differences in awareness of different types of cognitive symptoms.\nFor both theoretical and clinical purposes, it is important to determine whether lack of awareness should be viewed as an all-inclusive phenomenon inherent to AD or whether it affects specific domains to a different degree. If AD leads to deterioration of all aspects of awareness to the same degree, research and assessment of awareness should look for a single origin of impairment. If, however, awareness of each domain is differentially affected by the disease, models of metacognition and assessment practices should accommodate these differences. The purpose of the current study is to examine whether awareness of memory decline resembles awareness of language decline in a cohort of individuals with AD.\nSeveral studies of awareness in AD have looked at awareness of one's condition as a whole or at awareness of the implications of Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

For example, it has been\nshown that lack of awareness of behavioral disturbances contributes more to caregiver burden than lack of awareness of memory problems. 14 Moreover, individuals with AD can demonstrate unawareness of personality changes or behavioral symptoms, alongside better awareness of cognitive difficulties. 15 The fact that individuals with AD show domain specific lack of awareness suggests that there is no one common cause that leads to general decline in awareness.\nTherefore, accounts of lack of awareness that ascribe all aspects of this phenomenon to damage to frontal brain regions, to psychological denial, or to the inability to update personal information due to memory problems 16, 17 cannot fully explain the complex pattern of awareness deficits in AD.\nIn addition to the differences between awareness of behavioral and cognitive domains, some studies have examined awareness of particular cognitive domains. For instance, Barrett et al 18 asked 14 individuals with AD to estimate how well they could remember or name objects. Participants were asked to assess whether they had naming difficulties on a vertical line with the label \"Naming is perfect\"\nat the top and the label \"Cannot name at all\" at the bottom. Estimates were provided before and after performing a naming task, and the analysis focused on the difference between estimates and actual performance. Results showed significant discrepancies between estimates and performance in the memory domain but not in the language domain, both before and after the task. Furthermore, individuals with AD overestimated their memory performance relative to their estimates of a control, noncognitive measure of eyesight, while underestimating their naming abilities relative to estimates of eyesight. 15 In another study, there were significant negative correlations between measures of awareness and performance on verbal memory tests, but no correlations were found for naming abilities. 19 Calley et al 20 asked patients and physicians to say yes or no if there were any memory or language problems and then correlated these ratings with test scores. They found stronger associations between memory assessments and memory performance than they did for language. As the conflicting results of these studies suggest, the differences between awareness of memory decline and awareness of language decline in AD are yet to be clarified. underestimate their decline relative to informants, and there will be differences in discrepancy patterns between the memory and the language domains, so that the discrepancy will be larger for memory than for language; (2a) participant ratings will correlate more poorly with actual performance than will informant ratings, and there will be negative correlations between level of decline (higher level = greater decline) and test scores (higher scores = better performance); and (2b) informant ratings will add more to the prediction of actual performance beyond relevant demographic variables than will participant ratings, and this will be true for both the memory and the language domains."}, {"section_title": "| METHODS", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Participants were asked to rate the ability to perform certain everyday tasks now as compared with the ability to do these same tasks 10 years earlier. Ratings were provided on a 4-point scale: 1 = there has been no change in ability, or performance is better compared with 10 years earlier; 2 = occasionally performs the task worse than 10 years earlier but not all the time; 3 = consistently performs the task a little worse than 10 years earlier; 4 = consistently performs the task much worse than 10 years earlier. There was also an option to mark \"I don't know,\" which was later removed from the data file (\"I don't know\" responses consisted of only 1.5% of all responses).\nAlthough the ECog was originally designed to be completed by an informant, 21 in ADNI, both participants and study partners completed the questionnaire, and instructions were adjusted as necessary.\nWe focused on the memory and language items. There were eight memory items that included statements such as \"Remembering a few shopping items without a list\" and \"Remembering things that happened recently (such as recent outings, events in the news).\" There were nine language items that included statements such as \"Forgetting the names of objects\" and \"Finding the right words to use in a conversation.\" Four scores were calculated: average participant and average informant ratings for the memory items, average participant, and average informant ratings for the language items. The range for each average could be 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater functional decline."}, {"section_title": "| Neuropsychological assessment", "text": "A description of the full ADNI neuropsychological battery can be found elsewhere. 26, 27 We focused on memory and language 31 with a potential score range of 0 to 30."}, {"section_title": "| Statistical analysis", "text": "To examine Hypothesis 1 that individuals with AD will underestimate their decline relative to informants, we conducted repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) that compared participant and informant ratings on the ECog memory and language scales.

To examine Hypothesis 2a that there will be stronger negative correlations between informant ratings and actual performance than between participant rating and actual performance, we looked at the correlations between ECog ratings and test scores, separately for participants and informants. To examine Hypothesis 2b that participant ratings will add less to the prediction of actual performance than will informant rating, we ran two regression analyses for each of the normally distributed cognitive test scores, controlling for age, education, and MMSE scores, and looking at the additional contribution of participant and informant ratings beyond those demographic variables."}, {"section_title": "| RESULTS", "text": "We analyzed data from 149 participants, ages 55-90 (mean that the participant-informant discrepancy was larger for the memory items than it was for the language items. whereas informant ratings on the memory items were significantly and negatively associated with three of the four memory scores. Both participant and informant ratings on the language items negatively correlated with performance on both language tests, so that the greater the decline reported on the ECog, the worse were the scores on the language tests.\nNext, we ran 12 linear regressions in which we predicted actual performance on the four memory tests and the two language tests.\nIn the first step of these regressions, we entered age, education, and MMSE scores to control for the possible effects of these variables on both ratings and performance. In the second step, we entered either informant or participant ECog ratings. On the RAVLT, informant memory ratings accounted for 5.1% of the variance in actual immediate memory scores beyond the demographic variables, and for 3.1% of the variance in delayed scores beyond these same variables (see Table 3 "}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "In support of our first hypothesis that individuals with AD will underestimate their decline relative to informants, we found that individuals Age, education, and MMSE scores were entered in step 1. ECog ratings were entered in step 2.\nwith AD indeed estimated both their everyday memory and their everyday language functioning as less impaired relative to informants.\nThese results fit well with previous studies of awareness of memory performance in AD, 13, 15, 18 although they could demonstrate both patients' decreased awareness of deficit and informants' increased awareness of the difficulties exhibited by the patients. Most important for the current analyses, the discrepancy between participant and informant ratings was larger for estimates of everyday memory functioning than it was for estimates of everyday language functioning.\nThe analysis of correlations between ratings and actual test scores\nshowed that participant ratings of their memory abilities were not associated with their scores on the memory tests, thus demonstrating impaired awareness of memory decline. Informant ratings on the memory items were significantly and negatively associated with three of the memory scores, reflecting the fact that greater assessment of decline was indeed related to worse test performance. This finding suggests that informants reported impairments that actually existed.\nIn contrast, and unlike the predictions of Hypothesis 2a that informants will be more accurate than participants in their report of decline, both participant and informant ratings of language functioning were similarly associated with scores on the naming and fluency tests.\nThus, participants demonstrated ratings of everyday language problems that predicted their actual performance. These findings were further emphasized by the regression analyses in which we factored out the effects of age, education, and general cognitive impairment (MMSE scores). In these analyses, participant ratings did not contribute to the prediction of memory scores, but they explained approximately 5% of the variance in naming and fluency scores beyond other relevant demographic variables. Importantly, we expected informant ratings to be better predictors of test scores in both the memory and the language domains, but we found that participant ratings contributed more to the prediction of language test scores than did informant ratings. Thus, individuals with AD assessed their language better than did the informants.\nIt appears, then, that individuals with AD are less aware of their everyday memory decline than they are of their language difficulties.\nThere could be several explanations to these findings. According to Ernst et al, 32 when individuals are not familiar with a task, they tend to anchor their predictions near the midpoint of the possible range of performance. It is thus possible that the fact that AD is associated primarily with decline in memory rather than with decline in language made participants use different anchoring heuristics for their ratings in the two domains. However, this account does not explain why participant ratings were better predictors of the language test scores than were informant ratings. Farrell et al 33 showed that subjective reports of word-finding difficulties in AD correlated with levels of social engagement, suggesting that individuals with AD are at least partly aware of their language problems and perhaps also of the practical implications of these problems.\nWe believe that our results can best be explained within the framework of the Cognitive Awareness Model. 34, 35 This model includes a central metacognitive awareness system, a personal database, and comparator mechanisms. As the awareness of language decline appears to be better preserved in AD than is the awareness of memory decline, it cannot be argued that AD leads to a general dysfunction of the central awareness system. In addition, it is impossible to argue that the personal database is outdated, because it is correctly updated with regards to language difficulties. Instead, as the central system interacts with, but is distinct from, language, memory, perception, and other cognitive modules, there could be a selective disconnection between the central system and a specific module. 17 Thus, the different routes available in this model can explain why individuals with AD provide some accurate and some inaccurate judgments of their everyday cognitive functioning.\nWe acknowledge that our study has some weaknesses. First, the fact that informant ratings predicted memory performance better than did participant ratings might mean that individuals with AD could not have remembered their everyday functioning and were unable to report it. It is also possible that participants' cognitive capacity was too impaired to assess whether their functioning has changed relative to 10 years earlier. Indeed, other studies have examined awareness of memory deficit by asking participants to relate to a specific task 15, 18 rather than by asking them to assess their daily functioning. However, participants provided accurate assessment of their language abilities, thus demonstrating intact ability to assess changes in their daily functioning. Second, our findings suggest that informant ratings were less accurate in predicting language test scores than were participant ratings, calling into question the participantinformant discrepancy method and showing that informants might be biased as well. Informant bias might associate with the nature of the relationship to the participant (spouse/child), with caregiver burden or depression, as well as with informants' cognitive abilities. [36] [37] [38] Unfortunately, the ADNI provided no information about the informants that could be analyzed in the current research. Further investigation of the effects of these characteristics on informants' assessment of specific aspects of cognition is necessary. Future studies should also examine what healthy people or caregivers of individuals with AD think about language decline in AD in an attempt to pinpoint the sources of this informant bias.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that individuals with AD are better aware of their language abilities than of their memory functioning, both when their awareness is tested against informant ratings and when it is tested relative to actual performance. The pathophysiological and anatomical changes that underpin the selective awareness to language decline in AD are yet to be defined.\nWhile overall insight loss has been associated with ventromedial and prefrontal atrophy, 39 less accurate metamemory has been specifically associated with reduced right insular volume. 40 It remains to be seen whether awareness of language decline is related to regions involved in insight in general, relies on similar regions as selfawareness of memory, or is based on neural networks that are particularly dedicated to language. Finally, clinicians should be careful in stating that an individual's global awareness is intact or impaired without looking at specific cognitive domains."}]
