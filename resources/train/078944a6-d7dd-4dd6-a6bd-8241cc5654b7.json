[{"section_title": "Research and Development Satellite Account Update Estimates for 1959-2007", "text": "By Jennifer Lee and Andrew G. Schmidt T HE BUREAU of Economic Analysis (BEA) re search and development (R&D) satellite account provides detailed statistics designed to facilitate re search into the effects of R&D on the economy. The ac count shows how gross domestic product (GDP) and other measures would be affected if R&D spending were \"capitalized,\" that is, if R&D spending were treated as investment rather than as an expense. This update of the R&D satellite account extends BEA's estimates of the effects of R&D on economic growth through 2007, and it now includes coverage of the business cycle expansion that ended in December 2007. The summary estimates presented in this article include revised national statistics for R&D, beginning with estimates for 1959, for R&D-intensive industries, beginning with estimates for 1987, for regional statis tics, beginning with estimates for 1998, and for inter national accounts, beginning with estimates for 1995. The methods used to derive the R&D estimates for this update are consistent with the methods used for deriv ing the estimates that were released in 2007. 1 For this update, several improvements were made to the statistics on R&D investment by industry. R&D statistics for the finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing industry are now separately identified; this industry had been included in \"all other for-profit in dustries\" in the prior satellite account update. In addi tion, the R&D satellite account by industry has now been expanded to include R&D investment by non profit industries and by government in order to pro 1.

Christian Awuku-Budu contributed the section on re gional R&D estimates, and Alexis Chaves contributed the section on international R&D estimates. vide a more complete picture of R&D investment in the GDP by industry accounts. According to the updated R&D satellite account es timates, treating R&D spending as investment would significantly affect several of BEA's measures of the economy. \u2022 Growth in R&D investment from 1995 to 2007 con tinued to track with business cycles. R&D's contri bution to economic growth slowed in 2001 and 2002, recovered in 2003, and outpaced the expan sion through 2007. \u2022 The contribution to real GDP growth from treating R&D as investment would have been approximately 0.20 percentage point of the average 2.9 percent growth, or about a 7.1 percent share of the average growth rate from 2002 to 2007. \u2022 The level of current-dollar GDP for 2007 would have increased $396.3 billion, or 2.8 percent. \u2022 Current-dollar private fixed investment for 2007 would have been 11.3 percent, or $256.4 billion, higher than published private fixed investment. \u2022 The largest contribution from an R&D-intensive industry to average real GDP growth from 1995 to 2007 would have been from the pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing industry. This industry's contribution would have accounted for about a 1 percent share of the average real GDP growth rate. The second-largest contribution would have been from the software publishing industry, which would have accounted for an additional 0.5 percent share. \u2022 The level of GDP by state would have increased the most for New Mexico (9.2 percent), Maryland (6.2 percent), and Massachusetts (6.0 percent) over the period 1998 to 2007. \u2022 In the international accounts, the surplus on direct investment income would have been larger in 2008, and as a result, the current-account deficit would have been reduced $3.5 billion. The net interna tional investment position would have been $17.0 billion lower as a result of a larger increase in the inward position than in the outward position. Currently, the national income and product ac counts (NIPAs) do not treat R&D and many other in tangibles as investment. Thus, the contribution of R&D and other intangibles to U.S. economic growth cannot be separately identified. The R&D satellite ac count is part of BEA's long-term efforts to better mea sure the effects of innovation and intangible assets on the economy. 2 The R&D satellite account format provides a means of exploring the impact of adjusting the treatment of R&D activity on the economy and a framework through which various methodological and conceptual issues can be examined. The account can be seen as a prelude to adjusting BEA's core economic accounts to better reflect the impact of R&D. Currently, BEA plans to incorporate R&D spending as investment into its core accounts around 2013 as part of the 2007 inputoutput accounts and as part of the comprehensive revi sion of the NIPAs. This article marks the final update of the satellite account before R&D investment is in corporated into BEA's accounts. 3 The rest of this report is organized as follows. First, the effects of the updated estimates on GDP and in vestment are explained, revisions to previous R&D es timates are discussed, and relationships between private and government R&D investment and the busi ness cycle are presented. Second, the price indexes used for deflating R&D investment in the satellite account are discussed. Third, estimates for the impacts of treat ing R&D as investment by industry are described, in 2.

The average difference was 0.13 percentage point for 1959 to 1973. The average differ ence narrowed to almost zero for the period 1974 to 1994, before picking up again to 0.17 percentage point for the period 1995 to 2001. From 2002 to 2007, the av erage difference narrowed to 0.12 percentage point. The level of current-dollar GDP would have been, on average, 2.6 percent higher for 2002 to 2007 if R&D spending were treated as investment in the NIPAs. The impact of treating R&D spending as investment on GDP growth can be seen by looking at the contribu tion of R&D to the annual real GDP growth rate (table  B). This contribution would have been approximately 0.20 percentage point of the average 2.9 percent growth, or about a 7.1 percent share of the average growth rate from 2002 to 2007. For 2007, current-dollar R&D investment would have been $405.7 billion, an increase of 9.1 percent from $371.7 billion for 2006 (table C). Real GDP would have grown 2.2 percent for 2007 if R&D were treated as investment, and the contribution of the new treatment of R&D to real GDP growth would have been 0.28 percentage point, or about a 12.9 percent share of the growth rate (table B).

Current-dollar private fixed investment for 2007 would have been 11.3 percent, or $256.4 billion, higher than published private fixed investment if R&D were included (table D, page 21). R&D as a share of R&Dadjusted private fixed investment would have increased to 11.1 percent for 2007 from 10.1 percent for 2006 (chart 1). Private R&D investment accelerated while residential fixed investment posted a notably larger de crease because of the housing market crash, resulting in R&D capturing a larger share of private fixed invest ment. R&D's gain as a share of private fixed investment for 2007 was the largest since 1991, when the share of R&D increased 1.4 percentage points and also ac counted for 11.1 percent of R&D-adjusted private fixed investment. 4. The value of capital services, the value of the R&D assets' use in pro duction, is defined as the sum of depreciation and the net return on invest ment. The inclusion in the R&D satellite account of net returns to nonprofits and to general government is a departure from BEA's current calculation of gross domestic income, which includes only depreciation, a partial measure of capital services. In the current GDP accounts, govern ments do not earn profits, so only depreciation is counted."}, {"section_title": "Revisions", "text": "The picture of the economy presented in the revised R&D estimates is similar to that shown by the esti mates published in 2007.

The upward revisions to federal R&D investment reflected upward revisions to both federal intramural R&D investment and federal extra mural R&D investment, based on revised source data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) on fed eral intramural R&D investment and a revised R&D seller's margin for R&D purchased from business by the federal government. 5 For 2004, the latest available year for the estimates published in 2007, investment in R&D totaled $321.5 billion, an upward revision of $4.9 billion from the previous estimates, reflecting revisions to business R&D investment and to federal extramural R&D investment, based on the same factors cited above (table C)."}, {"section_title": "Char", "text": "Revisions to current-dollar R&D-adjusted GDP from 1959 to 2001 primarily reflected the incorpora tion of the results of the 2009 comprehensive revision of the NIPAs. 6 Excluding the effects of the comprehen sive revision, the upward revisions to current-dollar R&D-adjusted GDP for 2002 to 2004 primarily re flected upward revisions to business R&D investment and downward revisions to the software R&D overlap adjustment.

Because funds for industrial R&D are valued by busi nesses at cost in the source data for business R&D performance (National Science Foundation Survey of Industrial Research and Development), the cost-basis value of the R&D funding must be converted to a purchase basis using an estimate of the R&D seller's margin in order to capture the full value of the R&D investment. The R&D seller's margin is estimated using the ratio of net operating surplus to gross output for miscellaneous profes sional, scientific, and technical services from BEA's GDP by industry data. 6.

Input price index. The input price index is similar to price indexes used for government and other hardto-measure services in the national accounts. Thus, these estimates provide a baseline against which other estimates can be evaluated. The input price index for R&D investment is based on an aggregation of detailed price indexes for the inputs used to create R&D output. Although this method is useful for estimating the im pact of inflation on R&D inputs, it is less appropriate for R&D output because it does not account for pro ductivity growth; it assumes real output grows at the same rate as real inputs. Given increases in computing power and other scientific advances, some argue that R&D productivity has increased, which would make the input price approach lacking. Aggregate output price index. The aggregate out put price index is the featured price measure. It is a weighted average of the output prices of other prod ucts produced by R&D-intensive industries, and it as sumes that there are common factors in R&D production processes across industries. Such an index tends to average out the extreme effects of rapidly fall ing or rapidly rising output prices for particular prod ucts. Although this index may pick up some of the effects of productivity growth in R&D-intensive indus tries, it may also be influenced by factors that are unre lated to R&D and that affect prices of other products produced by these industries. It is constructed using a Fisher-weighted combination of the output prices of 14 R&D-intensive industries with weights correspond ing to each industry's share of annual business R&D investment. For this update of the R&D satellite account, the in dex was improved by including the finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing industry.

Specifically, the account provides estimates of gross output and value added for these industries when R&D is treated as investment. The R&D satellite account provides detail for 14 R&D-intensive private industries. These 14 industries have the highest ratios of R&D investment to industry receipts and accounted for more than two-thirds of business R&D spending for 2007 (table 5.1). These in dustries include pharmaceutical and medicine manu facturing; semiconductor manufacturing; software publishing; motor vehicles, bodies and trailers, and parts manufacturing; computer systems design ser vices; and nine other industries. 9 The R&D satellite account by industry was im proved to separately estimate R&D statistics for the fi nance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing industry. In the previous satellite account update, R&D investment for this industry was included in \"all other for-profit industries.\" For 2007, R&D investment by this industry was $2.2 billion, or 1 percent of total pri vate industry investment in R&D.

The software publishing industry's and the computer services indus try's shares of growth would each be larger. The slight reduction in the share of growth in private industry value added attributed to the computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing industry and the finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing industry is due to the slower growth of real R&D investment rela tive to each industry's real output. Another way to look at the impact of capitalizing R&D on specific industries is to identify the growth in GDP that stems from business R&D investment. If R&D were treated as investment, business R&D would account for a 2.7 percent share of the average annual growth in real GDP from 1959 to 2007; the contribu tion to real GDP growth would be greater in recent years, accounting for a 4.6 percent share from 1995 to 2007 (table F).

Current-dollar and real estimates, using the aggregate R&D output price index, are provided in tables 7.1A-7.3B. The primary source for the R&D data used in the industry satellite account was the National Science Foundation's Survey of Industrial R&D, which pro vided industry detail on expenditures for the perfor mance of R&D. These data were supplemented with BEA data on international trade in services, economic census data on receipts for the R&D services industry, and unpublished data from BEA, the Census Bureau, and the National Science Foundation that were used to allocate R&D performance and investment to indus tries."}, {"section_title": "R&D as Investment in BEA's Regional Accounts", "text": "The updated estimates show that if R&D were treated as investment, GDP by state would have increased, on average, 2.5 percent from 1998 to 2007 (table G). (This is an unweighted average across all states.) The levels of GDP by state that would be most affected if R&D were treated as investment are New Mexico (9.2 percent), Maryland (6.2 percent) and Massachusetts (6.0 per cent). For New Mexico and Maryland, federal govern ment R&D accounted for most of the impact of treating R&D as investment, increasing state GDP by 8.4 percent in New Mexico and 5.2 percent in Mary land. For Massachusetts, business R&D investment ac counted for 3.3 percentage points of the increase. For Montana, a substantial increase in federal funding for R&D in 2007 boosted the impact of capitalizing R&D on state GDP to 3.1 percent for 2007 from 1.1 percent for 2006. 14 The estimates of R&D-adjusted GDP by state for 1998 to 2002 have been revised. The revisions are due to the incorporation of revised NSF data, revised NIPA-based estimates of R&D investment, and revised estimates of GDP by state. To move from a satellite account to the full incorpo ration of capitalized R&D into BEA's GDP by state and metropolitan area statistics, BEA will need to produce estimates of the impact of R&D investment at the de tail level of geographic region by industry. These statis tics are currently published for about 62 industries. 15 A project currently underway at the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies is intended to produce information to benchmark these more detailed re gional statistics. To obtain real values of R&D invest ment, BEA plans to use R&D price indexes developed at the national level to deflate current-dollar values of R&D investment that would be consistent with BEA's current use of industry-weighted national price in dexes to deflate current-dollar GDP by state statistics. BEA NIPA estimates of industry-specific R&D depreci ation rates would also be used to provide state esti mates of net R&D stock.

The summary estimates presented here for 1995 to 2004 have been revised, and the series have been updated through 2008. The estimates of the effect of treating R&D as an in vestment rather than as an expense in the international accounts should still be considered experimental, as BEA continues to study several methodological issues. One issue of particular concern for the international R&D estimates relates to the nonrival nature of R&D capital. To the extent that R&D capital is nonrival, its use by one entity of an MNC does not diminish the ability of other entities of the MNC to use it so that in some cases, the various entities that comprise an MNC can share R&D results at little or no cost. Conse quently, it is difficult to attribute ownership rights of R&D capital across either the entities within MNCs or national boundaries. A second, more practical issue concerns data limitations, particularly the lack of data on R&D stocks for firms that enter the population of MNCs. 16 In the ITAs, the current account measures transac tions in goods, services, income, and current transfers between U.S. residents and nonresidents. Treating R&D as an investment rather than as an expense affects the current account through its impact on direct in vestment income, a measure of the return on the direct investment of MNCs. The balance on direct invest ment income is the difference between U.S. parents' share of their foreign affiliates' income and foreign parents' share of their U.S. affiliates' income. When R&D is capitalized, estimates of both direct investment income receipts and direct investment payments rise as the respective values of R&D funded by these entities are treated as investment and no longer reduce income except through depreciation. For 2008, the adjusted estimate of the direct invest ment income surplus would be $3.5 billion, or 1.2 per cent, larger than the unadjusted estimate, because the adjustment's effect on direct investment income re ceipts would be larger than that on direct investment income payments (see the top panel of table H). As a 16. For a detailed discussion of the various difficulties of capitalizing R&D in the international accounts and a more detailed description of the methodology used to construct the international component of the R&D satellite account, see Daniel R. Yorgason, \"Treatment of International Research and Development as Investment Issues and Estimates,\" Bureau of Economic Analysis (October, 2007); www.bea.gov/papers. Most of the esti mates presented in that paper go back further than 1995-for some series as far back as 1966. However, the estimates in that paper differ slightly from those presented here, primarily because of subsequent revisions to the underlying series. consequence of the larger direct investment income surplus, the international investment income surplus (which includes both direct investment income and other types of investment income) and the current-ac count balance would also be larger by $3.5 billion. Rel ative to their unadjusted values, the international investment income surplus would be 2.3 percent higher for 2008, and the current-account deficit would be 0.5 percent lower. Capitalizing R&D would also result in changes in the international investment position accounts (see the middle panel of table H). Adding the stock of R&D at tributed to foreign affiliates to the outward investment position (U.S.-owned assets abroad) would increase that position by $180.4 billion, or 0.9 percent, for 2008. Similarly, the inward investment position would in crease by the value of R&D stock attributed to foreignowned affiliates in the United States. For 2008, the in ward investment position would increase $197.5 bil lion, or 0.9 percent. Because the increase in the inward investment position would be larger, the net interna tional investment position, which measures the differ ence between the outward and inward investment positions, would fall $17.0 billion, or 0.5 percent. BEA conducts annual surveys on the finances and operations of MNCs. Although these operations data do not directly enter the ITAs or the international in vestment position, they provide a picture of the overall activities of MNCs and are useful in analyzing the characteristics, performance, and economic impact of MNCs. The MNC operations data include estimates of value added, or the portion of a firm's output that re flects its own production. The value added of the three groups of entities covered by BEA's surveys of MNCs-majority-owned foreign affiliates, U.S. par ents of foreign affiliates, and majority-owned U.S. af filiates of foreign companies-is measured as the sum of the costs incurred (excluding intermediate inputs) and the profits earned in production. Because spend ing on R&D that had previously been expensed no longer counts against profits when R&D is treated as investment, the estimate of value added increases by the amount of R&D spending. For majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs, value added for 2008 would rise $35.4 billion, or 2.8 percent, relative to the unadjusted estimate (see the bottom panel of table H). For U.S. parent companies, value added would rise $182.5 billion, or 7.2 percent. For majority-owned U.S. affiliates of foreign MNCs,"}]
