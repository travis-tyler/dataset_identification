For complex diseases like LOAD, it is imperative that we look beyond single marker analyses to explore biologically plausible interactions and that we address the considerable heterogeneity present in disease status information by using meaningful intermediate phenotypes. In this study, we investigate the influence of interactions between genes previously associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) on amyloid-beta (Ab) load in an effort to better understand the genetic etiology of Ab deposition and, by extension, risk for LOAD.\nPrevious gene-gene interaction studies in LOAD have implicated interactions between CR1 and APOE using quantified Ab positron emission tomography (PET) as the outcome variable (Thambisetty et al. 2012) , and between cholesterol trafficking genes (Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2009 , 2010 and tau phosphorylation genes ) in case-control analyses. These studies indicate the important information that can be garnered from For the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data, but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_ Acknowledgement_List.pdf Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00439-013-1354-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. investigating higher-order genetic relationships in complex diseases like LOAD. The current study aims to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of gene-gene interactions between variants associated with AD risk, while leveraging quantitative measurements of AD-associated neuropathology, which can increase statistical power (Potkin et al. 2009 ). For brain-based diseases, quantitative data can be derived from neuroimaging, such as PET. PET imaging can be used to quantify levels of amyloid in the brain by utilizing a radiotracer such as florbetapir ( 18 F-AV-45 or AV-45) or and Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB, N-methyl-[\n11 C]2-(4 0 -methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole). These tracers have been shown to selectively bind Ab in living patients, have been correlated with disease onset and progression, have been validated in postmortem samples, and more recently were included as biomarkers for classifying patients with AD in research studies (Ikonomovic et al. 2008; Clark et al. 2011; Albert et al. 2011; Sperling et al. 2011) .\nGenetic interaction studies are prone to the problem of overfitting, which can result in spurious associations that are not replicated in independent datasets. This problem is exaggerated when large-scale (e.g., genome-wide) explorations are conducted, since the number of false-positive findings is greatly increased. However, by focusing on interactions between genes known to be involved in disease-related biological processes, one can maximize a priori biological plausibility and post hoc interpretability while reducing the multiple testing correction threshold and computational burden (Pattin and Moore 2008) . In this study, we investigated genes from the AD pathway of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, which is a collection of manually curated pathways based on published literature for metabolism, genetic and environmental information processing, and human diseases, including AD (Kanehisa and Goto 2000; Kanehisa et al. 2012) . The AD KEGG pathway (hsa05010) includes genes related to amyloid and tau processing, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, free radical production, and calcium homeostasis (http://www.genome.jp/ kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05010.html).\nAnother challenge for genetic interaction analysis concerns the biological ''unit'' or level at which one tries to replicate or validate findings. Attempts to replicate at the SNP level are rife with problems unrelated to verification of a true biological effect (Neale and Sham 2004) . SNPlevel replication is problematic largely due to the fact that most genotyped SNPs are not functional and merely tag a putative functional element. Differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns across samples from a single population can result in variable efficiency of tag SNPs and even reverse directionality of effects, wherein a tag SNP is linked to the risk allele in one sample but the reference or protective allele in another sample (Neale and Sham 2004) .\nLikewise, allelic heterogeneity, in which multiple SNPs in a gene have a similar effect, can result in reduced statistical power and a failure to confirm an association with any particular SNP, even when all are associated with the disease of interest (Neale and Sham 2004) . Indeed, since SNPs generally exert their effects either by altering the structure of a protein, the probability of transcription, or the efficiency of translation, their biological relevance is properly interpreted at the gene level (i.e., whether a protein is functional, whether it is present in deficient or excessive levels, etc.). Thus, in this study, we use a genebased approach to validate significant interactions from the discovery set in two additional independent datasets. A similar replication approach was previously successful in validating a novel gene-gene interaction underlying highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (Ma et al. 2012 (Ma et al. , 2013 ."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco.

Such an interaction is biologically feasible given that the proteins encoded by CACNA1C and RYR3 interact to maintain calcium homeostasis necessary for normal brain function (Ouardouz et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007) and that many studies outlined below have shown a relationship between calcium homeostasis and amyloidogenesis, whereby increased intracellular calcium levels lead to increased Ab deposition. An increase in Ab is considered a key event in AD etiology (e.g., Jack et al. 2013) , and calcium dysregulation is thought to assist in amyloid formation and deposition and has been hypothesized to be very important in the etiology of AD (Berridge 2010) . Increases in intracellular calcium have been shown to increase Ab production in human cell lines (Querfurth and Selkoe 1994) . High levels of intracellular calcium also have been shown to induce transient phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein in neurons, leading to increased production of Ab (Pierrot et al. 2006) . Lastly, calcium ions themselves have been shown to promote the formation of neurotoxic Ab oligomers in vitro (Itkin et al. 2011) . Our findings are further strengthened by accumulating evidence that RYR3 modulates Ab plaque deposition (Kelliher et al. 1999; Supnet et al. 2006; Oul\u00e8s et al. 2012) and that CACNA1C increases intracellular calcium levels in the presence of Ab (Mattson et al. 1992; Ueda et al. 1997; Scragg et al. 2005) .\nThis interaction could have an important clinical application, since both proteins encoded by these two genes are calcium channels that have FDA-approved channel blocking drugs and blocking either channel has been proposed as a therapy for AD pathology (Fruen et al. 1997; Anekonda et al. 2011) . A combination of these therapies could be investigated as an enhanced approach to AD treatment."}, {"section_title": "RYR3 and CACNA1C", "text": "RYR3 encodes ryanodine receptor (RyR)-3, which is a receptor expressed in the brain (Giannini 1995 ) located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis (Berridge 2010) . CACNA1C encodes the pore-forming alpha 1C subunit of voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) which are also expressed in the brain (Perez-Reyes et al. 1990 ). The major characteristics of this channel, including voltage sensitivity, ion selectivity, and pharmacological responsivity to calcium channel blockers, are encoded by CACNA1C (Bhat et al. 2012) . This subunit forms a pore in the cell membrane through which calcium ions flow into the cell (Bhat et al. 2012 )."}, {"section_title": "RYR3 in AD pathogenesis", "text": "In animal models of AD, the relationship between RyR and Ab has been extensively explored. Transgenic mice which overexpress the precursor of Ab (APP, encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP)) have increased RyR expression in their neuroblastoma cell lines (Oul\u00e8s et al. 2012) . Specifically, extracellular amyloid has been shown to selectively increase RyR-3 (but not RyR-1 or -2) isoform expression in cortical neurons of both wild type and AD-model mice (Supnet et al. 2006) . Transgenic mice which harbor human APP mutations have increased RyR expression in isolated cortical neurons, and this overexpression of RyR disrupts calcium homeostasis by increasing ER calcium release (Oul\u00e8s et al. 2012) . Furthermore, this relationship between RyR and Ab has been shown to be bi-directional, such that RyRs can also affect Ab levels. Dantrolene is a pharmacological agent that blocks calcium release from RyR-1 and RyR-3 and has been used in cell and animal models to diminish cell death resulting from neuronal injury (Fruen Fig. 1 The effect of genetic interactions between RYR3 and CAC-NA1C on amyloid deposition.

Interestingly, when it was used to block RyR and decrease calcium release in mouse models which either overexpressed APP or had an APP mutation, this decrease in calcium level was shown to reduce levels of intracellular and extracellular Ab, as well as the number of Ab plaques (Oul\u00e8s et al. 2012 ). Thus, RyR-induced calcium levels seem to influence Ab levels. This has also been shown in human cell lines: in human neuroglioma and embryonic cell lines transfected with APP, Ab production increased as levels of intracellular calcium increased and RyR-mediated calcium release increased (Querfurth and Selkoe 1994; Buxbaum et al. 1994) . In summary, the existing literature indicates that there is a bi-directional relationship between RyR and Ab, such that increased Ab has been associated with increased RyR expression, and RyR-driven calcium release has been associated with increased Ab levels."}, {"section_title": "CACNA1C in AD pathogenesis", "text": "CACNA1C encodes the pore-forming subunit of voltagedependent LTCCs. Its role in AD etiology can be better understood through its relationship with Ab and its effects on calcium dysregulation. In rat cortical cell lines, the presence of Ab increased calcium uptake by LTCCs by almost twofold (Ueda et al. 1997) . In human cerebral cortical cell lines, Ab destabilized neuronal calcium regulation and rendered neurons more vulnerable to environmental stimuli that elevate intracellular calcium levels (Mattson et al. 1992) . Up-regulation of the expression of CACNA1C was observed in human neuroblastoma cell lines after treatment with Ab (Anekonda et al. 2011) , and Ab promotes the insertion of the subunit encoded by CACNA1C into the plasma membrane (Scragg et al. 2005) . In summary, Ab modulates LTCC function to increase intracellular calcium and as described above in ''Calcium homeostasis and its relationship to amyloidogenesis'', this increase in intracellular calcium can further increase Ab production and deposition."}, {"section_title": "RYR3-CACNA1C interaction and amyloid load", "text": "Both of the products of RYR3 and CACNA1C have been shown to have a relationship with cellular Ab. These products have also been shown to physically interact with each other: in a study of cerebellar granule cells, RyRs and LTCCs have been shown to be functionally coupled, with RyRs controlling the activity of LTCCs (Chavis et al. 1996) . In a separate study in in vitro rat neuronal cell lines, immunoprecipitation revealed an association between LTCCs and RyRs, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the co-localization of LTCC and RyR clusters on axons (Ouardouz et al. 2003) . In that same study, depolarization sensed by LTCCs activated RyRs, which caused the release of toxic levels of calcium (Ouardouz et al. 2003) . This interaction was also demonstrated in a study of rat hippocampal tissue, where a physical interaction between the N-terminus of the LTCC and the N-terminus of a RyR was observed (Kim et al. 2007 ). Finally, an interaction between RyRs and LTCCs has been observed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, where these proteins are also expressed (Cannell and Soeller 1997; Squecco et al. 2004) .\nWith the evidence of physical interaction between the RyR and LTCC proteins and the evidence outlined above relating RyR, LTCC, calcium release, and Ab to each other, the statistical genetic interaction we report herein might be reflective of causal variants in RYR3 and CAC-NA1C interacting to cause disruption of calcium homeostasis and to increase intracellular calcium levels leading to increased Ab production and deposition as detected by PET."}, {"section_title": "Caveats", "text": "Fine-mapping and functional analysis of the SNPs identified could help clarify the implications of these statistical genetic interactions and provide greater specificity when attempting to leverage these results to identify targets for clinical intervention. Because we validated our results at the gene-gene level and not the SNP-SNP level, further delving into the function of each of these SNPs or the causal variant these SNPs are tagging would be necessary to understand whether the discovery and validation models represent the same effect. For example, if each SNP increases the expression of its respective gene, we could conclude that the effect was truly replicated and that increased expression of both genes is associated with increased amyloid load (regardless of which SNP caused the overexpression). In summary, the effect that each SNP has on expression level or function would have to be explored to determine true replication of the effect.\nThe exact SNP-SNP interactions do not replicate across the samples, but we would argue (as others have) this lack of replication does not necessarily indicate a false positive result and may instead be due to one or several biological reasons (Neale and Sham 2004) , including allelic heterogeneity (wherein different alleles at the same locus are each responsible for increased disease risk in different subjects), differences in minor allele frequency, or differences in LD structure across samples. The power to replicate at the SNP level drops dramatically with a change in allele frequency between datasets (Greene et al. 2009 ). Differences in LD structure across the two samples between each tag SNP and the causal variant could cause the same high-risk allele to have different patterns of association with the marker alleles (Neale and Sham 2004) .\nThe gene-based replication approach we employed here attenuates these issues and has been proposed as the ''gold standard'' for replication and the ''natural end point for association analysis'' (Neale and Sham 2004) . This is perhaps especially important in gene-gene interaction studies where these issues are amplified.\nThe present results must be interpreted within the framework of our statistical models. In all cases, we included covariates related to disease status and progression, including age, education, diagnosis, sex, and APOE status. Thus, all significant interactions explained variance beyond known predictors of risk, and while the contributions of these interactions appear to be meaningful, the implications should not be extended without considering the variance accounted for by the other factors in our model. The interactions in this study represent dominant effects (carriers versus non-carriers), and the results have been interpreted accordingly. We did not test mitochondrial genes in this study. This could be explored in a further analysis."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we have explored the relationship between genes within the AD pathway and their relationships to Ab plaque levels in humans. We found evidence for a statistical association between calcium dysregulation and Ab deposition as detected by PET amyloid imaging. In light of prior studies associating the products of RYR3 and CAC-NA1C with each other and with AD pathology, this result is certainly biologically plausible. This interaction is of particular clinical significance because pharmacological manipulation of the two channels involved is feasible for future AD treatment. Combined therapy, using LTCC and RyR blockers, could first be tested in cell lines and animal models to determine its effect on Ab plaque load and neuronal cell death."}]
