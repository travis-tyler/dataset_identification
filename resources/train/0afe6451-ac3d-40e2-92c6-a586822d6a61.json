These various crises appear along with the development of contemporary times. One crisis in Indonesia should get more attention is in education. Education has a strong impact on the development of a country. Education is important to develop students in the life. One problem is Indonesian students could not compete with other countries' students. So Indonesian education must be able to prepare graduates able to overcome the competition. One ability has an important role and needs to improve is cognitive abilities because they have important implications for interpersonal behavior and relationships (Murphy & Hall, 2011) . Cognitive development in the domain of mathematics is very important for educational and financial success in contemporary society. (National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008) .\nBased on the results of data from the 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) conducted on elementary school students showing the achieved of Indonesian students in mathematics ranked 46 of 51 countries with a score of 397. The average percentage of correct answers in the cognitive domain of children in Indonesia got a score of 76 while the average for international children is 150. The average percentage of correct answers in the domain of number and geometry content in Indonesia is 24 and 28 while for international scores 49 and 50. This shows thatthere were still many children who had not attended early childhood education. From the data got 28% of students in Indonesia not attending early childhood education, this the fifth largest number compared to other countries. Another reason is the lack of stimulation given to children, 27% of parents in Indonesia do activities that stimulate numeracy and literacy skills of students, such as reading fairy tales, singing the alphabet (Litbang.kemdikbud.go.id). Based on the findings, the spread of early childhood education institutions and cognitive stimulation at an early age influence the next level of education. Merkley & Ansari (2016: 20) which shows that cognitive development which highlights knowledge of number symbols is a longitudinal predictor of mathematical achievement. This knowledge mediates the transition between informal and formal mathematics learning and can improve school readiness.\nBased on the six longitudinal datasets found that mathematical skills in terms of numbers can predict the performance at the next school level higher than early reading skills, attentional skills or social-emotional skills.\n(Duncan, Dowsett, Claessens, Magnuson, Huston, Klebanov, Pagani, Feinstein, Engel, Brooks, Sexton, Duckworth, Japel, 2007: 1443). In fact, they were to leave this potential unrealized for many children. To realize this, a mathematical intervention needed providing experience for early childhood so children's mathematical knowledge increases. There are advantages to involving children in the mathematical experience, the knowledge of preschoolers about mathematics can use to predict success at the level of education in elementary schools and even high schools (Clements & Sarama, 2011: 968) .\nSeeing these conditions required special attention so as not to cause a worse impact in the following year. Observed from the consequences of early childhood, early childhood cognitive abilities of early mathematics need to develop. Early childhood cognitive abilities can improve from providing stimulation through media suitable for children according to the characteristics and needs of children. Piotrowski & Valkenburg (2015 : 1783 stated that media and child development had a greater effect. In this study, the authors developed pop-up books for stimulating children's cognitive media.\nPop-up books are different from books in general because they have dimensions when the book is opened so that it adds enthusiasm, with popup books the teacher can invite student interactivity in its use, students can use individually or in groups (Hiner, 2006: 19) . Iizuka (2011: 605) , states that Pop-Up is a paper craft with an attractive and consistent shape on the folds of paper shaped into 3 dimensions when opened. Furthermore, Dzuanda (2011: 5-6) showed that pop-up books can develop children's creativity, stimulate children's imagination, increase knowledge and give an introduction to objects, and can a medium to foster interest in reading in children. In addition, the benefits of reading pop-up books, pop-up methods, empower readers to control the order of time, move forward and back according to their wishes, and the ability to entertain and surprise even through repeated reading, the reader will remember the content by (Boyce, 2011: 254) .\nThe use of books with Pop-up forms contains material about cognitive is expected to make children's cognitive skills in the early mathematics field increase. This is because pop-up books children's skills can be honed, which includes the ability to conceptualize numbers, patterns, and classification. Based on observations and interviews known that the implementation of learning in children is only centered on the teacher and the use of learning media that is less varied. So pop-up books can be an interesting media for children and can be a medium for learning, especially in children's cognitive development. Based on the description of the above problems, it is necessary to develop a book with an interesting form and containing cognitive material close to the child, so that the basic concepts of early mathematics can be studied more optimally and meaningfully by children."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": "The research method that used is a research and development (R&D) method that can interpret as a scientific way to research, design, produce and test the validity of products it has produced (Sugiyono, 2015: 30) . The Subjects in this study are children aged 4-5 years in Sragen. The subjects used for the preliminary field test were 2 teachers and 12 children aged 4-5 years, the main field test of 4 teachers and 31 children aged 4-5 years, and then in operational field test comprised 40 children.\nTechniques and instruments of data collection conducted through interviews, validation sheets, teacher and child response questionnaires, and"}, {"section_title": "Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research, volume 249", "text": "observation sheets, and a test. The validity measured through the media validation sheet, then using the passing grade (X) which was the average score of the assessment results of academic and practitioners validatory and adapted to the media form the assessment criteria that have developed in table 1. Data in the form of observations of observations of children's responses using the agreement criteria in the form of total score assessment data with the assessment instrument model \"yes, will not be processed using the percentage of an agreement formula (Grinnell, 1998,160).\nThe effectiveness of pop-up book media measured using students' learning outcomes. To decide the effectiveness of the pop-up book media, it was necessary to conduct pretest and posttest. The experimental design using pre-experimental design in the form of one-group pretest-posttest design so that the treatment result can be more exact. This research conducts pretest to decide the students' learning outcomes before using pop-up book media. Then conducts posttest to decide the students' learning outcomes after using pop-up book media.\nIn addition, used a paired t-test to decide the significance students' learning outcomes improvement on cognitive ability. This research conducted a data analysis technique of paired t-test using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Normality testing of the data was to use Kolmogorov Smirnov.\nPlanning. In the preparation of the framework hold inside cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books refers to the results of information gathering in preliminary studies. Steps in planning research and development include: determining the material and indicators according to the stage of child cognitive development in age 4-5 years. It uses literature studies to decide this indicator. The next stage is determining the theme, in this Pop-Up Books, the theme taken for transportation. After it determines the theme, the researcher has a pop-up technique suitable for use the book. The next stage is determining the theme, in this Pop-Up Books, the theme taken for transportation. After it determines the theme, the researcher has a pop-up technique suitable for use the book. The next stage is determining the theme, in this Pop-Up Books, the theme taken for transportation. After it determines the theme, the researcher has a pop-up technique suitable for use the book. The techniques used are Pop-up Pop-ups, v-fold, 45o fold, box fold. Next, the researcher determines the image matches the theme and color suitable for the characteristics of children aged 4-5 years. The final stage of developing popUp Books learning media is the decision of the material to use.\nProduct Development. At the development stage, the first step in developing the product was compiling cognitive stimulation media material based on Pop-Up Books. Pop-up book material about cognitive abilities divided into 3 series has introduced the concept of numbers, classification and pattern recognition. Of these three materials are more inclined to cognitive development in the early mathematics. The next step after has determined the material is to design an image pattern according to the material that has determined using Corel Draw X5. After it finishes the design, prints the image in Ivory 260 gr paper.\nAt the first meeting, teachers used cognitive stimulation media based on pop-up books in groups. At the second and third meetings, the teacher provides opportunities for children individually to use the media. Based on material content and presentation aspects get an average score in category \"very good\" and in the overall assessment, the criteria got are in the \"very valid\". Besides getting assess from the teacher, researchers got data from children's responses to Pop-Up Books learning media.\nChildren's response for each item statement is good. They are interested in pop-up books to learn new things in the learning and different from other learning media. It looked interesting affected the learning environment became more enjoyable. Children agreed that learning to use a pop-up book can increase the motivation, and present material was easy. The pictures and material contained on the pop-up book following the theme. Children agreed to use the pop-up book as an alternative media for understanding the cognitive development, even they wished to use a pop-up book for the other content. Overall, the teacher's assessment received a good response. The teacher gives a few suggestions to change the color and size of the pop-up book. Children's response in main field testing is great, they are enthusiastic using pop-up media books. The results of data analysis on the response of children get a percentage of 98%. So, the media feasible for children.\nRevision. This third stage revision includes replacing a less bright pop-up book, such as changing the color of a light pink bus to an older pink one. In addition, the teacher gives suggest changing the size of the book that is too large for children, from the first size of 21x 52 to 21x42.\nof complexity. More than just a text container, popup books are material objects, with form and language, where existing moving elements and the possibility to describe support have contributed to changing both production and reading practices. In pop-up books, support not only has text but becomes a communicative space (Sarlatto, 2017: 89) In addition, respondents showed that with the pop-up books, children will motivate in learning. Ray and Smith (2010) showed that using children's books attracts to encourage learners' persistence and motivational behavior related to goals. The motivational potential of children's books in mathematics learning is how books can generate emotional connections to students involves them at various levels (Heuvel and Boogaard, 2008).\nIn planning, research and development include: (1) determining the material and indicators according to the stage of child development, (2) determining the theme of Pop-Up Books proper to the child's interests, (3) has a pop-up technique proper for the book, (4) decide the image that matches the theme and color suitable for the characteristics of children aged 4-5 years, (5) decide the material to use in a pop-up.\nAfter completing the plan, the next is Product Development. At the development stage, the first step in developing the product was compiling content Pop-Up Books. Pop-up book material about cognitive abilities divided into 3 series has introduced the concept of numbers, classification and pattern recognition. Of these three materials are more inclined to cognitive development in the early mathematics. There are advantages to involving children in the mathematical experience, the knowledge of preschoolers about mathematics can be used to predict the success in elementary school and even high school (Clements & Sarama, 2011: 968) . Furthermore, Lyons & Ansari (2015: 93) show that numerical and mathematical skills are important predictors of academic success. In addition, the ability to recognize the concept of pattern is very important for children because pattern activities become the center of mathematics. Preschoolers have involved as early algebraic thinking (Johnson, Fyfe, McLean, and McEldoon (2013: 377) .\nMaterial experts and media experts conducted Validity testing to test the feasibility of the product before being used in the field. Validation from material experts received an average score of 3.30 which was in the very valid category. Suggestion from material experts that is replacing images and letters in small size to be larger so all children can see them. Setiautami (2011: 316) showed that easyto-read text sizes range from 14 to 24 points depending on the type and age of readers and leading 4 to 6 points. Furthermore, Nurgiyantoro (2016: 93) showed that the size of the letters in children's reading books influenced children's motivation. Large letters will give a better sensory impression and make it easier to remember.\nAdvice from media experts makes pop-Up Books cover look more interesting. In addition, combinations of colors on cover should use a bright and contrasting color to attract more children's attention. The color choice must adjust to the colors children see. Using natural colors can increase child realism (Smaldino et al., 2011: 76) . The next suggestion is to make corners of book curved to be safe for children and not harmful to children. Another suggestion is to create a guidebook to help cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books.\nAfter being declared feasible by material and media experts, the next step is Preliminary field testing and the main field testing as a product feasibility test. In the preliminary field testing, assess the teacher's response to the content and presentation components received mean scores of 3.32 and 3.33. While for the overall assessment, cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books received an average score of 3.33. Besides getting an assessment from the teacher, the researcher got data from the child's response. The results of the children's response assessment get an average score of 89%. For a wider field test, assess the teacher's response to the content and presentation components had a mean score of 3.59 and 3.61. While for the overall assessment, cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books received an average score of 3.60 and included in the \"very good\" category. Besides getting an asses data from the child's response. The results of the child's response assessment received an average score of 98.6%.\nFrom these results, it can see that material content form in Preliminary Field Test and main Field Test included in a great category. According to the teacher, the material in the pop-up book learning media in accordance with a cognitive development of children aged 4-5 years. Ma et al. (2014: 87) show that picture books designed for children must fulfill the nature of children and have characteristics relevant to language development, cognitive\ninvolvement, and artistic thinking, pleasure, and to increase the interest and attention of users.\nIn the presentation form of the two trials included in the excellent category. Display of cover containing various images of transportation tools attracts children's interest. In addition, the contents of the book from the pop-up book media comprising various models of transportation tools make children more enthusiastic in learning. The bright color display is the main attraction of pop-up media book. Pop-up book learning media have communicative, interactive, interesting, and informative properties so the target can receive the message (Aisyah and Fauzi, 2012: 83). Together with these children's books spread an idea that an object can become a book and toy at the same time so that the interest in learning increases (Mosca Bonsignore, 2011).\nChildren's responses to cognitive learning using pop-up books are in the very good category. Children are very enthusiastic to learn to use pop-up books. They revealed that with pop-up media the book is easier to learn. The curiosity of children increases and children become more active in learning. According to them, various models of transportation tools in the pop-up book are great and interesting. Valerie Carroll (2015: 39) showed that children like pop-up books because they like anticipation; they want to see what's under the fold. Based on the results above the learning media of pop-up books are feasible for improving cognitive abilities of children aged 4-5 years.\nThe final stage of this study is an operational testing. In this trial, researchers conducted an effectiveness test to determine the effect of using cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books in developing cognitive abilities of children aged 4-5 years. Paired-sample t-test results for cognitive abilities scores before and after using cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books have a significant value of 0,000 <0.005. Based on the average value, the posttest value in using cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books has a higher value than at pretest with an increase of 11.15. These results mean that the posttest and pretest scores have significant differences and show that cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books is effective for cognitive learning to improve cognitive abilities in children aged 4-5 years in introducing concept numbers, patterns, and classifications. Hiner (2006: 19) revealed that Pop-up books can teach mathematics to children individually and in groups, besides that for centuries books like this were to help scientific work. Van Oers (2013) acknowledges the potential benefits of children's books to support discourse, especially when discourse can encourage illustrations that support children's thinking about mathematical ideas. Furthermore, Bluemel and Taylor (2012: 4) showed that pop-up books can help students understand reallife situations with symbols or images, and develop students to think critically and creatively. Dzuanda (2011: 5-6 ) reveals that Pop-up books can increase knowledge and give shape recognition to objects. Van Dyk (2010: 7) reveals pop-up books can make the learning experience more effective, interactive, and memorable. Using pop-up books can also involve users in a kinetic, through opening books and movable books can also help in combining hands and eyes, action and reaction, and discovery and amazement. From the explanation above, it can be concluded that in the development of children's cognitive abilities using cognitive stimulation media based on Pop-Up Books can improve in cognitive abilities in kindergarten.\n."}, {"section_title": "RESULT AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Result", "text": "The Development of Pop-up Book Media Preliminary Study. The development of pop-up book media in this study starts with the preliminary study, planning and developing the product. Preliminary study attends to get the first data and the needs of teachers and children in the teaching and learning process. By conducting a needs analysis, it can develop media pop-up book learning on the conditions and conditions faced by students. In this preliminary study phase, information gathering includes needs analysis and literature study. Based on the needs analysis, it gets general information about the learning it applies that in schools.\nIn cognitive learning, teachers use more conventional methods such as lectures so that learning is teacher-centered and provides fewer opportunities for children to take part direct and active in the learning process. In addition, the media used in learning is less varied. Teachers often use 2D, LKA or magazine images in the learning process, so that children often bored and are less interested in learning. They seldom use learning media that is more interesting and real. Most of them show that the material in the magazine was coherent, making it easier for teachers to teach. Furthermore, researchers found that most of the cognitive abilities of children have not developed optimally. They still experience difficulties in the numbers concept, organizing number symbols and sorting numbers. The ability to classify objects and pattern recognition of children is still low.\nTeacher's knowledge of Pop-up books is still low. Respondents who know about pop-up books are only 30%, the rest they don't know what pop-up books are. Most respondents show they had never used pop-up books in learning. The respondents have only seen pop-up books in the form of storybooks, but have never tried to use them for learning. Furthermore, researchers dig up information about whether pop-up books needed as media for cognitive learning for children. Respondents showed that needed cognitive stimulus media based pop-up book for cognitive learning. These respondents think pop-up books will interest to children. So, children will focus and not bored. In addition, children will focus and not bored.

Respondents think pop-up books will attractive to children. So, children will focus and not bored. The main attraction reason of pop-up books is the variety of attractive page views (Ma, Wei & Lin, 2014: 91). Furthermore, Songjing (2014: 623) show that pop-up books are an invaluable source for multimodal discourse analysis because they are not only a means of entertainment for young readers but the main means of literacy, literature and social values.
