[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most important disorders causing dementia in the elderly, with an estimated 36 million people affected worldwide in 2010. The AD population is expected to rise to 66 million by 2030, and 115 million by 2050. 1 Over 500,000 Canadians have dementia now, and over 100,000 develop some form of dementia each year. This exceeds the 40,000-50,000 new cases of stroke that occur in Canada each year. Estimates are, that by 2038, the annual incidence of new dementia cases per year in Canada will be 257,800, which is over double the current rate, and the prevalence will be 1, 125,200 by 2038. 2 In the USA, currently 5.3 million people have dementia, 3 but this is expected to increase to 13.2 million by 2050. 4 Currently, AD pathology contributes significantly approximately 60 per cent (50-75% range) of the total number of people with dementia living in developed countries. Moreover, in the USA, AD is the third most costly disease following cardiovascular disease and depression. 5 Despite the large effort to understand the cause of this disease, its pathogenesis has still to be fully elucidated.\nThe first case of AD reported by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906 revealed not only the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), but also the presence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Despite this seminal observation of concomitant CVD and the hallmark pathologies of AD in this important index case, Alzheimer himself and AbstrAct: Alzheimer's disease (AD), considered the commonest neurodegenerative cause of dementia, is associated with hallmark pathologies including extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) deposition in extracellular senile plaques and vessels, and intraneuronal tau deposition as neurofibrillary tangles. Although AD is usually categorized as neurodegeneration distinct from cerebrovascular disease (CVD), studies have shown strong links between AD and CVD. There is evidence that vascular risk factors and CVD may accelerate A\u03b2 40-42 production/ aggregation/deposition and contribute to the pathology and symptomatology of AD. A\u03b2 deposited along vessels also causes cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Amyloid imaging allows in vivo detection of AD pathology, opening the way for prevention and early treatment, if disease-modifying therapies in the pipeline show safety and efficacy. In this review, we review the role of vascular factors and A\u03b2, underlining that vascular risk factor management may be important for AD prevention and treatment. r\u00e9sum\u00e9: maladie d'Alzheimer, maladie c\u00e9r\u00e9brovasculaire et cascade \u03b2-amylo\u00efde.

A number of studies have shown that the risk factors for CVD are quite similar to those for non-genetic AD 7,8 , and that symptoms of dementia are more readily expressed when Alzheimer's brain pathology coexists with cerebrovascular lesions. 9-12 It has been also shown that cerebral infarction and other types of brain injury can accelarate Alzheimer neuropathology. [13] [14] [15] Furthermore, amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2)"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "deposition in the brain occurs not only in the parenchyma but also in the vessel walls, causing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).\nIt has been increasingly accepted that AD is linked to A\u03b2 accumulation and NFT formation, which begins at a very early stage of disease progression in the brain of AD patients, often decades before clinical symptoms begin, and also that A\u03b2 deposition can be present even though clinical dementia is not manifest. 12, 16 Hence, it has been thought that A\u03b2 accumulation might be one of the earliest changes in the normal aging human brain. Recent basic research, however, provides evidence that A\u03b2 in oligomeric form is neurotoxic, even when it has not fibrillated and deposited as plaques in the brain. [17] [18] [19] As A\u03b2 deposition is known to occur in the preclinical stage of AD, preclinical detection in vivo of AD is an important goal if amyloid-reducing drugs become available.\nRecently, diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease have been updated and include A\u03b2 imaging. 20 Much effort has been made to develop sensitive and specific neuroimaging techniques to assist in the diagnosis of AD, but so far, no definitive criteria have been determined for diagnosing AD using conventional imaging modalities. 21 Since AD has specific pathological characteristics in the postmortem brain, current imaging efforts are focused on direct imaging of the pathological process, especially of A\u03b2, in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) to detect A\u03b2 deposition in the brain has been applied to normal elderly, prodromal AD as well as AD dementia populations. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] These developments warrant a reconsideration of relationships among AD, CVD, and A\u03b2, especially since imaging methods may soon allow detection of amyloid as well as vascular brain injury in vivo. In particular, there is growing evidence that non-genetic AD may be initiated by vascular factors that precede and may foment the neurodegenerative cascade. 27 We review some of the recently published basic and clinicopathological research data that support this hypothesis. We also review the pathogenesis of A\u03b2, and the opportunity that A\u03b2 imaging offers for detecting preclinical AD. Our purpose is to give the neurological community an overview of basic and clinical research studies related to A\u03b2 and AD, and to discuss vascular risk factors and the pathogenesis of AD with a special reference to the role of CVD in the emergence of AD dementia. Clinical implications of A\u03b2 imaging for early detection of AD are also discussed."}, {"section_title": "Definition", "text": "Dementia has been generally defined as acquired persistent impairments in two or more cognitive domains (one of which should be memory for typical AD), sufficient to cause decline in ability to carry out social or occupational functioning independently. The most prevalent types of dementia are classified by presumed etiology into VaD caused by vascular lesions and AD resulting from a neurodegenerative process. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) 28 and the previously widely used criteria formulated and recently revised by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association (NINDs-ADRDA), which have just recently been revised in 2011 20 , a demented individual who has evidence of substantial CVD previously is excluded from the diagnosis of probable AD. By DSM-IV-TR, this person would be automatically classified as VaD instead. Other research criteria specify imaging and clinical criteria including mode of onset and progression for VaD. 29 However, CVD (for example, lacunar infarcts, CAA, microbleeds, and white matter changes) is frequently found in the brains of AD patients. 30 The recent revision of the NINDs-ADRDA acknowledge that CVD is common and if concommitant CVD is evident, the designation of possible AD can be used. 20 Some researchers have hypothesized that there are two major pathological pathways leading to development of AD: the amyloid cascade or vascular injury. The first step of the amyloid hypothesis is excessive miscleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into longer fragments A\u03b2 40-42, which are neurotoxic and prone to fibrillate and deposit in senile plaques or along vessels, eventually leading to AD dementia. 31 On the other hand, the vascular hypothesis suggests that ischemic changes and hypoperfusion associated with aging and vascular risk factors, disturbing blood supply and metabolism, lead to neuronal and/or neuroglial energy failure which not only causes injury, but also accelerates amyloid over-production and reduces clearance, 32 eventually leading to AD pathology. 33 We will consider the evidence that has been put forward to support the pathogenic role of vascular injury in AD."}, {"section_title": "epiDemiology", "text": "Numerous prospective and retrospective population-based epidemiological studies have revealed a number of risk factors associated with both AD and CVD. These include cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, high fibrinogen levels, high serum viscosity, smoking, and obesity. 7, 8 Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks are also considered to be risk factors for AD. 7, 9 Related to those factors, age is also clearly one of the most important risk factors for AD. The incidence of AD is strongly and positively correlated with age, from less than 1% in people aged 65 years to over 25% in those who are aged 85 years or over in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. 34, 35 One meta-analysis revealed that prevalence of AD consistently doubles every 5.1 years after age 60, confirming the strong relationship between prevalence of AD and age. 36 Other predisposing factors include alcoholism, traumatic brain injury (TBI), aluminium toxicity, and herpes simplex virus infection, which are believed to cause inflammation and free radical damage to neuronal and other cells and subsequent gliosis. Significant TBI is also associated with overproduction of A\u03b2 in the acute phase. Genetic polymorphism for apolipoprotein E type 4 (APOE-\u03b54) is the strongest genetic susceptibility risk factor for late-onset AD so far recognized, though recent studies have identified weaker genetic factors such as polymorphisms in the SORL1 gene for late onset AD, 37 as well as several other gene loci. 38 Since the APOE-\u03b54 allele has been reported to be a risk factor causing various cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events 8, 39 , it is of great importance to better understand the role of this gene in the pathogenesis of AD in association with CVD. There are also gene mutations (e.g., PS1 on chromosome 14, PS2 on chromosome 1, and APP on chromosome 21) for familial forms of early onset AD 40 and for autosomal dominant CAA. 41 eviDence of risk fActors for AD AnD cvD (Figure 1) "}, {"section_title": "a) risk factors", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Aging", "text": "Aging is one of the most important factors causing various types of vascular events. Blood vessels and their basement membrane, endothelial and muscular components gradually lose their integrity with aging. Older adults who have no typical risk factors, such as genetic predisposition, vascular risk factors, or previous TBI, can still develop AD. In this particular patient group, aging likely plays a predominant role in AD pathogenesis. The normally aging brain undergoes pathophysiological changes, including decreased cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism, which might, at least in part, result from loss of integrity of brain microvessels, both on the arteriolar and venular side of the microcirculation. 7, 42 Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidences of both AD and CVD increase with aging [34] [35] [36] and some even claim that very late onset disease is part of the normal aging process. Therefore, the pathophysiological changes induced by aging could be etiologically related to, or even play an initiating role in, the pathogenesis of AD."}, {"section_title": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE for gene; apoE for protein)", "text": "ApoE is a plasma protein that transports lipids (e.g. cholesterol) and is associated with neuronal repair. The APOE gene, located on chromosome 19, has three allelic variations, and the occurrence rates in the general population are 8% for \u03b52, 78% for \u03b53, and 14% for \u03b54, respectively, although this varies in different populations. 39 The APOE-\u03b54 allele is a genetic risk factor for both familial and sporadic late-onset AD 43 ; this has been confirmed epidemiologically and pathologically. Heterozygous APOE-\u03b54 carriers (\u03b52/\u03b54 or \u03b53/\u03b54) have 3-4 times the risk of developing AD, and homozygous carriers (\u03b54/\u03b54) have 10-12 times the risk. 44 Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) possessing at least one APOE-\u03b54 Figure 1 : The schema shows the hypothetical pathway of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main stream of this pathway is starting from the brain of individuals with no AD-related gene, i.e. sporadic AD, with mid-life vascular risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity) through infarction (or hypoperfusion) and \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) increase, resulting in neuritic plaques or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and finally progressing to clinical AD. There is another pathway that starts from the brain of individuals with AD-related genes such as having a mutation in presenilin1, presenilin2, or amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes, or Down's syndrome. Sporadic AD is one of the most important disorders for the older population. Studies have suggested an association between risk factors and subsequent development of AD. However, some of the AD patients who do not have any risk factors may be affected by other aging effects that cause hypoperfusion in their brains. Once A\u03b2 peptide levels increase in the brain, these might (possibly via tau elevation) cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. However, the pathway from A\u03b2 increases in to diffuse plaques may not cause dementia in older adults.\nallele have a 62% increased risk of progressing to AD. 45 In comparison to non-carriers, they have lower mini mental status examination (MMSE) and higher (worse) Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-cog) scores, and smaller hippocampal sizes. 46 Most longitudinal analyses of nondemented individuals also reveal a greater decline in performance on a variety of cognitive tests in APOE-\u03b54 positive subjects, 47, 48 showing that the presence of APOE-\u03b54 is a risk factor for cognitive impairment. As pathological evidence, the ApoE protein is present in senile plaques and binds to the A\u03b2(1\u221228) peptide. 49 ApoE may have specific effects on the formation, aggregability, or clearance of A\u03b2, neurite outgrowth, and antioxidant activity. APOE-\u03b54 is neurotoxic compared to \u03b53, whereas \u03b52 has protective effects. 43 Increased risk for AD, decreased age of onset, increased senile plaque density, and decreased cholinergic neuron density, have all been shown to correlate with APOE-\u03b54 allele copy numbers. 50 APOE-\u03b54 is also reported to be a risk factor for CVD including CAA. APOE-\u03b54 was more common, not only in patients with AD (50-65%), but also in VaD (26%), than in nondemented controls (14%). 51 This allele is a risk factor for developing CAA and cerebrovascular pathology associated with AD, 52 and is associated with the presence of CAA-related hemorrhages that are probably due to increased A\u03b2 deposition in the cerebral vessel walls. 53, 54 Although the APOE-\u03b52 allele is protective for AD, 55 APOE-\u03b52 is believed to be a risk factor for CAA-related hemorrhages independent of AD, whereas APOE-\u03b54 is a risk factor dependent on concomitant AD. 56, 57 The APOE-\u03b54 allele is associated with elevations in total cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis relative to the \u03b53 allele, while the \u03b52 allele has the opposite effect. 58 ApoE is the major cholesterol carrier in the brain, is very important in repairing damaged neuronal membranes, and binds to A\u03b2. 59 It has been thought that interactions of ApoE and cholesterol might play a role in A\u03b2 secretion. Overall, APOE-\u03b54 may make the brain more vulnerable; it could be one of the most important genetic risk factors for brain damage, such as by CVD and AD. For a comprehensive review of the role of APOE in AD, please see the article by Kim et al. 60 "}, {"section_title": "Hypercholesterolemia", "text": "Hypercholesterolemia has received enormous attention because of its important etiological role in cardiovascular disease and therapeutic advances for its control. Epidemiological evidence has shown that hypercholesterolemia is also an important risk factor for AD. In the Rotterdam Study, high dietary intake of total fat and saturated fat increased the risk of dementia and AD, whereas fish consumption, a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, was inversely related to the incidence of dementia, particularly AD. 35, 61 This study also found that there was no relationship between serum cholesterol level and risk of dementia within two years, while a longitudinal population-based study showed that mid-life hypercholesterolemia was associated with increased risk of late-life MCI and AD. 62 Another study showed that hypercholesterolemia correlates with the presence of A\u03b2 deposition in the diffuse type of senile plaques, among subjects 40 to 55 years old. 63 These epidemiological data are further supported by basic research studies suggesting that cholesterol may contribute to the development of AD pathology by altering APP processing. Simons et al showed in their in vitro studies that cholesterol level modulates the enzymatic processing of APP and A\u03b2 production. 64 Moreover, in APP transgenic mice, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia accelerated A\u03b2 pathology and decreased APP\u03b1, a product of the non-amyloidogenic pathway. 65 Cerebral A\u03b2 deposition occurred in APP transgenic mice on both atherogenic and normal diets, but only atherogenic diets impaired learning task performance. 66 Hypercholesterolemia also increased the level of C-terminal fragments, the substrates for the subsequent intramembranous cleavage by the \u03b3-secretase complex, resulting in an increase in A\u03b2 34, 38, 40, and 42 production. 65 Low cholesterol favors the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP by \u03b1-secretase and leads to decreased A\u03b2 generation, whereas high cholesterol favors \u03b2/\u03b3-secretase activity and thereby increases A\u03b2 production. 64 The cholesterol transporter ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter) has become a focus of research, as it may connect cholesterol, ApoE, and A\u03b2. Lack of ABCA1 causes extremely low brain ApoE which gets stuck in amyloid plaques, and these abnormal APOE particles promote amyloid deposition in APP transgenic mice. 67 Increasing ABCA1 activity may promote A\u03b2 clearance.\nStatins, therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, reduce serum cholesterol levels by inhibiting the rate limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Retrospective clinical studies have reported that the prevalence of diagnosed AD in patients taking statins was significantly lower than in those not taking statins. [68] [69] [70] Both simvastatin and lovastatin reduce intracellular and extracellular A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 levels in cultures of hippocampal neurons and of mixed cortical neurons, and high-dose simvastatin induces a strong reduction of cerebral A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain of guinea pigs. 71 Furthermore, statins probably have other effects that antagonize A\u03b2 neurotoxicity, A\u03b2-induced vasoconstriction, and inflammation, 72 working directly on the underlying pathology rather than through lipid-lowering effects. 73 The FINRISK study showed that lipid-lowering treatment was related to decrease in dementia risk. 74 A small randomized control trial (RCT) using atorvastatin 80mg/day for six months showed a significant positive effect on the ADAScog. 75 However, two recent larger multicenter RCTs, one with atorvastatin 80mg/day for 13 months 76 and the other with simvastatin for 18 months, 77 failed to show any benefit over placebo. A clinical trial of high-dose atorvastatin after transient ischemic attack or mild stroke found that it reduces stroke risk. 78 , Hence, it may be that cholesterol lowering medications may have a preventative benefit prior to clinical onset of AD through stroke prevention and possible vasoprotective and antiinflammatory effects. For a summary of cholesterol in AD, please see a review article by Shobab et al. 79 "}, {"section_title": "Hypertension", "text": "Hypertension is an established risk factor for stroke, coronary heart disease, and VaD. It is also evident that hypertension is associated with late-life cognitive impairment 80, 81 and increased amounts of senile plaques and NFTs. 82 In a Swedish study, increased blood pressure at the age of 70 increased the risk of dementia between the ages of 80 and 85. 83 A longitudinal prospective population-based study showed evidence of a relationship between hypertension and AD. In the Honolulu-Asia study, Japanese-American men with elevated mid-life blood pressure had a higher risk for AD at a follow-up period of 25 years. 84 A postmortem analysis of this Honolulu-Asia study showed that elevated systolic blood pressure (>160mmHg) in mid-life was associated with low brain weight at death and greater numbers of neuritic plaques in neocortex and hippocampus, while elevated diastolic blood pressure (>95mmHg) was associated with greater numbers of NFT in the hippocampus. 85 There is evidence that antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium channel antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), may have some protective effects against development of dementia. A calcium channel antagonist was shown in an uncontrolled hypertensive population to reduce the emergence of dementia. 86 Brain penetrating ACEI were found to reduce progression of cognitive decline in mild to moderate AD in one randomized control trial (RCT). 87 However, ACEI failed to show a significant outcome in the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) trial and in the Study on Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE). 88 In vitro, ACEI increased A\u03b240 and 42 secretion. 89 Together, the data regarding the effectiveness of ACEI on cognitive decline in AD are inconclusive. 90 One study shows that angiotensin AT1receptor blockers (ARBs) are associated with lower risk of admission to a nursing home and death, and reduction in the incidence and progression of AD and dementia compared with ACEI. 91 There is emerging evidence that ARBs may be more neuroprotective than ACEI because brain ACE also catabolizes cognition-enhancing brain peptides, amyloid peptides and converts toxic A\u03b242 into less toxic A\u03b240. 92 The ARBs increase AT2 and AT4 receptor agonists, angiotensin II and IV, respectively. AT2 receptor activation is important for both learning acquisition and recall of passive avoidance behavior, whereas AT1 is critical only for retrieval, by which the greater cognition-enhancing effects of ARBs can be explained. One of the ARBs, valsartan, has been shown to prevent the formation of high molecular weight oligomeric A\u03b2 peptides in vitro, and is the only antihypertensive drug that shows evidence of prevention in vivo of AD pathological processes at present. 93 Another study suggested that antihypertensive treatment, which was mainly based on use of beta-blockers, diuretics, or both, might reduce the risk of dementia. 85 Subjects with combined high systolic blood pressure and high total cholesterol level at midlife had a significantly increased risk for MCI and AD, 62 indicating that these are risk factors for both CVD and AD. 7, 8, 61 "}, {"section_title": "Diabetes mellitus", "text": "Most studies have shown a positive association between diabetes mellitus and AD. In a prospective population-based study, patients with diabetes mellitus had around a twofold increased risk of AD. 94, 95 In a retrospective cohort study, diabetes mellitus was the strongest risk factor associated with late-life dementia. 96 Patients with diabetes mellitus, especially those requiring insulin, had dementia more often than those without, 61, 97 and uncontrolled diabetes increased the risk of AD. 98 The precise mechanisms remain unclear; however, diabetes mellitus related micro-and macrovascular changes could cause hypoperfusion, accelerating A\u03b2 deposition, and possibly clinical AD.\nInsulin resistance syndrome, characterized by chronic hyperinsulinemia, is associated with age-related memory impairment and AD. 99 In normal human adults, insulin increases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 levels in an age-dependent manner. 100 Hyperinsulinemia results in down-regulation of insulin transport into the brain, thus causing decreased insulin in the brain. Patients with AD have lower CSF insulin levels and higher plasma insulin levels compared to healthy controls. 99 In vitro, insulin increases the release of intracellular A\u03b240 and 42 101 , and regulates the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme, a protease critical for the efficient clearance of A\u03b2. 99 Abnormally low brain insulin levels may result in increased intraneuronal accumulation of A\u03b2 and reduced A\u03b2 clearance.

[111] [112] [113] In those studies, the patients who developed dementia or AD had lower folate and vitamin B12 levels and higher homocysteine concentrations than the control subjects. 112 This risk factor can, in part, be modifiable by supplementation of folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6, 109 but so far no prospective studies have verified efficacy in stroke or dementia prevention.

Smoking has been well known to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the Rotterdam Study showed that smoking resulted in a more than twofold increased risk of AD. 61 However, some epidemiologic studies have reported a consistently inverse relationship between smoking and the incidence of AD. 115 One community based study shows that current smoking is associated with increased risk of incident AD but no increase for former smokers. 116 These results were supported by other studies showing that chronic exposure to nicotine may protect against A\u03b2 pathology: acute and chronic nicotine administration has improved cognitive performance of not only healthy humans but also of patients with AD. 117, 118 Possible protective effects of nicotine against A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain post mortem, in vitro and ex vivo have been reviewed elsewhere. 119 Presumably, smoking has two opposing effects on the brain: protective effects through nicotinic receptor stimulation, and pathologic effects on cerebral blood vessels. Also, the conflicting epidemiological results may represent a survival effect due to smokers dying prematurely, before they can express dementia.\nThere are a number of other vascular risk factors implicated in AD and Vascular cognitive impairment. Each factor is worthy of a full paper in itself, which is not possible in this overview. However, it is worthwhile to briefly summarize our current understanding of the associations and possible mechanisms for each of those factors.

An autopsy study showed that atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis and its corresponding leptomeningeal arteries was significantly more severe in AD patients compared to a non-demented elderly group. 123, 124 Honig et al also showed that the presence of large-vessel CVD or atherosclerosis is strongly associated with an increased frequency of neuritic plaques. Moreover, this association persisted regardless of the presence or absence of cerebral infarction. 125 In a large population study, severe atherosclerosis confirmed by ultrasound was associated with a high incidence of AD. 126 A probable pathophysiological consequence associated with extensive and increasing stenosis in the circle of Willis or other large cerebral blood vessels is hypoperfusion. A study in transgenic mice also showed that the lesion area affected by aortic atherosclerosis is positively correlated with cerebral A\u03b2 deposits. 66 Atherosclerotic cerebrovascular pathology itself might directly influence A\u03b2 deposition and the development of AD through a variety of mechanisms, i.e., subclinical ischemia, distal atheromicroembolization, increased parenchymal oxidative stress, and blood pressure dysregulation, which might affect the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through which A\u03b2 may be transported from blood into brain tissue and vice versa. 56 Cardiovascular diseases are a risk factor in the same way as result of atherosclerosis, and cardiac disease itself might result in CVD such as cardioembolism caused by atrial fibrillation. There is even recent evidence for impaired transmitral flow efficiency in diastolic filling on echocardiography in AD patients. 127 Finally, a recent novel mechanism has been suggested by a study showing that tortuosity of the carotid artery termination, which anatomically abuts the substantia innominata where the cholinergic neurons are located, is increased in AD and is associated with a smaller volume of the substantia inominata and poor executive function. 128"}, {"section_title": "Cerebral ischemia, hypoperfusion", "text": "As a result of atherosclerosis and/or arteriosclerosis, cerebral ischemia or hypoperfusion occurs in patients who have vascular risk factors. Indeed, Snowdon et al. revealed that atherosclerosis of the circle of Willis was strongly associated with lacunar infarction, and those with the infarctions had poor cognitive function and a higher prevalence of dementia. 12 Autopsy series have shown that 60-90% of AD cases exhibit various types of so-called silent cerebrovascular pathology including CAA, microvascular degeneration, and periventricular white matter (WM) lesions. Furthermore, a third of AD subjects show evidence of cerebral infarction at autopsy. 9 The Nun study showed strong evidence that dementia is worse when both neuropathological features of AD and VaD coexist. White matter hyperintensities, which are thought to represent cerebral smallvessel disease revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are detected more frequently and occupy more WM volume in AD patients than in normal controls. 129 The dilation of periarterial spaces in the white matter in AD is greater in frequency and severity than in controls, and correlates with A\u03b2 load in the cortex and with the severity of CAA. 130 Even in demented subjects who did not fully meet the neuropathologic criteria for AD, the severity of cognitive impairment or dementia is strongly correlated with the severity of brain infarction, and less AD pathology was needed with coexisting infarction to cause clinical dementia. 12 Imaging-autopsy correlation studies suggest that periventricular WM disease may in fact be due to venous collagenosis exacerbating chronic periventricular hypoperfusion, and blood-brain barrier leakage, resulting in a chronic venous insufficiency syndrome, 131, 132 The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study showed that the frequency of dementia increased with neuritic plaque density, and increased further in case of the presence of cerebrovascular lesions. 11 Similarly, Esiri et al. showed that AD patients with additional CVD suffer significant reductions in cognitive examination scores, which can be seen even in patients with very mild pathological changes and normal or marginally reduced cognitive examination scores. 10, 133 CAA in AD patients also showed a significant correlation with dementia severity. 134 These studies suggest that strokes or cerebrovascular events worsen cognitive impairment and functional outcome in patients diagnosed with AD.\nExperimental animal studies have indicated that brain ischemia or hypoperfusion appear to increase presence of A\u03b21-40 and 1-42, and APP expression. 13 Microglial activation, inflammation, and vulnerability to subsequent brain ischemia are also enhanced in transgenic mice. 66, 135 In a rodent model of stroke, intraventricular A\u03b2 (25\u221235) injections interfere with infarct healing with expanding size instead of shrinkage. 136 This would have strong implications for stroke recovery in AD patients. To better explore the relationship between pure brain ischemia and A\u03b2 appearance, some studies have been done using non-transgenic rats to avoid the genetic effect on A\u03b2 genesis. APP and A\u03b2 appeared in the lesion as a result of induced ischemia, but disappeared during long-term observation. 14 Moreover, even if the brain was saturated with A\u03b21-42 by injection after brain ischemia, it resulted in widespread diffuse amyloid plaques in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and neuronal, glial, ependymal, endothelial and pericyte cell bodies were observed to be filled with A\u03b21-42 at the acute phase; however, no deposition of A\u03b2 was observed after one year. 137 Taken together, although brain ischemia does not result in permanent A\u03b2 deposits, it induces A\u03b2 production, which might have toxic effects on synapses in the hippocampus and elsewhere, causing memory loss and other cognitive problems."}, {"section_title": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), Inflammation, and Gliosis", "text": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) or superoxide is well known to be generated in the normal aging process, and as a consequence of ischemia. Reactive oxygen species gradually accumulate in the aging brain, damaging cell components, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. 138 If ischemia/reperfusion occurs, massive ROS and superoxide are generated, causing considerable damage in the brain. 139 The amount of oxidized DNA base pairs was higher in leukocytes of patients with AD or MCI. 140 NADPH oxidase, which causes ROS production in cerebral vessels, could be a mediator of the cerebrovascular dysregulation induced by aging, hypertension, and AD. 42 Animal studies have shown that decreased Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), an enzyme that reduces the amount of potentially harmful free radicals, resulted in increased vascular damage after cerebral ischemia. 139 In contrast, no endothelial dysfunction was found if SOD1 was overexpressed in APP transgenic mice. 141 Hence, SOD1 might have a protective key role, not only against ischemic insults, but also against the toxic endothelial effects of APP. Reactive oxygen species appear to be very harmful in the aging and AD brain, and are currently targets for intervention.\nChronic inflammatory features such as activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, and other markers of inflammatory processes, including complement factors and cytokines, and acute-phase proteins, such as alpha-1 antichymotrypsin frequently colocalize with A\u03b2 or \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) in cerebral ischemia and AD. 135, 136, [142] [143] [144] Beta-APP and A\u03b2 are enhanced in reactive astrocytes, which appear in a similar distribution to AD pathologically, as seen in the hippocampus or CA1 and CA4 regions. 14, 142 Besides, A\u03b2 itself enhances pathological and inflammatory responses, and A\u03b2 toxicity enhances gliosis. 136 Finally, both these basic research studies, and epidemiological studies have shown that anti-inflammatory drugs may slow the progression of AD, 135, 145 though no prospective trials have confirmed these findings. In contrast, some recent studies have shown that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have not been able to reduce the incidence of AAD or dementia, 146 and may have adverse effects, with increased incidence of dementia, AD, and neuritic plaques in a cohort of heavy NSAID users. 147, 148 According to the evidence described above, risk factors related to AD might result in A\u03b2 cleavage change or decrease in A\u03b2 clearance from the brain tissue, and cause A\u03b2 accumulation in the cells or the extracellular tissue in the brain. One study indicated that A\u03b2 is rapidly produced and cleared from the CNS in human. 149 Recently, a study suggested that A\u03b21-40 and 1-42 clearance from the brain is more important than A\u03b2 production in late onset AD cases. 32 Acceleration of A\u03b2 production and impaired clearance, induced not by gene mutation but by environmental factors surrounding brain cells, could contribute to the development of clinical AD."}, {"section_title": "Acetylcholine (Ach) in relAtion to AD", "text": "The cholinergic deficit in AD may not only involve cholinergic innervation of cortical neurons but also lead to a loss of cholinergic innervation of cortical blood vessels. 150 This vascular cholinergic deficit may cause cerebral hypoperfusion, which contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.

One PET study found an increased oxygen extraction fraction in the parietotemporal cortices in AD; however, the vascular transit time and vascular reactivity were well preserved in AD patients, whereas those indices showed marked worsening in VaD patients. 153 It is possible that vascular factors contribute in the pathogenesis of AD at the capillary level such that vascular changes and insufficiency may occur before alteration in energy metabolism. By combining glucose PET, and single photon emission computed tomography imaging or arterial spin labelling MR, it may be possible to investigate these issues and detect CBF and brain glucose metabolism in the same patient to better understand the pathophysiological brain changes in preclinical stages of AD.

Generally, the A\u03b2 molecule is a peptide of 39 to 43 amino acids in vivo, although A\u03b2 polypeptides have been prepared for experimental studies in vitro 154 , and rarely larger sizes in vivo. 155 Both A\u03b21-40 and 1-42 are the main components of A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain with A\u03b21-42 being deposited in senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and A\u03b21-40 being deposited in the perivascular spaces around cerebral arteries, causing CAA.\nA\u03b2 is derived from the transmembrane protein APP. 156 There are two APP cleavage pathways: the non-amyloidogenic pathway and the amyloidogenic pathway ( Figure 2 ). In the nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by \u03b1-secretase into shorter fragments that do not contain A\u03b2, or tend to polymerase and therefore this pathway does not result in amyloid deposition in the brain. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by \u03b2secretase (\u03b2-amyloid cleaving enzyme -BACE), followed by \u03b3secretase cleavage. The BACE cleavage liberates \u03b2-APP that contains the A\u03b2 peptides fragment, and \u03b3-secretase cleavage liberates the A\u03b2 1-40 and 1-42 polypeptides (amyloidgenic) from \u03b2-APP. The A\u03b2 peptides are toxic in oligomeric forms and have a tendency to form fibrils and to aggregate in the brain, eventually depositing as plaques or CAA. The gene responsible for APP is located on chromosome 21. Trisomy of chromosome 21 causes Down's syndrome, a condition in which AD pathology is very common, with A\u03b2 deposition seen in the brain, often by age 40, in a similar manner to late onset sporadic AD. One postmortem study suggests that the A\u03b2 deposition begins over a decade prior to the clinical symptoms of dementia in Down's syndrome. 157 Approximately 2% of the AD patients possess an autosomal dominant genetic background, known as early-onset familiar AD, as the onset is in the third to fourth decades. They have mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), or APP genes with an extremely high penetrance rate. PS1 is an essential cofactor for \u03b3-secretase activity 158 and PS2 is the homologue of PS1. Therefore, these subgroups, including Down's syndrome, have a strong genetic inclination toward the increased production of A\u03b21\u221242, which appears to accelerate the pathogenic process of AD. The other group, which is much more prevalent in older adults, is known as late-onset sporadic AD. This group has no known A\u03b2-related genes directly related to A\u03b2 production, but rather appears for various reasons, including the presence of the ApoE-\u03b54, to have difficulty with amyloid clearance. 150 (Table) The A\u03b2 conformation is classified into two subgroups: amorphous and fibrillar A\u03b2. Amorphous A\u03b2 constitutes diffuse plaques, whereas fibrillar A\u03b2, which is a main component of neuritic plaques, is associated with neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 are the other conformational classification. Soluble A\u03b2 includes amorphous A\u03b2 (preamyloid) and insoluble A\u03b2 consists of fibrillar A\u03b2. In vivo, soluble A\u03b2 exists in blood plasma, CSF, and the intracellular and extracellular spaces, and insoluble A\u03b2 mainly exists in the extracellular space in the brain."}, {"section_title": "b) A\u03b2 structure", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Classification of A\u03b2", "text": "Soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 levels are both increased in the AD brain, but correlations between soluble A\u03b2 levels and the degree of synaptic loss and cognitive impairment are stronger. 19, 159 However, there appears to be little correlation between the numbers of amyloid plaques and the degree of cognitive impairment. 160 These findings suggest that soluble A\u03b2 may initiate neurodegeneration and that A\u03b2 plaques may not be the primary pathophysiology, but rather a reaction to or a result of A\u03b2 accumulation, perhaps even as an epiphenomenon.\nBasic studies showed that there are several different sizes of A\u03b2 assemblies (Table) . The basic peptide for all assemblies is the monomeric A\u03b2. Low molecular weight A\u03b2 (LMW A\u03b2) is the minimum unit of A\u03b2 assembly. Other molecules are formed by aggregation, called oligomeric A\u03b2, ADDLs (A\u03b2-derived diffuse ligands), protofibrils, and fibrils. 19, [161] [162] [163] These assemblies maintain equilibrium between monomers and protofibrils, but the final progress from protofibrils to fibrils appears to be an irreversible phenomenon. 163, 164 A\u03b2 assemblies have the propensity to enlarge their size, especially once protofibrils have appeared, even when they are in equilibrium. 17 Therefore, if There are two APP cleavage pathways: the non-amyloidogenic pathway and the amyloidogenic pathway. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by \u03b1-secretase into shorter fragments, that do not contain A\u03b2 or tend to polymerize, and therefore this pathway does not result in amyloid deposition in the brain. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by \u03b2-secretase, which is also called \u03b2-amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE), followed by \u03b3-secretase cleavage. The BACE cleavage liberates \u03b2-APP that contains the A\u03b2 peptides fragment, and \u03b3-secretase cleavage liberates the A\u03b2 1-40 and 1-42 polypeptide (amyloidogenic) from \u03b2-APP.\nenvironmental conditions, such as pH, A\u03b2 and electrolyte concentrations, temperature, and incubation time are appropriate, the A\u03b2 aggregates become larger and more difficult to dissolve. 154 Amorphous A\u03b2 appears at lower peptide concentrations and fibrillary A\u03b2 at higher concentrations 165 , and there is a time-dependent relationship, i.e. longer times result in larger sizes. 164"}, {"section_title": "Alpha-helix, \u03b2-sheet, and \u03b2-turn structures", "text": "Conformations of monomers and dimers are mainly dominated by \u03b1-helices. These switch to \u03b2-sheet structures for oligomers. 154 Teplow suggested that ADDLs are the smallest form of protofibrils and would be expected to display some \u03b2sheet structures but not large amounts. 163 Protofibril formation involves substantial conformational rearrangement, during which unstructured, \u03b1-helix, and \u03b2-strand elements transform into predominately \u03b2-sheet/\u03b2-turn structures. 163 Finally, protofibrils conform to \u03b2-sheet structures in large amounts, and form A\u03b2 fibrils, which are also composed of \u03b2-sheet structures. 154 Fibrils and larger protofibrils \u03b2-sheet structures correlate with A\u03b2 concentrations in vitro. 17 A\u03b2 fibrillogenesis is thought to be based on the \u03b2-sheet structure.\nSenile plaques are a form of A\u03b2 accumulation, and along with intercellular deposits hyperphosphorolated tau forming neurofibrillary tangles, are some of the earliest pathological changes appearing before neuronal loss occurs in both the aging and the AD brain. 16 Senile plaques have two histologically different forms, which are thought to impact on disease symptoms and progression, classified as diffuse plaques and neuritic (or dense core) plaques. 16 Diffuse plaques consist of amorphous A\u03b2, lack the \u03b2-sheet structure, and are not surrounded by dystrophic neurites. 165 Neuritic plaques consist of fibrillar A\u03b2. Diffuse plaques are seen in normal aging, whereas neuritic plaques are found mostly in patients with AD, but also in a small numbers in the normally aging brain. 166 Therefore, it is very important to understand the role of both diffuse and neuritic plaques in neurotoxicity, neuronal death, and clinical symptoms. Since A\u03b2 \u03b2-sheet content is related to insolubility and neurotoxicity, 18, 167 it has been thought that fibrillary A\u03b2 is extremely important in initiating AD pathology and for disease progression, making it an appropriate target for prevention and disease modification."}, {"section_title": "c) A\u03b2 toxicity", "text": "As indicated above, fibrillar A\u03b2, protofibrils, and oligomer A\u03b2 have the conformation of a \u03b2-sheet structure, which is specifically detected by Congo red or Thioflavin T staining. 167 A\u03b2 oligomers disrupt synaptic plasticity in vivo at concentrations found in human brain and CSF. 18 Neurotoxicity of A\u03b2 molecules appears to be possible not only with large aggregates, but also in LMW A\u03b2, although it is not seen in monomers. 18, 167, 168 Even though Congo red and Thioflavin T can detect oligomer A\u03b2 and larger sizes, these dyes do not detect LMW A\u03b2 assemblies (see Table) . 17 Taken together, the neurotoxicity of A\u03b2 aggregation, through fibril formation, appears to lead to synaptic loss and eventually to neuronal death, correlating with memory impairment and other cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.\nA\u03b21-42 is thought to be a more pathogenic toxic peptide than A\u03b21-40. Intermolecular parallel \u03b2-sheet structure and \u03b2-turn formation play a role in the aggregation and neurotoxcity of A\u03b21-42, and the N-and C-terminal residues form intramolecular \u03b2-sheet structures which stabilize each molecule. 169 In contrast, A\u03b21-40 does not form intramolecular \u03b2-sheet structures at the end of the A\u03b2 peptide residues. Therefore, A\u03b21-42 may have more propensity to accumulation and fibrillogenesis. Since A\u03b21-40 is less fibrillogenic, its solubility is greater than A\u03b21-42, and it normally drains from the brain along perivascular spaces more easily. 170 The ratio of A\u03b21-40 to A\u03b21-42 likely contributes to the variability of disease progression with less tendency to form plaques with a higher A\u03b240:42 ratio. For example, in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, which shows fewer parenchymal A\u03b2 deposits compared to AD, the A\u03b2 40:42 ratio is significantly higher than that in human AD postmortem brain tissue. 171 In APP transgenic mice, a study showed that an elevated ratio of A\u03b2 40:42 favors the formation of CAA versus parenchymal plaques, and this is altered by ApoE-\u03b54. 172 Therefore, the A\u03b2 40:42 ratio may play an important role in where A\u03b2 aggregation occurs."}, {"section_title": "cerebrAl AmyloiD AngiopAthy (cAA)", "text": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is another pathological finding commonly seen in the AD brain, and is considered an important cause of intracerebral hemorrhage as well as ischemic stroke especially in the older population who do not have any CVD risk factors. 54 Cerebral amyloid angiopathy involves deposition of fibrillar A\u03b21-40 (Table) in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels, and is neuropathologically detected by Congo red staining. The prevalence of CAA is between 10-40% in people who are 61-70 years old, whereas it is between 80 to 98 % in AD. 173 Regarding the pathogenic role of CAA in AD, it has been increasingly recognized that vascular pathology, such as lacunar infarcts and WM lesions, constitutes a risk factor for AD. 125, 129, 174 White matter hyperintensities have been described to have a similar posterior distribution as microbleeds, which predominantly appear in the occipital lobes, not only in CAA subjects but also in AD subjects. 174, 175 An association between microbleeds and WM lesions is supported by the same risk factor, hypertension. 176 An important feature of CAA is degeneration of cells of the vascular walls. Endothelial cells and pericytes are involved in maintaining the BBB. 177 Thus, degeneration of these cells may lead to a focal dysfunction of the BBB in AD. There is evidence that A\u03b2 accumulates in pericapillary and periarterial drainage pathways, 178 and is cleared from the interstitial fluid to vessels by passing through the BBB. 27, 56 A compromised BBB may be required for deposition of A\u03b2 both in the brain parenchyma and in blood vessel walls. A\u03b2 originating from plasma may play a role in A\u03b2 deposition in CAA when BBB integrity is compromised by other factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and stroke. 56 Soluble A\u03b2 within the brain may also have toxic effects on vascular endotherium adversely affecting BBB. 27, 179 In fact, increasing A\u03b2 levels may affect the BBB before pathological changes, such as CAA and A\u03b2 plaques appear. On the other hand, A\u03b2 produced by neurons may be the primary source of senile plaques, since neuronal A\u03b2 may not be transported by the interstitial fluid drainage towards the periphery along the perivascular spaces. 170, 180 High frequency of neuritic plaques and AD pathological criteria (CERAD, Braak, and NIA-Reagan-Institute) associated with increased CAA might be clinicopathological evidence of impaired A\u03b2 drainage in cerebellar vessels. 125, 181 Massive deposits of A\u03b2 in capillaries and precapillaries cause obliteration of the lumen, degeneration of endothelium, and basal lamina that lead to ischemia. 170 Eventual damage of blood vessel walls results in microhemorrhages, impairment of brain perfusion, and strokes.\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy is thought to be implicated in AD-related vascular dysfunction in another way. A study showed that the structural and functional disruption of smooth muscle cells in the walls of leptomeningial vessels was affected by A\u03b2 deposition in transgenic mouse without muscle cell loss. The disruption of smooth muscle cell organization interfered with the ability of the vessel to respond appropriately to both an endothelial-dependent vasodilator (acetylcholine [ACh]) and an endothelial-independent vasodilator (sodium nitroprusside). 182 These results suggest that disorganized smooth muscle cells may contribute to vascular dysfunction, lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, and eventually result in impaired brain function. To summarize: on the one hand the amyloid cascade is driven by ischemia, and small vessel disease impairs amyloid clearance thereby facilitating its deposition both as interstitial plaques and along vessels. In turn, amyloid is a vascular toxin, and when it also accumulates around arteriolar walls, it can cause both ischemia and hemorrhage. It is both response to vascular risk factors and itself a vascular risk factor, which can lead to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and also dementia."}, {"section_title": "A\u03b2 imAging In vIvO", "text": "The development of PET has allowed us to understand differences of CBF, glucose metabolism, and neurotransmitter function in the brain between normal subjects and AD patients.

(Figure 3 ). 24, 26, 185 Since the half-life of [ 11 C]-labeled ligands is short (20.4 min), [ 18 F]labeled ligands with a longer half-life (109.7 min) are being developed for clinical use in the majority of institutions that lack a cyclotron. 186 There are three radioligands, [ 18 F]AH110690 (flutemetamol), 187 [ 18 F]BAY94-9172 (florbetaben), 188 and [ 18 F]AV-45 (florbetapir), 189 which perform comparably to [ 11 C]PIB. 23 The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is now utilizing [ 18 F]AV-45 so that participating sites can have an access to A\u03b2 PET imaging without a cyclotron. (http://www.adni-info.org/Home.aspx) Florbetapir is furthest along in its development 189, 190 and recently achieved FDA labelling for clinical use in detecting cerebral amyloid depostion. 191 The development of these radiotracers was based on Thioflavin T, which detects A\u03b2 with a \u03b2-sheet structure. Hence these ligands also label fibrillar amyloid in plaques or vessels. This also means that it may be difficult to detect preclinical neuropathology of AD in its earliest phases as these radioligands cannot detect LMW A\u03b2 or soluble A\u03b2 species.\nHigh magnetic field strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect A\u03b2 deposition in transgenic mice, 192 but to our knowledge, only one report has claimed to show putative A\u03b2 plaques using 7 Tesla MRI in in vivo human brain, 193 in a small series ten AD subjects, ten age-matched normal controls, and ten young normal subjects. The putative plaques were seen in the parietal cortex in all cases of AD and in two out of ten agematched controls.\nPostmortem neuropathologic examinations have shown senile plaques and NFTs in the brains of subjects with very early AD, MCI, and even normal aging, and accumulation of A\u03b2 may begin in the brains of AD and Down's syndrome patients 10 to 40 years prior to the onset of clinical dementia symptoms. 157, 194 A\u03b2 deposition progresses by a stepwise involvement of connected anatomical subfields. 195 Thal and colleagues have found a hierarchical pattern of A\u03b2 deposition in the brains of AD subjects with and without dementia. 196 They found that A\u03b2 deposition begins in the whole neocortex (Phase 1) and expands into deeper brain tissues such as the allocortex (Phase 2), the diencephalic nuclei (Phase 3), the brainstem nuclei (Phase 4), and finally the cerebellum (Phase 5). This hierarchy was also found in the brains of APP or PS1 transgenic mice. 197 A\u03b2 deposits become apparent before clinical symptoms appear, and clinically proven AD is a late stage of this process. They also found that AD-related pathology cases (clinically not demented but pathology positive) show less expansion of A\u03b2-deposition than demented AD cases, but more than normal cases. This evidence shows that once patients progress to MCI or very mild dementia such as a Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.5, the pathological changes are already severe, and conversely that as their symptoms progress further, the AD pathology is already severe without much further progression. This underlines the importance of preclinical detection of AD pathology using A\u03b2 PET imaging. Indeed, A\u03b2 pathology has been detected using PET imaging in MCI subjects. 46, 198 However, MCI is still an equivocal heterogeneous group, and a PET study showed subjects with and without detectable A\u03b2 pathology. 198 Because more than one third of older persons with MCI developed AD during an average follow-up period of about five years 45 , noninvasive preclinical A\u03b2 imaging with the combination of MRI/computed tomography has the possibility to discriminate a MCI-AD progressive group from a MCI-AD non-progressive group. 199, 200 The cumulative evidence of follow-up studies in MCI (mostly amnestic) and AD subjects using [ 11 C]PIB, [ 18 F]AH110690, [ 18 F]BAY94-9172, and [ 18 F]AV-45 showed a cognitive decline in amyloid positive MCI subjects. 201 Villain et al has just reported that both PIB-positive and -negative subjects showed a significant increase in A\u03b2 deposition, with this increase being significantly higher in PIB-positive individuals. 202 Together, A\u03b2-positivity on PET appears to be a good predictor of progression from MCI to AD. A\u03b2 imaging also would make it possible to recognize preclinical phases of AD, and to determine the extent of A\u03b2 pathology distribution in demented patients. The most important role of in vivo A\u03b2 imaging will likely be in conjunction with the development of several new classes of antiamyloid therapies, which have entered the clinical trial stage (see the following section). It may improve the efficacy of A\u03b2 therapies by providing an important surrogate outcome, namely reduction of amyloid burden. 203 T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo (GRE) imaging or susceptibility-weighted imaging has been recently used to detect CAA-associated cerebral microbleeds. 174, 176, 204 Since there is no difference between A\u03b2 in plaques and in vessel walls in terms of \u03b2-sheet structure, the utility of topographical differences in A\u03b2 binding to discriminate between these two pathological entities has been studied.

Other approaches that have been tried unsuccessfully include NSAIDs and vascular risk reduction medications such as antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering agents (e.g., statins), vitamins (e.g., vitamin E and C), and hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and insulin. 204 Since some aspects of preclinical neuropathological initiation of AD are understood, researchers have been investigating specific treatments targeting key toxic misfolded proteins seen in AD at autopsy, namely A\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau, the main component of NFT. Because A\u03b2 increase is thought to constitute the earliest change in the preclinical AD brain, a huge effort is currently underway to alter A\u03b2 formation or clearance.\nA\u03b2 modification therapies are classified into therapeutics that target amyloid production, aggregation, and/or degradation. Some of them are now being tested in on-going clinical trials. 206 It has been suggested that AChEIs may stimulate the nonamyloidogenic \u03b1-secretase cleavage of APP. 119 BACE inhibitors include TAK-070 and BMS has one in development. Gammasecretase inhibitors include: LY450139, nonpeptidic isocoumarin compounds (JLK inhibitors) now discredit, STI571 (Gleevec), and NSAIDs. The \u03b3-secretase modulator Rflurbiprofen looked promising in a phase II trial, 207 but failed in phase III. 208 Amyloid aggregation targeting therapies by antifibrillization include the glycosaminoglycan mimetic NC-531 (Alzhemed) 209 , PBT-2, PPI-1019, and TTP-448. The Phase II Alzhemed trial showed reduction of CSF A\u03b242 and stabilization of cognitive function in mild AD. However, the phase III trial failed to show efficacy (http://www.bellushealth.com/en/newsroom/?rkey= 1506228356&view=96347-2&Start=0&htm=0).\nAn oral deaggregating agent by McLaurin and collegues is a cyclohexanehexol stereoisomer or scyllo-inositol, which blocks the accumulation of A\u03b2 oligomers, and reduces AD-like behavioral deficits, AD-like neuropathology, and mortality in a transgenic mouse model of AD. 210 Because this drug is able to alter A\u03b2 pathology even after the symptoms appear, it may be useful not only in preclinical AD subjects but also in AD patients. A phase II trial was performed for this drug in mild to moderate AD. No clinical significance was shown, but there were some promising trends for some clinical outcomes and CSF amyloid levels in exploratory analysis.\nImmunization is another A\u03b2 modification therapy option that has been studied in both transgenic mice and AD patients. Although immunization succeeded in modulating cognitive problems 211 and reduced A\u03b2 plaques in APP transgenic mice, 212 the studies using immunization with A\u03b242 (AN1792) in AD patients had to be terminated prematurely owing to brain hemorrhage 213 and/or meningoencephalitis. 214, 215 Pathological evidence of the post-immunization patients showed that, although there was no effect on the frequency and severity of CAA per se, hemorrhages could clearly be attributed to amyloidladen blood vessels, and bleeding only occurred in brain areas affected by CAA. 213 Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is therefore assumed to be a contraindication to A\u03b2 immunization and screening for this prior to immunization therapy might improve results. The AN1792 trial in AD patients revealed decreased brain plaque burden at autopsy. However, there was no evidence for improvement of survival or severity of dementia even though some treatment responders showed some improvement in memory testing. 216 A gantenerumab Phase II trial showed some efficacy in removing A\u03b2 from the brain parenchyma in a dose dependent manner.\nPassive immunization with a humanized recombinant A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of A\u03b2 (AAB-001 or Bapineuzumab) is also under investigation and has entered a phase III clinical trial (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/NCT00574132?term=Bapineuzumab&rank=1). There are also some other ongoing Phase II-III immunization trials underway (Refer to Clinicaltrials.gov). For further detail in the immunotherapy in AD and clinical trials, please see a Delrieu's review article 217 and Townsend's review article. 206 Also new consensus MRI guidelines have been developed to determine eligibility and for monitoring patients for clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies, and eventually for clinical use, should this approach reach approval for clinical use. Specifically, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery imaging (FLAIR) to detect vasogenic edema and T2*-weighted gradient echo (GRE) to detect microbleeds are required at baseline and for safety monitoring as described in Sperling et al, 2011. 218 conclusions Considerable progress has been made in AD-related research. However, it is, as yet, unclear what underlies the association between vascular risk factors and AD. We know that sporadic AD is a multifactorial disorder at old age, and vascular pathology contributes to or causes the dementia syndrome. The principal pathological mechanism responsible for A\u03b2 has not yet been identified; however, substantial evidence suggests that cardiovascular risk factors and CVD-related effects are involved. We hypothesize that sporadic AD is initiated by vascular factors in early life causing brain hypoperfusion and/or inflammation, which precede the A\u03b2 increase and aggregation, which may also cause brain hypoperfusion and A\u03b2 drainage dysfunction, and eventually cause the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, firstly, addressing life style, and controlling vascular, i.e. AD, risk factors, is very important for primary prevention. Secondly, since A\u03b2 already appears widespread in the brain preclinically, detecting A\u03b2 accumulation in vivo, by applying A\u03b2 PET imaging in the preclinical or early stages, combined with targeting A\u03b2 reducing therapy, may be more important for secondary prevention of AD to succeed. Further investigation is needed for assessing AD and its treatment, and in order for disease modifying therapy to become clinically available.\nVerhoeff's research has been supported by the Alzheimer Society of Canada, the Alzheimer Society of Saskatchewan, the Alzheimer's Association, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Scottish Rite Charitable Foundation of Canada."}, {"section_title": "references", "text": ""}]
