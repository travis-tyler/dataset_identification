[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective-Research demonstrates heterogeneous neuropsychological profiles among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, few studies have included visuoconstructional ability or used latent mixture modeling to statistically identify MCI subtypes. We therefore examined whether unique neuropsychological MCI profiles could be ascertained using latent profile analysis (LPA), and subsequently investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, genotype, and longitudinal clinical outcomes between the empirically-derived classes.\nMethods-806 participants diagnosed via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MCI criteria received a comprehensive neuropsychological battery assessing visuoconstructional ability, language, attention/executive function, and episodic memory. Test scores were adjusted for demographic characteristics using standardized regression coefficients based on \"robust\" normal control performance (n=260). Calculated z-scores were subsequently used in the LPA, and CSF-derived biomarkers, genotype, and longitudinal clinical outcome were evaluated between the LPA-derived MCI classes.\nResults-Statistical fit indices suggested a 3-class model was the optimal LPA solution. The 3class LPA consisted of a mixed impairment MCI class (n=106), an amnestic MCI class (n=455), and an LPA-derived normal class (n=245). Additionally, the amnestic and mixed classes were more likely to be APOE e4+ and have worse AD CSF biomarkers than LPA-derived normal subjects.\nConclusions-Our study supports significant heterogeneity in MCI neuropsychological profiles using LPA and extends prior work (Edmonds et al., 2015) by demonstrating a lower rate of progression in the approximately one-third of ADNI MCI individuals who may represent \"falsepositive\" diagnoses.

The criteria for MCI diagnosis used in many large-scale studies rely on subjective complaints, rating scales, and evidence of impaired performance on a single cognitive test. This approach to diagnosing MCI is epitomized in several clinical trials targeting MCI (Petersen & Morris, 2005) and in many large-scale studies like the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; Weiner et al., 2013) . However, recent research has challenged the empirical validity of this conventional diagnostic approach, as statistical clustering techniques used to characterize MCI subtypes have identified considerable neuropsychological heterogeneity (Clark et al., 2013; Delano-Wood et al., 2009; Edmonds et al., 2015; Libon et al., 2010) . For example, Edmonds et al. (2015) examined 825 MCI subjects from ADNI via cluster analysis. Results produced four unique cognitive phenotypes: an amnestic MCI group (34.9%), a dysnomic MCI group (18.5%), a dysexecutive MCI group (12.5%) and a large fourth cluster (34.2%) characterized by intact neuropsychological performance despite their MCI diagnosis. The \"cluster-derived normal\" group performed within normal limits on all neuropsychological cluster measures despite subjective complaints and impaired scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) Logical Memory-II Story A and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale that led to their ADNI MCI diagnosis. The notion that individuals in this group were assigned a diagnosis of MCI in error was further supported by normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker profiles and low rates of progression to AD and high rates of reversion to \"cognitively normal\" diagnoses Edmonds et al., 2015) . Geldmacher, 2003) , consequently representing an important component in any neuropsychological protocol. For example, Nielson, Cummings & Cotman (1996) demonstrated in autopsy-confirmed AD subjects a significant correlation between impaired visuoconstructional ability and hyperphosphorylated tau in occipital cortex. Moreover, visuoconstructional ability was not correlated with hyperphosphorylated tau in other brain regions, and language and memory functions were unrelated to hyperphosphorylated tau in occipital cortex. Prominent, differential visuospatial impairment is also a core diagnostic criterion of posterior cortical atrophy, a syndrome often attributable to AD pathology (Crutch et al., 2012; Crutch et al., 2013) , and represents a key neuropsychological feature of Lewy body dementia (Ferman et al., 2006; Hamilton et al., 2008; Johnson, Morris & Galvin, 2005; Kao, et al., 2009; McKeith et al., 1996) . Furthermore, individuals with non-amnestic MCI who progress to pathologically-confirmed Lewy body dementia have been shown to initially present with visuospatial/constructional as well as attentional impairments (Ferman et al., 2013; Molano et al., 2010) . Visuospatial dysfunction has also been reported in multidomain amnestic MCI (Mapstone, Steffenella & Duffy, 2003) . Importantly, a cluster analysis of amnestic and non-amnestic MCI subjects by Clark et al. (2013) revealed four unique subtypes, with three demonstrating visuoconstructional impairment: a single-domain visuoconstructional MCI subgroup (23.8%); an MCI subgroup with predominant executive and visuoconstructional dysfunction (16.3%); and a multi-domain MCI subgroup with mixed episodic memory, executive function, language and visuoconstructional impairment (17.5%). The fourth MCI subgroup was characterized by single-domain amnestic impairment only (42.5%), a consistent finding among all previous MCI neuropsychological classification studies (Delano-Wood et al., 2009; Edmonds et al., 2015; Libon et al., 2010) . However, results in the visuospatial domain lack replication due to the exclusion of any representative assessment, such as visuoconstruction, in the MCI classification literature. Thus, the contribution of visuoconstructional testing available in ADNI has potentially been overlooked by past studies identifying neuropsychological MCI subtypes Edmonds et al., 2015) .\nAnother limitation of Edmonds et al. (2015) involves the use of traditional cluster analysis to identify subgroups. Newer latent mixture models, such as latent profile analysis (LPA), offer several statistical advantages over traditional cluster analysis given its model-driven classification approach. For example, while cluster analysis assigns each individual to subgroups in binary fashion, LPA utilizes maximum likelihood estimation to generate posterior probabilities and model the classification uncertainty of each individual in each latent class Magidson & Vermunt, 2002; Muth\u00e9n, 2004) . These posterior probabilities are used to account for measurement error, consequently decreasing estimation bias and improving the accuracy of standard errors in analyses (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2015; Bray, Lanza, & Tan, 2015; Clark & Muth\u00e9n, 2009; Magidson & Vermunt, 2002) . LPA also produces information criterion and likelihood fit indices to guide determination of the number of optimal classes Muth\u00e9n, 2004) . This statistical comparison of nested models inherently increases objectivity and minimizes the arbitrary nature of subgroup selection in cluster analysis (Magidson & Vermunt, 2002) . Other benefits of LPA include the ability to handle missing data points in analyses (Roesch, Villodas, & Villodas, 2010) , accommodation of multiple data types such as categorical and continuous variables (Magidson & Vermunt, 2002) , incorporation of predictor variables and distal outcomes in the model (Magidson & Vermunt, 2002; Muth\u00e9n, 2004) , and model verification with independent samples (Shao, Liang, Yuan, & Bian, 2014) .\nTherefore, we employed LPA to investigate unique MCI subtypes within ADNI across four neurocognitive domains (visuoconstructional ability, language, attention/executive function, and episodic memory), and subsequently evaluate class differences on exploratory outcomes of CSF and genetic AD biomarkers, longitudinal outcome, and other ADNI measures. We hypothesized that the optimal LPA solution would generate five classes: four subgroups similar in size and neuropsychological profile to the Edmonds et al. (2015) study -including a class with normal neuropsychological performance-as well as the emergence of a small, fifth subtype predominantly characterized by visuoconstructional impairment. Additionally, we predicted that visuoconstructional deficits would be present in a class analogous to the dysexecutive MCI subgroup from Edmonds et al. (2015) , thus representing a subtype with \"mixed\" neuropsychological impairment. Among exploratory outcomes, we hypothesized that the classes would differ on AD biomarkers and longitudinal outcomes; classes with impairment across multiple domains would display increased levels of AD-positive markers and higher conversion rates than classes with mild, circumscribed deficits. Furthermore, the normal neuropsychological class was predicted to demonstrate lower rates of AD-positive biomarkers, lower longitudinal conversion to AD, and higher reversion to normal than all other classes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

However, performance on the MMSE pentagon test was only low average for the mixed MCI class. The amnestic MCI class demonstrated mild-to-moderate impairment on both measures of episodic memory and average to low average performance across all other cognitive domains. The LPA-derived normal class demonstrated average performance across all neuropsychological tests, despite their original MCI diagnosis. Neuropsychological performance of each class is presented in Figure 1 .\nOmnibus Wald tests suggested significant differences between classes on every neuropsychological variable (all p's<0.001). Post-hoc comparisons indicated the mixed MCI class performed significantly worse (all p's<0.001) than both the amnestic MCI and LPAderived normal classes on all measures of visuoconstructional ability, language, and attention/executive functioning. However, on AVLT Recall and Recognition the mixed MCI class was only significantly worse compared to the LPA-derived normal class (p< 0.001). The amnestic MCI class produced significantly lower scores than the LPA-derived normal class on all tests of episodic memory and language, as well as TMT, Part B (p< 0.001).

Additionally, past research by Jefferson et al. (2002) has shown differential performance in patients with cortical vs. subcortical neurodegenerative disorders using this 8-point scoring system. Errors include 1) size distortion, 2) number of figures, 3) improper pentagon intersection, 4) tremor/segmentation, 5) absence of five angles, 6) significant rotation, 7) interminable motor perseveration, and 8) pull-to-stimulus. For further information and operational definitions of the scoring system, please refer to Jefferson et al. (2002) .\nTwo raters were trained on the 8-point scoring system and established reliability on a randomly selected subset (n=54) of MMSE pentagons from the ADNI sample. After establishing satisfactory reliability (single measure intra-class correlation: 0.906, 95% CI: 0.838 -0.945; range of kappa values for individual error types: 0.673 -1.000) each rater was randomly assigned half of the remaining MMSE pentagons for recoding with the 8point error scoring system.\nThe MMSE pentagons could not be retrospectively obtained via archives for 17.7% of our MCI sample. According to ADNI representatives, data were missing due to technical problems with raw file upload rather than lack of administration or inability to complete the test. Missing values analysis indicated that MMSE pentagons were not missing completely at random (Little's MCAR test: \u03c7 2 (7)=22.156, p=0.002) when evaluated with the other 7 neuropsychological variables. However, original MMSE pentagon scores (0 or 1) were available in ADNI for all MCI participants. These original scores and the 8-point error scoring system were significantly correlated with a medium-large effect (r= -0 .387, p<0.001), supporting their use as a reasonable proxy to examine the missing data. The proportion of individuals with correct versus incorrect original scores did not differ (\u03c7 2 (1)=2.519, p=0.112) by presence (n=663; Correct: 87.6%, Incorrect: 12.4%) or absence (n=143; Correct: 92.3%, Incorrect: 7.7%) of raw files.

The ladder command in Stata version 12 was utilized to determine the benefit of transformations on the normality of neuropsychological variables in robust normal controls. All multivariate analyses were performed in MPlus version 7.3.\nLatent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted using SRB z-scores of the eight neuropsychological variables as indicators of class membership. Models with two to eight latent classes were evaluated and maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors was used in LPA model estimation. Unavailable MMSE pentagons (82% covariance coverage) were assumed missing at random (MAR) in the model. All LPA's were initially performed with the default number of random starts, which were subsequently increased twice (100, 25; and 500, 100) to ensure reproduction of global maxima and protect against misidentification of an erroneous local maxima (Hipp & Bauer, 2006 ). In the current study, all LPA results were unchanged after increasing random starts.\nDetermination of the best-fitting LPA is an iterative process, comparing a model with k latent classes to k-1 classes until obtaining an optimal solution. Multiple indicators of model fit are useful to determine the best number of latent classes; however, LPA lacks a gold standard and requires consideration of these indices in conjunction with model parsimony and meaningful theoretical interpretation Roesch et al., 2010) . The current study considered three comparative fit indices: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and sample-size adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (sBIC), with the smallest values indicating the best-fitting model. In addition, the Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test (VLMR-LRT) and the Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT) were used to compare the model with k latent classes to the k-1 class solution; statistical significance (p<0.05) suggests the k class model is a better fit than k-1 classes. Additional statistics used to identify suitable model fit include entropy, an aggregate index of posterior probabilities that reflects the overall precision with which subjects were correctly classified Roesch et al., 2010) ; a scree-plot of each model's log-likelihood, which can be a helpful exploratory diagnostic tool in optimal class determination (Nylund, Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2007) ; and the number of classes containing <5% of the overall sample size, an indicator of potential data over-extraction Roesch, et al., 2010) . Monte Carlo simulation studies using a variety of sample sizes suggest the sBIC, BLRT, and entropy are the most robust fit indices Nylund et al., 2007; Roesch et al., 2010; Tein, Coxe & Cham, 2013) . Finally, LPA solutions were evaluated for model parsimony, data over-extraction, and meaningful theoretical interpretation based on previous research.\nAfter selection of the optimal LPA, distal outcome variables were examined between latent classes within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. This method is preferential over subject assignment to most likely latent class membership and subsequent ANOVA comparisons; analyzing distal outcomes within SEM models classification uncertainty in statistical comparisons, generating accurate standard errors and reducing biased inferences (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2015; Bray et al, 2015) . In the current study the 3-step BCH method (Bakk & Vermunt, 2015; Bolck, Croon, & Hagenaars, 2004; Vermunt, 2010) was employed for continuous distal outcome variables, while the DCAT command was utilized with categorical distal outcome variables . The former uses a weighting procedure to account for classification error, while the latter treats distal outcomes as a form of covariate. Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n (2015) have demonstrated that these methods are the preferable approaches for continuous and categorical distal outcomes, respectively, due to their satisfactory estimation of standard error, resistance to class shifts, and minimal bias. MPlus performs parameter comparisons on all measures using the Wald chi-square test (Asparouhouv & Muth\u00e9n, 2007) and statistical significance was set at \u03b1=0.005 to control for Type-I errors."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Latent Profile Analysis", "text": "Two to eight latent class models were tested. Fit indices and descriptive characteristics for each model are provided in Table 2 and 3 AIC, BIC, and sBIC comparative fit indices successively decreased with increasing latent classes; the BLRT showed a similar pattern, with k classes always a statistically significant fit compared to k-1 classes. These indices failed to clearly converge on an optimal solution, as this trend would presumably continue past eight latent classes and likely result in data over-fitting based on other indicators (Nylund et al., 2007) .\nAn examination of the LPA log-likelihood scree plot revealed two elbow points, at the 3-and 6-class models. The VLMR-LRT suggested the 3-class solution as a significantly better fit than 2-classes. However, the 4-class solution (vs. 3-classes) did not result in statistically significant improvement in model fit via the VLMR-LRT. The VLMR-LRT remained nonsignificant for all subsequent class comparisons (e.g., 5-vs. 4-classes, etc.). Entropy was highest for the 4-class model, though satisfactory (Asparouhov & Muth\u00e9n, 2014; Tein et al., 2013) and relatively equivalent for the 3-and 6-class solutions. The smallest class size for the 3-class solution was 13.2% of all MCI participants; LPA models with 5 or greater classes contained at least one class that was <5% of the overall sample.

Significant omnibus differences (all p's<0.001) were noted between classes on all ADNI diagnostic measures (i.e., WMS-R LM-II, CDR Sum of Boxes, MMSE, and FAQ). The LPA-Derived normal class performed significantly better on all ADNI diagnostic measures than both the mixed and amnestic MCI class. The amnestic MCI class produced a significantly higher MMSE score and lower CDR Sum of Boxes tally than the mixed MCI class, though no differences between the two classes were noted on WMS-R LM-II or the FAQ.\nSignificant omnibus differences were also present for all genetic and CSF biomarkers (all p's<0.001) available on a subset of the overall sample. A significantly lower proportion of the LPA-derived normal class had the APOE e4 allele than both other classes (all p's<0.001); the mixed MCI and amnestic MCI classes did not differ.

Identical results were obtained upon examination of mean CSF biomarker concentrations, with the exception that post-hoc total tau levels were only a nonsignificant trend between the LPA-derived normal and the mixed MCI class (p=0.007). This trend is due to our use of \u03b1=0.005 significance level to adjust for multiple comparisons and increased variability of total tau in the mixed class, which produced a larger standard error than the other classes.

In contrast to past neuropsychological research in ADNI, tests of visuoconstructional ability were included to better capture aspects of visuospatial functioning in statistically-defined MCI subtypes. The optimal solution contained three classes: a mixed MCI, an amnestic MCI, and LPA-derived normal class. Contrary to our expectations, a unique MCI subtype characterized by predominant visuoconstructional deficits did not emerge in the 3-class LPA. Several reasons might explain the absence, including the neuropsychological measures chosen, psychometric properties of scoring systems, selected latent model, and MCI diagnostic criteria used by ADNI.\nVisuospatial assessments available in ADNI were unfortunately limited to visuoconstructional tasks, which are multi-factorial and require integration of visuoperceptual, organizational, and motor skills (Ahmed et al., 2016) . Thus, low scores on clock drawing and MMSE pentagons may reflect a combination of visuospatial and executive functioning difficulties rather than \"pure\" visuospatial impairment. Additionally, the psychometric properties of these visuoconstructional measures were non-normally distributed and did not benefit from transformations, likely contributing to our results. Posthoc examination of frequency distributions revealed that 86.5% of the robust normal controls and 80.1% of the total MCI sample produced two or fewer MMSE pentagon errors, suggesting the task or scoring system may not sensitively discriminate between normal and mildly impaired individuals.\nAnother possible factor contributing to our results is the initial ADNI diagnosis of MCI. ADNI inclusion criteria are heavily weighted towards verbal episodic memory to target preclinical AD, while previous research has demonstrated early, differential visuospatial/ constructional impairment most frequently in individuals with non-amnestic MCI (Clark et al., 2013; Ferman et al., 2013; Molano et al, 2010) . Thus, one might argue that ADNI's reliance on a single memory score to determine MCI potentially biases the prevalence of non-amnestic deficits in ADNI. However, visuoconstructional impairment is not captured by verbal memory assessment and, along with other non-amnestic domains, remains uncharacterized with ADNI's diagnostic criteria. In fact, past work Edmonds et al., 2015) has demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in ADNI neuropsychological profiles despite the vast majority of individuals receiving a conventional \"amnestic MCI\" diagnosis. Furthermore, recent research also indicates that the \"pure\" AD pathology targeted by ADNI is less common than multiple underlying neuropathologies (Schneider et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2013; Zlokovic, 2011) , providing further support for using comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to classify MCI across multiple cognitive domains.\nUnsurprisingly, results of the current study are similar to the cluster subgroups found by Edmonds et al. (2015) , who reported analogous amnestic MCI (34.9%), dysexecutive MCI (12.5%), and cluster-derived normal (34.2%) subtypes. Although our amnestic MCI class was much larger (56.5%), the LPA-derived normal class was comparable in size (30.4%). The mixed MCI class (13.2%) appears to correspond to the dysexecutive MCI group in Edmonds et al. (2015) , with analogous size and performance. However, Edmonds et al. (2015) also found a fourth dysnomic/amnestic MCI subtype. There are two possibilities explaining its absence in our study: 1) The statistical algorithms underlying LPA, which converged on a different solution, and 2) inclusion of visuoconstructional assessment, which revealed more robust impairment in a subset of dysnomic individuals. These subjects may have been reclassified as mixed MCI in our LPA and the remaining dysnomic subjects, lacking adequate differentiation in their scores, were folded into the amnestic class. Additionally, our 3-class solution was very consistent with another ADNI cluster analysis by Bondi et al. (2014) using conventional Petersen/Winblad MCI criteria. They also found three MCI subgroups (amnestic: 56.4%, dysexecutive/mixed: 12.3%, and \"false positive\" normal: 31.3%) of almost identical size and cognitive profile, along with similar genetic/CSF biomarker associations and longitudinal outcomes.\nOverall, the current research appears very consistent with previous findings and further underscores the problem using single test scores, cognitive screening measures, and subjective rating scales in MCI diagnosis. ADNI's MCI criteria led to \"false-positive\" diagnoses in approximately a third of the sample; this class performed within-normal limits on all neuropsychological measures, had a lower proportion of AD-positive CSF and genetic biomarkers, and better longitudinal outcomes compared to the other MCI classes, similar to past results Edmonds et al., 2015) . Although our amnestic and mixed MCI classes demonstrated unique neuropsychological profiles, the groups only differed in total MMSE score and rate of conversion to AD among all CSF/genetic biomarker, ADNI diagnostic, and longitudinal outcomes. These results raise the possibility that the amnestic and mixed MCI classes may represent stages of disease progression. A recent analysis of cortical atrophy patterns among Edmond et al's. (2015) cluster-defined MCI subtypes supports such speculation, as the authors demonstrated distinct but overlapping profiles of cortical thinning consistent with their neuropsychological performance (Edmonds et al., 2016) . Taken together, our results advocate for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in the clinical and research diagnosis of MCI, which has been shown to improve MCI classification, associations with AD biomarkers, and longitudinal outcomes . Additionally, the neuropsychological profiles derived from our LPA may provide useful prototypic models of performance for clinicians attempting to identify varying levels of disease burden and risk of progression to AD in non-demented individuals.\nDespite the majority of similarities, a few notable differences were present in this study compared to past work Edmonds et al., 2015) . Most importantly, the LPA-derived normal class yielded a rate of dementia progression (5.8%) that is almost half of Edmonds et al.'s (2015) finding (10.7%) as well as Bondi et al.'s (2014) results (9.3%). This significant result suggests our LPA methods further improved classification accuracy and are preferential to cluster analysis in future classification research. Another unique finding in our study was the disproportionate representation of the LPA-derived normal class by ADNI phase; fewer such individuals were enrolled during ADNI-1 than other classes, though significantly more were recruited in ADNI-GO. This shift likely reflects ADNI-GO's efforts to focus on \"early\" MCI . However, without the incorporation of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to inform diagnosis, ADNI may have unintentionally recruited cognitively normal individuals erroneously identified as \"early\" MCI. Such misclassification has considerable implications for MCI research, where inaccurate diagnosis will increase the likelihood of Type-II errors, attenuate effects sizes, and reduce the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions.\nStrengths of the current study include its large sample size, neuropsychological representation of four major cognitive domains including visuoconstructional assessment, availability of longitudinal clinical follow-up, CSF AD-biomarkers, APOE e4 genotyping, and the use of a robust normal control group to standardize performance. Additionally, LPA is a novel statistical technique in the MCI classification literature; previous studies have employed traditional cluster analysis (Clark et al., 2013; Delano-Wood et al., 2009; Edmonds et al. 2015; Libon et al., 2010) , although it has been used in neuropsychological studies of dementia (Libon et al., 2014) , elderly normal (Hayden et al., 2014) , and subjective cognitive complaint populations (K\u00f6hler et al., 2013) . Limitations of our study include the lack of a diverse set of visuospatial measures in ADNI (i.e., no available tests of visuoperceptual relationships, block construction, etc.), the multi-factorial nature of visuoconstructional assessment, the non-normative distributions of some neuropsychological tests and the use of transformations on select variables to normalize distributions in the robust normal control group, and lack of clear convergence among LPA fit indices on a bestfitting model. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies are unable to properly answer questions regarding the longitudinal patterns of cognitive decline in MCI subtypes. Future research should utilize longitudinal multivariate methods such as latent transition analysis (Collins & Eppig et al. Page 13 J Int Neuropsychol Soc.
