[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) can present heterogeneously, with several subtypes recognized, including dysexecutive AD. One way to identify people with dysexecutive AD is to consider the difference between memory and executive functioning, which we refer to as the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum. We aimed to determine if this spectrum was heritable. We used neuropsychological and genetic data from people with mild LOAD (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 or 1.0) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We cocalibrated the neuropsychological data to obtain executive functioning and memory scores and used their difference as a continuous phenotype to calculate its heritability overall and by chromosome. Narrow-sense heritability of the difference between memory and executive functioning scores was 0.68 (standard error 0.12). Single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, and 18 explained the largest fraction of phenotypic variance, with signals from each chromosome accounting for 5%-7%. The chromosomal pattern of heritability differed substantially from that of LOAD itself."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related dementia, and most cases of AD occur late in life, referred to as late-onset AD (LOAD). Although LOAD subtypes are well recognized clinically and in research criteria for LOAD (Dubois et al., 2014) , they are typically not considered in analyses aimed at elucidating the genetic architecture underlying LOAD (see, e.g., [Lambert et We used neuropsychological and genetic data from 2 large US-based consortia to evaluate the heritability of the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum among people with LOAD. We hypothesized that this spectrum would be heritable and furthermore that the pattern of heritability would be different from that of LOAD itself (Ridge et al., 2013 )."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "We used a well-validated psychometric approach to cocalibrate neuropsychological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI1) and National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) databases.

We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA; Yang et al., 2011) to calculate a lower bound for narrow-sense heritability, defined as the fraction of phenotypic variance explained by additive genetic effects. We estimated the heritability of this phenotype by chromosome and compared this chromosomal pattern of heritability with recently published chromosomal heritability estimates for LOAD (Ridge et al., 2013) . We also performed a genome-wide association study of the difference between executive functioning and memory among people with LOAD."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership.\nThe primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether imaging measures, biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and mild AD.\nNACC developed and maintains a large relational database of standardized clinical research data collected from the 29 National Institute on Aging -funded AD Centers and AD Research Centers. Each site enrolled participants and collected neuropsychological data using a single neuropsychological battery, the Uniform Data Set. Data are uploaded to NACC regularly. . Because we were interested in mild LOAD, we restricted our sample to people with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0.5 or 1.0 (Morris, 1993) . Participants were either prevalent cases (i.e., were given a LOAD diagnosis at their initial study visit) or incident cases (i.e., were given a LOAD diagnosis at a follow-up study visit). For prevalent cases, we analyzed data from the baseline visit. For incident cases, we analyzed data from the first visit at which a LOAD diagnosis was made. Years of education were ascertained by self-report. We excluded participants aged less than 60 years.\nADNI and NACC have similar neuropsychological batteries, which include several tests of executive functioning and memory. Table 1 shows the executive functioning and memory tests administered. There were not sufficient indicators of language or visuospatial functioning to derive robust measures of these cognitive domains. Table 1 Participant characteristics 2.3. Genotyping, quality control, population substructure, and imputation Before imputation, for quality control (QC), we excluded SNPs with minor allele frequency <0.01, call rate <95%, or not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 10 ). We excluded participants if reported sex differed from the sex designation established by X-chromosome analyses.\nWe addressed cryptic relatedness within and across studies using KING software (Manichaikul et al., 2010) after performing linkage disequilibrium pruning on post-QC-genotyped SNPs. Our final \"unrelated\" data set (n = 926) excluded third degree or closer relatives (kinship coefficient \u22650.0442).\nWe evaluated population substructure in the 2 cohorts together. We only included individuals of self-reported European ancestry, as there were too few with non-European ancestry to derive meaningful results. We removed outliers whose genetic profiles were inconsistent with European ancestry. We used EIGENSTRAT (Price et al., 2006) to derive principal components based on common genotyped SNPs across studies."}, {"section_title": "\u22126", "text": "We used IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009 ) to perform genome-wide imputation of allele dosages separately for each cohort using the December 2010 1000 Genomes European ancestry reference panel (build 37) (Abecasis et al., 2012) . We only included imputed SNP dosages with imputation quality \u22650.50 in both data sets. We combined the 2 data sets using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) and obtained a common set of 4,819,405 SNPs after a strict post-imputation QC that excluded SNPs with minor allele frequency <0.01 or call rate <98% on the combined data set."}, {"section_title": "Construction of the phenotype: the difference between executive functioning and memory scores among people with LOAD", "text": "Among ADNI participants, we previously developed composite memory (ADNI-Mem) and composite executive functioning (ADNI-EF) scores using modern psychometric approaches Gibbons et al., 2012) . ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF encompass performance on all of the ADNI executive functioning and memory neuropsychological tests in Table 1 Cocalibration refers to combining test scores across studies into a single metric. We cocalibrated ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF scores with NACC item level data to obtain composite executive functioning and memory scores from NACC participants on the same metric as ADNI participants based on methods we previously published (Crane et al., 2008) . Overlapping test items between NACC and ADNI shown in Table 1 served as anchor test items administered in both studies. We used structural equation modeling with Mplus software (Muthen and Muthen, 1998-2004) to parameterize relationships between anchor test items. We then calculated executive functioning and memory scores for all NACC participants using ADNI-EF and ADNI-Mem parameters. We subtracted memory scores from executive functioning scores to create a difference score. A positive difference score reflects more memory than executive impairment, whereas a negative score reflects more executive than memory impairment.\nFor descriptive purposes we defined 5 groups: those with executive functioning >1 standard deviation (SD) worse than memory, those with executive functioning 0.5-1 SD worse than memory, those with executive functioning and memory within 0.5 SD of each other, those with memory 0.5-1 SD worse than executive functioning, and those with memory> 1 SD worse than executive functioning."}, {"section_title": "Narrow-sense heritability calculations", "text": "Narrow-sense heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by additive genetic effects.

The largest proportion of people with LOAD had memory scores >1 SD worse than executive functioning scores (44% in ADNI and 40% in NACC).\nSizable proportions had executive functioning scores 0.5-1 SD below memory scores (7% in ADNI and 9% in NACC), and even more had executive functioning scores >1 SD below memory scores (11% in ADNI and 13% in NACC). In all, 18% of people with LOAD from ADNI and 22% of people with LOAD from NACC had executive functioning scores at least 0.5 SD worse than memory scores. Table 2 Distribution of differences between executive functioning and memory scores Some participants from NACC had autopsy data available, and some from ADNI had amyloid PET imaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid biomarker data available. We show data from those evaluations stratified by differences between executive functioning and memory scores in Supplementary Tables 1-4 . Although sample sizes for some of these investigations were small, with the data available to us, it appeared that people with executive functioning scores worse than memory had similar patterns of findings in these analyses compared with other people with LOAD (p-values: 0.1-0.7; see Supplementary Tables 1-4 ).\nThe narrow-sense heritability of the difference between executive functioning and memory was 0.68 (standard error = 0.12; p-value = 0.003) among people from NACC and ADNI with LOAD. SNPs on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, and 18 accounted for the largest proportion of the phenotypic variance, where combined signals from each of these chromosomes accounted for 5%-7% of the overall phenotypic variance ( In the same population, narrow-sense heritability for executive functioning itself was 0.10 (standard error = 0.22; p-value = 0.3), and narrowsense heritability for memory was 0.01 (standard error = 0.21; p-value = 0.5). The chromosomal pattern of heritability for the difference between executive functioning and memory was distinct from that for executive functioning itself and memory itself (See Supplementary   Table 5 and Fig. 1 ).\nBecause APOE genotype had previously been implicated in the variation in executive functioning and memory in AD ( After controlling for covariates, the APOE \u03b54 allele was associated with more impairment in memory ( ; p-value = 0.03) and a larger difference score ( ; p-value = 0.01) but was not significantly associated with executive functioning ( ; p-value = 0.21).\nIn GWAS analyses, no SNPs achieved genome-wide significance."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, of 926 people with mild LOAD, 193 (21%) had executive functioning scores at least 0.5 SD worse than their memory scores, suggesting some degree of executive prominence. The executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum, defined by the difference between executive functioning and memory scores, was highly heritable with a narrow-sense heritability of 0.68 (standard error 0.12, p-value = 0.003). The executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum were much more heritable than executive functioning or memory separately.\nThe chromosomal pattern of heritability of the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum was distinct from the previously published This study provides evidence that the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum among patients with LOAD is highly heritable. Our calculation of 0\u00b768 may reflect a lower bound for narrow-sense heritability because it does not consider additional genetic effects from rare . Furthermore, they suggest that differences between GCTA-based heritability estimates and twin study-based estimates may be useful to understand missing heritability.\nThe present report is the first to address heritability of the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum among people with LOAD;\nthere are no twin studies we are aware of. Future studies may address this, though such studies would need a large number of pairs of twins with LOAD and available neuropsychological data.\nThe study also demonstrates that genetic factors associated with LOAD risk appear to be different from genetic factors associated with the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum among people with LOAD. For instance, chromosome 11 variants explain the greatest amount of phenotypic variability for the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum but only explain a small amount of LOAD's phenotypic variability. Conversely, chromosome 19 variants, which include APOE genotypes, explain a substantial proportion of LOAD's variability but only a small proportion of the variability of the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum (Fig. 1 ).\nThis work confirms and extends previous findings relating to APOE genotype ( To date over 20 genetic loci have been identified to be associated with the risk of LOAD (Lambert et al., 2013) . The field has been characterized by coordinated efforts to search for variants associated with LOAD risk using ever-larger coalitions of research studies and more genetic variants. Less attention has been paid to genome-wide genetic analyses of LOAD subtypes.\nOur study has several weaknesses, mainly stemming from the modest sample size. Larger samples would reduce the standard error, providing a more precise estimate of narrow-sense heritability. Narrow-sense heritability estimates for chromosomes 3, 7, 14, and 21 failed to converge, likely because of sample size. Predictably, given our sample size, no single variant achieved genome wide significance in our genome wide association analyses. We were not able to compare findings from the NACC data to those from the ADNI data. Nevertheless, our analytic strategy is scalable. We plan to augment our sample by evaluating neuropsychological and genetic data from additional cohorts. Although ADNI focuses on early-stage LOAD and NACC includes people from across the LOAD-severity spectrum, we enhanced comparability by restricting study participants to those having a CDR of 0.5 or 1.0. Only a subset of participants in these studies had neuropathology or fluid biomarker data. Once larger samples are available, it will be important to repeat these analyses among people with biomarker confirmation of AD pathology. Because of the cognitive data collected by these studies, we are not able to firmly conclude that our findings are related specifically to executive functioning and not other domains such as language or visuospatial ability. Nevertheless, our findings strongly support the notion that there is considerable cognitive domain heterogeneity among people with LOAD and that this heterogeneity has a strong genetic component that is distinct from the genetic architecture of LOAD itself. ADNI and NACC are large convenience-based samples. It will be important to compare findings across other study designs to determine the extent to which idiosyncrasies in enrollment criteria and research focus may have an influence on findings.\nAlthough evaluation of the genetic architecture of disease subtypes has been applied in several conditions, especially congenital heart disease (Cordell et al., 2013) , its use in neurogenetics is rare (Girard and Rouleau, 2014) . A recent article on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) used a similar strategy to evaluate genetic architecture of FTD subtypes (Ferrari et al., 2014) . That study identified the C9orf72 locus with genomewide significant findings in people with overlapping motor neuron disease but not in other FTD subtypes and not in the combined group of everyone with FTD. These findings, together with those presented here, suggest that the disease subtype approach may be a valuable strategy to further our understanding of the genetic architecture of other neurodegenerative conditions (Ferrari et al., 2014) , including LOAD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "About one-fifth of the people from 2 prominent studies of LOAD have executive functioning scores substantially lower than the memory scores. Genetic variation explains at least 2/3s of the variance of this executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum among people with LOAD. The pattern of phenotypic variability explained by SNPs on each chromosome differed substantially from that of previously published findings for LOAD. Our results suggest that different genes-and thus different biology-may be responsible for executive prominence among people with LOAD. Future studies should specifically address heterogeneity among people with LOAD."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material Supplemental materials", "text": "Click here to view. "}]
