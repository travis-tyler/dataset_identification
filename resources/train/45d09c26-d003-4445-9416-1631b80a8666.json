INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recent research has revealed surprising properties in the fluctuations in the size of entities such as breeding bird populations along given migration routes [1] , U.S. firm size [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , money invested in mutual funds [8] , GDP [9] [10] [11] , scientific output of universities [12] , and many other phenomena [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . This is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 . The first unusual property is in the logarithmic annual growth rates g t , defined as g t = log(N t+1 /N t ), where N t is the size in year t. As seen in the top panel of Figure 1 , all of the data sets show a similar double exponential scaling in the body of the distribution, indicating heavy tails.\nThe second surprising feature is the power law scaling of the standard deviation \u03c3 with size, as illustrated in Figure 2 . In each case the standard deviation scales as \u03c3 \u223c N \u2212\u03b2 with\nThese results are viewed as interesting because they suggest a non-trivial collective phenomena with universal properties. If the individual elements fluctuate independently, then\n(with a caveat we will state shortly) the standard deviation of the growth rates scales as a function of size with an exponent \u03b2 = 1/2, whereas if the individual elements of the population move in tandem the standard deviation scales with \u03b2 = 0, i.e. it is independent of size.\nThe fact that we instead observe a power law with an intermediate exponent 0 < \u03b2 < 1/2\nsuggests that the individual elements neither change independently nor in tandem. Instead it suggests some form of nontrivial long-range coupling. Why should phenomena as diverse as breeding bird populations and firm size show such similar behavior? There is a substantial body of previous work attempting to explain individual pheomena, such as firm size or GDP [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . However none of these theories has the generality to explain how this behavior could occur so widely.\nThe caveat in the above reasoning is the assumption that the fluctuations of the individual elements are well-behaved, in the sense that they are not too heavy-tailed. As we show in a moment, if the growth fluctuations of the individual elements are sufficiently heavy-tailed then the fluctuations of the population are also heavy tailed, even if there are no collective dynamics. Under the simple additive replication model that we propose the fluctuations in size are Levy distributed in the large N limit. This predicts a scaling exponent 0 < \u03b2 < 1/2 and the shape parameter of the Levy distribution predicts the value of \u03b2. We show here that this model provides an excellent fit to the data. In the first part of this paper we develop the additive replication model and show that it gives a good fit to the data. Our analysis in the first part is predicated on the existence of a heavy-tailed replication distribution. In the second part of the paper we present one possible explanation for the heavy-tailed replication distribution in terms of stochastic influence dynamics on a scale-free contact network, and argue that such an explanation could apply to any of the diverse settings in which these scaling phenomena have occurred. This influence dynamics is an example of \"nontrivial\" collective dynamics. Thus, the process that generates the heavy tails in individual fluctuations may come from nontrivial collective dynamics even though the replication model does not depend on this."}, {"section_title": "II. THE ADDITIVE REPLICATION MODEL", "text": "We assume an additive replication process: At each time step each individual element is replaced by k new elements drawn at random from a replication distribution p(k), where 0 \u2264 k < \u221e.

By definition the number of elements N t+1 on the next time step is\nwhere k jt is the number of new elements replacing element j at time t. The growth G t is given by\nThe simplest version of our model assumes that draws from the replication distribution p(k) are independent; we later relax this assumption to allow for correlations.\nWhy might such a model be justified? First note that additivity of the elements is automatic, since by definition the size is the sum of the number of elements. The assumption In order to compare to the top panel, we plot the logarithmic growth g and compare to a Levy distribution (solid curve). This gives a better collapse of the data which works in the tails as well as the body.\nthat each element replicates itself in the next year amounts to a persistence assumption, i.e.\nthat the number of elements in one year is linearly related to the number in the previous year, with each element influencing the next year independently of the others. We also assume uniformity by letting all elements have the same replication distribution p(k). For the case of firms, for example, each sale in year t can be viewed as replicating itself in year t + 1. This is plausible if the typical customer remains faithful to the same firm, normally continuing to buy the product from the same company, but occasionally changing to buy more or less of the product. For migrating birds this is plausible if the number of birds taking a given route in a given year is related to the number taking it last year, either because of the survival probability of individual birds or flocks of birds, or because individual birds influence other birds to take a given migration route."}, {"section_title": "III. PREDICTIONS OF THE MODEL", "text": "Given that the size N t at time t is known and the drawings from p(k) are independent, the growth rate G t is a sum of N t I.I.D. random variables. Under the generalized central limit theorem [33, 34] , in the large N t limit the growth P G converges to a Levy skew alpha-stable distribution\n0 < \u03b1 \u2264 2 is the shape parameter, \u22121 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1 is the asymmetry parameter, \u00b5 is the shift parameter and c is a scale parameter.\nThe normal distribution is a special case corresponding to \u03b1 = 2. This occurs if the second moment of p(k) is finite. However, if the second moment diverges according to extreme value theory, under conditions that are usually satisfied, it is possible to write p(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 for large k 1 .

TESTING THE PREDICTIONS", "text": "To test the prediction that the data is Levy-distributed, in the central panel of Figure 1 we compare each of our three data sets to Levy distributions. The three data sets are (1) the number of birds of a given species observed along a given migration route, (2) the size of a firm as represented by its sales, and (3) the size of a U.S. mutual fund. The data shown in the middle panel of Figure 1 are exactly the same as in the upper panel, except that we plot the growth fluctuations G rather than their logarithmic counterpart g, we plot a cumulative distribution rather than a histogram, and we graph the data on double logarithmic scale.\nThe fits are all good.\nBecause we are lucky enough that the shape parameter \u03b1 and the asymmetry parameter \u03ba are similar in all three data sets, we can collapse them onto a single curve. This is done by transforming all the data sets to the same scale in G by dividing by an empirically computed scale factor equal to the 0.75 quantile minus the 0.25 quantile (we do it this way rather than dividing by the standard deviation because the standard deviation does not exist). It is important that this normalization is done in terms of G, in contrast to the standard method which normalizes the logarithmic growth g. The standard method, illustrated in the top panel, produces a collapse for the body of the distribution, but there is no collapse for the tails -mutual funds have very heavy tails while the breeding birds closely follow the exponential even for large values of g. In contrast, the collapse using G as suggested by our theory, illustrated in the bottom panel, works for both the body and the tails.\nTo test the prediction of the power law scaling of the standard deviation with size we estimated \u03b3 from the data shown in Figure 1 and \u03b2 from the data in Figure 2 . We then make a prediction\u03b2 for each data set using Eq. 4 and the estimated value of \u03b3 for each data set. The results given in Table 1 (This might be plausible for mosquitos but does not seem plausible for birds). One can also postulate mechanisms that involve collective behavior, as we do in the next section."}, {"section_title": "VI. THE CONTACT NETWORK EXPLANATION FOR HEAVY TAILS", "text": "In this section we present a plausible explanation for power law tails of p(k) in terms of random influence on a scale-free contact network. This example nicely illustrates how the heavy tails of the individual replication distribution p(k) can be caused by a collective phenomenon.\nAssume a contact network [35] where each node represents individuals. They are connected by an edge if they influence each other. For simplicity assume that influence is bi-directional and equal, i.e. that the edges are undirected and unweighted. Let individual i be connected to d i other individuals, where d i \u2208 {1, . . . M} is the degree of the node. The degree distribution D(d) is the probability that a randomly selected node has degree d.\nLet each individual belong to one of \u0393 groups. For example, belonging to group a \u2208 {1 . . . \u0393} can represent a consumer owning a product of firm a, an investor with money in mutual fund a, or a bird of a given species taking migration route a. The groups are the same as the populations discussed earlier, i.e. N a t is the size of group a at time t. The dynamics are epidemiological in the sense that an individual will stay in her group unless her contacts influence her to switch. The switching is stochastic: An individual in group a with a contact in group b will switch to group b with a rate \u03c1 ab . Furthermore, the switching rate is linearly proportional to the number of contacts in that group, i.e. if an individual belonging to group a has n contacts in group b, she will switch with a rate n\u03c1 ab . As an example, the individual in the center of the graph in Fig 3 has a degree d = 8 and belongs to group a. She will switch to group b with a rate 4\u03c1 ab , to group c with a rate 2\u03c1 ac and to group d with a rate \u03c1 ad .\nFor example consider firm sales. If a given consumer likes the product of a given firm, she might influence her friends to buy more, and if she doesn't like it, she might influence them to buy less. Thus each sale in a given year influences the sales in the following year.\nA similar explanation applies to mutual funds, under the assumption that each investor influences her friends, or it applies to birds, under the assumption that each bird influences other birds that it comes into contact with 3 .\nWe now show how the contact network gives rise to an additive replication model. To calculate N a t+1 consider each of the N a t individuals in group a one at a time. Individual j in group a replicates if she remains in the group, and/or if one or more of her contacts that belong to other groups join group a. She fails to replicate if she leaves the group and also fails to influence anyone else to join. Let the resulting number of individuals that replace individual j be k jt . This implies\nwhich is identical to Eq. 1 except for the group label (which was previously implicit).\nThe replication factor k jt is a random number with values in the range\nGiven the stochastic nature of the influence process we approximate 4 k jt as a Poisson random variable with mean\nwhere \u03b8 a is the probability that a randomly selected contact belongs to group a. This means that the replication factor k jt is proportional to the degree, i.e. k jt \u223c d j , and that the replication distribution is proportional to the degree distribution,\nThus the influence dynamics of the contact network are an additive replication process with the individual replication distribution proportional to the degree distribution of the network. If the network is scale free, i.e. if for large k the degree distribution is a power law with \u03b3 < 3, then the growth fluctuations will be Levy distributed. It is beyond the scope of this paper to explain why the contact groups in the various settings that have been studied might be scale free, but there is at this point a large literature demonstrating that such behavior is common [38, 39] .\nA numerical simulation verifies these results 5 . We simulated a network of 10 6 nodes with a power law tailed degree distribution D(d) \u223c d \u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3 = 2.2 and average degree d = 10.\n5 The average number of individuals and the average growth rate of a group can be approximated using a mean field approach. The mean field growth rates are given by [40] . and \u03b8 a = d\na is the fraction of individual elements with degree d that belong to group a. We know of no analytic method to compute the growth fluctuations.\nThe dynamics were simulated for 10 3 groups with a homogeneous switching rate \u03c1 ab = \u03c1. As expected the growth rates have a Levy distribution P (G) \u223c G \u2212\u03b3 as shown in Figure 4 "}, {"section_title": "VII. CORRELATIONS AND FINITE SIZE EFFECTS", "text": "So far we have assumed that the growth process for individual elements is uncorrelated,\ni.e. that the draws from p(k) are I.I.D. Sufficiently strong correlations can change the results substantially. There can be correlations among the individual elements or correlations in time. For example, suppose some groups are intrinsically more or less popular than others.\nFor example, the popularity of a city might depend on its economy and living conditions. This can be modeled by assuming that the replication of individual j in group i is given by a random variablek i jt which is the sum of a random variable that depends on the individual and one that is common for the group, i.e.k i jt = k jt + \u03b6 it . We can then write the replication model in the form\nAs shown in the supplementary materials, for small sizes the individual fluctuations k jt dominate, so that there is a power law scaling of \u03c3, but for larger sizes the group fluctuations \u03b6 it dominate, and \u03c3 becomes constant (i.e. \u03b2 = 0). This is indeed what we observe for cities 6 .\nWe have also assumed in our analysis that the number of elements is infinite, i.e. that there is no upper limit on the replication factors. For finite systems the growth of one group is at the expense of another. This can induce correlations which affect both the growth rate distribution and the fluctuation scaling. Nevertheless, as our simulation shows, under appropriate circumstances the theory can still describe finite systems to a very good approximation. A more detailed discussion is provided in the supplementary materials.\n6 Note that the nature of the scalings for cities is controversial and strongly depends on how a city is defined -our results are in agreement with those who claim the scaling is not very good [41] . Rather than using the census definitions, Rozenfeld et al [17] use a clustering algorithm for defining cities and then the fluctuation scaling (without the group correlations) seems to hold."}, {"section_title": "VIII. DISCUSSION", "text": "The explanation that we offer here is widely applicable and very robust. The idea that a larger entity can be decomposed into a sum of smaller elements, and that the smaller elements can be modeled as if they replicate, is quite generic. As discussed in the previous section this can be broken if the growth of the elements is too correlated. Our explanation for the heavy tailed growth rate distributions and fluctuation scaling requires that the replication distribution p(k) is heavy tailed. The key thing we have shown is that when this occurs, the generalized central limit theorem dictates that the growth distribution P G will be Levy, which in turn dictates the power law size dependence of the standard deviation, \u03c3(N).\nThe previous models which are closest to ours are the model of firm size of Wyart and\nBouchaud [29] and the model of GDP due to Gabaix [31] . Both of these models assume that the size distribution P (N t ) has power law tails and that firms grow via multiplicative fluctuations. They each suggested (without any testing) that additivity might lead to Levy distributions for their specific phenomena (GDP or firm size). This is in contrast to our model, which requires neither the assumption of power tails for size nor multiplicative growth. This is a critical point because the size of mutual funds does not obey a power law distribution [8] , which rules out both the the Wyart and Bouchaud and Gabaix models as general explanations. We are apparently the first to realize that these diverse phenomena all obey Levy distributions, and that this explains the power law scaling of \u03c3(N).\nThere are many possible explanations that could generate a heavy tailed replication distribution p(k). Here we proposed an influence process on a scale free contact network as a possible example. This mechanism is quite general and relies on the assumption that an individual element's actions are affected by those of its contacts. Scale free networks are surprisingly ubiquitous and the existence of social, information and biological networks with power law tails with 2 < \u03b3 < 3 is well documented [38, 39] , and suggests that the assumption that the degree distribution D(d) and hence the replication distribution p(k)\nare heavy-tailed is plausible.\nThe influence model shows that the question of whether the interesting scaling properties of these systems should be regarded as \"interesting collective dynamics\" can be subtle.\nOn one hand the additive replication model suppresses this -any possibility for collective action is swept into the individual replication process. On the other hand, the influence model shows that the heavy tails may nonetheless come from a collective interaction. More detailed data is needed to make this distinction.\nOur model shows that, whenever its assumptions are satisfied, one should expect universal behavior as dictated by the central limit theorem: The growth fluctuations should be Levy distributed (with the normal distribution as a special case). Our model does not suggest that the tail parameter should be universal, though of course this could be possible for other reasons. Based on our model there is no reason to expect that the value of the exponent \u03b1 (or equivalently \u03b3 or \u03b2) will not depend on factors that vary from example to example.\nThus the growth process is universal in one sense but not in another."}, {"section_title": "IX.
