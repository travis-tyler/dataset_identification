[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Reproducible identification of white matter tracts across subjects is essential for the study of structural connectivity of the human brain. The key challenges are anatomical differences between subjects and human rater subjectivity in labeling. Labeling white matter regions of interest presents many challenges due to the need to integrate both local and global information. Clearly communicating the human/manual processes to capture this information is cumbersome, yet essential to lay a solid foundation for comprehensive atlases. The state-of-the-art for white matter atlas is the single population-averaged Johns Hopkins Eve atlas. A critical bottleneck with the Eve atlas framework is that manual labeling time is extensive and peripheral white matter regions are conservatively labeled. In this work, we developed protocols that will facilitate manual virtual dissection of white matter pathways, with the goals to be anatomically accurate, intuitive, reproducible, and act as an initial stage to build an amenable knowledge base of neuroanatomical regions. We analyzed reproducibility of the fiber bundles and variability of human raters using DICE correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, and root mean squared error. The protocols at their initial stage have shown promising results on both typical 3T research acquisition Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and high-acquisition quality Human Connectome Project datasets. The TractEM manual labeling protocols allow for reconstruction of reproducible subjectspecific fiber bundles across the brain. The protocols and sample results have been made available in open source to improve generalizability and reliability in collaboration."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Human brain atlases have had a transformative role in the study of neuroscience. Evolving neuroimaging, image processing, and analysis techniques are framing the way that we understand brain anatomy. Modern brain atlases (Mazziotta et al., 2001; Hawrylycz et al., 2012; Amunts et al., 2013) combine population atlases with multi-modal structural and functional information. These atlases provide a detailed representation of the anatomy and are a fundamental component of the field of image analysis. Although most commonly used modern approaches tend to treat white matter as essentially homogeneous, most current atlases are incomplete without detailed white matter information. A whole-brain white matter (WM) atlas, for subject-specific population atlases, labeled with equivalent methodologies, tools and protocols is therefore a funda-mental resource for integrative and comprehensive modern brain atlases.\nThe effort to create atlases is not new. The importance of a white matter atlas arises from the information that can be inferred from them. White matter connectivity stores substantial information about functional neuroanatomy (Sporns et al., 2005; Skudlarski et al., 2008; van den Heuvel et al., 2008; Greicius et al., 2009 ), longitudinal changes (Resnick et al., 2003) , brain morphology (Lawes et al., 2008) , abnormalities and their cognitive correlation (Gunning-Dixon and Raz, 2000) , critical periods for neural development (Anderson et al., 2011) , recovery and plasticity (Jiang et al., 2006; Dayan and Cohen, 2011) , and cognitive functioning (Llin\u00e1s et al., 1998) . Nonetheless, existing white matter atlases are limited to population-averaged single atlases with extremely time consuming manual delineation , atlases lacking comprehensive coordinate information about white matter structures (960), atlases targeting selective tracts instead of the whole-brain (Wakana et al., 2004;  Figure 1: Pipeline overview: Pre-processing steps included susceptibility and eddy current corrections, and b0 signal normalization. A fractional anisotropy volume was created for every acquisition. After transferring each volume to Talairach space, 4th order spherical harmonic Q-ball imaging and generalized q-sampling are applied to BLSA and HCP datasets respectively to obtain orientation distribution functions, which are the inputs to DSI-Studio. The orientation distribution functions (ODFs) are used to create subject-specific 2D seed/ROI/ROA regions for each tract. Then region-based deterministic tractography is employed on the orientation maps. Each seed region was placed approximately in the middle of the bundle, all fibers entering the ROIs preserved and all passing through exclusion region (ROAs) masks are discarded. The results show two tractograms delineated by different raters. Oishi et al., 2008; Adluru et al., 2016; Besseling et al., 2012; Garyfallidis et al., 2018; Nath et al., 2018; Zhang and Arfanakis, 2018) or atlases created with automated methods that rely on manual delineations (Garyfallidis et al., 2018; Wasserthal et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2018) .\nWhile there is expert evaluated white matter atlases (Essayed et al., 2017; Yeh et al., 2018) , they lack protocols detailing how to delineate white matter structures. The current state-of-the-art white matter atlas is the population-based single-subject Johns Hopkins University (JHU) atlas labeled using the Eve protocol Oishi et al., 2008) , using both diffusion tensor data and a T1-structural image of the brain. The JHU Eve atlas is based on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent diffusion tractography. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging allows diffusion of water molecules to be visualized by sensitizing images in the direction of the field gradients. Diffusion tensor imaging uses this information to calculate anisotropy and therefore orientation information of the neural pathways. There are several limitations to the use of the Eve-based frameworks:\n(1) it is a population-averaged single atlas, (2) peripheral white matter regions are conservatively labeled and (3) averaging over many people causes blurring of small pathways. Additionally, (4) the atlas was generated using diffusion tensor imaging, which has been shown to have limitations in crossing fiber and complex regions (Oouchi et al., 2007) , whereas a number of more advanced techniques successfully can overcome these limitations (Tuch, 2004; Descoteaux et al., 2007; Yeh et al., 2010) .\nIn this work, we rectify the lack of manual labeling protocols that are robust to human subjectivity. This was achieved by creating protocols that are driven by strong anatomical prior. This strong prior is the state-of-theart Eve white matter atlas that is obtained in consensus with many experts with neuroanatomical knowledge. The TractEM project aimed to allow expert/non-expert users to create and curate reproducible pathways across the brain. We developed TractEM and implemented a pipeline that allows tracking for 35 fiber tracts resulting in total 61 unique pathways (including L/R) in less than 6 hours with a methodology that can be applied generally to a large number of subjects. The protocols are tested on multiple datasets and are assessed for reproducibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses human variability across minor and major pathways. This method will serve as a valuable tool for the neuroimaging community. Additionally, the TractEM project in its initial stage curated a dataset that includes real human acquisitions, along with careful manual selection and definitions of ground truth streamlines. Subject-specific TractEM tractography data from the Human Connectome Project dataset is open to public use. We provided not only white matter volumes (or labels), but also streamlines themselves, a feature not provided by other open sourced datasets (Wasserthal et al., 2018; . Thus, TractEM will show value in region identification, normalization, anatomical validation, and even development of machine learning based tracking strategies (Poulin et al., 2019) . This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the pipeline and methodology for the construction of tracts. Section 3 presents the results of intra-subject interrater tract reproducibility, tract variability, and rater reproducibility.

Regions are defined as a set of voxels stored by their coordinates. There are different types of regions to inform fiber tracking. Multiple regions in combination can be used to control tracking when identifying fine grained details or complicated white matter structures. For example, if the tract is large, multiple regions of interest along with tract-specific exclusion regions can be used to delineate it. Regions can be manually drawn or created using a segmentation method. Example regions are shown in Figure 2 . These regions are prior for the pathways, and extracted from the Eve atlas parcellation maps Figure 3 .\nSeed -Seed regions serve as starting points for the algorithm. A user labels seeding voxels which then are converted to starting points by the tracking algorithm. These starting points are at the subvoxel resolution to accommodate the algorithm. For example, a seed voxel placed at (1, 1, 1) will have subvoxel seeding placed within (0.5 1.5, 0.5 1.5, 0.5 1.5). Within the voxel region (0.5 1.5, 0.5 1.5, 0.5 1.5), DSI-Studio draws a point within the voxel range using a uniform distribution.\nRegion of interest (ROI) -These regions lead the fibers to where anatomical landmarks are.

When necessary T1 weighted images are co-registered to b=0. Using DSI-Studio, six elements tensor construction was performed on the diffusion-weighted image set to produce FA images in the subject's native space. The FA map was registered to a Talairach template image (Talairach, 1988) using an affine transformation. The template image was generated by applying an affine transformation of Lancaster et al. (2007) to the probabilistic ICBM152space FA template image from the FSL atlas distribution (Mori et al., 2005; Wakana et al., 2007; Hua et al., 2008) . The affine transformation was applied to the diffusionweighted images, and the appropriate corresponding ad-justment was made to the b-vectors.\nFor orientation distribution function (ODF), two high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) models for voxel-wise reconstruction were selected, according to the image quality of each datasets. HARDI models are capable of characterizing multiple directions and resolving crossing fiber issues (Tuch, 1999; Tuch et al., 2002; Descoteaux et al., 2007) .\nIn this implementation, for the BLSA dataset, we fit 4th order spherical harmonic Q-ball. QBI uses a single shell (single b-value) to estimate the dODF to represent the fiber orientation distribution. DSI-Studio adopts the spherical harmonics based QBI reconstruction method by Descoteaux et al. (2007) . For multi shell HCP data, generalized Q-sampling (GQI) reconstruction was used. GQI in addition to being capable of resolving crossing fiber issues, can utilize multi-shell (multi-b-value) data and works best with fairly dense sampling of directions to similarly estimate the dODF (Yeh et al., 2010) .

Eve is an effective guide for region drawing with high inter-rater reproducibility (k > 0.85 and CoV < 3 % ). A clear guide to a priori knowledge of the anatomy was prioritized when defining the TractEM protocols. The Eve atlas defines 50 white matter bundle parcellations slice by slice. Region-based tractography is performed using these regions of interest as prior. Example Eve white matter parcellation maps (WMPM) are shown in Figure 3 . WMPM definitions are used to delineate tract-specific seed and ROI regions. A total of 61 unique pathways were selected such that most of the brain was accounted for: 53 of these pathways, 22 of which have bilateral pairs of homologous tracts (22x2=44), 5 commissural pathways, 3 of the brainstem tracts and the optic radiation were manually identified with Eve. In addition to the Eve-defined pathways, 8 subject-specific lobar regions were defined by a multi-atlas segmentation algorithm (Huo et al., 2016) .\nDuring the design and the development of the protocols, the high-acquisition (multi-shell) HCP dataset was used. Contrary to the Eve atlas, TractEM protocols do not divide anatomical fibers into multiple regions. Instead, anatomically consistent regions are merged into individual tracts. For the 53 Eve-defined pathways, seed regions were drawn roughly at the center of each tract. For bilateral tracts, seed regions were placed in both hemispheres. As white matter structural complexity increased, we increased the number of additional ROIs and ROAs in order to capture a tract as consistent as possible with its anatomical definition. In this manuscript, the complexity of the protocols is referred to as simple and complex tracts. If a protocol contains only a single seed region, e.g. genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), we refer it as a simple tract. If a protocol includes multiple seed/ROI regions in combination, this is referred as a complex tract, e.g. inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) (Please see Figure 4 ). We further divided the complex tract labels as 2-unique and 3+ unique labels. For the lobar regions, multi-atlas segmented subject-specific 3D lobar masks were used as seed regions and 3x-dilated lobar masks were used as end regions. ROA regions were guided in the protocols in order to isolate the tract or region of interest to fit into its anatomical definition for both the pathways and the lobes."}, {"section_title": "Application", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Tracking Parameters", "text": "Tracking parameters were chosen carefully to reduce the number of false positive fibers and to ensure that the tracking does not suffer from premature termination.

The QA threshold is the suggested minimum as lower values may produce false fibers (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org). Angular and QA thresholds are the determining parameters of how the fibers are tracked from the region of interest. Angular threshold is set to zero, therefore stopping criteria is not determined by this parameter; instead the length constraint or end regions serve as an end condition.

Qualitative and quantitative identification of the estimated fiber pathways are crucial for the veracity of connectivity studies that rely on manual or automated approaches. Reproducible tractography can provide a backbone to the group-wise analyses and longitudinal testing studies for which a comprehensive modern atlas is essential. Despite the importance, there are a limited number of reproducibility studies with limited number of fiber pathways (Heiervang et al., 2006; Wakana et al., 2007; Besseling et al., 2012) .\nWith the TractEM project, we tested 61 unique tracts using 35 protocols. The most reproducible fiber bundles were the lobar tracts, followed by corpus callosum (CC), cingulum, cerebral peduncle (CP), middle cerebral peduncle (MCP), corticospinal tract (CST), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO), and uncinate fasciculus (UNC) on both datasets. In contrast, FX, fornix stria-terminalis (FXST), superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) exhibited low reproducibility. Tracking sometimes resulted in less than 100K streamlines (tract count). FXST takes a particularly long time, results in lower tract count. Anecdotally, reproducibility could be increased if more time allowed. The low reproducibility tracts generally fitted in our complex tract description (please refer to Section 2.4). It can be inferred that as the complexity of manual protocols increases, the rater reproducibility decreases. In addition to the complexity, manual region drawing and slice selection affected reproducibility. This reproducibility issue progressively improved as the protocol evolved by selecting easily distinguishable parcels (from the Eveparcellation maps) and adding specificity to the protocol descriptions (i.e. approximated slice numbers).\nAs mentioned earlier, we assessed reproducibility on probabilistic density images. A direct comparison of the reproducibility could not be made between our analyses and ones in the literature due to the selection of different modalities and metrics. One of the earliest works on reproducible tractography is from Wakana et al. (2007) where they performed reproducibility analyses using kappa measure on FA and T2 for 11 tracts, 8 of which exist in TractEM (CGC, CGH, CST, SLF, ILF, IFO and UNC). The inter-institution inter-rater reproducibility is the closest assessment to our evaluation of tract reproducibility. These assessments resulted in average correlation ranging between 0.73-0.95 for the 8 tracts evaluated (Wakana et al., 2007) . Heiervang et al. (2006) tested their most reproducible method of seed definition for probabilistic tractography. They evaluated tract volume overlap for only three TractEM corresponding tracts: cingulum bundle, GCC and optic radiation. Their results have shown inter-session and inter-subject mean overlap 81% and 50% respectively. Catani and De Schotten (2008) suggested a template guide for some of the association, projection and commissural pathways. They investigated cingulum, ILF, UNC, IFO, CC, AC, fornix (FX) and cerebral tracts and presented qualitative representations of them. The anatomical references are in agreement with our protocols. Another group, Besseling et al. (2012) , did tract morphology similarity analyses for cingulum and GCC. They assessed reproducibility for proximal (excluding cortical projections) and extended (including cortical projections) streamlines.. The reproducibility of these two tracts was measured using DICE with a threshold of 5%. For the extended representation of cingulum and GCC, average DICE values were 0.82 and 0.84 respectively. Different automated protocols are capable of producing streamlines, highly reproducible even for small pathways, and accounts for the whole brain (Garyfallidis et al., 2018; Wasserthal et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2018) .Nonetheless, these methods rely on manual delineations as their prior. This need alone highlights the importance of reproducibility studies at the manual level. Tract specific protocols in combination with subject-specific delineations can provide a backbone to automated methods.\nWe have traced and analyzed lateral and single tracts that co-exist in both hemispheres. Our results quantitatively confirm the inter-hemisphere asymmetry that has been shown in multiple studies (Toga and Thompson, 2003; Wakana et al., 2007; de Schotten et al., 2011) (see Appendix B, Figure S.2-9 ). It was not clear what caused this asymmetry, whether it was anisotropy or the size of the tracts. From a broader perspective, lateralization is evolutionary, hereditary, and developmental, and may occur as the result of disease. Mapping the asymmetry between hemispheres may be a very useful tool to identify abnormalities and the relationship between neighboring white matter tracts.\nTractEM allows non-expert users to create whole brain tractography datasets. At its initial developmental stage, it has shown encouraging results. Using the protocols constructing a full dataset with 35 tracts with their bilateral counterparts is feasible (< 6 h/subject)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we addressed the lack of available manual labeling protocols that are reproducible in spite of human subjectivity. In response to this challenge, we present the TractEM protocols. The TractEM project allows expert/non-expert users to create and curate reproducible pathways across the brain and can be applied generally to large cohorts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses human variability across minor and major pathways on both healthy and aging study data."}, {"section_title": "Data and Code Availability", "text": "TractEM is an open source project, in terms of data and labeling guidelines.
