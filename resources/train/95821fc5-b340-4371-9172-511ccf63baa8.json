To accurately characterize brain structure and any anatomic changes which may occur over time, and to correlate such anatomical changes with concurrent physiological or cognitive changes, we developed, implemented, and validated a set of imaging tools capable of capturing subtle longitudinal changes in the regional and global volumetric structure of the brain. We tested this system on crosssectional and longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data acquired as part of the neuroimaging study of participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (1) . The main goal of this image processing system is to measure the magnitude, rate and regional pattern of longitudinal changes in the brain. Future applications are extensible to functional neuroimaging data. All system components have known accuracy and errors, and thus, the overall system accuracy can be estimated.\nThe application of an image processing system within a large scale longitudinal brain imaging study has posed difficulties in the development, implementation and validation of the different components. Methods typically employed in cross-sectional studies do not have sufficient sensitivity to detect more subtle longitudinal changes. Most studies focusing on the volumetric analysis of the brain deal with cross-sectional data and seek the measurement of part of or the total volume of a structure or region of interest (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Although the notion that imaging studies employing quantitative volumetric methods potentially yield more accurate and less biased results than qualitative studies is widely accepted, validating this assumption can be difficult and timeconsuming. Quantitative neuroanatomic methods may range from manual, local operations in 2-D images (7) to automated, 3-D model-based brain volume estimations (2, 8) to continuous, automated, 3-D volumetric measurements based on probabilistic atlases of neuroanatomy (9) (10) (11) (12) .\nDetailed cortical parcellation techniques have been developed (13) , but they are extremely laborious and time-consuming. In addition, these approaches usually depend on subjective criteria, leading to difficulties in establishing reliability and validity. Finally, an extensive literature exists on stereological methods (14, 15) , which, however, are suitable only for volumetric measurements of large partitions; detecting small local changes by fine sampling would require a prohibitive amount of work.\nIn our case, we are interested in accurately, reliably and automatically measuring the total volumes of structures and regions in the brain. We are particularly concerned with the ability to capture small structural brain changes which may occur over time at global and regional (local) levels. The quantitative methods used in our system include the acquisition of 3-D high-resolution MR spoiled grass (SPGR) images, pre-processing of the data, image segmentation, normalization and regional volumetric analyses including the volumetric quantification of MR images within a stereotaxic coordinate system.\nAt the center of this image processing system are the segmentation and normalization techniques. Our segmentation approach (16) has the ability to adapt to shading artifacts caused by non-uniformities in the radiofrequency (RF) field during image acquisition. Shading artifacts, which occur in nearly all MR images, cause voxel intensities of the same tissue class to vary over the image domain. These artifacts may be corrected prior to the image segmentation step (17) (18) (19) (20) or their correction may be embedded within the segmentation procedure (16, (21) (22) (23) . In the former case, an algorithm first compensates for the shading artifact, then the image is segmented by one of the several available segmentation techniques (24) . In the latter group, the intensity inhomogeneities are compensated simultaneously with image segmentation. In either case, not compensating for the shading artifacts might severely limit the accuracy of any segmentation technique operating on MR images. In addition to shading artifacts, our approach is also very robust to poor soft tissue contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio and partial volume effects.\nThe segmentation allows quantitative measures of global changes in the brain, however, additional tools are necessary to measure the local magnitude and regional pattern of longitudinal changes in the brain. To quantify regional volumes, we examine the brain images within a standard stereotaxic space, the Talairach coordinate space (25) , after spatially normalizing all images for overall shape differences. Several methodologies for spatial normalization of brain images have been proposed in the literature (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Our approach is based on a geometric deformable model, coded in the STAR algorithm, which uses a surface-based elastic warping transformation to bring two 3-D images into registration (35, 36) . This technique has superior performance and better accuracy than other normalization methods which are based on a piecewise linear Talairach transformation (2) or normalization approaches employed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (32) because it utilizes several explicit features, e.g., the ventricular boundary, as well as the outer cortical surface, to drive the elastic transformations. The use of the ventricular boundaries and cortical features is particularly critical in the presence of atrophy, a situation common in the elderly.\nFor the regional analysis in stereotaxic space, the segmented data are tessellated into the 1,056 Talairach boxes (25) . This method yields an accurate and reliable approach for quantitation of large brain regions; however, due to the discrete nature of the Talairach boxes, it is not suitable for smaller regions or individual brain structures. For the quantitation of smaller brain regions, we employ a hybrid procedure which combines the stability of a region-of-interest (ROI) approach with the spatial resolution of a voxel-based method. We refer to this alternate procedure as Regional Analysis of Volumes Examined in Normalized Space, or RAVENS."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "System Overview. Image analysis is comprised of several steps including reslicing of the data, removal of extracranial tissues, segmentation of different tissue types, normalization to a standard coordinate space, and regional quantitative analysis. A schematic diagram illustrating the overall procedure is shown in Figure 1 . In this section, we describe each component in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "MRI Acquisition.", "text": "While the main goal of this paper is to present an image analysis methodology, we tested our protocols on a small sample of elderly subjects -a subset of the participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (1) . All subjects in this study were Image Reformatting. After acquisition, the images were resliced parallel to the AC-PC plane using (i) the correctional angles for roll, yaw, and pitch determined interactively, and (ii) cubic splines for interpolation of the data running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 high-impact workstation (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA)."}, {"section_title": "Removal of Extracranial", "text": "Tissues. An important pre-processing step is the removal of extracranial tissues because our segmentation technique labels the entire brain into three global compartments: WM, GM and CSF. Removal of extracranial tissues is also important for the stereotaxic normalization which is based on the brain boundaries as opposed to the skull contour.\nRemoval of extracranial tissues was accomplished by a sequential application of morphological operators, thresholding, seeding, region growing, and manual editing. First, a morphological erosion with a spherical structuring element (default radius = 2 mm) detaches the brain tissue from the surrounding dura. Next, a 3-D seeded region growing extracts the brain tissue. Finally, a 3-D morphological dilation with a spherical structuring element (default radius = 4 mm) recaptures the tissue lost in the erosion step. Note that the radius of the sphere used in the dilation is larger than the one used in the erosion in order to guarantee that no brain tissue is lost either due to the manual thresholding or to the erosion. In addition, whenever users assign a narrow threshold range, holes may be created inside the brain region. As long as these holes are not connected to the image background, they are automatically recognized as brain regions and filled with the original voxel values. If needed, bridges are placed to sever any connection of these holes with the background. This automated step takes less than a minute (running on a SGI Indigo 2 ) to generate a \"deskulled\" image set. A limitation of this method for pre-processing SPGR images is that an undetermined amount of sulcal CSF is removed because the CSF-dura interface is difficult to determine reliably with the SPGR pulse sequence. Thus, sulcal CSF cannot be estimated reliably from our SPGR images. Typically, the automated step generates an image which is adequate for many image processing operations, such as registration and 3-D rendering. However, for a quantitative volumetric analysis of brain images, some manual editing was necessary to extract the sagittal sinus anteriorly and posteriorly, to eliminate extracranial tissues mesial to the temporal lobes, and to remove portions of the dura posteriorly. In addition, prior to the segmentation step, we manually edited out the cerebellum and brainstem due to concerns about the adequacy of our segmentation algorithm to accurately label these regions and our emphasis on quantitative analysis of the cerebrum. The algorithm maximizes the a posteriori probability jointly over tissue types and mean intensities in an iterative and adaptive fashion. For each iteration, it estimates (i) the mean intensities for each tissue type via a least squares fitting of the B-spline function, and (ii) the tissue type regions modeled by a MRF. By increasing the number of control points of the B-spline functions, the algorithm slowly adapts to regional intensity variations which, in the case of MR images, may be caused by shading artifacts due to MR field inhomogeneities.\nThe segmentation algorithm is fully automated. As an initial step, the algorithm presegments the data with a k-means clustering technique which groups the voxels in the image into k clusters through the minimization of the total inter-cluster variance (a maximum likelihood estimation). The result of the pre-segmentation is then used as an initial classification for the adaptive and iterative model. After the automated segmentation into WM, GM and total CSF, the ventricular CSF (V-CSF) was determined by manually drawing a crude ROI to eliminate any CSF falling outside the ventricular system. This ROI served as a mask within which CSF voxels on the segmented image were reclassified as V-CSF.\nImage Normalization. The segmented images provide global volumetric measurements of the total amount of WM, GM and V-CSF. To quantify regional brain volumes, however, the images were examined within a standard stereotaxic space, the Talairach reference space (25) , after spatially normalizing all images for global morphological differences. The spatial normalization of the images was performed using the STAR algorithm detailed in (35, 36) .\nBriefly, a parametric representation of the outer boundary of the brain was first determined from the skull-stripped images, using the deformable surface algorithm developed by Davatzikos (36) . Based on this representation, a map from the outer boundary of each subject's brain to the brain of the Talairach atlas (25) Subsequently, each image was elastically warped to satisfy the outer cortical map, accounting for the overall shape differences in the subjects' brains. Additionally, variability in ventricular size was accounted for using a uniform strain within the ventricles. This procedure allowed their contraction corresponding to volumetric differences between each subject's ventricles and the ventricles in the atlas. After this gross volumetric correction, a force field applied to the ventricular boundaries brought them into register with the ventricular boundaries in the atlas.\nVentricular registration is an important step in our normalization procedure because we are imaging older subjects who, typically, have enlarged ventricles compared with younger subjects. The rest of the brain tissue was deformed according to the equations governing the deformation of an elastic solid.\nAnother important characteristic of our spatial normalization procedure is the preservation of the tissue volumetric units in stereotaxic space, rather than the tissue density as is customary in many spatial normalization methods (2, 32) . Therefore, the total volumes of WM, GM and V-CSF are the same before and after normalization. It is important to preserve the tissue volumetric units to permit quantitative analyses in stereotaxic space. For example, a volumetric difference between the two hemispheres would otherwise be eliminated after normalization to the symmetric Talairach atlas."}, {"section_title": "Quantitation of Regional Brain Volumes.", "text": "The regional quantitative analysis is performed by two distinct methods: the \"Boxel\" counting method and the RAVENS method. Both approaches quantify brain regions in stereotaxic space and are based on the previously segmented and normalized images. The major differences between the regional quantitation methods are related to resolution and visualization issues. The Boxel method is adequate for quantitation of large compartments like the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital brain regions (2) . The method is fully automated and visualization is not required. The RAVENS approach takes full advantage of visual information and mapping techniques and is best suited for quantitation and visualization of smaller brain regions like the caudate nucleus, the lenticular nucleus, the temporal horns, and potentially, specific cortical ROIs. These regions are not individually labeled by the global segmentation method nor quantified by the Boxel approach. Additionally, the RAVENS method is more flexible and takes advantage of the image's full resolution through a voxel-based analysis.\nThe method can operate in an automated or interactive mode.\nThe Boxel Method -Tissue Distributions in Talairach Space and Box Analysis. Following normalization, the segmented images were tessellated into 1,056 boxes, as described in (25) . The total amounts of WM, GM and V-CSF were measured for each box. These 1,056 measurements could in principle be compared individually across subjects; however, such comparisons would be meaningful only if the normalized images were in perfect register. In practice, this is not the case, due to residual inter-individual variability after normalization. Therefore, measurements at the box level are likely to have higher variance across individuals, which would reduce the statistical significance of morphological changes or differences observed. In addition, each box may include several anatomic regions, limiting the utility of data based on individual boxes.\nThe individual boxes were thus grouped into larger brain compartments, as defined and validated by Andreasen and colleagues (2) . Specifically, we defined four major compartments corresponding to the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Then, after tessellating a segmented brain image into the Talairach space, regional quantitation is obtained by counting the volumes for each tissue type, i.e., WM, GM and V-CSF, within each of the four lobes for each hemisphere. The normalization of the images into the Talairach space causes a deformation of the original image morphology; however, applying the RAVENS method, the tissue volumes are preserved by coding them as intensity-based maps. As shown in Figure 3A -D, brain regions which expanded during the normalization step will look darker than their original counterparts because the same amount of tissue was spread over a larger area. Similarly, regions which were decreased in size will look proportionally brighter. Note that after normalization, the shape and size of both ventricles are similar (as expected) and the differences in volumes are coded as intensitybased maps."}, {"section_title": "RAVENS -Regional Analysis of Volumes Examined in", "text": "Once the segmented tissue distributions are stereotaxically normalized, they may be averaged to generate mean images for groups or processed individually for longitudinal analyses.\nTypically, as illustrated in Figure 4A -C, we generate average images over samples of interest and display them as intensity-based maps. Besides being able to carry out quantitative analyses in normalized space, these displays allow for scale-space analysis (by allowing different degrees of blurring) and provide a representation which can be directly correlated with other imaging modalities such as normalized PET scans.\nThe quantitative analysis of brain structures and regions with the RAVENS maps may be performed in two different ways: (i) a free-hand ROI may be drawn directly on a RAVENS map as illustrated in Figure 5A ; integration of the RAVENS map within this ROI yields the volume of the underlying structure. Or, (ii) as illustrated in Figure 5B , a brain structure may be chosen in a coregistered digital brain atlas; this atlas' structure is then overlaid onto the RAVENS map, marking a 3-D region which is integrated through all slices yielding the volume of the structure being studied.\nThis method is particularly attractive to us since many brain regions have already been delineated and defined in a digital stereotaxic atlas of neuroanatomy (37) , allowing automated processing of many regions. The volumetric accuracy of this method becomes mainly a function of the global and local registration precision between the digital atlas and the RAVENS maps."}, {"section_title": "ASSESSMENT OF RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY", "text": "Removal of Extracranial Tissues. Since the complete removal of extracranial tissues involved manual editing by an operator, interoperator differences were examined to assess how distinct operators would affect the stripping process. For this test, fourteen images were initially processed with the automated part of the skull stripping method and then manually edited, independently by two operators, for any extracranial tissues still present in the images. Finally, these two sets of images were segmented and the volumes of the white matter and gray matter compartments compared by t-test.\nImage Segmentation -Phantom. To assess the accuracy of the adaptive Bayesian method and to compare it against other segmentation techniques, we created the 3-D digital brain phantom depicted in Figure 6 . The overall shape of the phantom and the volume of its three major compartments -WM, GM and CSF -are based on a segmented SPGR image of a 72 year old subject. In this case, the segmentation involved a simple thresholding technique which was complemented by manual outlining. The matrix size of the phantom is 256 x 256 x 72 voxels with each voxel measuring 0.9375 mm 2 x 1.5 mm and having 8-bits of depth. This image set serves as our standard reference, with known volumes for WM, GM and CSF.\nA number of parameters may be modified in the phantom to create a realistic looking image ( Figure 6A ) which simulates the appearance and characteristics of an older brain. These parameters include: mean intensity values, noise, magnetic field inhomogeneities and partial volume effects.\nThe specific parameters employed in our validation studies were determined from MRI scans of ten older individuals aged 59-84 years. Based on these images, mean intensity values of the phantom were fixed at 112.08, 87.53, and 35.00 for the WM, GM and CSF, respectively. The standard deviation of the superimposed Gaussian noise was set to 6.0. The 3-D linear shading which simulated magnetic field inhomogeneities was 7% in each direction. Finally, the partial volume averaging effect of the MR acquisition was simulated substituting each point in the final image by a weighted average in its 6-connected 3-D neighborhood.\nResults for the adaptive Bayesian method ( Figure 6B ) were compared with: a Gaussian clustering method, a n-nearest neighbors classifier, and a neural networks technique all implemented in the Analyze biomedical image analysis package (38); a region growing method and a multiple thresholding technique implemented in the MEDx radiological image processing software (Sensor Systems Inc., Sterling, VA); and a standard fuzzy c-means algorithm (24)."}, {"section_title": "Short-Term Reliability.", "text": "To assess the short-term reliability of our quantitative approach, three subjects had repeated SPGR scans separated by approximately 30 minutes with the subjects being removed from the scanner and repositioned between the two SPGR acquisitions. The images were volumetrically acquired, pre-processed to remove extracranial tissues, and segmented into WM, GM and V-CSF.\nLongitudinal Stability. To assess the longitudinal or long-term stability of our approach, we examined data from ten BLSA subjects, who had been imaged at times t and t+1 year. The ten subjects ranged in age from 59-84 years (mean, 72.4 years \u00b1 10.7). SPGR images were acquired approximately one year apart. These images were pre-processed and segmented into WM, GM and V-CSF. However, unlike the short-term reliability study previously described, for a single subject, any observed differences in the volumes of WM, GM and V-CSF compartments between times t and t+1 year, do not necessarily reflect inconsistencies or errors in the image analysis protocol employed. During a period of one year, it is conceivable that true anatomical changes may take place, altering the volumes of the WM, GM and/or V-CSF. The possibility of true longitudinal brain changes may be particularly relevant for older subjects. Thus, any differences between volumetric measurements at times t and t+1 year confound measurement errors and true longitudinal changes, and reflect upper-bound estimates of the measurement error."}, {"section_title": "Regional Brain Volumes -Boxel Analysis.", "text": "Reliability of the Boxel analysis was assessed using the images from the three subjects with repeated SPGR scans separated by 30 minutes.

The development of the different system components was motivated by our need for an accurate and reliable system capable of analyzing cross-sectional and longitudinal data. The application of this image processing system within the framework of a large scale longitudinal study posed unique difficulties in the development, implementation and validation of the different system components. A general goal of our system is to reliably and accurately analyze and quantify large amounts of volumetric data over a period of years. Specifically, based on the analysis of structural MR data, we want to measure the magnitude, rate and regional pattern of longitudinal changes in the brain. We achieved these goals by designing a system with the following basic characteristics: the accuracy and errors of the individual system components are measurable and known, providing an estimate of the overall system accuracy; the system must be efficiently implemented since large amounts of data are being processed; whenever possible, methods are automated without compromising their accuracy; manual handling of the data is kept at a minimum, and the variability introduced by different operators, when necessary, is measured. Additionally, the MR data are processed in a manner which permits correlation and combination with external measures (e.g., neuropsychological assessments of memory and cognition) and/or other imaging modalities such as PET and other functional neuroimaging measures. Furthermore, the methods were adapted and optimized to manipulate data sets from older subjects who typically have enlarged ventricular systems and greater degree of brain atrophy.\nOur imaging system was divided into five major components or steps: acquisition of the MR data, image pre-processing, global segmentation, stereotaxic normalization and regional volumetric analyses which, in turn, were composed of the Talairach boxes counting method (the 'Boxel' method) and a newly proposed RAVENS method.\nOur assessment of the error introduced by trained operators during the image preprocessing step indicated that interoperator variability is less than 1% of WM, GM and total brain volumes. Errors in the tissue labeling ranged between 1-3% for WM, GM and CSF as shown by phantom studies. This accuracy indicates that we have sufficient sensitivity to detect longitudinal volumetric changes greater than 2 to 3% for individual measures of WM, GM and CSF.
