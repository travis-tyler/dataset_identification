[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Circulating microRNAs, present either in the cellular component, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), or in cell-free plasma, have emerged as biomarkers for age-dependent systemic, disease-associated changes in many organs. Previously, we have shown that microRNA (miR)-34a is increased in circulating PBMC of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present study, we show that this microRNA's sister, miR-34c, exhibits even greater increase in both cellular and plasma components of AD circulating blood samples, compared to normal age-matched controls. Statistical analysis shows the accuracy of levels of miR-34c assayed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis: the area under the curve is 0.99 (p < 0.0001) and the 95% confidence level extends from 0.97 to 1. Pearson correlation between miR-34c levels and mild and moderate AD, as defined by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), shows an r-value of \u22120.7, suggesting a relatively strong inverse relationship between the two parameters. These data show that plasma levels of microRNA 34c are much more prominent in AD than those of its sister, miR-34a, or than its own level in PBMC. Transfection studies show that miR-34c, as does its sister miR-34a, represses the expression of several selected genes involved in cell survival and oxidative defense pathways, such as Bcl2, SIRT1, and others, in cultured cells. Taken together, our results indicate that increased levels of miR-34c in both PBMC and plasma may reflect changes in circulating blood samples in AD patients, compared to age-matched normal controls."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recently, microRNAs found in circulating blood, especially in cell-free plasma, have been noted functionally for intercellular and/or inter-organ communication. Circulating plasma microRNAs seem to be largely released from the cellular compartment, i.e., peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), either associated with specific protein or lipid molecules, or released in vesicles known as exosomes, with some portion derived from the cell debris of apoptotic bodies (Smalheiser, 2007; De Smaelea et al., 2010; Etheridge et al., 2011) . Not surprisingly, differentially expressed plasma microRNAs have been noted as powerful biomarkers for several central nervous system disorders, from bipolar disorder to schizophrenia, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Gaughwin et al., 2011; Rong et al., 2011; SuarezGomez et al., 2011; Geekiyanage et al., 2012; Sheinerman et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012) . Our own work has shown Abbreviations: miR or miRNA, microRNA; AD, Alzheimer's disease; NEC, normal elderly control; MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examination; MMSE score (4-9), severe group; MMSE score (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , moderate group; MMSE score (21-24), mild group; Bcl2, B-cell lymphoma 2; SIRT1, sirtuin1; Psen1, presenilin-1. that lead microRNAs are differentially regulated in PBMC of AD patients compared with age-matched controls (Schipper et al., 2007; Maes et al., 2010) . Therefore, unique microRNAs offer another aspect, in addition to specific transcriptome and serum protein profiling: blood biomarker discovery, for instance for AD.\nAmong many microRNAs, the miR-34 family, composed of three members, miR-34a, -34b, and -34c, is relatively wellunderstood. MicroRNA-34b, a plasma biomarker for Huntington disease (Gaughwin et al., 2011) , and its sister, miR-34c, are linked as a bi-cistronic transcriptional unit (Liang et al., 2009) ; together with the other sister, miR-34a, they participate functionally in at least two signaling pathways: (1) Bcl2 for cell survival/apoptosis; and (2) SIRT1 deacetylase for p53 or neuroprotection signaling. SIRT1, p53, and miR34a are involved in a positive feedback loop for miR-34a expression: acetylated p53 binds the promoter to activate this microRNA's transcription (He et al., 2007; Yamakuchi et al., 2008) . Increased miR-34a suppresses SIRT1 expression, thereby diminishing its deacetylation of p53, leading to an increase in acetylated p53 transcriptional activity, resulting in the continued up-regulation of this microRNA (Yamakuchi et al., 2008) .\nMany reports, including our own work in aged mice, observe parallel changes during aging between differentially regulated circulating microRNAs and changes in the central nervous system (Li et al., 2011a) . During aging, accumulating oxidative stressactivated p53 may tilt the balance toward age-dependent increase of miR-34a, observed in the brains of old rats and mice (Li et al., 2011b,c) ; and a reduction in age-dependent increase in miR-34a in brain has been observed in calorie-restricted mice (Khanna et al., 2011) . In animal models of AD, increased miR-34a levels are observed in brains of mouse models bearing both the APP swe and presenilin transgenes . MicroRNA 34-c, a sister of miR-34a, is also observed in the hippocampal region of AD animal models to be functionally connected to cognitive decline, because inhibition of this microRNA rescues memory impairment in AD transgenic mice, with corresponding regained SIRT1 levels (Zovoilis et al., 2011) . These results suggest that increased expression of miR-34a and -34c may repress SIRT1 and Bcl2 expression, one of the many underlying causes for dysregulation of oxidative defense and neuronal cell survival in the brain of AD transgenic animals.\nThe main objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that unique microRNA changes in AD patients, specifically those of the microRNA-34 family, can be identified in circulating blood samples in both the cellular component, PBMC, and cell-free plasma. To test this hypothesis, we have expanded beyond our previous observation of increased miR-34a in PBMC of AD patients (Schipper et al., 2007) to include also miR-34c in our study of specimens of both blood components. Here, we report that miR-34c in circulating plasma and PBMC indeed exhibits increased levels of expression in AD patients, compared with age-matched normal elderly controls (NEC). Transfection study shows that miR-34c, similar to reported findings for miR-34a, functionally represses Bcl2, SIRT1, and other proteins, all key genes whose decreases are functionally associated with weakened oxidative defense and cell survival."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS AND CLINICAL EVALUATION", "text": "Informed consent was obtained from all participants, following the Institutional Review Board protocol approved by the Sir Mortimer B.

The Ct value is the difference between the Ct of the target microRNA and that of the reference microRNA ( Ct = Ct miR34\u00d7 \u2212 Ct miR16).

Correlation between MMSE scores and expression levels of miR-34c and miR-34a in AD and NEC patients was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) (Taylor, 1990) ; a correlation coefficient value of 0.8 or above indicates strong correlation, whereas a value around 0.5 is indicative of moderate correlation.\nReceiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the accuracy of the test differentiating AD from NEC individuals for miR-34c and miR-34a in age-matched cohorts (Zweig and Campbell, 1993; Fawcett, 2006) .

Contrary to these scenarios is discordance between these two categories: i.e., a false positive (FP) is defined as disease absence in an individual whose diagnostic test is positive, and a false negative (FN) characterizes disease presence in an individual whose diagnostic test is negative.

The age range for the AD group is between 56 and 90, with an average age of 80; the NEC cohort is between 61 and 90, with an average of 72 (Table 1) . Our cohort's cognitive ability, assessed by the MMSE, is as reported in the literature (Sharp and Gatz, 2011) , i.e., lower scores are linked with fewer years of education in AD individuals ( Figure 2S ). Our recruitment program for normal control individuals is limited by the fact that many are in their 60 s. In order to achieve an agematched study design, we further selected from the AD and NEC groups such that the age range of both subcohorts lies between 76-90; the average age for the former is 82, and the latter 80 ( Table 1) .\nTo optimize the accuracy of quantitative PCR assays, we used two control steps: (a) quality control for the cDNA synthesis step with C. elegans Cel 39 spike-in; and (b) using miR-16 to standardize baseline level determination. Figures 1A-D shows similar levels of miR-34a and miR-34c with and without spike-in experiments in both AD and NEC plasma samples. These results suggest that the protocol established for miR-34a and miR-34c qPCR assays is stringent, providing optimal quality cDNA synthesis with minimal putative RT-RNA inhibitions.

However, since miR-16 is an abundant microRNA associated with red blood cells, even minimal hemolysis can cause unreliable qPCR results, as shown by M\u00fcller et al. (2014) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) qPCR assays. In this context, we evaluated miR-16 levels in all samples used in our study, as shown in Figures 1E,F , and found that in both total and age-matched cohorts, levels of this microRNA are similar between the AD and NEC cohorts.

Similar wide spreads of AD values while NEC samples are clustered were also observed with miR-34a levels ( Figures 2C,D) . Table 2 shows the wide distribution and high SD indices for both microRNAs in the AD group. To address the concern that higher AD microRNA values could be due to the older age group used, we next selected from our cohorts NEC individuals age-matched to AD counterparts, as listed in Table 1 . Figures 3A,B shows box plots and distribution of individual values for miR-34c in the two age-matched subcohorts. Clearly, the majority of AD plasma specimens in the age-matched control study exhibit higher miR-34c levels than do normal controls; Table 3 shows 1/deltaCt values in the 0.20-0.53 range for AD, and 0.05-0.22 for NEC plasma specimens. When levels of miR34a were analyzed, however, the range of distribution is not differentially expressed between the AD and NEC groups, with more spread-out distribution for both groups, as well as significant overlapping ranges, by both box plot and scatter plots (Figures 3C,D; Table 3 ).

Our previous study reported miR-34a as a lead microRNA from array profiling and validated by qPCR assays, showing a 2.5-fold increase in PBMC isolated from AD specimens (Schipper et al., 2007 ). The present study shows that this microRNA's sister, miR-34c, is even more prominently increased in both PBMC and plasma fractions of AD blood samples over age-matched NEC. Most importantly, the majority of miR-34c levels among mild AD patients, determined by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), are elevated beyond those of normal controls. In addition, inclusion of patients with moderate degrees of AD dementia with mild and normal counterparts in our study shows a relatively strong inverse relationship between MMSE scores and levels of this microRNA among the three groups. Levels of miR-34b, the bicistronic sister of miR-34c, are not significantly different between AD and NEC age-matched controls. Thus, our results reported here will serve as future leads to identify key microRNA abundance, such as miR-34c, as noninvasive indicators for plasma changes associated with AD. Age-matched circulating blood microRNA studies like ours by design suffer several limitations, such as: (1) restriction of obtaining gene expression changes at a particular snap-shot time window; and (2) inability to link with changes of the same gene expression in individuals' brains. The first limitation cannot be addressed by small scale studies like ours, but rather in large consortium studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study of the National Institute on Aging, USA, with longitudinal blood sample collection linking plasma and CSF analysis study, and MRI imaging of brain changes in the same individuals. However, most of these studies are centered on the analysis of protein changes, with some focus on Tau and A\u03b2 as biomarkers (O'Bryant et al., 2011; Toledo et al., 2011 Toledo et al., , 2013 . Other studies such as M\u00fcller et al. (2014) have limited sample size because such samples are only available from a very few centers where longitudinal ante mortem blood or CSF samples are collected along with follow-up acquisition of autopsy brain specimens. Comparative studies between ante-mortem blood samples and post mortem autopsy will emerge in future studies, yielding results elucidating the relationships between plasma biomarkers and brain pathology structural changes, including but not limited to amyloid plaques and Tau-associated tangle formation.\nTo identify body fluid-associated microRNA biomarkers for neurodegeneration, standardization of the sample collection protocol and quality control of RNA isolation are two obvious quality control criteria in any study of this kind.

One-way ANOVA followed by LSD test was used to determine statistical significance; * P < 0.05, * * P < 0.01. samples were unacceptable because of poor RNA integrity. Even among the 70-80 samples with good RNA quality, we had to narrow our study to 25 AD and 27 NEC as shown in Table 1 , in order to satisfy age-matched criteria for our study. With samples from these two subcohorts, as in most neurodegenerative studies, before proceeding to qPCR assays of a particular microRNA of interest, we implemented quality control to insure the cDNA synthesis part of the assays by incorporating Cel 39 spike-in in the step of RNA isolation. Besides the above issues, selection of reference microRNAs for determination of microRNA levels of expression is crucial for studies of blood samples of neuronal disorders. We use miR-16 as our reference microRNA, following the report by Gaughwin et al. (2011) , who used it as the reference microRNA to show that miR-34b is elevated in the plasma of Huntingdon mutation gene carriers, prior to disease manifestation. Interestingly, our study with this microRNA shows that miR-34b levels do not differ significantly in plasma specimens between AD patients and NEC. A recent study by M\u00fcller et al. (2014) shows that miR-16 and miR-146 are increased in AD in both hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, this report also suggests that miR-16, a major red blood cell microRNA (Kirschner et al., 2011 (Kirschner et al., , 2013 McDonald et al., 2011) , may be contaminatedby hemolysis in CSF samples; even as little as 100 \u03bcl of erythrocytes added skews the qPCR results (M\u00fcller et al., 2014) . In addition, several other microRNAs reported so far as unchanged in AD tissue have been used as references to determine levels of microRNAs of interest (Geekiyanage et al., 2012; Sheinerman et al., 2012; Sheinerman and Umansky, 2013) . Notwithstanding all these reports, no unifying approach of selecting appropriate reference controls has yet been reached. At present we are limited to the use of miR-16 as the reference, based on the rationale that we found no significant variance in it among our samples, as shown in Figures 1E,F . The widespread variance in levels of both miR-34c and its sister, miR-34a in AD plasma compared with the tight NEC cluster range, shown in Figures 1-4 , clearly suggests individual variability in the control of these microRNAs' expression. From our small age-matched cohorts, miR-34c levels may be a better candidate than miR-34a and miR-34b for future large-scale study as a blood-based biomarker, simply because its expression in most mild AD patients shows higher levels than most NEC. The ROC analyses performed for both miR-34c and miR-34a 1/deltaCt values in age-matched cohorts proved the former to be an excellent discriminant (AUC = 0.99), whereas the latter was merely fairly good (AUC = 0.81). However, these results suggest the need of further research with larger cohorts, to stringently validate our results of sensitivity using miR-34c as a diagnostic biomarker for plasma samples. Likewise, the inverse correlation, observed only when the moderate and mild groups are compared with their NEC between cognitive scoring and levels of expression of miR-34c in plasma also needs future studies with larger cohorts to define their true relationship. Nevertheless, our findings open the possibility that plasma microRNAs, along with other biomarkers, may be fertile ground for future research linking cognitive decline with changes of gene expression in blood samples.\nThe increased miR-34c in AD plasma may derive from PBMC, where miR-34c is also increased. As reported, microRNAs present in the circulating plasma may be found either in the encapsulated vesicles known as exosomes, or in lipid-or protein-associated free particulates (Smalheiser, 2007; Etheridge et al., 2011) . Reports so far are inconclusive as to what proportion of plasma microRNAs are associated with the former vs. the latter components. Future comparative studies of PBMC, exosomal and free-form miR-34c will reveal the relationship among these three components of AD circulating blood specimens responsible for this microRNA's increased expression.\nMicroRNA-34c, as reported for its sister, miR-34a (He et al., 2007; Yamakuchi et al., 2008) and as shown in Figure 8 , represses Bcl2, SIRT1, Psen1, and Onecut2, all associated with cellular survival and oxidative defense signaling (Clotman et al., 2005; Goodall et al., 2013) . This led us to suggest that increased miR-34c may be one of many factors contributing to an overall systemic weakening of stress defense and cell survival, as suggested in our model presented in Figure 9 . Life-long cumulative oxidative stress induction of p53 up-regulation may activate the expression of this microRNA, with a steadily increasing trend during aging (Li et al., 2011b,c) . In AD, this oxidative stress may be further enhanced, manifested in brain as well as perhaps system-wide, reflected in circulating blood by both PBMC and plasma (Maes et al., 2010; Goodall et al., 2013) . Future culture experiments in PBMC isolated from AD patients compared with those from normal counterparts will allow us to investigate whether these cells with increased miR-34c levels are indeed prone to apoptotic death, and whether plasma from the same samples stimulates stress and apoptotic signaling in neighboring cells.\nIn conclusion, data presented here indicate that levels of miR34c significantly increase in plasma samples of sporadic AD. Future studies with larger age-matched cohorts will validate these results, and reveal whether this microRNA change is characteristic of sporadic AD as a biomarker criterion, and further comparative studies will elucidate whether it is a common biomarker shared among various neurodegenerative disorders, associated with the decline of oxidative defense and cell survival in neuronal dysfunction.\nWhitehead, and ljlal Yazdani for technical assistance.
