[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Tropical cyclones are renowned for their destructive nature and are an important feature of marine and coastal tropical ecosystems. Over the last 40 years, their intensity, frequency and tracks have changed, partly in response to ocean warming, and future predictions indicate that these trends are likely to continue with potential consequences for human populations and coastal ecosystems. However, our understanding of how tropical cyclones currently affect marine biodiversity, and pelagic species in particular, is limited. For seabirds, the impacts of cyclones are known to be detrimental at breeding colonies, but impacts on the annual survival of pelagic adults and juveniles remain largely unexplored and no study has simultaneously explored the direct impacts of cyclones on different life-history stages across the annual life cycle. We used a 20-year data set on tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean, tracking data from 122 Round Island petrels and long-term capture-mark-recapture data to explore the impacts of tropical cyclones on the survival of adult and juvenile (first year) petrels during both the breeding and migration periods. The tracking data showed that juvenile and adult Round Island petrels utilize the three cyclone regions of the Indian Ocean and were potentially exposed to cyclones for a substantial part of their annual cycle. However, only juvenile petrel survival was affected by cyclone activity; negatively by a strong cyclone in the vicinity of the breeding colony and positively by increasing cyclone activity in the Northern Indian Ocean where they spend the majority of their first year at sea. These contrasting effects raise the intriguing prospect that the projected changes in cyclones under current climate change scenarios may have positive as well as the more commonly perceived negative impacts on marine biodiversity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Extreme climatic events such as tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes and typhoons, but hereafter referred to as cyclones) are an important feature of tropical marine, coastal and island ecosystems. Cyclones are typically considered destructive by nature, negatively impacting on human populations (Mendelsohn et al., 2012; Peduzzi et al., 2012) , marine (Raynor et al., 2013; Dewald & Pike, 2014; Perry et al., 2014) and terrestrial biodiversity (Oli et al., 2001; McConkey et al., 2004; Schoener et al., 2004; Rittenhouse et al., 2010; Dunham et al., 2011) , but can have both short-and long-term positive ecological impacts on marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Burslem et al., 2000; Lugo, 2008; Carrigan & Puotinen, 2014) .\nOver the last 40 years, the changes in cyclone frequency, rate of genesis and intensity in different hemispheres and ocean basins, primarily in response to a warming environment, have been well documented (Webster et al., 2005; Elsner et al., 2008; Kuleshov et al., 2010; Kishtawal et al., 2012) . In the Southern Indian Ocean cyclone region (hereafter referred to as SIO), there is weak evidence to show that cyclones are getting less frequent (Kuleshov et al., 2010) , but there is an increase in the frequency of strong cyclones (Webster et al., 2005; Kuleshov et al., 2010; Kuleshov, 2014) , an increase in the lifetime maximum wind speed (Elsner et al., 2008; Deo & Ganer, 2014) and an increase in the rate at which cyclones intensify (Kishtawal et al., 2012) . There is also a strong connection between the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) and cyclones in the SIO with ENSO affecting the frequency and spatial distribution of cyclones (Ho et al., 2006) . In El Ni\u00f1o years, there were more cyclones in the western SIO (west of 75\u00b0) than in La Ni\u00f1a years and in El Ni\u00f1o years cyclone tracks followed an earlier recurve to the east. In the Northern Indian Ocean cyclone region (hereafter referred to as NIO), there is no evidence for a change in the annual number of cyclones (Webster et al., 2005; Evan & Camargo, 2011) , but there are some regional variations within this trend. Cyclone genesis in the Arabian Sea has increased, yet declined in the Bay of Bengal (Deo & Ganer, 2014) and the duration of the premonsoon cyclone period in the Arabian Sea (May-June) is increasing with cyclones forming earlier (Deo & Ganer, 2014) . There is also evidence for a recent increase in cyclone intensity in the NIO (Webster et al., 2005; Elsner et al., 2008; . Under a range of climate change scenarios, these trends are predicted to continue (Gualdi et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2010) and alongside other extreme weather events are predicted to have important consequences for biodiversity and human systems (Jentsch & Beierkuhnlein, 2008; De Sainz et al., 2014; Garcia et al., 2014) . To understand the impacts of the projected changes in cyclone activity on biodiversity, we first need to understand how biodiversity is affected by current cyclone conditions both in the short and long term. While a number of studies have explored this in terrestrial systems (see earlier examples and Ameca Y Ju arez et al. (2013) , Moreno & M\u00f8ller (2011) ), documented impacts in marine systems are less commonplace despite this being the environment where cyclone genesis and their subsequent tracks primarily occur. In marine systems, seabirds are a relatively well-studied taxa, in terms of their ecology and how they are influenced by environmental conditions (Barbraud et al., 2012; Sydeman et al., 2012; Jenouvrier, 2013; Oro, 2014) , but studies in the tropics are still limited (Oro, 2014) . Given the tropical nature of cyclones, it is therefore unsurprising that only a small number of studies have examined their impacts on seabird ecology. To date, studies have primarily concentrated on either coastal species at or near breeding grounds (King et al., 1992; Spendelow et al., 2002; Devney et al., 2009; Raynor et al., 2013) or the 'inland wrecks' of pelagic species driven ashore by cyclones (Bugoni et al., 2007; Hass et al., 2012) . Given that seabirds are typically long lived, with a relatively slow life-history strategy on the slow-fast continuum (Saether & Bakke, 2000) , their population growth rate is most likely to be sensitive to changes in survival and adult survival in particular, hence understanding how this might respond to cyclones is important, but clearly overlooked in tropical species. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of cyclones on annual survival has only been examined in one (temperate) species, the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), which breeds in the Mediterranean but migrates through the hurricane region in the Atlantic, where increasing storm frequency negatively impacts on adult survival (Jenouvrier et al., 2009b; Boano et al., 2010; Genovart et al., 2013) . No study has yet to explicitly examine this in the survival of a tropical seabird, which could be exposed to cyclones at both the breeding grounds and during migration.\nExploring the impacts of large-scale environmental factors, such as cyclones, on population demography is challenging because both location data are required to demonstrate where and when species of interest are exposed to environmental factors and long-term, detailed demographic data are required to then quantify any impact. In species with a migratory aspect to their life cycle, such as pelagic seabirds, these challenges are compounded and the need for year-round, extensive location data are particularly important to qualify the extent of exposure. In this study, we interpret, for the first time, a long-term demographic data set on a tropical seabird in the light of seasonal location data relative to the spatiotemporal distribution of an environmental factor (cyclones) likely to impact on survival. Our study is based in the Indian Ocean, which has three distinct cyclone regions, three cyclone seasons (Evan & Camargo, 2011) and exhibits long-term trends in cyclone metrics since the 1970s (Webster et al., 2005; Elsner et al., 2008; Kuleshov et al., 2010; Kishtawal et al., 2012) . We first combined 20 years of cyclone tracks and 3 years of tracking data from adult and fledgling Round Island petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana) to establish that these pelagic seabirds were exposed to cyclones at the breeding colony, during their annual migration and first year at sea, within the Indian Ocean. Secondly, we used a 20-year capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data set and the corresponding seasonal cyclone data to examine the impact of cyclones on adult and first-year survival at different spatial scales."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study site, species and data collection", "text": "This study was conducted at Round Island Nature Reserve (19.85\u00b0south; 57.78\u00b0east), a 219 ha island situated 23 km off the North coast of Mauritius, Indian Ocean. The climate is strongly seasonal, dominated by two monsoon periods, the warm and wet north-east monsoon (NEM) and the cooler, drier south-west Monsoon (SWM) (Fig. 1) . The former typically runs from October to April (i.e. austral summer) and includes the tropical cyclone season and the latter from May to September (i.e. austral winter) (Schott & McCreary, 2001) . Five species of seabird breed on Round Island including the Round Island petrel (Pterodroma arminjoniana), which is a long-lived, gadfly petrel (300-500 g). The classification of the petrel on Round Island has proved confusing since its discovery in 1948, and recent genetic evidence suggests that there are at least three species of Pterodroma breeding and hybridizing on the island (Brown et al., 2010 (Brown et al., , 2011 . Unpublished ringing and tracking data suggest that immigration from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans continues, but to what extent remains unclear. Round Island petrels breed all year round, with chicks and eggs found in any month of the year, but there is a peak in egg laying in August-October (Tatayah, 2010) . Petrel activity (i.e. eggs, chicks and adults) is typically lowest on the island in May each year ( Fig. 1) and hence a petrel year runs from June to May, thereby spanning two calendar years and is referred to by the first calendar year, that is season 2001 = 2001/2002 . The petrels are surface nesters, nesting under rock ledges, in clusters of boulders and in the native tussock grass Vetivera arguta. Not all petrels that return to Round Island attempt to breed each year, but along with breeding petrels remain at Round Island for around 6 months. When not at Round Island, these petrels are pelagic, typically performing a 6-month migration to other regions in the Indian Ocean including the Arabian Sea, Somali basin, Bay of Bengal and Western Australian basin. Adult petrels return to Round Island each year and therefore typically spend half the year at the island and half the year on migration and the timing of this process is consistent from 1 year to the next (unpublished analyses). Juvenile (first year) petrels fledge at around 90 days old (Tatayah, 2010) remain in the vicinity of Round Island for up to 2 weeks postfledging and then stay away from the island for at least 1 year spending time in the Mascarene basin, Somali basin, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, before returning aged~18 months or older. In the 1970s and 1980s, sporadic ringing of a small number of petrels (63) on Round Island occurred, and in 1993, a population monitoring programme was initiated involving regular surveys of breeding sites, monitoring of breeding success, ringing of chicks (aged >70 days) and adults (with South African Bird Ringing Unit numbered steel rings) and their subsequent recapture (Tatayah, 2010) . As part of the surveys, petrels are recaptured when breeding, that is found on an egg or chick, and also when resting on the island. Petrels are also known to compete for nest sites, and also rest in nest sites, and hence can be found in nest sites with chicks and eggs that are not their own (Tatayah, 2010) ; therefore, we are unable to consistently distinguish between breeding and nonbreeding individuals and hence immature or subadults and adult petrels. Prior to the establishment of a permanent field station on the island in 2001, this monitoring programme was conducted as part of the four, 1-week management trips conducted each year. Post 2001, the petrel population has been monitored on a monthly basis."}, {"section_title": "Tropical cyclones", "text": "The Indian Ocean has three cyclone regions: two in the NIO, the Arabian Sea (AS) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB), and one in the SIO north of 40\u00b0south (Fig. 2a) . In the AS & BoB, the cyclone season is bimodal (May-June & October-December), with 90% of cyclones occurring in May/June and November (Evan & Camargo, 2011) . Cyclones are more frequent and more intense in the May/June period (Evan & Camargo, 2011) . In the SIO, the main cyclone season runs from December to April (Webster et al., 2005) , and in order to comply with our nomenclature for a petrel year, we chose to label cyclone seasons by the first of the 2 years that they span (i.e. 2001 = 2001/2002 season) , ensuring consistency between both petrel and cyclone-related data. We accessed data on storms from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) (Knapp et al., 2010) . We included data from 1993 to 2012 and only those storms that were classified as tropical cyclones, whereby they exceeded a maximum sustained wind speed of 63 km h \u00c01 (or 33 knots) (Evan & Camargo, 2011) . For each cyclone, we calculated its accumulated cyclonic energy over its lifetime (ACE) (Bell, 2003) and summed these for each region to generate regional values of ACE. We generated kernel density estimations (plate carr ee projection, cell size 10 km and search radius of 180 km) for each of the three cyclone regions for both cyclone tracks and cyclone ACE. attached to the tarsus via 1 or 0.75 mm thick salbex (an industrial grade PVC; Sallu Plastics, Redditch, UK) rings, which including this attachment weighed 3.6 g (<1.0% of the mean adult mass: 374 g). Loggers were deployed predominantly on birds that were captured while resting (94.1%) on the island and not directly observed in a breeding attempt, that is incubating an egg (2.7%) or brooding a chick (3.2%). Geolocators were recovered between October 2010 and November 2012, either during the standard monthly petrel breeding surveys or during occasional specific searches for geolocators. All loggers underwent a 3-to 5-day calibration period at a known location prior to deployment and postdeployment this process was repeated.\nData from recovered, viable geolocators were downloaded and decompressed into light, temperature and immersion data using 'BAS Track' software provided by the British Antarctic Survey. We used light and immersion data from the loggers to determine the start and end dates of the overwinter migration period for petrels from Round Island. The last day of the petrel at Round Island was taken as the start date of the migration period and the first day back at Round Island as the end date. Locations of the petrels during their overwinter migrations were estimated using the R package 'TripEstimation' (Sumner et al., 2009; Thiebot & Pinaud, 2010) The locations of six petrels tracked during their first year at sea after fledging from Round Island in the months of December-April (Orange) and May, June, October and November (Grey)*. In (a) and (b), a progression through green, yellow and orange to red is indicative of an increasing concentration of cyclone activity and ACE. In (c) and (d), an increase in colour intensity indicates an increase in the density of petrel locations. * In the May-June cyclone season in the Northern Indian Ocean, juvenile petrels were found in the AS, and in the October-November cyclone season in the AS and BOB, but for clarity of presentation, the locations during both cyclone seasons are shown in one single (grey) kernel density map.\nJuvenile petrel distribution. In November-December 2009, we deployed 24 British Antarctic Survey MK15 leg-mounted geolocators on Round Island petrel chicks that were withi\u00f1 10 days of fledging. Tag deployment and recovery protocols followed that for adults. All chicks fledged, and by November 2015, 12 of these Geolocators had been recovered. However, only viable data were obtainable from six of these due to tag failure. Due to tag memory issues, and the resulting absence of light data and corresponding SST data, we were unable to derive locations using the method described for adults, so we adopted an alternative approach. To determine the location of these six individuals during their first year at-sea postfledging, light data were processed using a threshold method (Phillips et al., 2004) . Times of sunrise and sunset events were estimated from the light data and converted to locations using TransEdit and BirdTracker software (British Antarctic Survey). We used a threshold setting of 10, a sun elevation angle of \u00c03.0 and the compensation for movement filter. All locations within 21 days either side of the equinox periods were excluded as were all locations that occurred over land, and we removed any unrealistic locations based on flight speeds which exceeded 80 kmh. This resulted in 3441 locations encompassing the Somali basin, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Western Australian Basin. We divided these locations according to the three different cyclone seasons and generated kernel density estimations (plate carr ee projection, cell size 10 km and search radius of 180 km) for each cyclone season.\nPetrel and cyclone distribution. We mapped the kernel densities for both adult and juvenile petrels and the corresponding cyclone tracks and ACE to provide a visual representation of the exposure of petrels to cyclones in each of the three regions and three cyclone seasons. For each petrel year, we calculated ACE at a range of temporal and spatial scales where cyclones and petrels overlapped for the AS, BoB and SIO (See Table 1 for details), thereby providing a measure of cyclone activity for the areas utilized by petrels during the relevant cyclone season. In the NIO, we estimated ACE for AS and BoB in each cyclone season, and in the SIO, we estimated ACE at three scales: hemisphere scale, that is west of 115\u00b0east (the Australian coast); a regional scale focusing primarily on where petrels were located during the cyclone season, that is between 50 and 90\u00b0east; and a local scale (within 275 km of Round Island). The latter was based on data from Meteo services, Mauritius (http://metservice.intnet.mu/cyclonetrack.php), on the proximity of cyclones that affected Mauritius between 1958 and 2007 and hence could have directly affected Round Island. Because immature petrels are known to utilize the AS and BoB during both cyclone seasons, we generated an annual measure of ACE for these two regions combined. We also generated a measure of overall cyclonic activity throughout the Indian Ocean (IO) (and hence the entire area possibly covered by juvenile petrels) by summing the ACE metrics for the three cyclone seasons in the NIO and SIO. All mapping and spatial analyses were conducted using ARC MAP v10.0 (ESRI, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Petrel survival", "text": "We adopted an analytical approach based upon a series of single-state Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models and multistate models implemented in Program MARK 6.2 (White & Burnham, 1999 ). An important assumption underpinning the use of a CMR framework is that the sampling interval (i.e. recapture period) is short in comparison with the intervals between sampling periods (Lebreton et al., 1992; O'Brien et al., 2005) and hence that mortality during this occasion is low. Our sampling regime is year-round; however, Round Island petrels typically spend only 6 months of the year at Round Island (where they can be recaptured) and 6 months at sea (where they cannot be recaptured). Therefore, by their nature, they create sampling periods and corresponding intervals that are broadly equivalent. While this is not ideal, it has been demonstrated that where sampling periods are not brief in comparison with the intervals that any induced bias in survival rates are minimal when survival rates are typically high (O'Brien et al., 2005) . As petrels are typically long-lived species (>40 years for Round Island petrels -unpublished ringing data) with annual adult survival of >90% (Waugh et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2011) , it would be reasonable to assume that shortterm survival rates would be so high as not to violate this assumption for Round Island petrels. We are primarily interested in exploring the potential impact of cyclones on the survival of petrels that frequent Round Island during their adult life-history stage (in this case petrels in their second year or older, which can include both subadult and adult birds) and the juvenile (i.e. first year) lifehistory stage of petrels fledging from Round Island. We based this division on the premise that juvenile petrels would be substantially less experienced in the marine environment (and \nassociated activities such as flight and foraging) than petrels that have made it through the juvenile life-history stage, that is subadults and adults, and hence more susceptible to the impacts of environmental conditions (such as cyclones) as has been shown for other seabirds (Frederiksen et al., 2008; Sidhu et al., 2012; Horswill et al., 2014) . Hereafter, for convenience, we refer to these two life-history stages as adult(s) and juvenile(s). Given the potentially mixed origins of petrels on Round Island (see study species section for details), that is immigrants and those originating from Round Island, we recognized that a common origin of birds to examine juvenile survival was required and hence we restricted the analyses of juvenile survival to only those birds ringed as chicks on Round Island. In contrast for adults, we are interested in the survival of adults known to frequent Round Island and can therefore include both petrels that originated from Round Island and potential immigrants in any analyses, thereby maximizing the use of the data potentially available. Below, we describe the discrete analytical approaches we took to explore the impact of cyclones on firstly adult petrel survival and secondly on juvenile petrel survival.\nAdult survival. We used recaptures of 2147 adults only (i.e.\nmore than 1 year old and having completed their first postfledging migration) from the petrel monitoring programme between 1993 and 2012 (a petrel 'year' runs from 1 June to 31 May) to construct individual recapture histories. For petrels ringed as adults, the ringing event was the start of their recapture history and for those ringed as chicks their first capture occasion as an adult was the start of their recapture history. Model notation is as follows apparent survival (\u03a6), recapture probability (P), (t) time dependence and (.) constant (Lebreton et al., 1992 ). Initially, we tested the fit of our fully time-dependent global model \u03a6 (t) P (t) to the data using a goodness-of-fit test in U-CARE 2.3.2 (Choquet et al., 2009 ). Akaike's information criteria (AIC) was corrected for over-dispersion (i.e. including a variance inflation factor -see Results: goodness of fit) as QAICc (Burnham & Anderson, 2002) . We then compared a set of models with \u03a6 constrained by six measures of cyclone ACE (using the logit link) with two reference models (\u03a6 (t) P (t) and \u03a6 (.) P (t) ) using ANODEV (Grosbois et al., 2008) . Cyclone metrics tested included: SIO, SIO Region, SIO Local, NIO (May-June), AS (May-June) and SIO+NIO (May-June). The latter metric represented the geographical range of petrels during the two cyclone seasons when combined.\nJuvenile survival. Postfledging many species of seabird leave their natal colony and then embark on a period at sea, which can encompass multiple years (Croxall & Rothery, 1991; Weimerskirch, 2002) , before returning to their natal colony for the first time as subadults or adults. During this period at sea, individuals are typically unobservable and hence multistate models with an unobservable state representing this period are frequently used (Spendelow et al., 2002) when modelling survival. However, for Round Island petrels, we know that this is not strictly true because some individuals are recaptured after only 1 year at sea (64/473 fledgling petrels from Round Island) and tracking data from GLS deployed on fledglings show that they return to Round Island after only 1 year away, that is during their second year. In the light of this, an alternative modelling approach would be to use a single-state CJS model, where all adult birds, that is more than 1 year old, are assumed to have the same recapture rate. However, in our study system, this may not be the case as young birds are likely to be returning to Round Island as visitors (i.e. nonbreeders) rather than as breeding petrels and hence have lower recapture rates due to differences in behaviour and time spent at the breeding colony. One potential solution to this is to distinguish between recapture rates for young and older adults in the CJS models, but this could generate imprecise survival estimates for young adults if recapture rates are very low. No distinction between young and older adult survival rates is one solution to the latter issue.\nIn the light of the peculiarities of our study system, modelling the impacts of tropical cyclones on juvenile survival in Round island petrels are therefore not a straightforward process. To overcome these issues, and ensure that our findings were not contingent on the choice of model type, we adopted three approaches as follows:\n\u2022 We chose to ignore any potential variation in age-specific recapture probabilities of petrels 2 years and older and used a simple CJS model with a two-age class structure (juvenile and adult) in both survival and recapture rate.\n\u2022 We acknowledged there might be variation in the recapture rates between 2-year-old and older petrels and implemented a CJS model with a three-age class structure in recapture rates, that is juvenile, 2 year old and 3 year and older.\n\u2022 We removed all recapture events of petrels as 2-year-olds and using a multistate modelling framework created a 'ghost' state into which all individuals transitioned, after their first year for at least 1 year, before transitioning into an adult state following their recapture on Round Island for the first time. In effect petrels spent at least their second year in this state and their annual survival rates are assumed to be the same as those for petrels observed as adults.\nWe applied each of these approaches to the 853 petrel recapture histories. Approaches based on single-state CJS models followed the same methodology as outlined for adult survival, but incorporated age structure in both survival and recapture rates (see SI for details). We used a multistate CMR (Brownie et al., 1993) to estimate survival rates, recapture probabilities and state transition rates. Our model was based on three states: state 1 which represents the initial marking of a petrel and its juvenile period (first year); state 2 which is an unobservable 'ghost' state into which all petrels transition after the juvenile period; and state 3 where a petrel has returned to the colony and been recaptured. Multistate models can often result in numerous model parameters, many of which are in effect redundant; therefore, to avoid this, we fixed a number of parameters based on reasonable biological assumptions relevant to our study system (Spendelow et al., 2002 ) (see SI for details).\nWe used the programme U-CARE (Choquet et al., 2009 ) to assess the fit of the data to a Jolly MoVe model. We excluded the tests 3GSR and WBWA, based on the grounds that we will be running an age-structured model as made by Votier et al. (2008) . Akaike's information criteria (AIC) was corrected for any over-dispersion (i.e. including a variance inflation factor) as QAICc (Burnham & Anderson, 2002) .\nPrevious research on the Round Island petrel suggests that petrels are recaptured at Round island for the first time aged 2 years and above, with the majority returning at around 3-5 years old (Tatayah, 2010) . Age is therefore likely to be influential in the transition rates from state 2 to state 3; therefore, we explored this as the first step in our analytical framework. This was carried out sequentially increasing the maximum age at which petrels could return to Round island for the first time, hereafter known as age of first recapture (AFR) and assessing model fit based on AIC following Burnham & Anderson (2002) . Once the appropriate age structure in AFR was established, then we constrained juvenile survival by various measures of TC ACE following the approach used in the single-state CJS models."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cyclones", "text": "Between 1993 and 2012, there were 301 cyclones in the SIO, 42 in AS and 64 in BoB (see Table S1 , SI, for details).

(c) Three-age class CJS model: Grey diamonds are time-dependent estimates (model 3, Table 4a ) with error bars corresponding to 95% upper and lower confidence intervals. Black dashed line represents the estimates generated from model 1, NIO appeared to have a strong positive effect on apparent juvenile survival (slope coefficient; AE95% from model 4, Table 3a ; 0.036 [0.015 and 0.059]). However, when NIO ACE was added to a model constrained by SIO local ACE, it was no longer found to be significantly influential (model 1, Table 3a ). There is no evidence for a correlation between SIO local Ace and NIO ACE (R 2 = 0.091).\nThe relationship between SIO local and \u03a6 j appeared to be largely driven by 1 year (2001) with an NP -number of model parameters. Model notation is as follows apparent survival (\u03a6), recapture probability (P), (t) time dependence, (.) constant, juvenile (j) and adult (a). For brevity of model notation, where recapture (P) is not shown, it is modelled as P j(.) , a (t) . Model 9 is the global starting model. Cyclone metrics follow the notations from Table 1 . Models in bold include single measures of tropical cyclone metrics that were found to influence juvenile apparent survival. *When testing the effect of adding a second covariate to a model using ANODEV, the reference models are the fully time-dependent model and a model containing only the first of the two covariates listed in the model being examined.\nexceptionally high ACE metric (see Fig. 4a ), which was primarily due to the very severe tropical cyclone Dina that passed within 50 km of Round island in January 2002. The estimates generated from the model (model 2, Table 3a ) appeared not to mirror the additional background variation (44%) in survival from 1 year to the next (Fig. 4a) . This is further illustrated by constraining \u03a6 j by local ACE, but excluding 2001 from this constraint and fixing that year as a constant. Applying ANODEV to then test the influence of local ACE on \u03a6 j (excluding 2001) provided no evidence (F = 0.01, P = 0.913, R 2 < 0.01, see model 5, Table 3b ) of an influence. Therefore, to be confident that we had not overlooked the potential influence of the other spatial measures of cyclone activity in the Indian Ocean, we again constrained \u03a6 j to be a function of three (IO, SIO region and NIO annual) measures of cyclone activity in turn, for all years except 2001. In this instance the constant model in the reference set for ANODEV was a model were survival was constant across all years except 2001, which was fixed at a different constant (model 3, Table 3b ). This approach identified only NIO annual as having a significant, positive influence on juvenile survival (slope coefficient; AE95% CIs from model 1, Table 3b ; 0.021, [0.0001; 0.042]), whereby apparent juvenile survival improved with increasing ACE in the NIO (Fig. 4b) NP -number of model parameters. Model notation is as follows apparent survival (\u03a6), recapture probability (P), (t) time dependence, (.) constant, juvenile (j) and adult (a). For brevity of model notation where recapture (P) is not shown, it is modelled as P j (.) , (.) , a(t) . Cyclone metrics follow the notations from Table 1 . Models in bold include single measures of tropical cyclone metrics that were found to influence juvenile apparent survival.\n( Fig. 4c) from~0 .64 in years of low ACE to~0.79 in years of high ACE.\nMultistate model. There was no compelling evidence from any of the four GOF tests applied in U-CARE for significant overdispersion in the data and\u0109 was estimated at 1.1 (see Table S3 , SI), which we applied as a variance inflation factor in Program MARK to the multistate models. There was compelling evidence for age structure in the transition rates (hereafter known as age of first return or AFR) from the unobservable state to adult state, Table 5a , Models 5 and 7. AFR was fixed at zero for 1-year-olds to reflect their inability to return to the colony during their first year, but estimated at 0.31 (AE95% CIs: 0.24-0.391) for 2-year-olds, 0.46 (AE95% CIs: 0.346-0.584) for 3-year-olds and 0.23 (AE95% CIs: 0.134-0.347) for 4-year-olds (estimates from Model 5, Table 5a ). This implies that all petrels had returned to the breeding colony for the first time before they were 5 years old.\nCyclones in the vicinity of Round Island had a strong negative impact on the apparent survival of juvenile petrels, at both the local and the regional scale (slope coefficients; AE95% CIs for influence of SIO local ACE: Table 5a ; 0.154 [\u00c00.03 and 0.339]). The addition of SIO regional ACE or NIO ACE to a model constrained by local ACE did not improve model fit as was the case in the two/three-age class CJS models (for brevity models not shown in Table 5a ). As before, in the two-age class model, we constrained \u03a6 j to be a function of three (IO, SIO region and NIO annual) measures of cyclone activity in turn, for all years except 2001. This approach identified NIO annual as having a significant, positive influence on juvenile survival (slope coefficient; AE95% CIs from model 2, Table 5b ; 0.03, [\u00c00.01; 0.068]). Under the multistate modelling approach, apparent juvenile survival appeared on average to be higher than in the single-state models and improved with increasing ACE in the NIO (Fig. 4d) from~0.76 in years of low ACE t\u00f5 0.89 in years of high ACE. Juvenile survival was estimated at 0.38 for the 2001 cohort from models 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Table 5b . It is worth noting that the only other difference in terms of outputs between the single-state Table 5 Outputs from multistate models and ANODEV tests used to examine the impact of cyclones on annual juvenile Round Island petrel survival. (a) All years are included the analysis of juvenile survival and (b) all years except 2001 are included in the analyses of juvenile survival. NP -number of model parameters. Model notation is as follows apparent survival (\u03a6), recapture probability (P), age of first return (\u03a8), (t) time dependence, (.) constant, juvenile (j), (u) unobservable state and adult (a). For brevity of model notation: where recapture (P) is not shown, it is modelled as P j(.) P u(.) P a(t) unless otherwise specified; and where age of first return (\u03a8) is not shown, it is modelled as a function of four age classes -\u03a8 (1-4) . Cyclone metrics follow the notations from Unsurprisingly, using a two-age class or three-age class modelling approach does not change the estimates of (time-independent) juvenile survival (0.63 AE 95% CIs: 0.578-0.671) or adult survival (0.97 AE 95% CIs: 0.959-0.983). However, the multistate modelling approach, in response to excluding any recapture information on 2-year-olds, estimates a higher (time-independent) juvenile survival rate (0.75 AE 95% CIs: 0.685-0.812) and a lower adult survival rate (0.96 AE 95% CIs: 0.946-0.972). Despite this variation, our different modelling approaches all indicate that in different regions of the Indian Ocean, tropical cyclone activity has contrasting effects on juvenile petrel survival; strong tropical cyclones in close proximity to the breeding colony reduce juvenile survival while greater cyclone activity in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal improve juvenile survival. Our results also indicate, irrespective of the modelling approach, that once the negative impact of TCs on juvenile survival in 2001 was accounted for the impact of TCs at the IO scale were always positive, but not necessarily statistically significant (i.e. P < 0.05). This suggests that at an ocean-wide scale (IO) and regional scale (NIO), the overall impacts of TCs on juvenile survival are typically positive."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Using the long-term CMR data, we provide (to the best of our knowledge) the first robust estimate of annual adult survival for a tropical procellariid and only the second estimate of this important demographic parameter for a Pterodroma. Annual survival for adult Round Island petrels falls at the upper end of published estimates for procellariidae, which range from 0.78 to 0.97 (Dobson & Jouventin, 2010; Jones et al., 2011; Descamps et al., 2015) . Juvenile survival is still relatively poorly documented and ours are the first estimates for a tropical species and comparable to the few available for procellariidae (Jenouvrier et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2011) . The breeding colony and migration routes of adult and juvenile Round Island petrels encompass the three cyclone regions in the Indian Ocean and to the best of our knowledge is the only species of seabird breeding (at one single colony) in the Indian Ocean that does so. Each year Round Island petrels are therefore exposed to cyclones at different stages in their annual cycle, and this has different consequences for the survival of different life-history stages. While adult petrels are largely unaffected by cyclone activity at either the breeding colony or during migration, cyclones appeared to have a significant impact on juvenile petrels during their first year at sea. The latter finding was observed, irrespective of the analytical approach used. Each approach identified the reduced juvenile survival in the 2001 cohort associated with the high level of TC activity in the vicinity of the breeding colony and described a positive relationship between TC activity in the NIO and juvenile survival during their first year at sea. While absolute juvenile survival rates did not differ between the two single-state models, these were lower (~16%) than those estimated by the multistate model. However, this did not appear to affect our overall findings, which highlight the importance of not only identifying when and where species are exposed to environmental variation across their life history and life cycle, but also that the environmental factor needs to be considered as potentially having both a regular 'mild' impact (i.e. on a continuous scale) and a stochastic 'extreme' impact (see Jenouvrier et al., 2009a) .\nRound Island petrels are asynchronous breeders (Tatayah, 2010) ; therefore, not all fledglings and adults are exposed to cyclones in the vicinity of the colony. However, the peak period for chicks/fledglings at the colony overlaps with the cyclone season (December to April) in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 1) . Therefore, the majority of breeding adults and most fledglings are potentially exposed to cyclones in the vicinity of the breeding colony. Juvenile Round Island petrels fledge, that is leave the colony, and spend up to 2 weeks in the vicinity of the colony before dispersing into the wider Indian Ocean. During this period, they are gaining their powers of flight and initial experiences in foraging and could therefore be particularly prone to mortality due to extreme weather events, in this case cyclones. We surmise that in January 2002, the passage of the very severe cyclone 'Dina' close to the breeding colony resulted in the mortality of a significant proportion of the ringed, fledged and near-fledged petrel chicks at that time rather than another causal agent. This conclusion is supported by anecdotal information from the ringing programme, with 34% of petrel chicks ringed 2 months prior to the event (i.e. in November) recaptured later in life compared to 0.56% of those ringed in the month (December) immediately preceding the event. As a comparison between 2002 and 2006, when there were no cyclones in the vicinity of the colony, 51.8% (73/141) of petrels ringed as chicks in November and 49.4% (40/81) ringed in December each year were recaptured as adults on Round Island.\nOnce fledglings have left the south-west Indian Ocean, our tracking data, currently limited to six individuals, indicate that they typically move into the Northern Hemisphere, primarily into the extremely productive Arabian Sea (L evy et al., 2007; Piontkovski & Claereboudt, 2012) and also the Bay of Bengal (Fig. 2d) . Both of these areas are prone to cyclones during two short seasons each year and during our study period experienced a wide range of cyclone activity (NIO ACE range: 7.4-61.9), including six super cyclonic storms (Table S1 ). Published evidence suggests that given elevated levels of cyclone activity in these regions, we might have expected a decrease in juvenile petrel survival primarily through 'inland wrecks' as found in the Atlantic and Caribbean (Spendelow et al., 2002; Bugoni et al., 2007; Hass et al., 2012 ), but we found no evidence to support this. On the contrary, we found that improved juvenile survival was associated with increased levels of cyclone activity in these regions. On the assumption that our limited tracking data of petrels during their first year at sea are typically representative of the majority of juvenile petrels from Round Island -Why might this occur?\nPrimary production typically takes place when nutrient rich waters are pumped into the euphotic zone, via a variety of mechanisms (Lin et al., 2003) . One such mechanism involves strong winds causing vertical entrainment and upwelling in tropical oceans (Eppley & Renger, 1988; Marra et al., 1990) . Tropical cyclones generate extremely strong winds and have been proposed as drivers of vertical entrainment, but this has only recently been explored and the extent to which primary production can be modified by tropical cyclones quantified (Subrahmanyam et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Rao et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008) . The passage of tropical cyclones through an area of the ocean, although brief, can result in a marked cooling of SSTs (Rao et al., 2006) , large-scale upwelling (Chang et al., 2008) that result in localized increases in primary productivity (Subrahmanyam et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2008) . These temporary alterations of a largely oligotrophic environment can occur within 1-2 weeks after the passage of the cyclone (Subrahmanyam et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2008) and can lead to a < 30-fold increase in chlorophyll-a abundance (Lin et al., 2003) and an associated fourfold to ninefold increase in primary productivity (Lin et al., 2003; Rao et al., 2006) . These positive impacts of cyclones have been described in the Bay of Bengal (Rao et al., 2006) , the Arabian Sea (Subrahmanyam et al., 2002) , the Pacific Ocean (Fiedler et al., 2013) and the South China Sea (Lin et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008) , and in the latter, single cyclones have been estimated to generate up to 4% of new primary productivity and to contribute up to 20-30% of the annual regional primary productivity (Lin et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2008) . We therefore suggest that the passage of cyclones in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal is generating localized patches of higher productivity leading to improved foraging opportunities for the juvenile petrels and that in years of higher cyclone activity (as recorded by ACE) this can lead to improvements in survival.\nFor adult petrels, we found no compelling evidence for an influence of cyclones on their apparent annual survival at either the breeding colony or migration grounds. Although, for all models constrained by cyclone ACE, the influence on survival was positive but nonsignificant. Adult petrels are primarily exposed to cyclones during their time at the breeding colony (Fig. 2c) , but do not exhibit the same elevated levels of mortality associated with very severe cyclones that juveniles do. This could in part be explained in accordance with life-history theory (Roff, 1992; Stearns, 1992) , whereby experienced individuals show improved performance in reproduction and survival in comparison with relatively inexperienced individuals (Forslund & Part, 1995; Reid et al., 2003) . This has been demonstrated for both survival and reproductive success in seabirds in response to environmental variation, through improved foraging capabilities, (Nevoux et al., 2007) and it would therefore not be unreasonable to suggest that through experience adult Round Island petrels are better prepared to deal with very severe cyclones compared to recently fledged juveniles. Very severe cyclones in proximity to mainland coastlines have resulted in 'wrecking' in adults of other petrel species (Bugoni et al., 2007; Hass et al., 2012) , but there is no evidence to suggest that this occurs for adult Round Island petrels. This may in part be due to their pelagic nature whereby they remain away from mainland coastlines during the period where their migration corresponds with regional cyclone seasons, but also the relative isolation of their breeding colony from substantial land masses (as shown by Fig. 2c) . Both of these traits would therefore limit opportunities for adult petrels to be 'wrecked' by cyclones.\nUnder projected climate change scenarios, the recently observed general trends in cyclone metrics are to continue for cyclones in the NIO and SIO with; a decline in frequency, an increase in the frequency of strong cyclones and an increase in the maximum wind speeds (Gualdi et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2010) . However, there are some more subtle regional scale variations in cyclone frequencies, which could have important implications for the first year survival of Round Island petrels. In the SIO, there is a predicted general decline in cyclone frequency, but in the southwest Indian Ocean region, which includes the Mascarenes (Mauritius, Reunion & Rodrigues), a significant increase in cyclone frequency is predicted in association with changing SST and CO 2 levels .\nRegional variation is also apparent in the NIO with a predicted increase in cyclone frequency in the western north section of the Arabian Sea only and a decrease elsewhere including in the Bay of Bengal Sugi et al., 2014) . Therefore, while there is potential for an increase in the frequency of detrimental impacts associated with cyclones in the vicinity of the breeding colony (Round Island) during the SIO cyclone season, there is the intriguing potential for this to be (partially) offset by changing conditions in the Arabian Sea. Exactly, how these contrasting effects might affect Round Island petrel demography and population dynamics is unclear, because at present, our understanding of breeding success (e.g. numbers of fledglings produced) within and outside of the SIO cyclone season is limited. In addition as petrels breed at Round Island all year round, only some fledglings (or chicks close to fledgling) are potentially exposed to cyclones, at or in the vicinity of the breeding colony, while current tracking data (be it from a limited number of individuals) indicates juvenile petrels are potentially exposed to cyclones in the Arabian Sea. While the next logical step might be to explore the within-year variation in first-year survival of petrels fledging during or outside of the cyclone season, this is currently not possible due to the relatively low numbers of fledglings produced outside of the cyclone season -only 18.5% of 1178 chicks ringed between 1993 and 2012 were ringed outside of the cyclone season -and the requisite postfledging recapture period. Therefore, further long-term monitoring of annual breeding success and survival and tracking of juvenile petrels is required to understand how these two regionally contrasting impacts of cyclones might shape Round Island petrel population dynamics.\nOur study has demonstrated that cyclones can have contrasting effects on a single species raising the intriguing prospect that the projected changes in cyclones under current climate change scenarios may have positive as well as the more commonly perceived negative impacts on marine biodiversity. These positive impacts may have the potential to mitigate (in part at least) for the more commonly perceived negative impacts. However, our study also highlights the need for comprehensive data sets not only on cyclone metrics, which are readily available, but also on species demography and year-round tracking data to effectively understand this process."}, {"section_title": "Supporting Information", "text": "Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article: Table S1 .
