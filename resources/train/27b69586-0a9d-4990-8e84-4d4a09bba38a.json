[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In this study, we examined characteristics associated with experiencing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity and how persistent and transitional adult food insecurity influences toddler cognitive and motor development, along with toddler's weight and health status. Using the first 2 waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, 4 mutually exclusive variables capturing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity were created to capture those adults that experience adult food insecurity in the following: both waves, in 1 wave (at 9 or 24 mo after birth), and never experience food insecurity. We used logistic regression models to estimate characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional adult food insecurity. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to estimate how persistent and transitional adult food insecurity influences toddler development. Similar factors influenced one's likelihood of experiencing adult transitional and persistent food insecurity; individuals who experienced any food insecurity were more economically disadvantaged. Thus, outreach efforts do not need to vary by duration of food insecurity. Whereas negative effects of food insecurity on school-aged children are found in the literature, it appears toddlers are buffered from the effects of persistent adult food insecurity. Our findings suggest that toddlers residing with a temporarily food-insecure adult compared with a never food-insecure adult experienced immediate, but small, negative effects on their development. Hence, outreach and assistance may lessen immediate impacts of food insecurity on toddler development."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A sizable portion of the U.S. population experiences food insecurity, defined as the \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire food in socially acceptable ways\" (1) . In 2006, 10% of adults resided in households that experienced low or very low food security (2) . Research shows that food-insecure mothers are at greater risk for mental health problems (3) , which places their children at risk for cognitive and motor delays and emotional difficulties (4) (5) (6) . Although extensive research has been conducted on the influence of food insecurity on school-age children, research examining the influence of food insecurity on infants and toddlers is limited.\nAvailable research on the effects of food insecurity on infants and toddlers indicates that those who experience household food insecurity are at increased risk for worse health outcomes (7) (8) (9) . With 2 exceptions (10, 11) , most of these studies (3, (7) (8) (9) ) have primarily used cross-sectional data and/or non-nationally representative samples. Given this reliance on cross-sectional data, analyses examining the effects of food insecurity on infant and toddler development have focused on point-in-time measures of food insecurity and have not focused on food insecurity patterns over time. Focusing on food insecurity patterns is necessary, as food insecurity is reoccurring and usually not constant (2) and because experiencing food insecurity over time may influence infants and toddlers differently. For example, Jyoti et al. (12) studied the patterns of household food insecurity among schoolaged children (i.e. persistently food insecure, became food secure, became food insecure, food insecurity any time, and persistently food secure) and found that the patterns of food insecurity negatively influenced subsequent development. Despite these findings, however, there is a lack of research examining the influence of persistent and temporary food insecurity patterns on toddler development.\nUnlike many studies that examined food insecurity among all members of the household (e.g. 7, 12, 13) , this paper focuses on adult food insecurity measured among adults in the household. Some researchers have raised methodological concerns over the use of measuring food insecurity among all members of the household (14) , because it is unclear whether it is the adults, the survey child, other children in the household, or all members of the household who experience food insecurity. Focusing on adult food insecurity decreases the uncertainty as to who is food insecure.\nIn summary, this study used the first 2 waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) 6 to examine (1) the characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional food insecurity among adults and (2) how the patterns (i.e. persistent and temporary episodes) of adult food insecurity can influence toddler cognitive and motor development, along with toddler's weight and health status. It is hypothesized that families who experience persistent adult food insecurity are more likely to have toddlers with poor developmental outcomes than families who experience transitional adult food insecurity and families who are food secure. We contributed to the food insecurity literature by focusing on toddlers' developmental outcomes, patterns of food insecurity (unstudied for toddlers), food insecurity measured at the adult rather than the household level, and by utilizing state-level data to control for access to and participation in food assistance programs."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data set. The analyses used data from the ECLS-B, a longitudinal data set collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The baseline sample of~10,200 births who participated in the child assessments out of~14,000 selected children was designed to be nationally representative of children born in 2001, with an over-sample of Asian and American Indian children, twins, and low and very low birth weight children. The ECLS-B follows children from birth through kindergarten with data collection occurring when the child is 9 mo of age (2001), 2 y of age (2003),~4 y of age at preschool entry (2005) , and at kindergarten entry. To investigate the effects of food insecurity on infant and toddler development, the first 2 waves of survey data were used. Of the 10,200 children who participated in the first wave of the survey, 8950 participated in the second wave. Nonresponse rates for the second wave of the survey were relatively similar across maternal education, region of residence, and child's race ethnicity (15) . In the first 2 waves of the data, information was collected from children and both parents, including residential and nonresidential fathers, birth certificates, and child care providers. These data were ideal to use for our study, because data on food insecurity were collected at the household, adult, and child levels. Further, the data included a rich set of outcomes that can be examined and control variables that can be included in our models. Finally, the data were nationally representative, allowing us to make generalizations about the U.S. population of toddlers. Ethical considerations were overseen by NCES when the data were collected and individual respondents cannot be identified. The Institutional Review Board at each author's institution approved the study described in this article.\nAnalysis sample. Our analysis sample consisted of~7900 births. The reported sample sizes for the entire analysis sample and subgroups were rounded to the nearest 50 per NCES restrictions regarding disclosure of restricted use data (16). However, the analyses and statistics presented in the tables and text were generated using all observations in the appropriate sample. To create the analysis sample, births that were missing information for any of the outcomes and food insecurity variables, including those that did not participate in the second wave of data, were excluded (2200 births excluded). The majority of these births were excluded, because they did not participate in the second wave of data collection and nonresponse rates for the second wave of the survey were relatively similar across maternal education, region of residence, and child's race ethnicity (15) . In addition, births with missing information for any of the control variables were excluded with the exception of the following 3 variables: birth is mother's first, number of times per week family eats dinner together, and number of Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) agencies per 1000 poor persons (100 births excluded). Each of these variables had .100 missing values; therefore, we assigned the mean value to the missing data points for the continuous variables: the number of times per week family eats dinner together and number of WIC agencies poor 1000 poor persons. We assigned the modal value for the binary variable: birth is mother's first. All models included variables that indicated whether the observation had a value that was mean-or modereplaced. The percent of adults in the analysis sample who experienced food insecurity in the ECLS-B was 10.7, which is very close to the national rate of 10.2% in 2001 (2).\nFood insecurity. Food insecurity captures the following experiences due to financial constraints: running out of food, perceptions that food in a household is of inadequate quality or quantity, and reduced food intake by adults or children. Adult food insecurity in both waves was based on the 10 items pertaining to adults from the full 18-item scale developed by the USDA that measured both the quality and quantity of food over the past 12 mo. In each wave, calculations of the adult food insecurity status were based on methods used in a report by Bickel et al. (1) . Our analysis relied on the categorical measures of adult food insecurity in the ECLS-B, which included 3 variables that capture adult food insecurity: very low food security, low food security, or food secure. Prior to 2006, these categories were referred to as food insecure with hunger, food insecure without hunger, and food secure, respectively. Using this information, we created 1 variable indicating any adult food insecurity if the adult experienced low food security or very low food security. It is important to note that the food-secure category included adults who were marginally food secure. In a sensitivity analysis, we included these adults in the food-insecure group.\nTo examine the influence of persistent and transitional adult food insecurity on the outcomes of interest, 4 mutually exclusive dichotomous variables were created. Those who experienced food insecurity at both interviews were classified as \"persistently food insecure.\" Those experiencing transitional food insecurity comprised the next 2 groups. Those who experienced food insecurity at the 9 mo interview, but indicated no experience at the 24 mo interview, were classified as \"food insecure in wave 1 only\" and those who did not experience food insecurity at the 9 mo interview, but indicated they did at the 24 mo interview, were considered \"food insecure in wave 2 only.\" The final group, \"never food insecure,\" did not experience food insecurity in either wave.\nCognitive and motor development scores. Children's cognitive and motor development at 9 mo and 2 y after birth was measured using the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition (BSF-R) Mental Scale and Motor Skills Scale, which was designed for use in the ECLS-B (17). The BSF-R was adapted from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (18) , which is a standardized assessment of children's cognitive and physical development from birth to 42 mo of age. In this analysis, we used the scale scores. The BSF-R consists of a cognitive scale (31 items) and a motor scale (35 items). Cognitive and motor scale scores were constructed from the individual items using item response theory. The reliability of the BSF-R scale scores in the ECLS-B is high and is captured by the item response theory reliability coefficient, which is 0.80 for the cognitive scale and 0.93 for the motor scale. The BSF-R cognitive scale directly assesses children's early cognitive and language ability by examining items regarding early communication skills, expressive and receptive vocabulary, listening comprehension, and early problem-solving skills. The BSF-R motor scale measures children's fine motor skills (e.g. reaching, grasping, and manipulating small objects) and gross motor skills (e.g. sitting, standing, walking, and balance). For more information on psychometric properties regarding the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, see Andreassen and Fletcher (19, 20) .\nWeight-for-age Z-score. Children's weight was measured at 9 mo and 2 y after birth. Weight measurements were collected twice to minimize measurement error. If the 2 measures differed by .5%, a third measurement was taken. The mean of the 2 closest measurements was then calculated. We transformed the weight variables to a weight-for-age Z-score using parameters from the CDC (21) . The use of these Z-scores allowed us to compare weight relative to other toddlers in the nation. Although we examined weight-for-age Z-scores, we did not examine weight-for-length Z-scores as one of our main outcomes. This is primarily because of a data limitation.\nHealth status. Measures of the children's health status were based on mothers' self-reports at 9 mo and 2 y. Mothers reported on a 1-5 scale if the child's health in general was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. The variable was reverse coded so that higher values indicated excellent health.\nControl variables. A rich set of covariates capturing child, maternal, household, and state-level variables was included in our models (Supplemental Table 1 ). Covariates were collected at the 9-mo data collection with the exception of child age of assessment, child race, and number of times the household eats dinner together per week. Child covariates included: gender (female), age of the child in months at time of the assessment, race/ethnicity [non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other], and birth is mother's first. Reference variables are indicated in Supplemental Table 1 . It was important to control for age at the time of assessment, as there was substantial variation in the child's age of assessment and the cognitive and motor scale scores were not agenormed.\nMaternal covariates included binary variables for the following characteristics: age at birth (,20 y, 20-29 y, $30 y), education (,12th grade, high school diploma or equivalent, some college or vocational/ technical training, college graduate), US born, employment status (full time, part time, not employed), and marital status. We also included mutually exclusive dichotomous variables to capture changes in marital status (married between waves, unmarried between waves, marital status unchanged between waves), because these indicators of change are important characteristics that are likely to influence food insecurity.\nHousehold characteristics included: income (,$20,000, $20,001-40,000, $$40,001), own home, total number of individuals in the household, number of times the household eats dinner together per week, geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and size of city [city ($50,000), town (2500-49,999), rural (,2500)]. Similar to marital status, changes in income are important characteristics that are likely to influence food insecurity. Mutually exclusive dichotomous variables that capture changes in income (income increased between waves, income decreased between waves, income remained the same) were included in the model.\nState-level contextual variables were included, because prior research illustrates that state-level contextual characteristics are predictors of food insecurity (22) and may be related to the outcomes of interest, thus biasing the coefficients on the food insecurity variables. Because the ECLS-B data collection for when the child was Statistical methods. Logistic regression models are estimated to answer the first research question of what characteristics predict the likelihood of adults experiencing persistent food insecurity and transitional food insecurity. The first set of models is based on the entire analytic sample and the second set of models is estimated on toddlers living in a household at or below the poverty line. For each set of models, the following 2 comparisons are made: a comparison of persistently food-insecure families to those who were not persistently food insecure, and a comparison of persistently food-insecure families to families who experienced food insecurity temporarily. The control variables described above were included in all of these models.\nOrdinary least squares regression models were estimated to examine the association between persistent and temporary adult food insecurity and toddler outcomes measured at 24 mo after birth. The primary independent variables of interest were the adult food insecurity variables. All of the control variables described above were also included. Models included the initial score of the respective dependent variable (9 mo) as an independent variable, because this controls for a child's starting point and thus is a strong control for unobservable characteristics affecting the outcomes of interest that may also be related to food insecurity status.\nFive sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the main findings. The first model excluded the initial scores (9 mo) of the respective dependent variable. The purpose of this test was to determine whether we could generate significant results when not including the lagged dependent variable. The second model included marginally foodinsecure individuals in the food-insecure group. We were more likely to observe effects of food insecurity on outcomes using this more inclusive definition of food insecurity. The third model estimated development among toddlers residing in households with incomes #100% of the federal poverty line (poor households). The purpose of these models was to determine whether the effects of adult food insecurity are different among households that are more likely to experience food insecurity. Finally, the last 2 models estimated regressions by the gender of the child, because previous studies have found a different influence of food insecurity on boys compared with girls.\nAll results were weighted using the ECLS-B provided weight, W2C0. All regression analyses adjusted the SE, as some births were to the same mothers and were likely to be related. 7 The unit of analysis was the birth. Results were considered significant using an a of 0.05."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Descriptive statistics by adult food insecurity status demonstrated that families who experienced any food insecurity were more disadvantaged than those who never experienced food insecurity ( Table 1) . A greater proportion of non-Hispanic White children lived in households where adults were persistently food secure whereas a greater proportion of Hispanic children lived in households where transitional and persistent adult food insecurity occurred. Mothers who experienced food insecurity tended to be younger, have not completed high school, unemployed, less likely to be married, more likely to make #$20,000, more likely to experience income volatility, and less likely to own their home. Compared with food-secure families, food-insecure families lived in states where the poverty rate is greater, fewer individuals have a bachelor's degree, and the mean wage is lower. Toddlers, who lived in households where mothers experienced temporary or persistent food insecurity, had lower cognitive scores and worse health status than food-secure families.\nLogistic regression models confirmed that disadvantaged characteristics were associated with adults being persistently food insecure ( Table 2 ). Focusing on column 1, mothers were more likely to be persistently food insecure compared with not persistently food insecure if their child was older and if the mother had less than a college education and a household income of #$40,000. Mothers were less likely to be persistently food insecure if the birth was mother's first, if the mother was #29 y at the time of birth, if she owned a home, and if the state she lived in had greater access to WIC-only stores. The size of the last coefficient, however, was extremely small in magnitude. Next, the persistently food-insecure mothers were compared with the temporarily (i.e. transitional) food-insecure mothers (Column 2). Mothers who were $30 y at birth, had less than a college education, and had a household income of #$40,000 were more likely to be persistently food insecure compared with experiencing occasional food insecurity. However, the size of the coefficients were much smaller and/or less likely to be significant in this comparison then when comparing persistently food insecure to the nonpersistently food insecure. This was expected as the sample is more homogenous. In results not shown, we compared the persistently food insecure to those who became food secure and those who became food insecure separately and the results were similar. Therefore, we combined the 2 groups experiencing transitional adult food insecurity. In Columns 3 and 4, the models were reestimated on a sample of toddlers who resided in a household at or below the poverty line (i.e. $14,269 for a family of 3 in 2001) and the odds ratios tended to be smaller and/or less likely to be significant when compared with the estimates from the full analysis sample. Again, this was not surprising, because the sample was more homogeneous. We used ordinary least squares regression models to examine the association between adult food insecurity and toddler development ( Table 3) . Adults who persistently experienced food insecurity and those who experienced food insecurity at 9 mo did not significantly influence the developmental outcomes of toddlers. However, mothers who experienced food insecurity at 24 mo had toddlers who scored 1.5 points lower on cognitive assessments (1%) and 0.17 points (4%) lower on the health status scale, which translates into worse health.\nThe results from all 5 sensitivity analyses uphold our main findings, as the coefficients from these sensitivity analysis did not significantly differ from those generated from our primary model in Table 3 using a 2-tailed hypothesis test and significance level of 0.05 ( Table 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our objectives were to estimate the characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional food insecurity among adults and to examine how patterns (i.e. persistent and temporary episodes) of adult food insecurity influence toddler development. The results suggest that similar factors influenced one's likelihood of experiencing adult transitional and persistent food insecurity, with those experiencing any food insecurity being more economically disadvantaged. Although negative effects of food insecurity on school-aged children are found in the literature, it appears toddlers are buffered from the effects of persistent adult food insecurity. Findings suggest toddlers residing with a temporarily foodinsecure adult compared with a never food-insecure adult experienced immediate, but small, negative effects on their development.\nThis article contributes to the food insecurity literature in several ways. We focus on toddler development, because there is a dearth of literature focusing on the effects of food insecurity on this age group. Focusing on the developmental outcomes of 24-mo-old toddlers is important, because research has suggested that nutritional deficiencies during infancy can lead to poor brain development (23) . We attempted to gain a clearer picture of the association between adult food insecurity and child development by focusing on how the patterns (i.e. persistent and transitional episodes) of adult food insecurity influence a broad set of toddler developmental outcomes. Focusing on the patterns of adult food insecurity is important, because episodes of food insecurity tend to be reoccurring for those who experience food insecurity (2) . To study the patterns of adult food insecurity on toddler development, we classified families into 4 mutually exclusive groups according to food insecurity experiences: persistently food insecure, food insecure only at 9 mo, food insecure only at 24 mo, and never food insecure. The 4 patterns were then used to predict a broad set of toddler developmental outcomes that were self-reported by mothers and measures that were collected objectively.\nWe also shifted the focus of food insecurity measured among all household members to food insecurity among adult members to explore the characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional food insecurity among adults. The food insecurity measure accounting for all household members fails to identify who is food insecure and focusing on adult food insecurity lessens this ambiguity. Furthermore, the measure of adult food insecurity has implications for child development. Food-insecure mothers are at greater risk for depression and anxiety (3) and research has suggested that mothers with mental health problems place their children at risk for developmental difficulties (4) (5) (6) . The rich data set includes an abundance of child, mother, and household characteristics that have been found to be related to food insecurity and developmental outcomes of interest. We also include state-level variables for food assistance participation and access.\nThe analyses indicate that families who experience any food insecurity are more economically disadvantaged than families who are not persistently food insecure. Furthermore, persistently food-insecure mothers have a greater likelihood of being $30 y of age, have a lower likelihood of having a first birth, and have less human and financial capital compared with mothers who are not persistently food insecure. When comparing the characteristics of the persistently food-insecure mothers to transitional food-insecure mothers, results are similar; however, the size of the coefficients are smaller and/or less likely to be significant than those of the regression model comparing persistently food-insecure mothers to everyone else. The absence of large coefficients in the persistent vs. transitional comparison group suggest that these 2 groups are relatively similar and the big difference lies between the persistently food-insecure mothers compared with everyone else. Thus, the same characteristics effectively predict both transitional food insecurity and persistent food insecurity. The similar characteristics allow programs to target their resources to similar populations. Table 2 . An additional control variable is the dependent variable measured at 9 mo.\nTurning to how the patterns of adult food insecurity contribute to toddler development, we hypothesized that persistently foodinsecure adults would have toddlers with poor developmental outcomes compared with toddlers who lived with transitional food-insecure adults or food-secure adults. Yet our results did not indicate this. Therefore, the results suggest that toddlers are buffered from the effects of persistent food insecurity. This is in contrast to findings of previous research [e.g. Jyoti et al. (12) ] that found persistent food insecurity affected the development of school-aged children.\nInstead, our analysis suggests that toddlers who live in households where adults experience food insecurity at 2 y, but not at 9 mo, experience a small decline in cognitive development and health status. Thus, our findings suggest that when adults experience food insecurity, it has an immediate impact on toddler development. It is possible that adults who experience food insecurity have less energy to engage with their toddlers and provide stimulating activities. It may also be possible that adults who experience food insecurity are experiencing depression or anxiety, which may influence children's outcomes immediately.\nOur findings suggest that temporary food insecurity has greater negative outcomes for toddlers than persistent food insecurity, which is counterintuitive. It is possible that those who experience persistent food insecurity have developed coping strategies to address the situation. For example, they may know how to maneuver within the social service system. Hence, providing assistance and information to food-insecure families through family clinics, pediatrician offices, food banks, and early intervention programs may lessen the immediate effect of food insecurity on toddler development. When providing the assistance, it is important to include information on how food insecurity influences toddler development and maternal behaviors.\nThere are limitations to the analysis that should be noted. The food insecurity variables do not give us an indication of the timing, intensity, and duration of the food insecurity. From the survey, it is not possible to determine when in the last 12 mo adults experienced food insecurity, the length of time adults experienced food insecurity in the past 12 mo, and the severity of the experience. Similarly, the use of the food insecurity measure among adults does lessen ambiguity as to who in the household is food insecure. However, the measure still leaves questions as to which adult in the household is food insecure. Although the primary caregiver, typically the mother, answered the food insecurity questions, it is assumed that she is referring to herself, but it could be the father or some other adult in the household who experienced food insecurity. It is possible that we would have detected an effect of food insecurity on outcomes if we examined food insecurity among children and not adults. However, few children in the ECLS-B experienced food insecurity directly, thus making this analysis statistically unreliable.\nIn addition, the dependent variable of infant health status and a majority of the independent variables are based on maternal reports. In relation to investigating infant health, mothers who are themselves in poor health may not be the best judge of their infants' health. Further, in our main analyses, we used weight- for-age Z-scores, yet weight-for-length Z-scores may be a better measure of a toddler's physical development because it controls for the toddler's length. However, physical anthropometry protocols call for the measurement of recumbent length up to 2 y of age and standing height from this age onwards. In the ECLS-B, only standing height data and not recumbent length data were collected at the 2 y wave regardless of the toddler's age at the time of assessment. At the 2 y survey, variation in assessment age across children resulted in roughly one-half the assessed sample being below 24 mo. Hence, we did not examine weight-for-length Z-scores as one of our main outcomes, but we did estimate a similar model to those presented in Table 3 using this outcome. Parallel to our findings related to weight-for-age Z-scores, we found no influence of persistent or transient adult food insecurity on weight-for length Z-scores. Finally, the results could be biased if we omitted variables that are related to food insecurity and the outcomes. One important omitted variable is infant feeding practices. We estimated regressions including infant feeding practices and the primary results were unchanged. However, we did not include these variables in the main models, because they cover different time periods. Including first wave outcomes in regressions that involved second wave outcomes did help reduce the threat of unobservable characteristics, but the results could still be biased. Despite the limitations, this study contributes to the food insecurity literature by focusing on toddler developmental outcomes, the characteristics associated with the likelihood of experiencing persistent and transitional food insecurity among adults, and how patterns of adult food insecurity influence toddler development.\nLiterature Cited"}]
