[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The viral genome often contains more coding information than a co-linear relationship between nucleotide and protein sequences would suggest. This increase in coding density depends on overlapping genes, in which two different reading frames on the same strand are translated to yield two proteins (Normark et al., 1983) . Overlapping genes originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which critical nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing ancestral frame induce the expression of a de novo protein from an alternative frame (Keese and Gibbs, 1992; Rancurel et al., 2009; Sabath et al., 2012) . The de novo proteins, unlike the ancestral ones, usually lack any remote homologs in protein databases (Gibbs and Keese, 1995) .\nOverlapping genes were first detected in the genome of the bacteriophage \u03a6X174 by Barrell et al. (1976) . For many years they were thought to be limited to viruses, but experimental (Michel et al., 2012; Bergeron et al., 2013; Vanderperre et al., 2013; Fellner et al., 2015) and computational studies (Chung et al., 2007; Delaye et al., 2008; Ribrioux et al., 2008; Vanderperre et al., 2012) indicate that they also occur in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\nThus, the expression of two proteins from the same mRNA has changed the traditional view that a mature eukaryotic mRNA is a monocistronic molecule with a single translated open reading frame (ORF) (reviewed by Mouilleron et al., 2016; Brunet et al., 2018) . Interestingly, it has been found that some human cancer-specific antigens, silent in normal tissues, are translated from alternative open reading frames (AltORFs) (Wang et al., 1996 (Wang et al., , 1998 Rosenberg et al., 2002; Mandic et al., 2003; Slager et al., 2003) . These neoantigens are promising targets for the development of antitumour immunotherapies with a potentially broader coverage of patients (Smith et al., 2019) .\nResearchers have advanced two theories, not mutually exclusive, to explain the abundance of overlapping genes in viruses. The gene-compression theory claims that this feature is a strategy to maximize the information content of small genomes (Lamb and Horvath, 1991; Pavesi et al., 1997) , as a consequence of error-prone polymerases (Belshaw et al., 2007) and biophysical constraints acting on the capsid structure (Chirico et al., 2010) . The gene-novelty theory asserts that the birth of de novo proteins, often overprinting a structural or enzymatic protein, is driven by selection pressures providing the virus with a fitness advantage that lead to their fixation (Keese and Gibbs, 1992; Rancurel et al., 2009; Brandes and Linial, 2016) . Indeed, the de novo proteins originated by overprinting often play a critical role in virus infection, by neutralizing the host interferon response (van Knippenberg et al., 2010; Mc Fadden et al., 2011; Wensman et al., 2013) and the RNA interference pathway (Vargason et al., 2003; Chellappan et al., 2005; Li and Ding, 2006) , by inducing apoptosis in host cells (Noteborn et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2001 , Boehme et al., 2013 or promoting the systemic spread of virus (Taliansky et al., 2003) , A few de novo proteins can also exert functions that are not virus-specific. A well-known example is the apoptin of Chicken anemia virus, which induces cell death in a broad range of human tumour cell lines but not in normal cells (Danen-Van Oorschot et al., 1997; Backendorf et al., 2008 ; reviewed by Castro et al., 2018) . Another example is the X protein of Borna disease virus, which shows protective properties against neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo (Szelechowski et al., 2014) . To increase their therapeutic effectiveness, researchers have constructed N-terminal deleted forms or short peptides both for apoptin (Shen Ni et al., 2013; Ruiz-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) and X protein (Szelechowski et al., 2014; Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2017) .\nTo identify viral overlapping genes by sequence analysis, Firth (2014) and Sealfon et al. (2015) have developed statistical methods that detect, in a set of homologous protein-coding regions, the atypical pattern of nucleotide substitution induced by the overlap (i.e. a significantly reduced rate of synonymous substitution). Schlub et al. (2018) have recently proposed a new statistical method. It examines single gene or genome viral sequences, and can therefore be applied in many situations where the previous methods could be ineffective.\nTo provide a benchmark for systematic studies, we assembled a dataset of 80 overlapping genes 180 nt or longer from eukaryotic viruses with a genome shorter than 30 kb, whose expression is supported by reliable experimental evidence (S1 dataset from Pavesi et al., 2018) . A first analysis revealed that overlapping genes differ significantly from non-overlapping genes in their nucleotide and amino acid composition (Pavesi et al., 2018) . A further analysis, carried out on 75 pairs of homologous overlaps, revealed that half of overlapping genes undergo asymmetric evolution, as the protein encoded by one frame is significantly more variable than that encoded by the other frame (Pavesi, 2019) .\nIn the present study, I enlarged the dataset of overlapping genes by increasing the number of homologs. The dataset I assembled contains 319 viral overlapping genes, instead of 80 or 150 as in the previous studies (Pavesi et al., 2018; 2019) . I first investigated the nucleotide and amino acid composition of overlapping genes with the principal component analysis (PCA) (Hotelling, 1936) , by using as a control the entire complement of non-overlapping genes in the viral genome.\nI then analyzed the dataset with the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (reviewed by Lee et al., 2016) and the Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (Fisher, 1936) , with the aim to separate overlapping from non-overlapping genes with the best accuracy. To test which of the two theories about the abundance of gene overlap in viruses (gene-compression and gene-novelty) is the most plausible one, I also applied LDA to a subset of overlapping genes with known genealogy (which frame is ancestral and which one is de novo).\nFinally, I developed a computational algorithm that simulated the birth of new overlapping genes encoding variants of two peculiar proteins: the apoptin of Chicken anemia virus (apoptin is the de novo protein overprinting the ancestral capsid protein VP2) and the X protein of Borna disease virus (X is the de novo protein overprinting the ancestral phosphoprotein). The huge amount of new overlapping genes yielded by simulation was processed using PLS-DA and LDA, with the aim to obtain a set of protein variants whose selective anticancer activity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein) could be tested experimentally."}, {"section_title": "Search for homologous overlapping genes in the NCBI database", "text": "I first added to the dataset of 80 overlapping genes (S1 Dataset from Pavesi et al., 2018) two other overlaps experimentally proven: NS1 protein/NS2 protein of Influenza A virus (Lamb, 1980) and large T antigen/ALTO protein of Merkel cell polyomavirus (Carter et al., 2013) . I then extracted from the dataset the amino acid sequence of the two proteins encoded by each overlap. For each protein, I searched for homologs against the non-redundant protein sequences and the reference protein sequences NCBI database using BLASTP with an E cutoff of 10 -6 . (Altschul et al., 1997) . In the rare cases where BLASTP did not detect any homolog I used TBLASTN, which compared the protein query sequence against the nucleotide collection NCBI database translated in all reading frames. I used TBLASTN because the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by one of the two overlapping frames (usually the one discovered more recently) may not be reported in the NCBI database.\nOverall, I collected a total of 319 overlapping genes from 244 viral genomes (the number of genomes is lower than that of overlapping genes because some genomes contain more than one overlap). Each of them was classified as internal or terminal overlap. Internal overlap means that one gene is entirely within a second gene but in a different reading frame. Terminal overlap means that two genes overlap for part of their lengths, one upstream and one downstream. The combined overall length of overlapping genes was 163,050 nt.\nFor each viral genome, I extracted from the NCBI database the non-overlapping coding regions. They were composed of the sequences of non-overlapping genes, and, in cases where some genes partially overlap, of their non-overlapping regions. For viruses with segmented genomes, all segments were included in the calculations. Non-overlapping coding regions came from the 62 complete genomes that contain the 82 proven overlaps and from the 182 genomes that contain the respective 237 homologs (175 complete genomes and 7 partial genomes). The combined overall length of non-overlapping genes was 1,724,466 nt.

I also calculated the percent content of amino acids with high codon degeneracy (the 6fold degenerate residues L, R, and S), medium codon degeneracy (the 4-and 3-fold degenerate residues A, G, P, T, V, and I), and low codon degeneracy (the 2-and 1-fold degenerate residues C, D, E, F, H, K, N, Q, Y, M, and W).\nOverall, I compared a sample set of 319 overlapping genes with a control set of nonoverlapping genes for 102 composition features (4 from nucleotides, 16 from dinucleotides, 20 from amino acids, 59 from synonymous codons, and 3 from amino acids grouped in accordance to codon degeneracy). I used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) to detect the composition features showing a statistically significant difference between overlapping and non-overlapping genes (z-value >4.41; two-tailed P = 10 -5 ; 319 degrees of freedom).\nTo overcome the problem that the dataset of non-overlapping genes was more than 10-fold larger than that of overlapping genes (1,724,466 vs. 163,050 nt), I randomly selected nonoverlapping coding regions of the genomes that are of equal size to the overlapping set (510 nt from each genome for a total of 162,690 nt). By repeating this step 100 times, I obtained 100 resamplings of the non-overlapping set. I compared each resampling to the dataset of overlapping genes, assessing the statistical significance of the 102 composition features.

I calculated the difference between the percent content of the 37 composition features in each overlapping gene and the percent content of the same features in the respective complement of nonoverlapping genes in the viral genome. I obtained a matrix of 319 rows (the number of overlaps) and 37 columns. The matrix was subjected to PCA, by using the OriginPro software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). PCA summarized the information carried by 37 variables into 5 synthetic variables, that is the first (PC1), second (PC2), third (PC3), fourth (PC4), and fifth principal component (PC5). Using the first three PCs, I could represent the 319 overlapping genes of the dataset as a swarm of points in a three-dimensional map (see Results).\nThe search for overlapping genes with a highly atypical composition was carried out by applying to each of the five PCs the the Rosner's test for detection of multiple outliers (Rosner, 1975 ) (https://contchart.com/outliers.aspx)."}, {"section_title": "Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of overlapping and non-overlapping genes", "text": "After removing the 7 outliers detected by PCA (see Results), I compared a sample set of 312 overlapping genes with a control set of non-overlapping genes taken from 244 viral genomes. The first statistical method I used was the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (Brereton and Lloyd, 2013; Lee et al., 2016) . The input data were collected into a matrix of 556 rows (312 overlapping and 244 non-overlapping genes) and 37 columns (the critical composition features I detected). The matrix was enlarged with a \"dummy variable\" having a value of -1 for overlapping genes and +1 for non-overlapping genes (38 th column). This variable was the \"outcome\" variable on the Y-axis, while the 37 critical composition features were the \"predictor\" variables on the X-axes. PLS-DA first calculated a, the intercept on the Y-axis, and b, the regression coefficient for each X-axis. Using this linear regression function, I predicted Y and evaluated the accuracy of prediction. It was given by the number of overlapping genes with a predicted Y value below 0 added to the number of non-overlapping genes with a predicted Y value above 0. The sum was divided by the total number of observations (556) and multiplied by 100.\nThe accuracy of prediction was assessed with the validation test. The dataset was partitioned into: i) a training set composed of 75% of overlapping genes (234 out of 312) and of 75% of nonoverlapping genes (183 out of 244); ii) a validation set composed of the remaining 25% of overlapping genes (78 out of 312) and of the remaining 25% of non-overlapping genes (61 out of 244).

The aim of LDA was to obtain a combination of a number of composition features yielding the best discrimination between overlapping and nonoverlapping genes. Thus, I randomly selected a number of features ranging from 15 to 25 and I evaluated the accuracy of prediction (the percent of overlapping and non-overlapping genes correctly predicted as such) of the corresponding LDA.\nThe accuracy of prediction of each LDA was assessed with the validation test. By randomly resemplings the dataset, I obtained 100 training sets composed of 75% of overlapping and nonoverlapping genes and 100 validation sets composed of the remaining 25% of overlapping and nonoverlapping genes. LDA was carried out on each training set and the accuracy of prediction was tested on the respective validation set.

The genealogy of 24 overlaps of the dataset is known from previous phylogenetic studies (see Table 1 in Sabath et al., 2012 and Table 1 in Pavesi et al., 2013) . By extending it to the respective 87 homologs, I obtained a first set of 111 overlapping genes with a known ancestral and de novo frame.\nAnother approach to infer the genealogy of overlapping genes is the codon-usage method. It is based on the assumption that the ancestral frame, which has co-evolved with the other viral genes over a long period of time, has a distribution of synonymous codons significantly closer to that of the viral genome than the de novo frame (Pavesi et al., 2013) . Analysis of the dataset with an improved version of the method (Pavesi, 2015) predicted the genealogy of 21 additional overlaps.\nBy extending it to the respective 54 homologs, I obtained an additional set of 75 overlapping genes with a known ancestral and de novo frame.\nThe overlap polymerase/large envelope protein of Hepatitis B virus was examined separately.\nIn accordance to the genealogy inferred by codon usage and indirect experimental evidence (Pavesi, 2015; Lauber et al., 2017) , it was subdivided into two regions: i) a 5' region in which the Pre-S domain of envelope (encoded by the ancestral frame) overlaps the spacer domain of polymerase (encoded by the de novo frame); ii) a 3' region in which the reverse transcriptase domain of polymerase (encoded by the ancestral frame) overlaps the S domain of envelope (encoded by the de novo frame). Extension of genealogy to 3 homologs yielded 4 other overlapping genes with a known ancestral and de novo frame.\nThanks to phylogenetic and codon-usage methods, I could predict the genealogy for more than half (46 out of 82) of the overlapping genes in the dataset (Supplementary Table S1 )."}, {"section_title": "Computer simulation of new overlapping genes encoding variants of the apoptin from Chicken anemia virus (CAV) and of the X protein from Borna disease virus (BDV)", "text": "The algorithm I developed first operated on the overlap capsid protein VP2/apoptin from CAV (Ac. number NC_001427). The apoptin (121 aa) is encoded by the de novo frame, which is shifted of one nucleotide 3' (+1) with respect to the ancestral frame. The algorithm randomly permuted the synonymous codons of the ancestral frame (e.g. permutation was between CGC(Arg) at codon position 3 and AGA(Arg) at codon position 7). Thus, permutation did not change the codon usage of the ancestral frame (e.g. CGA, CGC, and AGA for arginine remained the preferred codons over CGT, CGG, and AGG) as well as the amino acid sequence of the encoded capsid protein VP2.\nHowever, permutation of synonyms did not affect 62 codon positions of the ancestral frame.\nThe reason is that any synonymous change at these positions (e.g. CGA instead of CGC) would always cause an amino acid substitution in a few critical regions of the apoptin, as apoptin is encoded by the +1 frame. The critical regions (see Fig. 1 in Castro et al., 2018) are the following: i) a N-terminal apoptosis-inducing domain, formed by a proline-rich segment (20 aa; residues 9-28) and a (iso)leucine-rich segment (14 aa; residues 33-46); ii) a C-terminal apoptosis-inducing domain, formed by a bi-partite nuclear localization sequence (18 aa; residues 82-88 and 111-121) and a nuclear export sequence (9 aa; residues 97-105); iii) a threonine site at position 108, whose phosphorylation in transformed cells is crucial for nuclear accumulation of apoptin (Rohn et al., 2002) .\nThus, permutation of synonyms in the ancestral frame was limited to 59 out of 121 codon positions. It generated a huge amount of new overlapping genes, half of which were discarded because of a +1 frame interrupted by termination codons. Selecting the remaining ones with the scoring rules given by PLS-DA and LDA, and using also a conservation criterion, yielded a subset of variants of the CAV apoptin (see Results).\nThe algorithm I developed then operated on the overlap phosphoprotein/X protein from BDV (Ac. number NC_001607). The first 17 aa of the X protein are encoded by a non-overlapping region, while the remaining 70 aa are encoded by a de novo frame, which is shifted of two nucleotides 3' (+2) with respect to the ancestral frame. The algorithm randomly permuted the synonymous codons of the ancestral frame, preserving both its codon usage (e.g. CAG for glutamine remained the preferred codon over CAA) and the amino acid sequence of the encoded phosphoprotein. Permutation of synonyms affected all 70 codon positions of the ancestral frame, because little is known about the presence of functionally critical regions in the X protein.\nPermutation generated a huge amount of new overlapping genes, half of them were discarded because of a +2 frame interrupted by termination codons. Selection of the remaining ones with the scoring rules given by PLS-DA and LDA, and using also a conservation criterion, yielded a subset of variants of the X protein from BDV (see Results)."}, {"section_title": "Creation of a dataset of 319 homologous overlapping genes and preliminary analyses", "text": "The search for homologs in the NCBI database led to detection of only one homolog for 30 out of 82 overlaps in the dataset.

The high standard deviation is due to a wide length distribution, ranging from 126 nt (the homolog of the overlap bel protein/bet protein of Puma feline foamy virus) and 2844 nt (p130 protein/replicase of Providence virus). The combined overall length of overlapping genes was 163,050 nt, while that of non-overlapping genes was more than 10-fold higher (1,724,466 nt).\nI collected all nucleotide and amino acid sequence data in Supplementary File S1.

Using Clustal Omega (Sievers and Higgins, 2014) , I first aligned the two proteins encoded by each overlap with the respective homologs. Whenever present, I then manually removed the protein regions with large gaps.\nConsider for example the overlap capsid protein P3/movement protein P4 of Potato leafroll virus, which encodes two proteins having a length of 156 aa. Manual inspection of the alignments of P3 and P4 with the respective 6 homologs led to removal of the largely gapped N-and Cterminal regions. Thus, the occurrence of symmetric or asymmetric evolution was tested on the central un-gapped region of 90 aa. Using the chi-square test (cutoff >3.84; P <0.05; one degree of freedom), the numbers of conserved and non-conserved amino acid positions in the alignment of P3 (38 and 52, respectively) were compared to those in the alignment of P4 (19 and 71, respectively).\nA chi-square value of 8.32 (P = 0.004) indicated that this overlap undergoes asymmetric evolution, as the number of amino acid substitutions in P4 is significantly higher than that in P3.\nChi-square test confirmed the pattern of asymmetric evolution found previously in 32 overlaps (see Table 1 in Pavesi, 2019) . Unlike the previous study, it revealed that 5 more overlapping genes evolve in accordance to the asymmetric model (Table 3) . Thus, the number of overlaps evolving asymmetrically increased from 32 to 37 (57% of the total), while that of overlaps evolving symmetrically decreased from 33 to 28 (43% of the total).

Thus, it was important to examine the genome sequences of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of the current pneumonia outbreak in the world (Zhou et al., 2020) . I analyzed the genome sequence of the isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512), which shows a nucleotide identity of 80% with human and bat SARS-Cov and of 96% with the closely related bat coronavirus RaTG13 (Ac. number MN996532). Application of the model to SARS-CoV-2 pointed out a strict conservation of the overlap nucleocapsid protein/9b protein. Indeed, the 9b protein of SARS-CoV-2 (unannotated in NC_045512, but encoded from nt 28,284 to 28,574) showed an identity of 71% with the homologs from human and bat SARS-Cov and of 93% with the homolog from bat coronavirus RaTG13 (unannotated in MN996532, but encoded from nt 28,250 to 28,543). Interestingly, the model pointed out that the overlap 3a protein/3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in bat coronavirus RATG13, but it is deeply different from that of human and bat SARS-CoV. Indeed, the 3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 (not annotated in NC_045512, but encoded from nt 25,457 to 25,579) is three-fold shorter (41 aa) than that of human and bat SARS-CoV (154 and 114 aa, respectively). In addition, it shows with them an identity of only 22.5 and 28%, respectively. Application of the model led to identification in SARS-CoV-2 of two new potential overlapping genes. They were predicted as such by both PLS-DA and LDA (see asterisks in Fig. 4 ).\nIn the first case, a +1 overlapping frame from nt 28,734 to 28955 is entirely within the region that encodes residues 155-229 of nucleocapsid protein. It encodes a hypothetical protein having a length of 73 aa (Fig. 5A ).

This frame encodes a hypothetical protein having a length of 57 aa (Fig. 5B ). Using TBLASTN, I found that this overlapping frame is a peculiar feature of SARS-CoV-2.

I calculated the percent content in amino acids, synonymous codons, and amino acids grouped in accordance to codon degeneracy in each ancestral frame and in the respective de novo frame. I used the Wilcoxon test to detect the composition features showing a statistically significant difference (z-value >4.41; two-tailed P = 10 -5 ) between ancestral and de novo frames.\nWhen applied to the first group (126 overlaps), the Wilcoxon test revealed that the +1 de novo frames differ significantly from the ancestral ones for 25 composition features.

This finding made possible a PCA based on 37 variables. It confirmed that overlapping genes follow a common pattern of sequence composition (2 outliers out of 82 overlaps) more strongly than the previous PCA based on 20 variables (5 outliers out of 80 overlaps).\nIn addition, the present dataset made possible a more accurate evaluation of the pattern of symmetric/asymmetric evolution in overlapping genes. A previous study demonstrated that half of overlapping genes (32 out of 65) evolve in accordance to the asymmetric model (Pavesi, 2019) . This analysis, however, underestimated the sequence diversity of overlapping genes, as it selected only one homolog per overlap and, moreover, with stringent criteria (an equal length in nucleotides and an alignment of the encoded proteins with virtually no gaps). The present analysis, which examined a number of homologs three-fold higher than that in the previous study (208 vs. 65), changed the trend in the direction of a prevalence of asymmetric (37 out of 65) vs. symmetric evolution (28 out of 65)."}, {"section_title": "PLS-DA and LDA are a valuable tool for detecting new potential overlapping genes", "text": "The linear regression function given by PLS-DA, accounting for 23 composition features, and the linear function given by LDA, accounting for 21 composition features, separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 95.5% and 96.8%, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3) .

A joint application of PLS-DA and LDA to 8 overlapping genes previously classified as putative (Pavesi et al., 2018) revealed that 5 of them are bona fide overlapping genes (see Results). Application of the model to a set of overlapping genes predicted in viruses by Firth (2014) and Schlub et al.

By exploring the Supek's dataset, Brunet et al. (2018) suggested that the underlying cause of pathological synonymous mutations could be an amino acid change in a \"hidden\" protein encoded by an alternative ORF in the same mRNA.

First at all, SARS-Cov-2 shows an overlap 3a protein/3b protein deeply different from the homologs from human and bat SARS-CoV. It may be that SARS-CoV-2 has lost the ability to encode a functional 3b protein. Indeed, the length of itts predicted 3b protein is about one quarter of that of human SARS-Cov, which acts as inhibitor of the host interferon response (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) .\nHowever, within the gene region that encodes 3a protein I identified a new potential overlapping gene, shifted of two nucleotide positions (Fig. 5B) . Interestingly, this overlap is a feature unique to all the human SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in NCBI to date. If the hypothesis of a non-functional 3b protein in SARS-CoV-2 is correct, this finding suggests a replacement of the +1 frame encoding 3b with a +2 frame of unknown function. A similar mechanism has been described for the overlapping gene capsid protein VP2/apoptin in some human divergent gyroviruses (see Fig. 1 in Gia Phan et al., 2013) .\nIn addition, within the gene region that encodes the nucleocapsid protein I identified a further new potential overlapping gene, shifted of one nucleotide position (Fig. 6A) . Unlike the previous case, this putative overlap is a common feature of SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV. The location of the two putative overlapping genes in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the gene region encoding the 3a and nucleocapsid proteins could be a hotspot for overprinting. A similar feature was found previously in the \"gene nursery\" of deltaretroviruses (Pavesi et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Prediction of genealogy by codon usage is helpful to infer the relative age of overlapping genes", "text": "As shown in Supplementary Table S1, I could predict the genealogy for 46 out of 82 overlapping genes in the dataset. In addition to 9 overlaps whose genealogy was inferred only by phylogeny, Table S1 reports 37 overlaps in which prediction of ancestral and de novo frame came from codonusage alone or combined with phylogeny. I would highlight two particular cases of gene overlap, as a paradigm of different evolutionary pathways.\nThe first is the overlap nucleocapsid protein/non-structural protein NSs from orthohantaviruses (6 homologs, see overlap #19 in Table S1 ). In all homologs, the codon-usage method demonstrated that the frame encoding NSs (the predicted de novo frame) has a codon bias significantly more distant to that of the viral genome than that of the frame encoding the nucleocapsid protein (P values ranging from 0.0001 to 0.005).\nThe other is the overlap envelope glycoprotein (EGP)/secreted glycoprotein (SGP) from ebolaviruses (6 homologs, see overlap#16 in Table S1 ). In 3 homologs, the codon-usage method demonstrated that the codon bias of the frame encoding SGP (the predicted de novo frame) is significantly more distant to that of the viral genome than the codon bias of the frame encoding EGP (P values ranging from 0.0001 to 0.025). In the remaining 3 homologs, the method yielded the same genealogy, but prediction was not supported significantly (P values ranging from 0.15 to 0.25). Sabath et al. (2012) found that young de novo genes have a codon usage highly different from the rest of the genome and that older de novo genes tend to have a codon usage more adapted to that of the rest of the genome. Based on this finding, I can infer that the non-structural protein NSs of orthohantaviruses is encoded by a young de novo gene and that the secreted glycoprotein (SGP) of ebolaviruses by an older de novo gene. Table S1 reports several overlaps with a codon-usage statistics similar to that found in orthohantaviruses (e.g. overlaps #6 and #24) or to that found in ebolaviruses (e.g. overlaps #9 and #44). This information should be useful for inferring the relative age of other overlapping genes."}, {"section_title": "LDA should support the gene-novelty theory about the abundance of gene overlap in viruses", "text": "The finding that the length of viral genomes is negatively correlated with the length of the overlapping genes they contain could be a clue to support the gene-compression theory. This theory explains the abundance of gene overlap in viruses as a consequence of a physical constraint on genome length by the capsid (Chirico et al., 2010) or of a high mutation rate such that occurring in RNA viruses (Belshaw et al., 2007) . As most mutations are deleterious, the high mutation rate will limit the genome size, and thus new genes must come from overprinting (Holmes, 2009 ).\nHowever, the negative correlation I found between gene overlap and genome length, albeit significant, is weak (rho = -0.31). The strong correlation reported in previous studies (Belshaw et al., 2007; Chirico et al., 2010) could be artefactual, because it was a correlation between the length of the genome and the ratio of the length of overlaps to the length of the genome. As noted previously (Pavesi et al., 2018) , using twice the same variable (the genome length) in a correlation test is statistically questionable, since the examined data are not independent.\nIn this study, LDA separated the ancestral overlapping frames from the de novo + 1 frames and from the +2 de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100% (Fig. 6 ). In detail, the de novo proteins encoded by the +1 frame are enriched in hydrophobic residues (leucine and methionine) and depleted in acidic residues (aspartic acid) (Supplementary Table S2 ). The de novo proteins encoded by the +2 frame are enriched in basic residues (arginine and histidine) and cysteine, and depleted in hydrophobic residues (leucine and methionine) (Supplementary Table S3 ).\nThese findings should support the gene-novelty theory, which states that the abundance of gene overlap in viruses is driven by selection pressures favouring the expression of new proteins with peculiar sequence properties (Rancurel et al., 2009; Brandes and Linial, 2016) .\nIn the overlaps with known genealogy, the strong prevalence of the +1 de novo on the +2 de novo frames (36 and 11 cases, respectively, see last column in Table S1 ) can be explained by mutation bias. Indeed, analysis of the control set of non-overlapping genes (1,724,466 nt) revealed that start AUG codons are more frequent in the +1 frame (1 per 30 codons) than the +2 frame (1 per 110) and that stop codons are less frequent in the +1 frame (1 per 16 codons) than the +2 frame (1 per 12 codons). These results are in full accordance with those reported by Willis and Masel (2017) . Belshaw et al. (2007) proposed that prevalence of the +1 on the +2 frameshifts should result in a preponderance of NYR and YRN triplets, respectively. Indeed, we would expect to find more stop codons (TAA, TAG, and TGA) by chance in a YRN-rich (+2 frameshifted) sequence than in a NYR-rich (+1 frameshifted) sequence. In accordance to this proposal, analysis of the control set of non-overlapping genes (1,724,466 nt), shifted of 1 nucleotide position, showed a preponderance of the NYR triplet (31%) on the YNR triplet (26%). The same analysis, with a shift of 2 nucleotide positions, showed a preponderance of the YNR triplet (21%) on the NYR triplet (15%).\nFinally, Belshaw et al. (2007) showed that in internal overlaps the +1 frameshifts are significantly more common than the +2 frameshifts (59 and 20 cases, respectively). This finding was fully confirmed by analysis of the 47 overlapping genes with known genealogy and of their homologs. Indeed, I found that the number of internal overlaps with a +1 de novo frame is almost 5fold larger than that of internal overlaps with a +2 de novo frame (98 and 20 cases, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "The new variants of apoptin and X protein are a useful benchmark for experimental studies", "text": "The selective anticancer toxicity of CAV-apoptin depends on a predominantly nuclear localization in tumor cells, whereas in normal cells it is detected mainly in cytoplasm (Danen-Van Oorschot et al., 2003) . Apoptin has a N-terminal apoptosis-inducing domain, formed by a proline-rich segment (PRS) and a leucine-rich segment (LRS), and a C-terminal apoptosis-inducing domain, formed by a bi-partite nuclear localization sequence (NLS1 and NLS2) and a nuclear export sequence (NES).\nBoth the N-and C-terminal halves of apoptin can induce cell death on their own, albeit less strongly than the full-length protein (Danen-Van Oorschot et al., 2003) . A truncated apoptin lacking residues 1-43 is a soluble, non-aggregating protein that maintains most of the properties of wildtype apoptin when transfected into human cancer cells (Rui-Martinez et al., 2017) . Two other constructs, the first formed by PRS and NLSs and the other by LRS and NLSs, can induce selective apoptosis in a breast cancer cell line and in glioma cells, respectively (Shen Ni et al. 2013; Zhang et al., 2017) .\nThe aim of these studies was to obtain deleted forms of CAV-apoptin retaining the selective anticancer activity of the full-length protein, yet with the advantage of an increased solubility (Rui-Fernandez et al., 2017) or a reduced immunogenicity (Zhang et al., 2017) . However, all efforts in this direction have been conducted so far using the wild-type apoptin of CAV. By a computer simulation of the process of overprinting, the aim of the present study is to provide new variants of CAV-apoptin. The X protein of BDV is encoded by a non-overlapping region (residues 1-17, see italic characters in Fig. 8 ) and an overlapping region (residues 18-87). The finding that its mitochondrial localization is mediated by residues 5-16 led to construction of two N-terminal manipulated mutants with an improved mitochondrial targeting and higher neuroprotective potential (Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2017) . Szelechowski et al. (2014) found that a short peptide (residues 59-87) provides a protection against neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease that is similar to the full-length X protein, yet with the advantage of a minimally invasive method of administration. The same study revealed that two other peptides (residues 1-29 and 30-59 respectively) did not exhibit any protection.\nIn addition to the scoring rules given by PLS-DA and LDA, selection of variants of the X protein of BDV was favoured by the finding that the overlap phosphoprotein/X protein undergoes strong asymmetric evolution. Indeed, the amino acid identity between the 7 homologous phosphoproteins (46 conserved residues) is three-fold greater than that between the 7 homologous X proteins (16 conserved residues).\nUsing the scoring filters given by PLS-DA and LDA and a conservation criterion, I could obtain a first set of 6 variants of the X-protein (Fig. 8 ). Using the same scoring filters, but limiting the conservation criterion to the region from residue 18 to 58, I could obtain a further set of 30 shorter variants (Supplementary File S5). Both datasets are a useful benchmark for experimental studies testing the neuroprotective potential, especially the second one due to the poorly invasive method of administration of short peptides in vivo (Szelechowski et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In the present study, a multivariate statistical analysis of a large dataset revealed new evolutionary features of viral overlapping genes. They show a common, and peculiar, pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Thanks to discriminant analysis, overlapping genes can be separated from non-overlapping genes with high accuracy. Thus, the model I developed is a valuable tool for identifying new potential dual-coding regions in the viral genome sequences deposited in databases and, possibly, also in the eukaryotic genome sequences. A preliminary application of the model to SARS-CoV-2 led to prediction of 2 putative overlaps in the 3' genome region. The finding that the proteins encoded by the de novo frames differ significantly from those encoded by the ancestral frames supports the view that overprinting is a valuable source of genetic novelties. This view is corroborated by the notion that 2 de novo proteins (apoptin from CAV and X protein from BDV) can exert functions that are not virus-specific, such as a selective anticancer toxicity in human tumour cell lines and a protection against neurodegeneration in tissue culture, respectively. The search for variants of these proteins with an enhanced therapeutic effectiveness is an intriguing field of research. The contribution provided by this study could be helpful for future experimental studies. Finally, the wide collection of processed genome sequences given in Supplementary Files can be used by others as reference datasets for subsequent evolutionary studies (e.g. the relative age of overlapping genes or the occurrence of symmetric and asymmetric evolution in different regions of the same overlap). were correctly classified as overlap (their score ranged from -53.91 to -35.36). With the same score, a high percentage (97.1%) of non-overlapping genes were correctly classified as non-overlap (their score ranged from -35.31 to 0.84). Overlap 3a protein/hypothetical protein: the nucleotide sequence (from nt 25522 to 25698) encodes the region of 3a protein spanning residues 44-102. The +2 overlapping frame (from nt 25524 to 25697) encodes a hypothetical protein (underlined characters) with a length of 57 amino acids. and in the respective +1 de novo frames (grey columns). With a discriminant score of 18.02, a high percentage (97.6%) of ancestral frames were correctly classified as ancestral (their score ranged from 18.29 to 36.29). With the same score, a high percentage (98.4%) of the +1 de novo frames were correctly classified as de novo (their score ranged from -3.96 to 17.95). (B) Histogram of the distribution of the LDA score in 68 ancestral frames (black columns) and in the respective +2 de novo frames (grey columns). With a discriminant score of -15.92, all the ancestral frames and all the +2 de novo frames were correctly classified as ancestral and de novo, respectively. Fig. 7 . Alignment of the 7 most divergent apoptins yielded by simulation (from #1 to #7) with the apoptin of Chicken anemia virus (sequence NC_001427). Italic characters indicate the N-terminal apoptosis-inducing domain (Pro-rich region from residue 9 to 28 and Ile/Leu rich region from residue 33 to 46), the C-terminal apoptosis-inducing domain (NLS1 from residue 82 to 88, NES from residue 97 to 105, and NLS2 from residue 111 to 121), and a critical threonine site (residue 108). Due their critical role, these protein regions were excluded from random permutation."}, {"section_title": "Figure legends", "text": "Underlined positions indicate the 14 conserved amino acids in the apoptins of CAV, AGV2, and Gyrovirus Tu789.
