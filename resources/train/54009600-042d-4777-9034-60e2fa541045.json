With AI, the various regions on the viral structure with antibody targets and cell presentation can be identified and used for the development of vaccine. Though in its initial stages, the developments seems interesting."}, {"section_title": "Streamlining the Research", "text": "Everyday hundreds of papers on COVID-19 appear on Internet carrying variable and valuable information. The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has come up with a unique idea of utilizing AI and machine learning (ML) for harnessing these diverse papers to discover relevant information quickly. 11 The information retrieved is useful for effective treatment and management of COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Adding intelligence to scientific meetings and medical education", "text": "Most of the organizing bodies and institutions are shifting towards virtual meetings; e-conferences and digital learning. 12 AI-powered platforms make these meetings more intelligent and interactive.

AI can personalize learning by mapping each user's individual learning plans, preferences, their weaknesses and strength."}, {"section_title": "Constraints in the current application of AI to COVID-19", "text": "Most of the AI systems are in their early stages. One of the major factors determining the efficacy of AI is data, which is still low as far as COVID-19 is concerned.\nPrivacy, medico-legal and ethical concerns stemming from AI need to be addressed at the earliest. The key challenges in developing nations includes availability, accessibility and quality of data; capacity to engage with AI; data ownership and security; governance, accountability and transparency of AI; and quackery. Formation of laws, code of ethics, code of conduct and regulatory bodies to prevent the misuse of AI can help sort out some of these issues.\nIn conclusion, during COVID-19, AI has applications in epidemiology, surveillance, case detection, disease diagnosis, identifying the structure of virus, development of vaccine and as a research assessment tool. The use of AI for our benefit during COVID-19 implies that it is a tool, which can be utilized for common good.\nOvercoming the constraints is a laborious job and will require a balance between privacy and health concerns."}, {"section_title": "References:", "text": "This article is protected by copyright.
