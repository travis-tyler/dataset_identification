Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the primary cause of neurodegenerative dementia [2] .\nTo date, scientists have concentrated on untangling the complex brain changes involved in the onset and progression of AD. However, this pathology is correlated to cognitive impairment, behavioral disturbance, and functional disabilities, which greatly have an impact on the quality of daily life, and is major problem for families, caregivers, and healthcare institutions. It is thus crucial to detect such changes early and to identify the level and the type of impairment in the patients. This could facilitate the provision of optimal support as soon as possible, in order to maintain their quality of life for as long as possible. In addition, early detection enables the disease to be monitored from its initial stage of disability, possibly administering available treatments when loss of functions is not yet advanced.\nNeuropsychological assessment plays a crucial role in detecting loss of cognitive functions and change in behavioral and functional state from normal conditions. Specifically, neuropsychological tests can detect dysfunctions in human \"cognitive domains\" as a consequence of dysfunctions in different neural networks and subnetworks caused by AD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [3] . DSM-5 defined six key domains of cognitive function, namely, complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor function, and social cognition, and each of these has subdomains. Identifying the domains and subdomains affected in a patient helps in establishing the aetiology and severity of the neurocognitive disorder. Neuropsychological tests can measure different cognitive domains (e.g., language, learning, and memory) and subdomains (e.g., long-term memory and 2 Behavioural Neurology recognition memory) [4] . However, despite the promising results from several different tests, identifying the best ones, as well as the best combination of tests to be used to classify and diagnose AD, is still a matter of debate, and a large amount of subjectivity continues to exist in the diagnostic process [5, 6] . In fact, even the DSM-5 does not name any proprietary tests. In addition, whether specific tasks are better for detecting impairment than others is still unclear [7] . A long list of neuropsychological tests is thus still considered appropriate and subjects are addressed to intensive testing. Optimizing or even reducing the amount of neuropsychological tests used to classify AD patients, also at an early stage of impairment, may be possible with no additional performance costs, thus reducing the time intensity and cognitive stress of the assessment.\nMachine learning (ML) is an advanced computational technique that can be used for automatic classification of subjects with diagnostic purpose. Specifically, methods based on ML are able to learn the relationship between input and response variables of two given classes of subjects (e.g., normal and pathological subjects) and to use the learned model to predict the response variable of a new (independent) subject. ML was first adopted in medicine because of its ability to deal with large and complex datasets [8] .\nSophisticated ML methods have been applied in the field of dementia in order to obtain a high level of accuracy in the automatic classification of subject impairment [9] . However, such methods have been extensively used with neuroimaging studies on dementia (e.g., [10] ) and there have been few explicit attempts to use ML to assess cognitive, behavioral, and functional measures.\nIn 2015, Weakley et al. [11] used ML and a combination of twenty-seven measures from a cohort of 272 subjects including cognitive, behavioral, and functional abilities obtained from different neuropsychological tests (e.g., visual and verbal memory and language category fluency) to automatically classify groups of patients with different clinical dementia ratings (CDR), namely, CDR = 0, CDR = 0.5, and CDR = 1+ (i.e., 1 and 2). The CDR Scale is a five-point semistructured interview between the patient and a reliable informant (e.g., caregivers) designed to stage the severity of dementia considering the state of the subject with respect to memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care [12] . Weakley et al. [11] envisaged the potential of ML with respect to traditional statistical approaches in fully automating the diagnostic process by reducing time-consuming and subjective manual analyses and producing reliable information on the relationship between input (measures of cognitive, behavioral, and functional abilities) and response variables (CDR score) without the need of defining assumptions on data [13] . The authors used ML (with respect to manual classification) to explore many measure configurations (i.e., many combinations of measures), which was impossible to analyze manually. The ML classifier selected a maximum of six measures able to predict the CDR score (an accuracy of 98%, 82%, and 94% was obtained when classifying CDR = 1+ versus CDR = 0, CDR = 0.5 versus CDR = 0, and CDR = 1 versus CDR = 0.5, resp.). The results showed that ML was a stable and robust predictive model for a number of approximately 200 participants.\nA similar approach was already reported by another study in the literature [14] , in which ML was applied to only seven cognitive and behavioral attributes from a database of 765 subjects (together with their educational level and the clinical estimation of the patient insight) to predict CDR scores (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3). However, these attributes were selected by the authors and leaded to poor classification accuracy for the mildly demented severity class (59%).\nGiven the results obtained by the two above-mentioned studies, it would be interesting to consider the use of more subdomains for the automatic classification, since it could lead to an improvement in the predictive model and classification performance.\nIn this work, our aim was to assess the potential of automatic classification in optimizing or even reducing the amount of neuropsychological measures to predict cognitive, behavioral, and functional impairment of subjects with AD, even at an early stage. We investigated the role of twelve state-of-the-art neuropsychological tests in the automatic classification of subjects with none, mild, or severe impairment as measured by CDR. Data were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). In the groups of measures used as classification features, we included measures of both cognitive domains (language, executive function, memory and learning, and complex attention) and subdomains (perceptual-motor coordination, working memory, and visuoconstructional reasoning). We also included measures of depression and loss of awareness, more specifically, orientation. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the computation, we used the following two approaches: (1) an automated classification following a computational feature reduction method and (2) an automated classification following a feature reduction guided by neuropsychologists."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants.", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

The CDR total score came from the subscores of measures on memory, orientation, capacity of judgment/problem solving, social and business activities, capacity to make home-life/intellectual activities/hobbies, Behavioural Neurology 3 and personal care. In our work, the CDR score served as a gold standard to classify each participant into one of the following three categories: absence of impairment with CDR = 0, mild impairment with CDR = 0.5, and severe impairment with CDR = 1.

In order to test all subsets, this procedure is then repeated 10 times.\nSpecifically, for each of the 10 rounds of the nested CV, all possible combinations of the reduced features (scores and subscores) were tested, for the two approaches described in Section 2.4. For each of the 10 rounds of the outer loop, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated, and results were averaged across all rounds.\nIn order to avoid problems arising from the use of classimbalanced datasets, which could lead to the classifier being trained more on one class than the other (in a binaryclassification framework), the number of subjects in the two classes was kept balanced in both the training and validation sets.\nWe also evaluated the classification performance using two specific metrics for imbalanced-domain problems, namely, the GM of the true rates and the Dominance [23, 24] .

In CDR = 0.5 versus CDR = 0, both approaches found the following features as best predictors: LDELTOTAL, Q4, LIMMTOTAL, TOTALMOD, MMSCORE, CATVEGESC, and TOTAL11. Many studies on MCI patients have found an impairment in long-term memory function [28, 29] . The measures that best predict the conversion to AD range from immediate and delayed words recall [30] to verbal fluency. The number of different vegetable names produced is a fluency task that provides measures of language and executive processes, including self-initiated activity, categorization, and mental flexibility that are often involved in MCI patients (e.g., [31, 32] ). GDHOPE, MMD, and AVTOT4 were found among the best predictors when using the computationbased feature reduction, but not when using the feature reduction guided by the neuropsychologists, because they were excluded from the list of input features by these neuropsychologists. These measures were excluded because AVTOT4 overlaps with Q1 (Word Recall Task, ADAS), while the other two measures were considered by the neuropsychologists not highly significant in the MCI literature and were not used to further our understanding of cognitive impairment. FAQTOTAL, Q8, and Q1 were found among the best predictors when the feature reduction was based on neuropsychological expertise but not when using the computation-feature reduction, because they were not among the 5% of features with the highest FDR retained for classification. This result is in line with the current literature, since Q1 and Q8 are both measures of long-term memory, and FAQ total has been recently reported as an important feature of MCI [33] .\nIn CDR = 1 versus CDR = 0.5, both approaches found the following features among the best predictors: FAQTOTAL, TOTALMOD, Q1, TOTAL11, CLOCKSCOR, CATVEGESC, and Q8. Most of these features provide information on episodic memory (Q1 and Q8), global cognitive status (the global scores of ADAS and CLOCKSCOR), and language/executive functions (CATVEGESC). Given the primacy of memory in age-related cognitive impairment [34] , ML algorithms highlighted measures of episodic memory (recalling information learned previously) as well as recognition memory (a nonverbal task that requires the recognition of the words learned in a longer list of words presented with distracter words). AVTOT5, FAQFORM, and FAQREM were found among best predictors when using the computationbased feature reduction, but they were excluded from the list of input features by the two neuropsychologists. The reason for the exclusion was related to the overlap of AVTOT5 with Q1 (Word Recall Task, ADAS), while the other two measures were considered by the neuropsychologists not highly significant in the MCI/AD literature. LDELCUE, Q4, and LDELTOTAL were found among best predictors when the neuropsychologists guided the feature reduction but not when using the automatic feature reduction because not among the 5% features with the highest FDR retained for the classification. Consistently with the literature, many studies [34] [35] [36] have shown anterograde episodic memory as the best marker to predict the conversion to AD in subjects with MCI."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The ability of neuropsychological measures to help in discriminating between different degrees of cognitive impairment has been widely recognized (e.g., [37, 38] ). Despite the existence of clinical measures that are used to classify patients and diagnose clinical disorders showing cognitive impairment, as AD, a large amount of subjectivity affects the diagnostic process. Machine learning is emerging in clinical neuropsychology and neurology as a credible technique to support this process in a quantitative way.\nOur work explored the contribution of cognitive, behavioral, and functional measures in the automatic classification of different stages of cognitive impairment using ML. Both total and partial scores as measures of cognitive domains and subdomains from a group of different neuropsychological tests available from the ADNI database were considered as potential predictors of cognitive impairment, even at an early stage.\nOur results showed that, among 131 measures considered, it is possible to use a subset of measures in which the classification accuracy is higher than 90% for severe (CDR = 1) versus no impairment (CDR = 0) and higher than 85% for mild (CDR = 0.5) versus no impairment (CDR = 0). Our performances for these two comparisons are similar to those obtained by Logie et al. [6] . These findings could have an impact on the clinical process to perform early diagnosis, with different benefits for patients. However, although we did not include CDR = 2 in the group of patients with severe impairment as Weakley et al. did, accuracy of our classification for patients with CDR = 0.5 versus CDR = 1 was found limited (65-69%) suggesting that our work is in progress and needs improvements. The automatic diagnosis of AD is not challenging and we would expect that ML, by using many features, would be able to predict mild impairment better than subjective techniques. Our model should be modified for this specific comparison in order to achieve best accuracy.\nFrom a methodological point of view, we used a lower number of features than the smallest number of subjects in each group (55 subjects with CDR = 1). This warrants that no curse-of-dimensionality problems occurred. In addition, the feature reduction strategies adopted in our study reduced the number of features used as inputs for the classifier to (at most) 10 (using the feature reduction guided by the neuropsychologists). This number is much lower than the number of subjects in the smallest group, thus avoiding overfitting problems, especially considering the use of SVMs, which are designed to handle high-dimensional data.\nConcerning the final cognitive profile, when comparing the fully automated classification to the classification guided by the neuropsychologists, a good overlap of results between the two classifications was found. Some tests were found more frequently among best predictors for the automatic classification, namely, LM, ADAS-Cog, AVLT, and FAQ, with a major role of ADAS-Cog measures of delayed and immediate memory and the FAQ measure of financial competency.\nThere are some measures known to be highly implicated in AD that this model fails to identify. There are some tests that are specifically recommended, that is, the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), which is considered as a valid clinical marker for AD [39] . This test was not included in our model since it was not available in the ADNI dataset. These tests provide specific episodic memory measures that correlate with the hippocampal dysfunction, suggesting that a poor performance is typically registered in AD patients [40] .\nIn the field of neurodegenerative diseases, several other studies have applied ML for the identification of subsets of \"optimal\" classification predictors (e.g., [41, 42] ), resulting in a subset of optimal measures, in particular measures of decline in episodic memory. A similar approach has been used for the evaluation of linguistic features within a language test for patients with AD [43] [44] [45] [46] . They show the potential of ML in determining the best predictors for language impairment in these patients. Some other studies have investigated this contribution in the classification of AD.\nPromising results on similar approaches have been also published in the field of psychiatric disorders. An interesting study by Costafreda et al. [47] showed that pattern recognition algorithms coupled with verbal fluency have a reliable diagnostic power in differentiating schizophrenic patients from healthy controls and patients affected by bipolar disorders. Pina-Camacho et al. [48] used SVM to study predictors of schizophrenia in early-onset first episodes of psychosis. They found that, among the variables included, neuropsychological measures (impaired attention, motor coordination, and global cognition) showed the highest predictive value for a diagnostic outcome of the disease. A study on autism spectrum disorder [49] showed that cognitive measures could be a useful aid to the diagnostic process when assessed by an SVM classifier. However, limitations of these studies were related to the use of cognitive, behavioral, and functional measures during the diagnostic classification of subjects used as a gold standard of analysis, thus inducing overfitting (e.g., [50] [51] [52] ). In our study, gold standard measures (CDR in our case) were independent from measures used as features. This excluded any potential bias due to circularity in the classification process.\nOverall, the results of our work show that ML provides an effective technique to quantify the process to classify patients and to diagnose clinical disorders by using neuropsychological measures. Combined with multicenter databases that collect information from a substantial number of patients (as the ADNI database used in our work), ML was proven to be suitable to conduct statistically meaningful machine learning calculations and to assist clinicians in the optimization of the best measures (and submeasures) to be used, reducing at the same time the subjectivity of the process. For example, we have shown how ML can support the selection of important subscores for the classification of subjects. This could be useful in the optimization of current neuropsychological tests or in the design of new tests for next-generation cognitive assessment.\nNotably, cognitive measures found in our works cannot be considered sufficient to perform a neuropsychological classification of patients and we cannot conclude that they are the best predictors from a cognitive perspective, for many reasons. For computation reasons, we have adopted two different strategies to reduce the number of features as input to classification; both strategies have limited the measures used by the machine learning to select the optimal predictors. Furthermore, other measures not included in the considered studies could be behavioral data providing a thorough description of the disease (e.g., loss of empathy, disinhibition, and apathy). These measures could improve the model. In addition, our findings need to be verified in other independent databases and by using other machine learning algorithms, thus proving the generality of our results.\nIn conclusion, ML approaches can be a useful tool for clinical neuropsychologists especially when they need to deal with a huge amount of data and the level of subjectivity of the process must be reduced. Given that a higher level of accuracy in classification still needs to be achieved and that some questions remain unanswered, further validations and verifications are needed in future research. However, we believe that this study represents a step towards achieving the goal of automatic classification of AD patients by means of clinical neuropsychological assessment."}]
