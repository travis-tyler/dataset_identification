[{"section_title": "", "text": "High school graduates whose parents have low levels of income and education are able to attend four-year colleges at the same rates as students from middle-income families, if they do what four-year colleges expect them to do. That is, if low-income students have an academic record and aptitude test scores which demonstrate even the minimal qualifications for admission to a four-year institution, if they take a college entrance examination, and if they submit an application for admission, the majority of lowincome students enroll in postsecondary education, and over 83 percent attend a fouryear college or university. College-qualified low-income students who have been accepted for admission to public four-year colleges and universities and those who have been accepted to private four-year colleges and universities are just as likely to enroll in them as are middleand high-income students. There is no measurable difference by family income in the proportion of those accepted at private institutions who choose to enroll in a public four-year institution instead. There are also no differences in the enrollment rates of iii 5 HIGHLIGHTS those college-qualified blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or whites who have been accepted for admission to either public or private four-year colleges and universities. Low-income, black, and Hispanic high school graduates are less likely to be well prepared academically to attend a four-year college. Even among those who are collegequalified, low-income and Hispanic (but not black) students are less likely to take the college entrance examinations and apply for admission to a four-year institution. Among all college-qualified seniors who enrolled in postsecondary education, Hispanics were less likely than any other racialethnic group to attend a four-year institution. Instead, college-qualified Hispanics were more likely than any other racialethnic group to attend a public two-year institution. College-qualified Hispanics were also less likely to take college entrance examinations and submit an application for admission to a four-year institution compared with Asian, white, and black college-qualified students. Three-quarters of all 1992 high school graduates enrolled in some type of postsecondary institution by 1994. Almost half (45 percent) enrolled in a four-year institution, one-quarter (26 percent) enrolled in a public two-year college, and 4 percent enrolled in other institutions offering less than four-year programs. The proportion of all students who enrolled in postsecondary education within two years of high school graduation was directly related to family income: 64 percent of low-income, 79 percent of middle-income, and 93 percent of high-income students attended postsecondary education by 1994. About 80 percent of the low-income high school graduates who enrolled in postsecondary institutions received financial aid. Their average educational expenses after financial aid ranged from about $4,900 at public two-and four-year institutions to $5,700 at private, not-for-profit, four-year institutions. To help meet these costs, twothirds of the low-income students worked while enrolled, for an average of 24 hours a week. When the 1992 high school graduates were in the eighth grade, 59 percent of lowincome, 76 percent of middle-income, and 92 percent of high-income students said that they expected to finish college. There was no substantial change in these expectations by family income or raceethnicity when they were seniors in 1992. Nearly 80 percent of the 1992 high school graduates said that they expected to attend postsecondary education immediately after high school. In October 1992, 65 percent were actually enrolled. By 1994, 75 percent had been enrolled. Among those students who had planned to attend immediately after high school, 89 percent had enrolled by 1994."}, {"section_title": "iv FOREWORD", "text": "This report examines the postsecondary enrollment patterns of 1992 high school graduates by 1994, two years after they graduated from high school. Specifically, it focuses on the access of low-income students and racialethnic minorities to postsecondary education and the degree to which the access of students with the academic qualifications to attend a four-year institution is limited by financial constraints. The analysis relies primarily on data from the second and third follow-up files of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), which began with a nationally representative sample of 1988 eighth graders who were followed up in 1990, 1992, and again in 1994. (A more complete description of the NELS:88 sample can be found in Appendix B of this report.) This was supplemented with information on college costs and financial aid for a comparable group of students in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 1992-93 (NPSAS:93). The NELS:88 surveys contain extensive information on student and parent attitudes about college costs and financial aid, educational expectations, plans for postsecondary education, the types of institutions to which they applied, and where they enrolled. In addition to information about family income, parental levels of education, and racialethnic background, the surveys contain many indicators of academic aptitude, achievement, and coursework in high school. This makes it possible to study differences in postsecondary enrollment patterns from a variety of perspectives. The estimates presented in this report were produced using the NELS:88/94 and NPSAS:93 Data Analysis Systems (DAS). The DAS is a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables from the NELS and NPSAS data. The DAS produces design-adjusted standard errors necessary for statistical testing of differences shown in the tables.

In this report, students were considered \"low income\" if the income reported by their parents was less than $25,000; \"middle income\" if it was at least $25,000 and under $75,000; and \"high income\" if it was $75,000 or more. Using this definition, about one-quarter (28 percent) of the 1992 high school graduates came from lowincome families, somewhat more than half (57 percent) from middle-income families, and 15 percent from high-income families. Table 1 also illustrates that family income was directly related to the parents' highest education level: half (51 percent) of the families in which both parents had no more than a high school education also had incomes below $25,000, compared to 29 percent of families in which a parent had taken some college courses and 8 percent in which a parent was a college graduate. One-third (35 percent) of the families in which a parent held at least a bachelor's degree had incomes of $75,000 or more, compared to 6 percent or less of those in which no parent had completed four-year college. Nearly three-fourths (73 percent) of all the 1992 high school graduates were white, 11 percent were black, 10 percent were Hispanic, 5 percent were Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 1 percent were American Indian/Alaskan Native.3 More than half of the black and Hispanic students came from low-income families, compared to one-third of the Asian students and one-fifth of the white students. Although the income distribution of black and Hispanic families was similar, the 2C. Manski and D. Wise, College Choice in America (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1983), remains a basic source. For a survey of the more recent literature, see T. Baker and W. Velez, \"Access to and Opportunity in Postsecondary Education in the United States: A Review,\" Sociology of Education, extra issue (1996): 82-101. Many studies use SES instead of income and education; both are factored into the derivation of SES. Since this study focuses on college costs and financial aid, it was more appropriate to use income as a separate variable. 3U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, National Educational Longitudinal Study: 1988-1994, Data Analysis System. Because of the small sample size, American Indians were not included as a separate category of analysis in this study. Since Hispanics can be of any race, when the terms \"white\" and \"black\" are used in the text they should always be assumed to include the qualifier \"not of Hispanic origin.\" Similarly, the term \"Asian\" should always be assumed to include Pacific Islanders. These qualifiers are always indicated in the tables, but their repeated inclusion in the text would have made the report awkward and difficult to read. parental education levels of Hispanics were lower than those of black students: nearly half (46 percent) of the Hispanic students came from families in which the parents had a high school education or less compared with 35 percent of black students.4 Unlike black and Hispanic students, Asians were as likely as white students to come from high-income families, but their parents had achieved higher levels of education than whites. In fact, nearly half (49 percent) of the Asian students came from families in which a parent was a college graduate,5 compared with about onethird (36 percent) of the white students. When comparing the students from minority backgrounds then, these broad differences in family income and educational levels should be kept in 4The parents of Hispanic high school graduates were also the most likely not to have finished high school (29 percent compared with 11 percent of Asian, 12 percent of black, and 4 percent of white students).

Access is measured by comparing the postsecondary enrollment rates of groups of students with different background characteristics, with the implicit assumption that groups of students who show similar rates of enrollment in similar types of institutions have had similar access to them. The specific focus is on how differences in family income, parental education, and students' race ethnicity are reflected in (1) enrollment in postsecondary education within two years of high school graduation; (2) the type of institution attended; (3) academic preparedness for admission to a four-year college; (4) taking the necessary steps toward admission to a four-year college; and (5) obtaining information about financial aid. A central issue is to what extent concerns about college costs and inadequate information about financial aid may deter low-income students from applying to four-year colleges and universities. Supplemental data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) is also used to examine the college costs and financial aid reported for a comparable group of students who were enrolled in postsecondary education in 1992-93. The descriptive reports of the second and third NELS:88 follow-up surveys have shown that black and Hispanic students and students with low socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to take college preparatory courses, to apply to colleges and take college entrance exams, and to enroll in four-year institutions than are other students. Most of the differences in postsecondary enrollment by raceethnicity and SES disappear among those students who were in the highest quartile on the aptitude test administered in the NELS survey.' This report will expand these previous analyses, with a particular focus on those 1992 high school graduates who may be considered \"college qualified\" because they have adequate academic course preparation, grades, and aptitude test scores to meet the minimal entrance requirements of most four-year colleges. In addition, this report examines those students who had the initiative to take a college entrance exam and submit an application for admission to a four-year I U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, A Profile of the American High School Senior in 1992 (Washington, D.C.: 1995); and U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, National Educational Longitudinal Study: 1988-1994, Descriptive Summary Report (Washington, D.C.: 1996.\ninstitution. If the financial aid system is providing equal educational opportunities and access to postsecondary schooling, one would expect no substantial differences by family income in the four-year college enrollment rates of students whose academic records show they are likely to be admitted to a four-year college and who have taken the necessary steps to be considered for admission. The findings of this study indicate that this is indeed generally the case: there were no substantial differences by family income in the four-year college enrollment rates of collegequalified high school graduates who apply to and are accepted for admission at four-year colleges. The report begins by examining some of the important background characteristics of the 1992 high school graduates and their relationship to postsecondary enrollment and the types of institutions attended within two years of high school graduation. This is followed by an examination of postsecondary costs and financial aid among low-income students enrolled in 1992-93. Next is a comparison of the educational expectations of the high school graduates when they were in eighth grade to their expectations in the senior year, as well as their plans for postsecondary education as seniors. The college qualification index developed for this study will then be discussed, and used to focus on those students who appear to have been qualified for four-year college work. The focus then narrows to those among the college-qualified who take the college entrance examinations and apply to four-year colleges. Then the enrollment patterns of those who were accepted for admission to four-year colleges will be examined, including their choice of private and public institutions. This is followed by an examination of the relationship between taking the steps toward admission to a four-year college, concerns about affordability, and information acquired about financial aid. Finally, a multivariate analysis of two-year and four-year college enrollment rates is presented. The conclusion includes a series of tables (tables 35-37) that provide a summary and overview of the information presented in more detail in the text."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "0", "text": "The postsecondary attendance patterns of the 1992 high school graduates by 1994 are displayed in table 2. One-quarter did not enroll in any postsecondary institution (25 percent), onequarter enrolled in two-year public community colleges (26 percent), almost half enrolled in four-year colleges and universities (45 percent), and a small percentage enrolled in other institutions offering less than four-year programs (4 percent).6 The proportion of students who enrolled in postsecondary education within two years of high school graduation was related to both family income and parental education. More than 40 percent of the students whose parents had not gone beyond high school and 37 percent of those from low-income families did not enter postsecondary education. Among black and Hispanic students, the majority of whom came from low-income families, almost 30 percent did not pursue postsecondary education. Hispanics were more likely not to enter postsecondary education than either whites (24 percent) or Asians (14 percent); the difference between blacks and whites was not statistically significant. Among high-income students and those whose parents had a college degree, about 7 percent had not entered postsecondary education within two years of graduating from high school. The proportions of low-and middle-income students attending two-year public colleges were similar (25 to 28 percent), but high-income students were less likely to attend this type of institution (14 percent). The two-year public college enrollment rates of students whose parents had less than a four-year college degree were also similar (27 to 30 percent), while students who had a parent with a four-year college degree were less likely to enroll in two-year public institutions. One third of Hispanics (34 percent) attended two-year public colleges, compared to about one-quarter of whites (25 percent) and blacks (23 percent) (figure 2).7 6Private, for-profit vocational institutions 3.1 percent; private, not-for-profit 2-year institutions 1.0 percent; and public less-than-2-year institutions 0.2 percent.

Unlike the community college enrollment pattern,8 enrollment rates in four-year colleges and universities were directly related to students' family income and the level of their parents' education. The proportion of students enrolled in four-year institutions increased at every income level, with one-third of low-income students (33 percent), almost half of middle-income students (47 percent), and about three-fourths of high-income students (77 percent) attending such institutions. Similarly, the proportions of students enrolled in four-year institutions increased with the level of their parents' education. Four-year college enrollments represented 54 percent of Asian, 47 percent of white, 42 percent of black, and 31 percent of Hispanic high school graduates."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "(figure 2). 8The terms \"two-year public institution\" and \"community college\" are used interchangeably in this report."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Figure 2Percentage of all 1992 high school graduates who enrolled in postsecondary education by 1994 according to type of institution attended, by family income and raceethnicity 100 "}, {"section_title": "FINANCIAL AID AND COLLEGE COSTS", "text": "The distinct differences in enrollment patterns by family income are consistent with a common perception that high costs deter low-income students from attending postsecondary education at all, and if they do attend, deter them from enrolling in four-year institutions where the tuition is higher. This section of the report will provide a brief examination of college costs in 1992-93 and the financial aid received by low-income students to help them meet those costs. The NELS:88 high school graduates who attended postsecondary education were asked whether they received financial aid, and if they received aid, to report the type of aid and the estimated total dollar amount. The responses of the low-income students are shown in table 3. The majority of low-income students reported receiving financial aid, with 66 percent of those at public two-year institutions, 90 percent at public four-year institutions, and 96 percent at private, not-for-profit,9 four-year institutions reporting that they received aid. The average dollar amount of aid that was reported ranged from about $1,700 at public two-year to about $8,400 at private four-year institutions. While 10 percent of the low-income students at public two-year colleges reported having taken out student loans, over half at public four-year institutions had such loans and three-quarters at private four-year institutions had loans. Half the low-income students at private four-year institutions reported holding work-study jobs while enrolled.10 The amount of detail about college costs and financial aid collected in the NELS:88 interviews is limited and is based only on student-reported information. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), which is based primarily on financial aid transcripts from the institutions, provides a more complete picture of the educational finances of a comparable group of low-income high school seniors who started postsecondary education in 1992-93. Table 4 shows the types and total amount of financial aid received in 1992-93 by low-income first-year 9Although there are private, for-profit, four-year institutions, none of the NELS:88 high school graduates had enrolled in one by 1994. Henceforth the term \"private\" institution should be assumed to include only not-for-profit institutions. I\u00b0Private four-year institutions are able to provide a larger proportion of students with Federal College Work-Study jobs because the funds in this program are allocated to institutions according to a formula. However, institutions receive a guaranteed base amount which reflects participation in the program in the early 1970s. 9 2  dependent students who graduated from high school in 1992 as reported in NPSAS:93. The percentage of low-income students receiving financial aid at public two-year (64 percent) and private four-year institutions (93 percent) is similar to that reported by the students in the NELS:88 survey, but is slightly lower at public four-year institutions (84 percent). The average dollar amounts of total aid reported by the public two-year and public four-year institutions for students in NPSAS:93 were somewhat higher than the totals recalled by the NELS students in the 1994 interviews.\" Such differences are to be expected in comparing institution-reported financial aid dollar amounts to student responses in a telephone survey. Moreover, although the two groups have similar characteristics, they are not identical.12 The amounts of financial aid that the students received are arguably meaningful only in relation to tuition and other educational costs, which vary by type of institution. As shown in table 5, the average yearly tuition at the institutions attended by the low-income students in 1992-93 ranged from about $900 at two-year public colleges to almost $9,000 at four-year private institutions. To help cover their costs, three-quarters of the low-income students received grant aid, such as the federal Pell grants and a variety of grant and scholarship programs funded by states, the institutions, or other organizations. One useful measure of how well financial aid reduces costs is \"net tuition,\" the amount of tuition minus grant aid, which is the remaining amount that the student must pay to the institution for instruction.\" As shown in table 5, more than half of the low-income students attending public institutions had their entire tuition charges covered by the grant and scholarship aid, compared to about one-quarter of the low-income students attending private four-year institutions.14 The proportion of low-income students who owed any tuition after grant aid, and the average amount remaining to be paid from other sources, is also shown in table 5. For example, those low-income students whose private four-year tuition costs were not fully covered by grants (72 percent) had an average of $4,200 in tuition remaining to be paid from other sources and other types of aid, such as loans and work study. 11The NELS:88 survey asked students to estimate only a total aid amount, not amounts by type of aid. There was no difference in the average amount of aid reported by students in the two surveys who attended private four-year or other less-than-four-year institutions. 12The 6 percent of 1992 high school graduates in NPSAS:93 who were independent students were excluded from the comparison because their parents' income is not known. 141f the grant and scholarship aid is greater than tuition, the additional amount is applied to other, non-tuition, educational costs. In addition to tuition, however, students have other expenses related to attendance, such as books and supplies, room and board, transportation, and other personal living expenses. The total cost of attendance, which includes these expenses as well as tuition, is estimated in student budgets used by the institutions in awarding financial aid. In 1992-93, these average costs of attendance, shown in table 6, ranged from about $6,000 to attend a two-year public college to almost $15,000 to attend a four-year private institution. By subtracting the total amount of financial aid (including loans) received from the total cost of attendance, the \"net cost\" to the student after aid can be calculated. Although the average net cost to the low-income 1992 high school graduates ranged from about $4,900 at public two-year and four-year institutions to about $5,700 at private four-year institutions, the difference was not statistically significant.15 For example, despite the difference in tuition between public two-year and four-year institutions, the average net costs of education for low-income students were similar at these types of institutions. One of the 15U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, How Low-Income Undergraduates Financed Postsecondary Education: 1992-93 (Washington, D.C.: 1996: 34, also reports net costs for dependent lowincome students, but the definitions are not the same. In that report, low income is defined as 125 percent of poverty level (using income and family size); undergraduates in all class levels are included (rather than only first-year students who had just graduated from high school); and educational costs are based on student-reported estimates of monthly expenses (rather than institutional student budgets). The average net costs reported are $4,900 at public lessthan-4 year, $5,400 at public 4-year, and $6,900 at private 4-year institutions. 12 27 FINANCIAL AID AND COLLEGE COSTS important effects of financial aid, therefore, is to reduce the differences in net costs between various institutions for low-income students, which may give them a greater choice of institutions to attend. Since low-income students and their parents still had to pay an average of about $5,000 to cover expenses related to postsecondary education, the effect of financial aid on access is not as clear as the potential effect on college choice. Where did the additional $5,000 or more come from? Some of the sources of funds reported by low-income students are shown in table 7. Half the low-income students reported that they were living at home with their parents, which reduced their living expenses. In addition, about half reported direct contributions from their parents, averaging about $2,000, while nearly two-thirds (65 percent) reported working while enrolled, for an average of 24 hours per week. At the two-year public colleges, 70 percent of the students lived at home, and 80 percent worked an average of 27 hours per week while enrolled. Thus, through some combination of financial aid, parental contributions, work, and other strategies, these lowincome students were able to meet their tuition and living expenses while enrolled. There is little doubt that the cost of attending postsecondary education posed difficulties for low-income 1992 high school graduates, and while financial aid reduced the differences in the amounts required to attend different types of institutions, on average, several thousand dollars remained to be paid. Nevertheless, as shown earlier in table 2, nearly two-thirds of the lowincome 1992 high school graduates were enrolled in postsecondary education within two years of high school graduation despite the financial burden. Although the importance of costs and financial aid should not be understated, postsecondary enrollment patterns reflect much more than financing issues. First, a high school student must want or expect to continue his or her education. Next, the student must make some plans about when and where to enroll. Those planning to attend four-year colleges and universities must also complete two appropriate steps: taking a college entrance examination such as the SAT or ACT, and applying for admission. In addition, if financial aid is needed, the student and his or her parents must get information about and file an application for financial aid. Finally, the student must actually be offered admission to an institution. All of this happens before enrollment, and all of these factors, from expectations to plans to college applications, may be influenced by the income, educational level, and racialethnic background of the family. Educational aspirations and expectations have often been found to be related to postsecondary attendance.16 In the NELS:88 survey, students were asked in both the eighth grade (1988) and in their senior year (1992) about the level of education they expected to achieve. Their responses to the question \"As things stand now, how far in school do you think you will get?\" in 1988 and in 1992 are displayed in table 8. As early as the eighth grade, the expectation of finishing college was directly related to family income and parental levels of education.\" Among eighth graders from low-income families 59 percent expected to finish college, compared with 76 percent from middle-income and 92 percent from high-income families. Hispanic eighth graders were less likely to expect to finish college than either whites or Asians. When the students were asked this question again in 1992 during their senior year, there was a small increase in the proportion saying that they expected some postsecondary education (from 20 percent to 25 percent) and a small decrease in those who expected to finish college (from 73 percent to 71 percent). However, there were no measurable changes among low-income students, blacks, or Hispanics in the proportion expecting to finish college. Over the period of 16M. Paulsen, College Choice: Understanding Student Enrollment Behavior (ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report No. 6, Washington, D.C.: 1990). 17Students who expected to attain at least a bachelor's degree were considered to have expected to \"finish college.\" Those who expected to complete trade or vocational school or \"some college\" were considered to have expected to complete \"some postsecondary.\" See appendix A for a description of the expectation variable. four years there had been no lowering of expectations on average among those groups of students whose families would have the greatest concerns and difficulties in financing a college education, although as high school seniors they were presumably much more aware of college costs and financial aid than they had been in the eighth grade. In addition to the question about their educational expectations, the seniors were also asked a more concrete question: whether they planned to continue their education immediately after high school.\" Their plans are compared to their actual enrollment patterns in table 9. More than three-quarters (79 percent) indicated that they planned to enroll in postsecondary education immediately after high school. When those who said that they did not plan to continue immediately 18Although the terms are similar, in this report \"expectations\" refers to one specific question in the NELS survey (\"How far in school do you think you will get?\") which was asked in 1988 and again in 1992, while \"plans\" refers to another question (asked only in 1992) about their plans immediately after high school."}, {"section_title": "16-", "text": "were asked if they ever intended to continue, virtually all (97 percent) of the high school graduates said that they planned to continue their education at some time after high school. More than 94 percent of students from all racial-ethnic groups, all family income levels, and all parental education levels said that they planned to attend postsecondary education at some time. Differences by family income and education levels emerge, however, when the seniors were asked if they intended to enroll immediately after high school (table 9). The proportion planning to attend postsecondary education immediately after high school was directly related to family income and parental education. For example, 70 percent of low-income students, corn-pared with 82 percent of middle-income and 92 percent of high-income students, said that they planned to attend postsecondary education immediately after high school. The proportion of high school graduates who actually enrolled in postsecondary education in the fall term (October 1992) was 65 percent.19 By 1994, two years after graduating from high school, three-quarters (75 percent) of the 1992 high school graduates had enrolled in postsecondary education. Enrollment in postsecondary education within two years of high school graduation was directly related to both the family income and the education levels of the students' parents. By 1994, 64 percent of low-income students, compared to 79 percent of middle-income and 93 percent of high-income students, had enrolled in postsecondary education. Those who said that they planned to attend immediately after high school, however, had high enrollment rates: 89 percent actually enrolled in postsecondary education within two years. Enrollment rates were also high (83 to 84 percent) for those low-income, black, and Hispanic students who had planned to attend postsecondary education immediately after high school, although the enrollment rates were even higher for the middle-income (90 percent), white and Asian -(90 to 92 percent), and high-income (96 percent) students who had also planned to do so. Table 10 focuses on those seniors who said that they planned to attend a four-year college or university immediately after high schoo1.20 Nearly all of these seniors attended some postsecondary institution (94 percent); over three-quarters (78 percent) enrolled in four-year institutions. Among those who planned to attend a four-year college, low-and middle-income students were less likely to actually enroll in a four-year institution than high-income students (72 and 77 percent compared to 89 percent, respectively). Black and Hispanic students were also less likely to enroll in four-year institutions than white and Asian students. About 15 percent of those who planned to attend a four-year college immediately after high school enrolled in a two-year public college instead. The public two-year college enrollment rate of those who planned to attend fouryear institutions was similar for both low-and middle-income students and for all racialethnic 19This is comparable to the October college-going rate (62 percent) reported in the Current Population Survey (CPS), because the CPS rate does not include enrollments in less-than-2-year institutions (about 3 percent of the NELS students). For the annual CPS college-going rates by income and raceethnicity see U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, The Condition of Education 1996 (Washington, D.C.: 1996): 52-53. 20This constituted 71 percent of all 1992 high school graduates.

Furthermore, prospective students must take a college entrance examination and submit an application for admission. In attempting to explain the gap in four-year college enrollment rates among income levels and racialethnic groups, two major factors will be examined: academic aptitude and achievement22 and taking the necessary steps toward admission to a four-year institution, which include taking a college entrance exam (SAT or ACT) and submitting an application. College admissions decisions are based on both objective and subjective criteria. In assessing applicants' qualifications, admissions officers try to look at as much information as possible, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of students in relation to their situation. For example, an applicant from a poor urban school district who has very low SAT scores may be admitted on the basis of a high class rank. For this study, a composite measure of academic qualification for four-year college work was developed that attempts to approximate the college admissions process. This \"college qualification index\" is based on cumulative academic course GPAs, senior class rank, the 1992 NELS aptitude test scores, and the SAT and ACT college entrance examination scores, with an adjustment for academic coursework. Since admission standards and requirements vary widely among four-year colleges and universities, the approach used was empirical. It was based on an examination of the actual distribution of these five measures of academic aptitude and achievement among those graduating NELS seniors who did attend a fouryear college or university by 1994. Data sources were available for approximately half (45 percent) of the NELS graduating seniors for four or five of the criteria: class rank, GPA, the NELS test, and ACT or SAT scores or both (table 11). For about one-third (36 percent) of the seniors there were only three data sources available because they had no ACT or SAT scores; most of these had NELS test scores, however. \nThen some adjustments were made for programs of rigorous academic coursework, defined as including at least 4 years of English; 3 years each of science, mathematics, and social studies; and 2 years of a foreign language. Those who had taken a program of rigorous academic courses were moved up into one higher level of qualification; and Those in the \"very highly qualified\" category were moved down into the \"highly qualified\" category if they had not taken rigorous academic coursework.24 The average scores for each of the levels of the four-year college qualification index, both for those who did and did not actually enroll in a four-year institution and for all of the high school graduates, are shown in table 12. Since the college qualification index was based on the highest score on any of the five criteria and then adjusted (usually upward) to reflect academic coursework, the averages for the individual categories are lower than the interval values used to classify the students initially. Those who enrolled and were classified as minimally college qualified, for example, had an average academic course GPA of 2.3, an average combined SAT score of 758, an average class rank (42nd percentile) below the median, and NELS aptitude test scores (51st percentile) which put them near the median of their senior class. Except for a lower average NELS aptitude test score (43rd percentile), the average scores for the marginally or not qualified who enrolled in a four-year college were similar to those who enrolled and were classified as minimally qualified. However, the total group of those classified as marginally or not qualified for four-year college work had an average class rank and NELS aptitude test scores which put them in the bottom third of their senior class, an average GPA of 2.1, and an average combined SAT score of 700. One reason that there is very little difference in the average scores between the minimally and the marginally or not qualified students who enrolled in a four-year college is the problem of missing data. As shown in table 11 above, the proportion of students in these groups with only one source available for the qualification index was about twice as high among those who attended a four-year college as among those who did not (20 percent compared to 11 percent of those marginally or not qualified; 15 percent compared to 7 percent of those minimally qualified). The methodology used to construct the qualification index has a bias, since the probability of scoring high on at least one criterion increases with the number of data sources available for the student. Among all high school graduates, the students classified as marginally or not 24This was done to assure that the very highly qualified had both rigorous coursework and high scores. qualified were more likely than any qualified group to have data for only one or two criteria, so they were more likely to be misclassified than those with more sources of data.25"}, {"section_title": "35", "text": "In order to identify as many students as possible who were potentially academically qualified for four-year college work, even if data were missing for these students on some of the criteria, the seniors were classified according to the highest level they had achieved on any of the five criteria for which data were present. That is, the college qualification index approximates an admissions process which would only take into consideration the applicants' strongest measure of academic performance. The initial classification of the graduating seniors was determined as follows: Very highly qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 10 percent of four-year college students (specifically the NELS 1992 graduating seniors who enrolled in four-year colleges and universities) for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=3.7, class rank percentile=96, NELS test per-centile=97, combined SAT=1250, composite ACT=28. Highly qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 25 percent of four-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=3.6, class rank percentile=89, NELS test percentile=90, combined SAT=1110, composite ACT=25. Somewhat qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 50 percent (i.e., in the second quartile) of four-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=3.2, class rank percentile=75, NELS test percentile=76, combined SAT=960, composite ACT=22. Minimally qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 75 percent (i.e., in the third quartile) of four-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=2.7, class rank percentile=54, NELS test percentile=56, combined SAT=820, composite ACT=19. Marginally or not qualified: those who had no value on any criterion that would put them among the top 75 percent of four-year college students (i.e., all values were in the lowest quartile). Those in vocational programs (according to their high school transcripts) were also classified as not college qualified.23 23This affected the classification of less than 1 percent. Very few students whose transcripts indicated that they were in vocational programs met any of the other criteria for college qualification. 37."}, {"section_title": "3 8 QUALIFICATION FOR ADMISSION TO FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES", "text": "25The majority of those who had only one source available had only the NELS aptitude test scores."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE  Table 13 shows the number of sources available for the college qualification index by student background characteristics for all high school graduates and for those who enrolled in fouryear colleges. Those with three sources available always had at least one standardized test score (usually NELS) and those with four or five sources always had either SAT or ACT scores. Among all high school graduates, Hispanics, blacks, and low-income students were less likely to have four or five sources available, which means they were less likely to take the college entrance examinations than were whites, Asians, or higher income students. Among those who attended four-year colleges, black students were more likely than whites to have only one or two sources available.26 The distribution of the 1992 high school graduates who enrolled in four-year colleges and universities according to the categories of this college qualification index are shown in table 14. Over half were classified as highly or very highly qualified (30 percent and 27 percent, respectively). Thirteen percent were minimally qualified and 11 percent were classified as marginally or not qualified for regular admission to a four-year college according to this index. As discussed above, the average scores of the latter two groups were similar, and 15 to 20 percent only had one source available for the qualification index, so the differences in the academic preparation of the minimally and the marginally qualified who enrolled may be relatively small. In addition to the problem of missing data, the qualification index has other limitations as a predictor of college admissions. At most four-year institutions, college admissions decisions are not based solely on grades, class rank, and test scores. 27 Other criteria may also be considered, such as letters of recommendation, musical and artistic talents, ability in sports, or parents who are alumni. Many colleges have policies which set aside a certain percentage of admissions for students in educational opportunity programs. These programs are designed to recruit motivated low-income students who do not meet regular admission standards, and to provide them with special tutoring and other support services. Table 14 shows, for example, that the college students who were marginally or not college qualified according to the index were more likely to come from families with low income and low educational levels, and were more likely to come 26The combined percentage for one and two sources was 12 percent for whites and 25 percent for blacks.

Among all 1992 high school graduates, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) appear to have been at least minimally qualified for admission to a four-year college or university (hereafter referred to as \"college qualified\"). There was a direct relationship between students' family income and their likelihood of being qualified for admission to a four-year institution: 53 percent of low-income students were college qualified compared to 68 percent of middle-and 86 percent of high-income students.

Recall that the overall proportion of high school graduates who expected to finish college declined slightly between the eighth grade and the senior year, from 73 percent to 71 percent (table 8). Table 17 compares the students' postsecondary expectations in these years again, but separates those students who were qualified to attend a four-year college in 1992 from those who were marginally or not qualified. Among those who were college qualified in their senior year, there had been no decline in the proportion who expected to finish college (83 percent in both years). Among those who were marginally or not qualified during their senior year, however, the proportion that expected to finish college had dropped from 52 percent during the eighth grade to 44 percent in the senior year. Instead, the expectations of these seniors had shifted toward achieving some postsecondary education (32 percent compared to 46 percent) rather than finishing college. This decline in college completion expectations was true only for white students, however (51 percent to 39 percent). Among the black, Hispanic, and Asian students who appear to have been marginally or not college qualified during their senior year, expectations were not significantly different between 1988 and 1992. Expectations for finishing college did not decline from eighth to twelfth grade among any group of students who were college qualified as seniors. This was true regardless of students' family income, educational level, or racialethnic background. Therefore, the decline in expectations for the entire class was largely driven by a decline in expectations for those, primarily white, students who demonstrated a low level of academic aptitude and achievement in their senior year. Among four-year college-qualified students, on the other hand, expectations had been set by the eighth grade and did not change; in fact, the expectations of college-qualified low-income students appears to have increased slightly (69 to 74 percent), but there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they changed. As shown in table 18, among all four-year college-qualified seniors who (in 1992) expected to finish college, 88 percent said that they planned to attend a four-year college. Long-term expectations and short-term plans for postsecondary education are based on different questions in  the survey.31 There were no differences in plans to attend a four-year college between low-and middle-income college-qualified students who expected to finish college, and both were less likely than their high-income counterparts to plan to do so. Hispanic students were also less likely to plan to attend a four-year college; instead, they were more likely to plan to attend a twoyear college or trade school.

Among all college-qualified students, nearly three-quarters (73 percent) took both a college entrance exam and submitted an application to a four-year institution.

Private four-year college application and enrollment rates represent one of the few instances in this study where a direct relationship to family income levels is not also reflected in a direct relationship to parental education levels. Given the large difference in the average tuition between public and private four-year colleges, it is not surprising that the application rates at private four-year institutions are directly related to family income. Low-income students and parents are undoubtedly aware that private college tuition is much higher. However, they may not be aware that financial aid can substantially reduce the difference in the actual net cost to the family unless the student has applied and 50 63 CHOICE OF INSTITUTIONS BY COLLEGE-QUALIFIED APPLICANTS been accepted, since the financial aid award offers are typically sent at the same time as the letters of acceptance. That is, the real effect of financial aid on college choice can be appropriately evaluated only by examining the behavior of those students who have been accepted for admission at four-year colleges, because they are the only ones who know how much financial aid has been awarded and can therefore actually compare the net costs at various institutions. Table 26 shows where the students who were accepted to four-year colleges chose to enroll. Among the students who were accepted to any four-year institution, 89 percent enrolled in one. There were no differences in the four-year college enrollment rates of those who had been accepted among racialethnic groups or between low-and middle-income students. High-income students, however, were somewhat more likely to enroll in a four-year institution compared with low-and middle-income students (93 percent compared to 88 percent). Among students who were accepted to private four-year institutions, over three-quarters (76 percent) enrolled in one, 16 percent enrolled in a public four-year institution, and 6 percent in a less-than-four-year institution. For these students, there were no measurable differences in the choice of attending either a less-than-4-year, private four-year, or public four-year institution by family income, parental education, or raceethnicity. Similarly, among students who were accepted to a public four-year institution, 81 percent enrolled in one, 8 percent enrolled in a private four-year institution, and 9 percent attended a less-than-four-year institution. There were also no differences in these enrollment choices by family income, parental education, or raceethnicity. In summary, low-income students who have been accepted to public four-year colleges and universities or those who have been accepted to private four-year colleges and universities are just as likely to enroll in them as were middle-and high-income students. There is also no difference in the enrollment rates of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or whites who have been accepted to four-year public or private colleges and universities.

The NELS survey includes some data which may help explain why some students are less likely to take the necessary steps. These include the responses of the students and their parents to questions about college affordability and to questions about the financial aid information they had available. In the spring of 1992, the graduating high school seniors who indicated they were planning to continue their education and their parents were asked a number of questions about the importance of college costs and financial aid in choosing a college and about their sources of financial aid information.37 Tables 27 through 29 compare the responses to some of these questions by the college-qualified seniors and their parents. Table 27 shows the percentage of 1992 college-qualified seniors and their parents who demonstrated that they were very concerned about college affordability by indicating that both the availability of financial aid and total college costs were \"very important\" in choosing an institution to attend, or that one was \"very important\" and the other \"somewhat important.\" Lowincome students and their parents were more likely to be very concerned about financial aid and college costs in choosing a college to attend than their middle-income counterparts, and middleincome students and parents were more concerned than those from high-income families. In lowincome families, the parents were more likely to be concerned about college affordability than their children (79 percent compared to 69 percent). Both black and Hispanic students and parents were more likely to be concerned about affordability than their Asian and white counterparts. In Hispanic families, the parents were also more likely to be concerned about college affordability than their children (71 percent compared to 56 percent), in contrast to black families, where the parents and the students were equally concerned about meeting college costs (70 percent of par-37Most of the students who planned to attend college would have already applied and taken the entrance exams at this point. ents and 74 percent of students).

Table 28 shows the proportions of 1992 high school graduates and their parents who had read financial aid information from the U.S. Department of Education or from postsecondary institutions by their senior year of high school. Parents were much more likely to have read information from both sources than the students. Low-income parents were just as likely to have read information from two sources as middle-income parents (54 and 56 percent), but lowincome students were more likely to have obtained financial aid information from both sources than their middle-income counterparts.  Table 29 shows the proportion of college-qualified students and their parents who obtained information about financial aid from teachers and guidance counselors, college representatives, loan officers, and other knowledgeable people. Low-income students were more likely to have discussed financial aid with a high school teacher or guidance counselor (72 percent) and with college representatives (49 percent) than middle-or high-income students. Black students were also more likely to have discussed financial aid with teachers and counselors (77 percent) or college representatives (57 percent) than students from other racial-ethnic groups. There were no differences in the proportions of low-, middle-, and high-income parents who spoke to teachers and counselors, but a larger proportion of low-and middle-income parents spoke with college representatives about financial aid, while a larger percentage of middle-income parents had spoken to a loan officer at a bank. "}, {"section_title": "54", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "71", "text": "In summary, low-income, black, and Hispanic parents of college-qualified seniors were very concerned about costs and the availability of financial aid in choosing a college; however, among these three groups only the black students were as concerned as their parents. Collegequalified low-income students were more likely than their middle-income counterparts to read information and speak to teachers, guidance counselors, and college representatives about financial aid. Low-income parents, however, apparently did not have any more information about financial aid than middle-income parents. College-qualified black students were not only more concerned about college affordability than Hispanic students, they were also more likely to have discussed financial aid with teachers, guidance counselors, and college representatives. Whether taking the steps toward attending a four-year institution is related to concerns about college affordability and information about financial aid is examined in tables 30 through 32. These tables focus on the college-qualified seniors from low-income, middle-income, Hispanic, and black backgrounds, which are the groups that are most concerned about college affordability as discussed above. Table 30 examines the relationship between concerns about college affordability and taking both steps toward attending a four-year college. It shows the percentage of college-qualified students who took both steps, comparing those students and parents who were very concerned about affordability to those who were less than very concerned. The difference in the degree of concern expressed about college affordability by students and parents from low-and middle-income and black and Hispanic families was not related to differences in the proportions of students taking both steps towards attending a four-year institution. However, because the affordability questions were asked only of those who planned to attend postsecondary education, this result does not address the issue of whether cost concerns had discouraged students from planning to go to college in the first place. Table 31 examines the relationship of taking both steps to the number of sources of information read about financial aid. All low-and middle-income, black, and Hispanic students who read information about financial aid from one or more sources were more likely to take both steps toward attending a four-year institution than those who did not read any information.38 For example, 48 percent of college-qualified low-income students who did not read any information on financial aid took both steps, compared to over 70 percent who obtained information from one or two sources. 38The exception to this is no difference between black students who read nothing compared with those who read two sources.

For example, 35 percent of lowincome students who did not talk with anyone about financial aid applied to a four-year college and took a college entrance examination, compared to 52 percent who talked with one person, 67 percent who talked with two, and 75 percent who talked with three or more people. Among Hispanic and black students, those who spoke with two or more people were also more likely to take both steps toward attending a four-year institution than those who had spoken with no one.39 In summary, the more sources of information they had obtained, and the more people with whom they had discussed financial aid, the more likely that college-qualified low-and middleincome, black, and Hispanic students would have taken the college entrance exams and applied for admission to a four-year college.' Although there is a positive relationship between getting information about financial aid and taking the steps toward attending college, it cannot be concluded that there is a causal relationship. That is, it may be that students who have already decided to go to college seek out more information about financial aid, or it may be that those who get more information are more likely to take the steps toward going to college. 39Although the difference in this proportion between Hispanic students who spoke with no one and those who spoke with one person appears large, these estimates are associated with large standard errors and the difference is not statistically significant. 40The importance of information for low-income students has recently been shown in J. King, The Decision to Go to College (Washington, D.C.: The College Board, 1996). According to the college qualification index used in this analysis, approximately one-third of the 1992 high school graduates were not academically prepared to attend a four-year college, and they were not included in most of the analyses above. The postsecondary attendance patterns of the graduating seniors who appear to have been only marginally or not qualified to attend fouryear colleges are shown in table 33. "}, {"section_title": "77", "text": "Half (48 percent) of all the marginally or unqualified seniors did not attend any postsecondary institution within two years of high school graduation. Not enrolling was directly related to family income and parental education levels. Over half (53 percent) of the low-income seniors did not enroll anywhere, compared with 43 percent of the middle-and 30 percent of the highincome unqualified seniors. Marginally and unqualified white seniors were more likely not to attend postsecondary education within two years of high school graduation than any of the marginally or unqualified seniors from minority groups. This is consistent with the earlier finding that the educational expectations of minority students, qualified or not, had not declined between the eighth grade and their senior year, but they had declined for marginally or unqualified white seniors. Among those who were marginally or not college qualified, 30 percent enrolled in two-year public institutions; 7 percent enrolled in private for-profit or not-for-profit institutions offering programs of less than four years; and 15 percent enrolled in four-year institutions. For this group, four-year college enrollment rates were directly related to family income and parental education, a typical pattern observed throughout this report. The marginally qualified seniors whose parents had high incomes or college degrees were three times as likely to have been enrolled in four-year colleges than those whose parents had low incomes or no more than a high school education. The proportions of marginally qualified Asians, whites, and Hispanics enrolled in four-year colleges were similar (about 13 percent). The proportion of black seniors who did not meet the minimum criteria of the college qualification index who were enrolled in four-year colleges (23 percent) was greater than the proportion of comparable whites and Hispanics. Again, it is important to note that among the students who appear to be only marginally qualified, those who did enroll in four-year colleges were more likely to have data missing for the college qualification index than those who did not enroll in a four-year college, and most of the average scores for the marginally qualified who did enroll were about the same as the minimally qualified students.41 In particular, black students who enrolled had fewer sources available for the qualification index than whites.42 Nearly one-third of the seniors who were marginally or not academically qualified for fouryear colleges did attend two-year public community colleges. The pattern seen frequently throughout this report, that Hispanics had higher public two-year college enrollment rates than whites (39 percent compared to 28 percent), is repeated. What is not typical is that Asians also had much higher public two-year college enrollment rates than whites. Nearly half (46 percent) of the Asian seniors who were marginally or not qualified for four-year colleges attended public two-year colleges, which is consistent with the high postsecondary enrollment rates of collegequalified Asians. In summary, even among those high school seniors who are not adequately prepared for regular admission to a four-year college, many of the same patterns which were observed among the college-qualified seniors are evident. Postsecondary enrollment in general, and four-year college enrollment in particular, is directly related to family income and education. Hispanics are more likely to go to community colleges, in contrast to blacks, who are more likely to go to fouryear colleges than Hispanics."}, {"section_title": "d0 A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF TWO-YEAR PUBLIC AND FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE ENROLLMENT RATES", "text": "In examining access to postsecondary education, this report has focused primarily on the factors associated with the relatively low four-year college enrollment rates of Hispanic, black, and low-income graduating high school seniors. Two of the most important factors were found to be that these groups were less likely to be well prepared academically, and among those who were qualified to attend a four-year college, low-income and Hispanic (but not black) students were less likely to take the college entrance examinations and apply for admission, which are the two steps required for acceptance to and enrollment in a four-year college or university. The analysis has therefore been focused on exploring the relationship of family income, parental education, and raceethnicity to four-year college qualification and taking the steps toward four-year college admission, and the relationship of these two intervening variables to enrollment patterns. To estimate the effect of a single one of these variables, the effects of the other related variables must be controlled, which requires a multivariate analysis. Two weighted least squares regression models were used to estimate how much each of the student background characteristics variables affected postsecondary enrollment, while controlling for college qualification and taking both steps toward four-year college admission, as well as the other background characteristics. One model examines community college enrollments; the dependent variable is the proportion of 1992 high school graduates who first enrolled in a two-year public institution. A second model focuses on four-year college and university enrollments; the dependent variable is the proportion of 1992 high school graduates who first enrolled in a either a private or a public fouryear institution.43 In each model the dependent variable is the dichotomous enrollment variable for each subject. The independent variables in both models include whether the student was college qualified (yes/no) and whether the student took both steps toward attending a four-year institution (yes/no) as well as the background characteristics displayed throughout this report: race ethnicity, family income, and parental education.\" The regression coefficients in the model were then used to adjust the original estimates of proportions of students enrolled in public two-year or 43See appendix B for a discussion of regression models appropriate for categorical dependent variables. 44Financial aid was not included as a variable because the amounts are known only for those who enrolled. 67 80 any four-year institution (see appendix B for the details of the methodology). These adjusted estimates, which take into account the joint effects of all the independent variables in the model, may then be compared to the original unadjusted proportion of all seniors who enrolled in a twoyear public (26 percent) or any four-year institution (45 percent) as displayed earlier in table 2. The results in the first column of table 34 show the original (unadjusted) estimates of the proportion of students who enrolled in a two-year public institution by background characteristics (the original estimates are in tables 2 and 16), college qualification, and steps toward four-year college admission. Column two contains the adjusted percentages after controlling for all other independent variables. Asterisks indicate that the estimates are significantly different from the reference group, which is italicized. For example, the unadjusted percentages indicate that only Hispanics had two-year public college enrollment rates that were significantly higher than whites, who are the reference group (34 percent compared to 25 percent). Controlling for all other characteristics, however, both Asians and Hispanics had higher community college enrollment rates than whites (32 percent of both Asians and Hispanics compared with 25 percent of whites, adjusted). This change may be due to the fact that Asians who were unqualified for four-year institutions had very high two-year public enrollment rates, as was shown in table 33. Students from low-income families had unadjusted community college enrollment rates, similar to those of students from middle-income families (25 to 28 percent, unadjusted). Controlling for all other characteristics, however, the adjusted rates indicate that low-income students were less likely to enroll in community colleges than middle-income students (22 compared with 29 percent, adjusted). The unadjusted estimates also suggest that the community college enrollment rates of students whose parents were college graduates were lower than those whose parents had less education. Controlling for all other variables, however, indicates that students whose parents are college graduates are only less likely to enroll in community colleges than those whose parents have some college education (25 compared to 29 percent, adjusted). A major change from the unadjusted to adjusted estimates concerns the effect of college qualification. The unadjusted estimates indicate that students who are qualified to attend fouryear colleges are less likely to attend public two-year colleges than those who are marginally or not qualified (23 percent compared to 30 percent, unadjusted). The regression model, however, results in adjusted estimates that reverse the relationship. Controlling for all other variables, it is the college-qualified students who are more likely to attend community colleges than those who are not qualified (29 percent compared to 21 percent, adjusted). In summary, the regression model indicates that, after controlling for the effect of all other variables, the community college enrollment rates of Asians and Hispanics were higher than the community college enrollment rates of white seniors. It also suggests that it is the students from families with middle incomes who were the most likely to enroll in community colleges (29 percent, adjusted) when other factors are controlled. Moreover, seniors who were qualified to attend four-year colleges were more likely to enroll in public two-year colleges than those who were not academically qualified after controlling for other factors. However, about 1 out of 10 of those who had applied to four-year colleges enrolled in a community college, while over 40 percent (unadjusted and adjusted) of those who did not take both steps toward 4-year college admission enrolled in community college. The second regression model defines four-year institution enrollment rates as the dependent variable (private and public colleges and universities combined), and the same independent variables as in the two-year public model discussed above. The unadjusted estimates (also shown in tables 2 and 16) are compared to the adjusted regression model estimates in the right panel of table 34. Since much of the analysis in this report focused on four-year college enrollment rates, which included tables showing the effect of controlling for college qualification and taking the two steps toward admission, the results of the regression model confirm most of the previous findings.45 The adjusted estimates confirm that there was no significant difference in the four-year college enrollment rates of whites compared to Asians, blacks, and Hispanics when controlling for the variation of all the other variables. A statistically significant difference (of 3 percentage points) remains between low-income and middle-income four-year college enrollment rates (42 percent compared to 45 percent, adjusted). The differences between the highest level of parental education (college graduate) and the lower levels also remained. Finally, the strong effect of taking the two steps toward four-year college admission remains in the regression model: (80 percent adjusted, 76 percent adjusted). Similarly, the effect of being college qualified also remained. 45No other table, however, reports \"Steps taken toward a four-year\" as a row variable. Table 34-Percentage of all 1992 high school graduates enrolled in a public 2-year or any 4-year institution by 1994, by background and college-related characteristics, and the adjusted percentage after taking into account the covariation of the variables listed in the BEST COPY AVAILABLE"}, {"section_title": "82", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Financing the cost of postsecondary education was not easy for the low-income students who graduated from high school in 1992. The majority depended on financial aid and, except for those attending community colleges, this often meant taking out student loans. Even with financial aid, low-income students had to find approximately $5,000 in additional funds from other sources to meet their postsecondary expenses. Some received contributions from their parents; some lived at home to reduce expenses; most held jobs while they were enrolled. Nearly twothirds of the 1992 high school graduates whose families had annual incomes under $25,000 managed to attend postsecondary education within two years of completing high school. There is no question that financial aid is an important component in financing low-income students' postsecondary education, and that it is necessary in providing access to postsecondary education. Differences in the amount of aid available, however, appear to have had a greater effect on equalizing net educational costs among different types of institutions than on access. No matter what type of institution they attended, the average net cost after aid for low-income students was approximately the same. The question posed in this study is whether the available amounts of financial aid and the actual net college costs (as opposed to perceptions of high costs) are sufficient to account for the lower postsecondary enrollment rates of low-income high school graduates. The evidence presented here suggests that other factors also are associated with this result, especially educational expectations and plans, levels of academic aptitude and achievement, and taking the steps required to be admitted to a four-year college.46 Tables 35 through 37 provide an overview of these factors, first for all 1992 high school graduates (table 35), then for those who were college qualified (table 36), and finally for those who were college qualified and took both steps (table 37). Barriers to a four-year college education for low-income high school graduates appear to include low educational expectations and poor academic preparation, both of which are associated with low rates of taking the college entrance examinations and applying to four-year col-46This confirms previous research which has found academic aptitude and achievement to be the biggest predictors of four-year college enrollment. See, for example, C. Manski and D. Wise, College Choice in America (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1983), and Y. Ozden, \"Have Efforts to Improve Higher Education Opportunities for Low-Income Youth Succeeded?\" Journal of Student Financial Aid 26 (1996): 19-39."}, {"section_title": "85", "text": "leges. However, even those low-income students who were academically college qualified were less likely to take the two steps toward four-year college admission than were middle-income students. The perception that four-year college costs are too high and that the financial aid will be inadequate may have contributed to this. The more information that college-qualified lowincome students obtained about financial aid (either by speaking with people or through written materials), the more likely these students were to have taken the necessary steps toward attending a four-year institution. Moreover, among those low-income students who were accepted to a four-year institution, almost 90 percent enrolled. That is, the majority of low-income high school graduates who took the college entrance examinations, applied to a four-year college, and were accepted for admission were not deterred from enrolling for financial (or other) reasons. The difference in the four-year college enrollment rates between Hispanic and black high school graduates also suggests that college access is more than a financial issue. The majority of both Hispanic and black high school graduates came from low-income families. Both groups experienced some of the same obstacles: they were less likely to be college qualified and less likely to expect to finish college as eighth graders. Black students, however, were more likely than Hispanics to attend a four-year college. Those black students who were prepared academically were just as likely to apply and take a college entrance examination as college-qualified Asian and white students, and the four-year college enrollment rates of college-qualified black students also were just as high. College-qualified Hispanic students, on the other hand, were less likely than blacks to take the necessary two steps for admission to a four-year college, and less likely than any other racialethnic group to enroll in four-year colleges. Factors relating to college costs or financial aid availability examined in this study do not appear to account for these persistent differences between the two groups.

Since admission standards and requirements vary widely among 4-year colleges and universities, the approach used here was to examine the actual distribution of these five measures of academic aptitude and achievement among those graduating seniors who did attend a 4-year college or university. Data sources were available for approximately half (45 percent) of the NELS graduating seniors for four or 80 96 five of the criteria: class rank, GPA, the NELS test, and ACT or SAT scores or both. For about one-third of the seniors there were only three data sources available because they had no ACT or SAT scores. All of these had NELS test scores, however. In order to identify as many students as possible who were potentially academically qualified for a 4-year college, even if data were missing for these students on some of the criteria, the seniors were classified according to the highest level they had achieved on any of the five criteria for which data were present. The initial classification of the graduating seniors was determined as follows: Very highly qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 10 percent of four-year college students (specifically the NELS 1992 graduating seniors who enrolled in four-year colleges and universities) for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=3.7, class rank percentile=96, NELS test per-centile=97, combined SAT=1250, composite ACT=28. Highly qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 25 percent of four-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=3.6, class rank percentile=89, NELS test percentile=90, combined SAT=1110, composite ACT=25. Somewhat qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 50 percent (i.e., in the second quartile) of four-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=3.2, class rank percentile=75, NELS test percentile=76, combined SAT=960, composite ACT=22. Minimally qualified: those whose highest value on any of the five criteria would put them among the top 75 percent (i.e., in the third quartile) of four-year college students for that criterion. Minimum values were GPA=2.7, class rank percentile=54, NELS test percentile=56, combined SAT=820, composite ACT=19. [Those in vocational programs (according to their high school transcript) were classified as not college qualified.] Marginally or not qualified: those who had no value on any criterion that would put them among the top 75 percent of four-year college students (i.e., all values were in the lowest quartile). Then some adjustments were made for programs of rigorous academic coursework, defined as including at least 4 years of English; 3 years each of science, mathematics, and social studies; and 2 years of a foreign language.

The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables from the NELS:88 data. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this report. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors48 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B1 contains standard errors that correspond to table 2 in the text, and was generated by the DAS. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (less than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the NELS:88 and NPSAS:93 stratified sampling method. (See discussion under \"Statistical Procedures\" below for the adjustment procedure.) 48The NELS:88/94 and NPSAS:93 samples are not simple random samples and, therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.

First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p< .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p< .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p< . 05.51 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racialethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=10 and the significance level of each test must be p< .05/10, or p< .005. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: 51The standard that p<.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p<.05. For tables showing the t statistic required to ensure that p<.05/k for a particular family size and degrees of freedom, see Olive Jean Dunn, \"Multiple Comparisons Among Means,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 56 (1961): 52-64."}, {"section_title": "99", "text": ".3 where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race ethnicity, there are five racialethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 2, Adjustment of Means to Control for Background Variation Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to socioeconomic status (SES) differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such as type of institution attended, intensity of enrollment, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended, within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables.52 Adjusted means for subgroups were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as race ethnicity, family income, etc. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, raceethnicity and income, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as attending a four-year college). The variables raceethnicity and family income are recoded into a dummy variable representing raceethnicity and a dummy variable representing family income:"}, {"section_title": "Raceethnicity", "text": "Black students To estimate the adjusted mean for any subgroup evaluated at the mean of all other variables, one substitutes the appropriate values for that subgroup's dummy variables (1 or 0) and the mean for the dummy variable(s) representing all other subgroups. For example, suppose we had a case where Y was being described by raceethnicity (R) and family income (F), coded as shown above, and the means for R and F are as follows:"}, {"section_title": "Suppose the regression equation results in:", "text": "A Y = 0.51 + (0.03)R + (-0.21)F To estimate the adjusted value for black students, one substitutes the appropriate parameter values into equation 4. "}, {"section_title": "0.282", "text": "A Y = 0.51 + (0.032)(1) + (-0.21)(0.282) = 0.48 In this case the adjusted mean for black students is 0.48 and represents the expected outcome for black students who look like the average student across the other variables (in this example, family income). In other words, the adjusted percentage who enrolled in a four-year college is 48 percent (0.48 x 100 for conversion to a percentage). It is relatively straightforward to produce a multivariate model using the DAS, since one of the DAS output options is a correlation matrix, computed using pair-wise missing values.53 This matrix can be used by most statistical software packages as the input data for least-squares regression. That is the approach used for this report, with an additional adjustment to incorporate the complex sample design into the statistical significance tests of the parameter estimates (described below). For tabular presentation, parameter estimates and standard errors were multiplied by 100 to match the scale used for reporting unadjusted and adjusted percentages. Most statistical software packages assume simple random sampling when computing standard errors of parameter estimates. Because of the complex sampling design used for the NELS:88/94 and NPSAS:93 surveys, this assumption is incorrect. A better approximation of their standard errors is to multiply each standard error by the average design effect of the independent variable (DEFT),54 where the DEFT is the ratio of the true standard error to the standard error computed under the assumption of simple random sampling. It is calculated by the DAS and produced with the correlation matrix. 53Although the DAS simplifies the process of making regression models, it also limits the range of models.
