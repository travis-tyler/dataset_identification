[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated this report in response to requests from data users for information on scientists and engineers in the United States without a bachelor's or higher degree. Before making a decision to conduct a survey to collect this information, SRS reviewed existing data sources. During the review, the Current Population Survey (CPS) was identified as the most current data source with adequate coverage of the population of interest. CPS is a monthly labor force survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This report provides the basis for understanding how CPS data may be used to satisfy the information needs of data users desiring information on the science and engineering (S&E) workforce without a bachelor's or higher degree. This information will complement the information on the S&E workforce[1] with education at the bachelor's level and higher that is provided by the NSF's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT). SESTAT is a data system that includes the employment, educational, and demographic characteristics of a sample of scientists and engineers in the United States. SESTAT, which NSF maintains to provide data for policy analysis and general research, is usually updated every 2 years. SESTAT's definition of scientists and engineers is restricted to individuals age 75 or younger with a bachelor's or higher degree living in the United States. It includes two groups: (1) individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree in S&E and (2) individuals with a bachelor's or higher non-S&E degree who are working in S&E occupations. CPS provides an alternative source of information about scientists and engineers. CPS can identify individuals with degrees by degree level; however, it does not collect data on field of degree and therefore cannot distinguish between S&E and non-S&E degrees. Because CPS collects data on occupation, it can identify individuals working in S&E occupations. Thus, CPS and SESTAT can both provide estimates of individuals with at least a bachelor's degree who are working in S&E occupations. Before endorsing the use of CPS data for estimates of the S&E workforce without a bachelor's or higher degree, SRS wanted to investigate the comparability of CPS data to SESTAT data where the coverage in the two survey systems overlaps. Therefore, the first purpose of this report is to compare SESTAT and CPS estimates of the S&E workforce with a bachelor's or higher degree and to try to account for any differences observed. Such differences may be attributed to the different coverage of the two survey systems, conceptual differences in the definitions used, nonresponse, and response effects. The comparisons between SESTAT and CPS estimates are presented in the section \"Coverage Issues.\" The second purpose of this report is to provide estimates of the numbers of individuals without a bachelor's or higher degree who are working in S&E occupations. The results for this group are presented in the section \"Comparison of Estimates.\" As background, the SESTAT and CPS designs are briefly reviewed in the sections \"Overview of SESTAT Design\" and \"Overview of CPS Design.\""}, {"section_title": "Overview of SESTAT Design", "text": "The SESTAT target population includes individuals living in the United States who have a bachelor's or higher degree and were either educated in S&E or are working in an S&E occupation, with the exception of those individuals who are either institutionalized or age 76 and older. The broad degree and occupation categories considered as S&E include computer and mathematical science, life science, physical science, social science (including psychology), and engineering (see Kannankutty and Wilkinson 1999 for more information about the definition of S&E degree fields and S&E occupations). The SESTAT data system is derived from three distinct survey components: the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), which are explained below. The NSCG primarily covers \"experienced\" scientists and engineers who are not covered by the other two SESTAT surveys. The sample for the 1993 NSCG was selected from the 1990 decennial census and included any individuals living in the United States as of April 1990 with a bachelor's degree or higher in any field, not just S&E. The target population also included college degree holders who earned their degrees outside the United States but who were U.S. residents in 1990. In 1993, two selected groups from the NSCG were incorporated into the SESTAT data system: those with S&E degrees and those without such degrees who were working in S&E occupations; however, anyone who was already covered by the 1993 NSRCG or the 1993 SDR was excluded. Subsequent rounds of the NSCG comprised those NSCG cases incorporated into the 1993 SESTAT, augmented by samples of S&E graduates since 1990 obtained from the prior rounds of the NSRCG (see next bullet). The NSRCG covers those individuals who received an S&E bachelor's or master's degree from a U.S. educational institution in the 2 academic years before the survey reference date. The NSRCG cases are referred to the NSCG for follow-up. The SDR covers those individuals who received a doctorate in an S&E field from a U.S. educational institution since 1942. Information about SESTAT can be found at http://sestat.nsf.gov/. This report was written for an audience with a technical background and knowledge of SESTAT."}, {"section_title": "Overview of CPS Design", "text": "CPS is a monthly survey of about 50,000 households. It is based on a stratified, multistage area probability sample design and is the primary source of information on the labor force characteristics of the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population. In addition to information about employment status, earnings, hours of work, and other labor force characteristics, CPS collects educational attainment data and a variety of demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status. Data are also available by occupation, industry, and class of worker. Since the inception of the survey, various changes have occurred in the design of the CPS sample. The survey is traditionally redesigned after each decennial census. The current sample design, introduced in January 1996, includes about 59,000 households from 754 sample areas. The number of eligible households in any given month is typically about 50,000; of these, about 93% respond to the survey. Data are generally collected for about 120,000 individuals of all ages from the responding households each month. CPS uses a 4-8-4 rotation scheme in which each sampled household is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, then dropped out of the sample for the next 8 months, and finally brought back into the sample the following 4 months. A feature of the rotation scheme is that in any given month, about one-eighth of the households are first-time households and one-eighth are reactivated households after their 8-month resting period. The remaining households have been in the sample for 2 or more consecutive months. Thus, the household sample has roughly a 75% month-to-month overlap. Although accumulating the monthly CPS samples will increase the total sample size, the gains are limited because of the substantial overlap resulting from the 4-8-4 rotation scheme. The number of unique households in the CPS sample in a year is about three times the size of a typical monthly sample. [2] A summary of key differences between the SESTAT and CPS designs is presented in the section \"Summary and Conclusions.\""}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The remainder of this report is organized as follows: \"Data Collection and Processing Procedures\" discusses the data collection and data processing procedures used by SESTAT and CPS. \"Coverage Issues\" explains the coverage issues and compares estimates of the S&E population derived from the two data sources. \"Statistical Issues\" briefly reviews other statistical issues that may affect comparisons of estimates between the two data sources. The main conclusions are summarized in \"Summary and Conclusions.\""}, {"section_title": "Footnotes", "text": "[1] For the purposes of this report, the S&E workforce is defined as people working in SESTAT S&E occupations. SESTAT defines S&E occupations as computer and mathematical scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists (including psychologists), and engineers.\n[3] 1999 SESTAT data were not available when this report was being written. The earlier cycles of SESTAT were not used because of time and resource limitations. s  n  o  i  t  a  p  u  c  c  o  c  i  t  s  i  r  e  t  c  a  r  a  h  C  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  9  ,  2  3  4  ,  9  6  0  0  6  ,  7  9  9  0  0  5  ,  0  3  4  ,  0  7  s  l  a  u  d  i  v  i  d  n  i  l  l  A  Sex  9  4  7  2  0  0  2  ,  7  4  1  ,  4  3  0  0  8  ,  2  7  2  0  0  0  ,  0  2  4  ,  4  3  e  l  a  m  e  F  1  5  3  7  0  0  7  ,  5  8  2  ,  5  3  0  0  7  ,  4  2  7  0  0  5  ,  0  1  0  ,  6  3  e  l  a  M  Race/ethnicity  8  4  0  0  9  ,  2  8  6  ,  5  0  0  7  ,  6  3  0  0  6  ,  9    [4] As shown in appendix C, table C-32 and figure C-1, the number of people in S&E occupations as reported in CPS fluctuates by month. These appendix tables are intended simply to illustrate the month-to-month variation in the CPS S&E occupation numbers and to include all people age 16 or older in the civilian labor force who have a college degree and who are working or previously worked in an S&E occupation. [5] The standard errors for CPS estimates tend to be higher than the corresponding standard errors for SESTAT estimates because the CPS sample includes a relatively small number of people in S&E occupations. [6] Throughout this section, \"degree\" refers to bachelor's or higher degree. [7] http://www.census.gov/prod/2000pubs/tp63.pdf [8] The data in many of the tables in this section are based on derived variables created for both SESTAT and CPS data. See appendix B, table B-1, for a description of these derived variables. [9] The sampling frame for the SDR is the Doctorate Records File, which is maintained by NSF and uses NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) as its primary source. The SED is a census of all individuals receiving a research doctorate from a U.S. institution in each academic year. Institutional coordinators in graduate schools distribute survey forms to and collect them from individuals receiving research doctorates. Because of the high visibility and participation of doctorate-granting institutions, there is expected to be little, if any, coverage error in the first stage (inclusion of doctorate-granting graduate schools). Because the graduate schools collect the questionnaires from degree recipients at the time of doctoral completion, the second stage is also considered quite accurate. Comparisons of the number of research doctorates covered by the SED with the total number of doctorates (including nonresearch doctorates) reported by institutions to the National Center for Education Statistics confirm that coverage of research doctorates in the SED is excellent (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/).\n[10] http://www.bls.census.gov/cps/basic/perfmeas/typea.htm [11] The National Center for Education Statistics has established IPEDS as its core postsecondary education data collection program. It is a single, comprehensive system that encompasses all identified institutions whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education. The IPEDS system is built around a series of interrelated surveys to collect institution-level data in areas such as enrollments, program completions, faculty, staff, and finances. The NSRCG poststratification adjustments used IPEDS data on number of bachelor's and master's degrees awarded by degree level and major field. \n[12] Numbers are rounded to hundreds.\n[1] During the 1997 survey cycle, data for individuals originally sampled as part of the 1993 and 1995 NSRCG surveys were collected in the NSRCG panel survey. The survey instrument used to collect data was the same as the NSCG instrument, except it included some additional education questions. These data were analyzed as part of the NSCG component and are considered part of that component, but the data collection method was similar to NSRCG, with most responses collected by CATI. In the 1997 NSRCG panel survey, 96% of the responses were collected by CATI. [2] The SESTAT guidelines include the following rules about the collection of proxy information from knowledgeable respondents, such as relatives or university officials: (1) proxy information may be used to determine eligibility for sample members who are living outside the United States, institutionalized, or deceased during the reference week; (2) a very limited set of proxy responses have been permitted for individuals who have extremely high positions and are too busy to respond otherwise; and (3) for a small number of cases involving language problems, respondents may ask another person to act as an interpreter for the questionnaire or CATI interview, but this is not considered a proxy situation. [3] In the 1997 SESTAT, 96% of the eligible population had received their most recent degree from a U.S. institution. [4] This report had some methodological issues that could affect the conclusions. It indicated the significance testing was performed assuming a design effect of 1. However, it was later determined that the correct design effect was 1.6, but the tests were not performed again. The authors also indicated that some of the results that were originally found to be significant might not be significant. Therefore, it is possible that the social desirability issue was even smaller than originally thought by the authors. [5] CPS also fields the school enrollment supplement every October, in which it asks about grades or year of school \"attending.\" [6] The NSCG baseline survey for the 1990 decade was the 1993 cycle. The NSRCG is a baseline survey every cycle. [7] The baseline survey for the SDR is the SED survey, which uses a different format than the one shown. [8] For a copy of the 1997 NSCG mail survey refer to http://sestat.nsf.gov/. [9] Additional information on the LFSTAT variable is available at http://sestat.nsf.gov/docs/lfstat.html. [10] For a copy of the 1997 NSCG mail survey refer to http://sestat.nsf.gov/ [11] In the SESTAT follow-up surveys, some cases are excluded from the best coding process. The exclusion rule on the 1999 NSCG is as follows: If the 1999 occupation self-code is not 055, 099, 254, 255, or 500, and the 1995 best code, 1997 self code, 1997 best code, and 1999 self-code all have the same code and are not blank, then set the 1999 best code = 1999 self-code and do not send the case to occupation best coding. [12] CPS is scheduled to begin using the 2000 SOC system in 2003. SESTAT occupation coding is also expected to be based on the 2000 SOC codes starting in 2003. [13] CPS caps the allowable range for age at 90-interviewers are instructed to code \"90\" for anyone age 90 or older. SESTAT excludes anyone age 76 or older from the survey system. [14] The current Office of Management and Budget standards on questions about race and ethnicity were not in effect during 1997, the year on which this discussion is based. In evaluating the match between SESTAT and CPS data on race and ethnicity in future years, one would have to consider each survey system's schedule for incorporating the new standards.

A detailed comparison of the procedures used for the two survey systems appears in appendix A. This section presents highlights of the comparison, including both differences and similarities in the data collection procedures and data processing procedures, and in the collection of data on academic degree, employment status, occupation, and other respondent categories."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Procedures", "text": "All SESTAT sample members are asked to provide self-reports. CPS relies heavily on proxy reports; for example, a household respondent may provide information on each eligible household member. Interviewers are encouraged to ask individual household members to self-report on labor force participation. However, interviewers work under tight time constraints and are just as strongly encouraged to collect as much information as possible in one contact. Typically, just under one-half of the CPS data collected on labor force participation are provided by proxies. The two survey systems use different modes of data collection. SESTAT data are collected primarily by mail and telephone, with some follow-up by personal interview. In the 1997 SESTAT, 61% of responses were obtained by mail, 37% by telephone, and 2% by personal interview. Most CPS data are collected through personal interviews during the first and fifth months of participation and through telephone interviews during the other months of participation. SESTAT surveys collected by telephone and personal interviews use computer-assisted telephone and personal interviewing (CATI and CAPI). All CPS data are collected with computer-assisted interviewing. The CATI and CAPI systems used on both SESTAT and CPS conduct internal consistency checks during the survey administration. These computer-generated edit checks produce edit screens that ask the respondent to resolve or clarify discrepancies in the responses. CPS uses \"dependent interviewing,\" in which responses to selected questions collected on each household member during a prior month are used during subsequent rounds of data collection. SESTAT does not use dependent interviewing. Both SESTAT and CPS require respondents to focus on a 1-week period of time (i.e., the reference week) as they answer the survey questions. In 1997, the SESTAT reference week was the week of 15 April 1997. The CPS reference week is always the week of the month that includes the 12th day of the month. This report used CPS data from the week of 12 April 1997. The length of the data collection periods scheduled for the two survey systems are different. CPS collects data for about 1 week after the reference week. SESTAT surveys last for several months after the reference week. Both survey systems have low-item nonresponse rates, especially for employment and occupation items. SESTAT has zero-item nonresponse rates for the questions on working during the reference week, looking for work during the reference week, and occupation because SESTAT defines these items as critical completes that must be answered to include the questionnaire responses in the final data system. The remaining SESTAT question used to determine labor force status, whether the respondent is on layoff from a job, generally has an item nonresponse rate of 1% or less. The item nonresponse rates for January 1997 CPS data are 0.3% for labor force status and 1.7% for occupation. Both SESTAT and CPS include respondents whose primary language is not English. Most SESTAT respondents are graduates of U.S. colleges and therefore have some English language skills. By comparison, CPS includes some respondents with limited English skills and is likely to capture more individuals without U.S. degrees than SESTAT. Language problems in CPS are expected to be more of an issue for respondents without bachelor's degrees than for respondents with bachelor's or higher degrees. CPS uses interviewers who live in the geographic area in which they interview, and some of these interviewers collect data in languages other than English. Interviewers for both SESTAT and CPS receive extensive hands-on training on questionnaire administration, whereas respondents who self-administer the SESTAT questionnaire receive no training.\nThe three surveys included in SESTAT use mail and telephone modes of data collection in different ways. NSCG and SDR were collected using self-administered questionnaires delivered by mail, with CATI telephone follow-up. For a small percentage of NSCG cases, field interviewers visited sample members and conducted a CAPI. Most NSCG and SDR data are collected by mail; in 1997, 79% of NSCG responses and 77% of SDR responses were completed by mail. NSRCG is primarily a CATI survey with some responses collected by mail. In the 1997 NSRCG, 97% of the responses were CATI. [1] For the 1997 SESTAT overall, 61% of responses were obtained by mail, 37% by CATI, and 2% by CAPI. CPS relies on a combination of CAPI and CATI data collection. Sample households are surveyed eight times during a 16-month period. The design calls for each household to be surveyed monthly from month 1 through month 4, and again from month 13 through month 16. CAPI interviews are the primary mode of collection in month 1 and in month 13; telephone interviews (CATI) are conducted in the other 6 months. CPS and SESTAT use computer-assisted technologies to differing degrees. Both the CPS and SESTAT CATI systems conduct internal consistency checks during the survey administration. These computer-generated edit checks produce edit screens that ask the respondent to resolve or clarify any discrepancies in the data. In addition, CPS programs use \"dependent interviewing,\" in which responses to selected questions collected on each household member during a prior month are used during subsequent rounds of data collection. The SESTAT system does not use dependent interviewing. A small number of cross-year edits are conducted using data collected in prior survey cycles, but they are generally conducted after data collection. CPS and SESTAT also differ in the use of proxy respondents; all SESTAT sample members are asked to provide self-reports, whereas CPS relies heavily on proxy reports. The SESTAT mail surveys are addressed to the sample members, who provide the bulk of the survey responses. During telephone follow-up, SESTAT interviewers are allowed to complete the interviews with someone other than the sample member only in special limited situations. [2] Historically, these special situations have represented only a handful of respondents. In CPS, a household respondent is identified at the beginning of each interview. The design features highlighted here could produce differences between estimates from the two survey systems. Although no investigation comparing the two designs has been conducted, methodological research indicates that variation in such design features can alter response patterns. For example, the self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires used in the SESTAT survey system give the respondent control over the order in which questions are presented and answered. In the SESTAT CATI component and in CPS, interviewers retain control of the order in which questions are presented. This difference can affect survey estimates by causing changes to the meaning of the survey questions. Dillman (2000) writes, Schwarz (1996) has detailed how, in the normal give-and-take of regular conversations, people tend to give answers that take into account things they have already said\u2026 Although the carryover is probably most extensive from questions that immediately follow one another, there is limited evidence that effects also occur when questions are widely separated. Consequently, it is important to recognize early on that a questionnaire cannot be viewed as a compilation of completely independent questions that have no effects on one another. Not only must each question be evaluated on the basis of its individual content, but also with regard to the larger context that often adds or subtracts meaning. (p. 91) Differences between the SESTAT and CPS data collection procedures might influence the survey estimates in several other ways, which are explained below. Discussions of these issues can be found in Groves (1989), Biemer (1991), Fowler (1993Fowler ( , 1995, Mangione (1995), and Dillman (2000). However, it is also important to note that the reinterview studies conducted on the SESTAT surveys did not find large differences between the initial interview and the second interview. Although this does not indicate that the respondent-reported information is correct, it does indicate consistency and can be used as a measure of data reliability."}, {"section_title": "Data Processing Procedures", "text": "SESTAT and CPS implement similar data processing procedures. Data from CATI and CAPI interviews are \"examined\" during the interviews through the use of programmed range checks and internal consistency checks. Both survey systems conduct postcollection editing using computerized systems. Although SESTAT and CPS follow many of the same steps in data processing, the techniques and rules for resolving problem cases vary. For example, SESTAT counts as a \"noninterview\" all cases that are missing one or more critical complete items (after attempted telephone follow-up), but CPS has no such rule. Furthermore, the two survey systems have important differences in the coding of occupation, as described in the section \"Occupation Data.\"\nIn many respects, SESTAT and CPS use similar data processing procedures. Data from CATI and CAPI interviews are examined during the interviews through the use of programmed range checks and internal consistency checks. SESTAT mail questionnaires are processed through a sophisticated computer editing system. Both survey systems conduct postcollection editing for range checks and skip error edits using computerized systems. In addition, the SESTAT computer editing system conducts additional checks, including mark-one edits for questions with more than one response marked, consistency edits, and cross-editing with previous cycle data for a small number of items. The SESTAT surveys also conduct computer-assisted backcoding of \"other specify\" responses. SESTAT has additional rules for \"best coding\" for occupation and field of study to correct respondent recording errors, such as not making a code entry or not reviewing the entire list before making a selection. However, coders are not allowed to change the respondent's chosen code unless evidence exists-based on answers to other questions-that the recorded response is incorrect. SESTAT occupation and education codes are assigned using a computer-assisted system. CPS relies heavily on computerized range checks and internal consistency checks that are contained in the CAPI and CATI programs. However, textual responses to questions on industry and occupation are edited and coded by coders using a computer-assisted system. The section \"Occupation\" contains additional information on the collection and processing of occupation data. Although SESTAT and CPS follow many of the same steps in data processing, the techniques and rules for resolving problem cases vary. For example, SESTAT counts as a \"noninterview\" all cases that are missing one or more critical complete items (after attempted telephone follow-up), but CPS has no such rule. Other important differences in the coding of occupation are discussed in the section \"Occupation.\""}, {"section_title": "Academic Degree Data", "text": "To be eligible for SESTAT, a sample member must have completed a bachelor's or higher degree in any field. CPS includes respondents with and without bachelor's or higher degrees. CPS collects the highest level of school or highest degree completed but does not collect any other information about completed degrees, such as field of study. SESTAT collects the college/university, degree level, date, and field of study for degrees at the bachelor's or higher degree level. SESTAT also collects some information on associate's degrees as well as other educational activities. For degree level, both CPS and SESTAT use the same categories of bachelor's, master's, doctorate, and other professional degree, so these data are expected to be consistent across survey systems."}, {"section_title": "Employment Status Data", "text": "Both survey systems gather data on workforce participation, including principal and secondary jobs, during the survey reference week. Although both survey systems ask similar questions about working for pay or profit during the survey reference week, the battery of questions used to determine labor force status are not the same on the two survey systems. The definition of \"employed\" is similar but not identical in the two survey systems. The main difference is that CPS specifically asks about work on a family business or farm and classifies the individual as employed if he or she is working 15 hours or more per week or receiving profits, whereas SESTAT instructs respondents to include self-employment without any limitation of number of hours worked. The two survey systems differ in the definition of \"unemployed.\" For the SESTAT labor force variable, an individual who is not working is classified as unemployed if (1) the person is on layoff from a job or (2) the person was looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the reference week. In CPS, an individual who is not working is classified as unemployed if (1) the person is on layoff from a job and has been given a date to return to work or has been given any indication of being recalled to work within the next 6 months or (2) the person has been trying to find work during the last 4 weeks and lists a job search method that could have brought him or her into contact with a potential employer. Both SESTAT and CPS collect information on full-time or part-time employment status during the survey reference week. In both survey systems, the full-time or part-time status can be determined for either principal job alone or all jobs combined."}, {"section_title": "Occupation Data", "text": "In SESTAT surveys, the respondent is asked to provide both a verbatim description of the occupation and a self-selected occupation code. With CPS, the industry and occupation information are collected using open-ended questions and dependent interviewing. SESTAT occupation coders review the respondent's self-selected code and occupation description, along with many other questionnaire items related to the respondent's job and education, to assign the best code for the occupation. Coders are instructed not to change self-selected codes unless sufficient evidence exists to indicate that the respondent has made a mistake and the information provided allows the assignment of a better code. CPS coders do not have a respondent self-selected code; instead, they assign codes based on the occupation description, job duties, and industry. In the SESTAT survey system, occupation data are collected independently during each survey cycle without dependent interviewing. However, SESTAT coders on follow-up surveys are instructed to consider the best occupation code assigned in the previous cycle under certain conditions. In CPS, dependent interviewing for the industry and occupation questions is used for households that were included in the sample the previous month. Respondents who say they have the same employer and job duties as in the previous month are asked to verify the previous month's job description. If the job description is verified as correct, the previous month's occupation code is brought forward and no occupation coding is conducted. Another important difference is that in CPS the previous data collected are generally 1 month old and in SESTAT the previous data are 2 years old. Different occupational taxonomies are used in the two survey systems. Because both taxonomies were developed from the 1980 Standard Occupational Classification maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the two taxonomies are generally consistent. However, whereas the SESTAT system uses broad categories for non-S&E jobs and more specific categories for S&E jobs, the CPS data are coded in both detailed and broad classifications for all jobs."}, {"section_title": "Other Respondent Classifications", "text": "Respondent characteristics that can be used in analysis include sex, age, race, and ethnicity. SESTAT and CPS collect these data using slightly different methods. The main difference is that CPS collects data by proxy, whereas SESTAT does not use the proxy collection method. Both survey systems collect date of birth, which is coded as \"age\" for analysis. Both survey systems have procedures for resolving inconsistencies between information collected during the current survey cycle and information collected in previous cycles for date of birth. Both SESTAT and CPS ask about race and Hispanic origin in separate questions. The SESTAT data for race and ethnicity come from the sampling frames or the baseline surveys, which include the 1990 decennial census long form for NSCG cases sampled from the 1990 decennial census, the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) for the SDR cases (with verification of responses during the 1993 SDR), and the NSRCG survey each cycle. The questions used to collect race and ethnicity differ slightly between these surveys. The CPS race question is very similar to the NSRCG race question. CPS also collects the verbatim race responses provided by the respondents but edits any such responses back into the four main racial groups. The three SESTAT sources of Hispanic origin data (1990 decennial census, SED, and NSRCG) ask directly whether the respondent is of Hispanic origin (with slightly different wording). In CPS, respondents are asked to select their origin (or the origin of some other household member) from a \"flash card\" that lists 20 ethnic origins. Individuals of Hispanic origin are those who indicated that their origin was Mexican American, Chicano, Mexican (Mexicano), Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic.\nRespondent characteristics that can be used in analysis include sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Again, SESTAT and CPS collect these data using slightly different methods. The main difference is that CPS collects data by proxy but SESTAT does not use this method. Recent studies have shown that people report ethnicity differently (for example, according to a person's age)"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Differences between the SESTAT and CPS data collection procedures might influence the survey estimates, as discussed in detail in appendix A. However, the reinterview studies conducted on the SESTAT surveys did not find large differences between the initial interview and the second interview. Although this does not indicate that the respondent-reported information is correct, it does indicate consistency and can be used as a measure of data reliability. SESTAT and CPS have similar data processing steps and procedures. However, the techniques and rules for resolving problem cases are different for the two survey systems. Some of the main differences are in the coding of occupation. Both CPS and SESTAT collect verbatim occupation descriptions using similar questions, and the coding taxonomies used in the two surveys are generally consistent with each other. However, the rest of the occupation coding process is different. These different processes could result in differences in the data for the two survey systems."}, {"section_title": "Coverage Issues", "text": "This section examines the areas of coverage and estimation. \"SESTAT Coverage\" discusses the coverage issues for SESTAT and provides SESTAT estimates of individuals in S&E occupations. \"CPS Coverage\" discusses the corresponding CPS coverage issues and how CPS can be used to provide estimates of individuals in S&E occupations that are comparable to SESTAT estimates. The CPS coverage also supports estimation of individuals in non-S&E occupations and individuals who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree (those who have an associate's degree or high school diploma as their highest degree level). Although not covered by SESTAT, there has been interest in examining the number and characteristics of individuals in S&E occupations who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree. \"Comparison of Estimates\" examines the compatibility of estimates between SESTAT and CPS and provides CPS estimates of individuals in S&E occupations that are not available in SESTAT. The estimates used data from the 1997 SESTAT[3] and the April 1997 CPS.[4] April 1997 was the reference month for both surveys. Appendix B documents the SESTAT and CPS variables used in this report, the initial frequencies before recoding, and the method used to create derived variables for comparisons. Appendix B includes the following: Table B-1 lists the value codes prior to recoding of variables used to create derived variables for this report, including both CPS and SESTAT variables. Table B-2 describes the derived variables created for this report, including both CPS and SESTAT variables. Tables B-3 to B-5 give unweighted frequencies for SESTAT and CPS variables used to create the derived variables for the report. Table B-3 shows frequencies  of the 1997 SESTAT sample employed in S&E occupations. Tables B-4 and B-5 show frequencies for the April 1997 CPS sample of persons 75 or younger with a bachelor's or higher degree who are employed in S&E and non-S&E occupations. Tables B-6 and B-7 show frequencies for the April 1997 CPS sample of persons 75 or younger with an associate's degree or high school diploma who are employed in S&E and non-S&E occupations. SESTAT and CPS are both sample survey systems and are thus subject to sampling error. In this report, survey estimates are presented with the approximate standard error (SE) to indicate the precision of the estimates. The section \"Sampling Errors\" and appendix C discuss the methods used to compute standard errors of SESTAT and CPS estimates presented in this report. For example, the 1997 SESTAT estimate shows a total of 3,369,400 individuals working in S&E occupations. The SE of this estimate is 26,600 (appendix C, tables C-1 and C-3); the corresponding 95% confidence limits are obtained by adding and subtracting 1.96 times the SE from the survey estimate. This means that with 95% confidence, the \"true\" population is expected to lie between 3,317,300 and 3,421,500. The corresponding CPS estimate of persons with bachelor's or higher degrees employed in S&E occupations is 3,542,100. The SE of this estimate is 101,700 (appendix C, tables C-9 and C-11) and the 95% confidence interval is between 3,342,700 and 3,741,600. [5] The difference between these overall estimates is not statistically significant. However, the SESTAT and CPS estimates are significantly different for some groups and those differences that are significant at the 95% confidence level are indicated in appendix C, tables C-29 and C-31."}, {"section_title": "SESTAT Coverage", "text": "The SESTAT target population (see \"Overview of SESTAT Design\") includes people who meet all of the following conditions as of the survey reference period: Have a bachelor's or higher degree Have at least one S&E degree or do not have an S&E degree but were employed in an S&E occupation [6] Are age 75 or younger Do not live in an institution (e.g., nursing home, prison) Live in the United States as of the survey reference date Table 1 summarizes estimates of the number of individuals in the SESTAT population by subset and year. The table also illustrates the magnitude of changes in the SESTAT population over time as well as coverage problems associated with certain subsets of the SESTAT population. As shown in the first row of the table, the population represented in the total SESTAT data system increased from 11,615,200 in 1993 to 12,530,700 in 1997. However, not all of the 12,530,700 individuals in the 1997 data system are scientists and engineers according to the SESTAT definition. About 276,600 individuals with no S&E degree in the 1997 SESTAT data system (subsets N,H,and J in table 1) were no longer working in S&E occupations in 1997 (but had been doing so in 1993).

Statistics, 1993."}, {"section_title": "SOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources", "text": "Under the current design used for the 1993, 1995, and 1997 SESTAT, certain groups that were originally intended to be in the target population are subject to undercoverage in SESTAT over the decade. One major group that is subject to undercoverage in SESTAT is a special group of immigrants. Immigrants who earned S&E degrees outside of the United States and who were residing in the country in April 1990 were included in the sampling frame for the 1993 NSCG. However, immigrants who earned S&E degrees outside of the United States and then entered the country after April 1990 are not covered in the SESTAT integrated data system unless they later earned an S&E degree from a U.S. institution. Immigrants who earned S&E degrees at a U.S. institution either before or after April 1990 are covered in the SESTAT integrated data system. Since it is not possible with the current SESTAT sampling frames to include foreign-trained individuals in SESTAT after April 1990 (unless they earn an S&E degree from a U.S. institution after entering the U.S.), the estimated population counts shown in table 1 understate the true numbers. Until provisions are made to supplement the SESTAT sample with foreign-trained scientists and engineers with no U.S. degree, the undercoverage of this subset will obviously increase over time. A rough estimate of the size of this omitted group is provided in the section \"CPS Coverage.\" The other major group subject to undercoverage in SESTAT includes individuals with a non-S&E degree who are employed in S&E occupations. This group would ordinarily be included in subset M of table 1. Starting with an estimated 593,600 individuals in the 1993 SESTAT, the numbers in subset M have decreased to 334,100 NOTES: After 1993 SESTAT surveys identified individuals for inclusion at point of earning an S&E degree from a U.S. institution, therefore two subpopulations of U.S. scientists and engineers are underrepresented in SESTAT integrated data system in 1995 and subsequent survey years: (1) new immigrants with degrees earned outside United States who entered the U.S. labor force after 1990, and (2) people with no S&E degrees in S&E occupations after 1993 (Box M in the diagram). Other individuals could be considered part of the population of scientists and engineers, e.g., individuals in technical occupations with 2-year degrees or other types of training. These individuals not included in SESTAT integrated data system, nor represented in this diagram. in 1995 and to 292,000 in 1997. This subset has diminished over time because the current SESTAT sampling frames do not allow any additions to the group. Specifically, the sample frames do not allow the identification of (1) individuals who earned non-S&E degrees after April 1990 and then obtained S&E jobs, (2) individuals who earned non-S&E degrees before April 1990 but then moved to S&E jobs after 1993, and (3) immigrants after April 1990 with only foreign-earned non-S&E degrees who entered S&E jobs in the United States. Even the estimated number of individuals with non-S&E degrees for 1993 is an understatement because individuals receiving non-S&E bachelor's or higher degrees between 1990 and 1993 who were working in S&E occupations in 1993 are not included in the 1993 SESTAT estimate. Although it is not possible to estimate the extent of the undercoverage of the population with non-S&E degrees using the SESTAT data, differences in the number of individuals in subset M of table 1 over the three survey cycles may provide some indication. For example, assuming conservatively that the actual number of individuals with non-S&E degrees who are working in S&E remains at roughly the 1993 level (i.e., 593,600 individuals), at least 259,500 would be excluded from the 1995 SESTAT (the difference between the numbers in 1993 and 1995), and 301,600 would be excluded from the 1997 SESTAT (the difference between the numbers in 1993 and 1997). Although these numbers of excluded individuals are relatively small in comparison to the total S&E population in SESTAT, they represent a significant portion of the subset of individuals without S&E degrees who work in S&E occupations. To summarize, the groups that are conceptually part of the target population but are subject to undercoverage after 1993 in SESTAT include the following: Individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree who were living abroad as of the 1990 decennial census (in April 1990), later came to live in the United States, and did not earn an S&E bachelor's or higher degree from a United States institution after 1 April 1990 Individuals living in the United States as of the 1990 decennial census who did not have a bachelor's or higher degree but who earned an S&E degree after 1 April 1990, from a foreign institution only Individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree in a non-S&E field as of the 1990 decennial census who were not working in an S&E occupation in 1993 but who later moved into an S&E occupation (and did not receive an S&E degree from a U.S. institution) Individuals who did not have a bachelor's or higher degree in April 1990 but earned a non-S&E degree (in the United States or another country) after April 1990 and later moved into an S&E occupation in the United States Analysts using the SESTAT data system may decide to restrict the S&E population to individuals with S&E degrees or, alternatively, to individuals currently working in S&E occupations. In doing so, the implications of the undercoverage will be different. For example, if the S&E population is restricted to include only individuals with S&E degrees, the undercoverage in SESTAT of individuals with non-S&E degrees who are working in S&E occupations is no longer a concern. The S&E population in SESTAT includes active duty military personnel living in the United States. (Military personnel living outside the United States during the survey  reference week are excluded from SESTAT, as are any individuals not residing in the  United States.) Table 2 shows counts of the SESTAT population for civilians and military personnel in the United States. The total number of military personnel is 94,500, less than 1% of the 1997 SESTAT population."}, {"section_title": "CPS Coverage", "text": "The target population for CPS is the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Individuals residing in group quarters (e.g., college dormitories, retirement homes, and communes) are included in CPS if the group quarters are classified as civilian and noninstitutional. CPS includes only the \"civilian\" labor force. Active duty military personnel are generally excluded from CPS regardless of whether they are stationed in the United States or overseas. (An exception is the March CPS Supplement, for which military personnel residing in households with another adult civilian are eligible.) See U.S. Census Bureau (2000)[7] for a discussion of CPS coverage issues. Although the goal of the CPS sample design is to give all U.S. residents a nonzero probability of selection for the survey, coverage of 100% is rarely achieved. Noncoverage results from errors in almost every phase of data collection from listing, sampling, and enumerating households to locating and interviewing respondents. Historically, the effect of these errors in CPS (like many other national surveys using area probability sampling designs) has been to understate the number of people in the United States. An indication of the amount of undercoverage for a specific subgroup of the population is given by the \"coverage ratio.\" The coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of the estimated number of individuals (as estimated from the sample) to the corresponding \"known\" population total derived from independent sources. For the 1996 CPS, the overall coverage ratio is estimated to be 93%. This can be interpreted to mean that about 7% of the U.S. population is not covered in the CPS data collection. The CPS coverage ratios also vary by race/ethnicity, age, and sex (see t  e  s  b  u  S   S&E degree  status   S&E occupational  status  Labor force status   a  n  a  n  a  n  0  0  5  ,  4  9  0  0  2  ,  6  3  4  ,  2  1  0  0  7  ,  0  3  5  ,  2  1  s  n  o  i  t  a  l  u  p  o  p  l  l  A  S&E population (D+E+K+L+M  276,600 274,900 1,700  figure 1 for definition of subsets.

(92%) than for females (96%). The younger age groups (particularly individuals in their 20s and 30s and younger black males) have much lower coverage rates than older individuals. CPS uses weighting adjustment and poststratification to independent population totals to compensate for undercoverage (see the section \"Weighting and Estimation\"). This procedure forces the aggregate count of individuals in the sample to agree with the independent totals. However, it does not guarantee that biases resulting from the undercoverage are adequately eliminated. For example, it is not known how the differential undercoverage will affect estimates of the number of individuals with S&E degrees or the number who are employed in S&E occupations. A limitation of CPS relative to SESTAT is that CPS does not collect data about S&E degrees. Comparisons of SESTAT and CPS estimates are restricted to individuals in S&E occupations. Comparisons by S&E degree are not possible. For example, CPS cannot provide separate estimates of individuals with an associate's degree in S&E who are not working in S&E occupations. However, CPS can provide estimates of the number of individuals in S&E and non-S&E occupations and for individuals with an associate's degree who are employed in S&E occupations. Table 3 shows CPS estimates of the number and percentage of individuals age 75 or younger in S&E and non-S&E occupations by highest degree attained, including degree levels above and below a bachelor's degree. An estimated 17% of individuals in S&E occupations have an associate's degree as their highest education level, and 5% have a high school diploma. The percentages of individuals in non-S&E occupations at these education levels are 33% and 39%, respectively. By employment status, 93% of individuals in S&E occupations are full-time workers, compared with 81% of individuals in non-S&E occupations. Table 4 compares weighted counts of individuals in the April 1997 CPS who were age 75 or younger, had a bachelor's or higher degree, and were employed in an S&E occupation with the corresponding counts from the 1997 SESTAT. The SESTAT estimate of the number of civilian workers employed in S&E occupations is 3,346,200 (SE = 26,600). The corresponding CPS estimate is 3,542,100   Bureau 2000, table 16-1). Coverage ratios tend to be lower for blacks (84%) and Hispanics (83%) than for whites (94%) and are generally lower for males Table 5 shows April 1997 CPS estimates of the number of bachelor's or higher degree recipients employed in S&E occupations by educational attainment and whether they entered the United States before 1990. Table 6 shows the corresponding estimates by S&E occupational group. Among the 3.54 million individuals in S&E occupations, about 210,200 (6%) entered the United States during or after 1990. This estimate of 210,200 (SE = 25,000) provides a crude upper boundary on the immigrant portion of the foreign-trained group that is excluded from SESTAT. The actual number of excluded immigrants is likely to be lower than 210,200 because individuals who received an S&E degree from a U.S. institution after April 1990 would be covered in SESTAT through the NSRCG or SDR. Those who entered the United States between January and April 1990 are also covered in SESTAT. The percentage of recent immigrants varies by educational level and by occupational groups. This percentage was higher among people with postgraduate degrees than among bachelor's degree recipients and higher among life scientists than other S&E occupations.

The inclusion of individuals without a college degree has the largest effect on estimates for computer and mathematical scientists and engineers, increasing the total counts by 37% and 32%, respectively. Appendix D lists the number of individuals in S&E occupations by educational level, S&E occupational group, and detailed occupational code."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Estimates", "text": "This section provides comparisons of SESTAT and CPS estimates of individuals employed in S&E occupations with and without coverage adjustments. Three coverage differences are noted. First, SESTAT included individuals employed in military service, and CPS did not include this group. Second, SESTAT did not include new immigrants who entered the United States after April 1990 (and who did not receive a bachelor's or higher S&E degree from a U.S. institution after entry into the country), and CPS did include this group. Third, SESTAT did not include individuals in S&E occupations who did not have a bachelor's or higher degree, whereas CPS did. Table 8 shows SESTAT and CPS estimates of the numbers of bachelor's or higher degree recipients in S&E occupations by highest degree attained, employment status, and S&E occupational group. [8] As mentioned earlier, the SESTAT estimate shows a total of 3.37 million graduates (civilian and military) in S&E occupations (SE= 26,600). The CPS estimate shows a total of 3.54 million civilians (SE = 101,700). The difference between these two overall estimates is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. By occupational group and degree attainment, some differences exist that are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. By occupational group, the SESTAT estimate is significantly higher than the CPS estimate for the number of life scientists (126% of CPS estimate) and significantly lower for engineers (89% of CPS estimate). By degree attainment, the SESTAT estimate is significantly lower than the CPS estimate for bachelor's degree recipients (92% of CPS estimate) and significantly higher for doctorate recipients (118% of CPS estimate). One factor that could explain the differences in the doctorate estimates is better coverage of U.S. doctorate recipients that are included in SESTAT from the SDR component. [9] About 752,500 individuals (SE = 47,300) in S&E occupations had an associate's degree, and another 245,100 (SE = 27,000) had a high school diploma (or occupational groups. The total count, including individuals whose highest educational level is an associate's degree or high school diploma, is about 4.54 million, which is 28% more than the total of 3.54 million individuals with bachelor's or higher degrees. Table 9 shows SESTAT and CPS estimates after \"adjusting\" for known differences between them. In this table, military personnel are excluded from SESTAT estimates and recent immigrants (individuals entering the United States in 1990 or later) are excluded from CPS estimates. These adjustments are imperfect because some of the excluded immigrants in CPS could have received an S&E bachelor's or higher degree in the United States after 1990 or could have entered the United States in 1990 by 15 April and would thus be included in SESTAT. In other words, to be comparable, the same set of recent immigrants should also be excluded from the SESTAT estimates; however, this is not possible with the collected data. Nonetheless, the results are interesting because they indicate the effect recent immigrants may have on the S&E population. For example, the CPS estimate for number of individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree employed in S&E occupations is 3,542,100 (SE = 101,700) overall and 3,332,000 (SE = 98,700) if those who entered the United States during or after 1990 are excluded.  The adjusted estimates in table 9 show that the number of individuals working in S&E occupations is roughly the same in both surveys. The SESTAT estimate is 3.35 million (SE= 26,600)and the CPS estimate is 3.33 million (SE = 98,700). The differences between the SESTAT and CPS estimates by occupational group and educational level are generally consistent with and without these coverage adjustments. However, two groups affected by these adjustments are life scientists and doctorate recipients. In both cases, the difference between the SESTAT estimate and CPS estimate increased.  with degrees and without degrees. Moreover, although the NSCG component of SESTAT included an initial poststratification adjustment to 1990 census counts, there has been no comparable adjustment in SESTAT. Table 11 shows estimates from the two data sources after excluding from SESTAT persons in military service and excluding from CPS immigrants who entered the United States during or after 1990. The differences in estimates by age group are consistent with the differences without the adjustments. After coverage adjustments, the SESTAT estimates by sex are not significantly different than the CPS estimates. By race/ethnicity, the exclusion of new immigrants from CPS had a large effect on the estimated number of Asians (decreasing from 381,200 to 263,700). One of the main coverage differences between SESTAT and CPS is that CPS includes individuals in S&E occupations who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree and SESTAT does not include this group. Table 12 shows the CPS estimates of this subgroup by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Of the estimated 997,600 individuals in this subgroup (SE = 54,400), the majority have an associate's degree (see table 7) and most are employed in computer and mathematical sciences or engineering occupations. Compared with individuals who have a bachelor's or higher degree, somewhat greater proportions of individuals in S&E occupations who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree are female and age 40 or older. Additional detailed breakouts by occupation are given in appendix E, which shows that more than 78% of the 394,100 individuals who do not have a bachelor's degree but who are employed in  Using CPS data, table 13 compares the characteristics of individuals in S&E occupations who have an associate's degree or high school diploma and the characteristics of individuals with the same degree attainment in non-S&E occupations. By sex and race/ethnicity, 73% of individuals in S&E occupations are male, 4% are Hispanic, and 7% are black. By employment status, a greater percentage of individuals in S&E occupations work full time than individuals in non-S&E occupations. This trend is consistent for all individuals in S&E occupations, including those both below and above the bachelor's degree level (see table 3). the broad computer and mathematical science category are computer systems analysts and scientists and the majority of the 487,600 engineers are employed either as electrical/electronic engineers or mechanical engineers.  In conclusion, to compare SESTAT and CPS estimates it is possible to adjust for some coverage differences. Three coverage differences are noted. First, SESTAT includes individuals employed in military service and CPS does not include this group. Second, SESTAT omits new immigrants who entered the United States after April 1990 (and who did not receive a bachelor's or higher S&E degree from a U.S. institution after entry into the country) and CPS does not omit this group. Third, SESTAT does not include individuals in S&E occupations who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree. The adjusted estimates for total number of individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree working in S&E occupations is roughly the same in both surveys when those in military service are excluded from SESTAT and immigrants who entered the United States during or after 1990 are excluded from CPS. The main differences in estimates from the two data sources among this adjusted group are by age and race/ethnicity and for life scientists and doctorate recipients. CPS can provide estimates of the number of individuals in S&E occupations without a bachelor's or higher degree that are not available in SESTAT. In the April 1997 CPS sample, 431 individuals without a bachelor's or higher degree were working in S&E occupations (appendix C, table C-18). On a weighted basis, these 431 individuals from the sample represent about 997,600 individuals without bachelor's degrees who are working in S&E occupations (SE= 54,400; appendix C, table C-17). Almost 90% of these people were employed as computer/math scientists or engineers."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Issues Sample Design", "text": "Both SESTAT and CPS are based on sample surveys that use complex probability sample designs. As such they are subject to various limitations. As described in the section \"SESTAT Coverage,\" the main limitation of the SESTAT design is that over time it excludes an increasingly larger part of the target S&E population. In addition, SESTAT currently excludes individuals who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree. CPS, on the other hand, by definition excludes individuals in the military (a group covered in SESTAT). Because CPS is based on an area probability sample, it is also subject to undercoverage of certain subgroups of the civilian population (see the section \"CPS Coverage\"). Thus, an important distinction between the designs for the two studies is related to coverage issues. As long as these differences are recognized, the results from CPS and SESTAT can be analyzed and compared despite the fact that the SESTAT and CPS sample designs are different. Some additional factors that have a bearing on the ability to make comparisons across the studies follow. These factors include nonresponse and imputation, weighting and estimation, and sampling errors."}, {"section_title": "Nonresponse and Imputation", "text": "Nonresponse (both unit and item nonresponse) is a concern in both SESTAT and CPS because it can introduce biases of unknown magnitude in the survey estimates. Although weighting adjustments are made in both SESTAT and CPS to compensate for nonresponse, it is unlikely that the biases are completely eliminated. However, even if the characteristics of the nonrespondents are different from those of the respondents, the effect of nonresponse on the survey estimates will be minimal if nonresponse rates are relatively low and are not highly variable among demographic groups. In other words, the higher the nonresponse rate, the greater the potential for serious biases in the survey estimates. Table 14 shows the unweighted unit response rate for SESTAT components in 1993SESTAT components in , 1995SESTAT components in , and 1997. For the NSCG, the response rates in 1995 and 1997 were conditional on prior respondent status in 1993. The 1993 NSCG response rate was 80%; only respondents of the 1993 NSCG were eligible for subsequent cycles. That is, there was no follow-up of nonrespondents from one cycle to the next. The conditional NSCG response rates for 1995 and 1997 were 95% and 94%, respectively. The unconditional response rate for the 1997 NSCG (i.e., the cumulative response rate for all three cycles) was approximately 71%. The response rates for the NSRCG and the SDR are unconditional response rates computed independently at each cycle. The unconditional response rates for the 1997 NSRCG and SDR were 82% and 84%, respectively. The CPS unit response rates are generally higher than the SESTAT response rates, ranging from 91% to 94% per month (e.g., see U.S. Census Bureau 2000 and the CPS website [10]). The lower response rates in SESTAT raise the concern that the potential for bias resulting from unit nonresponse is greater for SESTAT than for CPS. However, SESTAT has fairly complete and rich data on demographics and degrees that are used for nonresponse adjustment to attenuate nonresponse biases. Because CPS nonresponse and poststratification adjustments are made without regard to degree status, the effect of the CPS adjustments for subsets of individuals with degrees is unknown. Item nonresponse can also have adverse effects on survey data. The extent of item nonresponse is relatively minor for both SESTAT and CPS. In CPS, item nonresponse is generally low for demographic and labor force items (about 1% or less). In SESTAT, only those questionnaires that provide complete data for all \"critical\" items relating to degrees and occupation were considered to be completed questionnaires (i.e., respondents). Thus, by definition, there was no item nonresponse among respondents for the critical items. Any nonresponse in SESTAT is included in the unit response rates discussed above. For the noncritical items, item nonresponse rates are generally low. For example, the item nonresponse rates for variables included in this evaluation were approximately 1% or less. Both SESTAT and CPS use hotdeck methods to impute missing data items. SESTAT uses hotdeck imputation after some logical edit imputation is completed."}, {"section_title": "Weighting and Estimation", "text": "Both SESTAT and CPS require the use of weights to inflate the sample results to population levels. The purpose of the weights is to compensate for variable probabilities of selection, differential response rates, and undercoverage. All of the population estimates presented in this report are weighted estimates using person-level weights available in public-use files. Although some aspects of weighting have varied from year to year, the main features of the weighting procedures used in SESTAT can be summarized as follows: In the 1993 NSCG, nonresponse adjustment was incorporated in the poststratification adjustment used to adjust the weights to match the population counts of the 1990 census. In 1995 and subsequent years, there was a separate adjustment for nonresponse. In addition, in 1995 an adjustment was made to account for the cases subsampled out after the CATI phase. In the 1993, 1995, and 1997 NSRCG, two separate adjustments were made. The first one was a poststratification adjustment that was applied to the (first-stage) institution weight. For this adjustment, a ratio was calculated using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) [11] data in each of the 12 ratio-adjustment strata based on degree level and major field. For each ratio, the numerator was the sum of the number of degrees awarded over all institutions in the universe (i.e., in IPEDS), and the denominator was the weighted sum of degrees awarded in the sampled responding institutions as reported in IPEDS using the institution nonresponse-adjusted weight. The resulting (poststratified) institution weight was then used to develop an initial person-level weight, which was subsequently adjusted for survey nonresponse within designated weighting classes. In the 1993, 1995, and 1997 SDR, the base weights were adjusted for nonresponse within specified weighting classes. A nonresponse adjustment factor was calculated for each sampling cell; it was equal to the ratio of sample cases in the sampling cell to the number of usable responses in the sampling cell. If a nonresponse adjustment factor exceeded a prespecified ratio, collapsing procedures were used, i.e., the cell was combined with other cells with similar characteristics on the variables used for stratification. If this failed to provide adequate safeguards on the range of weights, the nonresponse adjustment weight was constrained to equal the maximum allowable rate. There was no additional poststratification of the nonresponse-adjusted weights. Each survey database (NSCG, NSRCG, and SDR) was designed to be combined with the other two surveys to capture the advantages of a larger sample size and greater coverage of the target population. However, combining the three databases meant that the issue of cross-survey multiplicity had to be addressed. That is, scientists and engineers in SESTAT could belong to the surveyed population of more than one component survey, depending on their degrees and when they were received. For example, someone with a bachelor's degree at the time of the 1990 census who went on to complete a master's degree in 1991 could be selected in the 1993 NSCG and the 1993 NSRCG. The following unique-linkage rule was devised to remove these multiple-selection opportunities: each member of SESTAT's target population is uniquely linked to one and only one component survey, and that individual is included in SESTAT only when he or she is selected for the linked survey. As a result, each person had only one chance of being selected into the combined SESTAT database. The priority for determining overlap used the hierarchy SDR, NSRCG, and NSCG. For individuals in SDR, their analysis weight was set equal to their SDR final weight. In NSRCG, the analysis weight was set to zero for individuals who had a chance of selection in SDR. In NSCG, the analysis weight was set to zero for individuals who had a chance of selection in either SDR or NSRCG. For the remaining individuals who did not have a chance of selection in the other components, their analysis weight was the same as their survey component final weight. For analyses of the CPS data, weights have been developed that reflect probabilities of selection and include both nonresponse adjustments and poststratification adjustments to current population counts. As described in detail in U.S. Census Bureau (2000), chapter 10, the weights derived for analysis of CPS data include the following components: A base weight equal to the reciprocal of the probability of selecting a household for the sample. Individuals in a household use the same base weight. The base weight reflects adjustments for special sampling situations such as periodic sample reductions and in-field subsampling designed to control workload. An adjustment for nonresponse. This adjustment is made at the household level within cells defined by geography and metropolitan status. Ratio adjustment to known population distributions. This adjustment is done in two stages. In the first stage, weighted counts of the sampled noncertainty primary sampling units within each state are adjusted to agree with the corresponding statewide population totals by race. In the second stage, person-level weights are adjusted (poststratified) to independent population control totals by state; cross-classification by sex, age, and Hispanic origin; and cross-classification by sex, age, and race (black and other). In conclusion, CPS adjusts weights by geographic area and demographic characteristics such as sex, age, race, and ethnicity. SESTAT adjusts weights by degree level and field as well as demographic characteristics such as sex, race/ethnicity, disability status, and citizenship."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Errors", "text": "All of the estimates cited in this report are based on sample data and are thus subject to sampling errors. Both SESTAT and CPS publish generalized variance functions (GVFs) that can be used to estimate the standard error of an estimated total. These GVFs have been used to obtain the standard errors of the estimates presented in this report. For example, table 15 shows the standard errors and the coefficients of variation (CV) of estimates of individuals working in S&E occupations by highest degree attained for SESTAT and CPS. CV is the standard error divided by the estimated total expressed as a percentage. As shown in the table, the standard errors for SESTAT estimates are considerably smaller than those for the corresponding CPS estimates. This is a reflection of the samples size for the two studies (see table 16). Thus, although CPS can provide useful information about the S&E population, detailed analyses are severely limited by the comparatively large sampling errors. In particular, analysis by subgroups, such as detailed occupation (e.g., economists) or demographic groups (e.g., women and minorities), is limited, even if several months of CPS data are accumulated. For additional information about the standard errors of the SESTAT and CPS estimates and corresponding subgroup sample sizes, see appendix C. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The two main purposes of this report are (1) to compare the SESTAT and CPS estimates of the S&E workforce with bachelor's or higher degrees and 2to obtain estimates from CPS of the numbers of individuals in S&E occupations who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree. For the first purpose, comparisons between SESTAT and CPS were restricted to the subset of the S&E population with bachelor's or higher degrees who are working in S&E occupations. The remainder of the SESTAT population, people with S&E degrees who are not working in S&E occupations, cannot be identified using CPS data because CPS does not collect the data on degree fields needed to identify S&E degrees. Therefore, no comparisons between SESTAT and CPS could be made for this group. CPS was used for the second purpose because individuals without a bachelor's or higher degree are not included in SESTAT. The principal findings and conclusions of this study are summarized below. SESTAT is a longitudinal data system that follows a large sample of individuals (about 100,000 in the 1997 cycle) with S&E bachelor's or higher degrees or S&E occupations over time. It is a rich data system for analyses of these individuals. CPS is a major survey that provides up-to-date information on the labor force and demographic characteristics of the general, civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. SESTAT includes individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree and CPS includes these individuals along with those who have a degree below a bachelor's. This report points out differences in the two data sources and explores the possible use of the CPS data to provide limited information about individuals below a bachelor's degree who are employed in S&E occupations."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "Differences exist in the mode in which SESTAT and CPS data are collected, which may affect nonsampling errors. In the 1997 SESTAT, 61% of responses were obtained by mail, 37% by CATI, and 2% by CAPI. CPS uses a combination of CAPI and CATI collection; CAPI is used during the first and fifth months of participation and CATI is used in the other months of participation. SESTAT and CPS also differ in the use of proxy respondents; all SESTAT sample members are asked to provide self-reports, whereas CPS relies heavily on proxy reports. However, it is unlikely that there is an appreciable mode effect for the items considered in this analysis."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "Differences exist in the way information on educational attainment, occupation, and certain demographic data are collected and coded in the respective survey systems. Some of these differences are summarized as follows: In the collection of data on degrees, the main difference between CPS and SESTAT is that CPS collects the highest level of school or degree completed and does not collect the field of degree, whereas SESTAT collects the school, degree level, date, and field for degrees at the bachelor's or higher level. SESTAT also collects some information on associate's degrees. The occupation-coding process is different for the two survey systems. In CPS initial interviews, coders assign occupation codes using verbatim descriptions of the occupation, job duties, and industry. During follow-up months, dependent interviewing is used in CPS and data collected and coded during previous months may be used without coder review. In SESTAT, respondents provide verbatim responses and then select their own occupation codes, either from a printed list or through a series of 3. CATI screens. Coders review these verbatims and self-selected codes along with other survey data, but they change the respondent's code only when sufficient information exists to allow the assignment of a better code. Different occupational taxonomies are used in the two survey systems, but they were derived from the same source and are generally consistent with each other. Both SESTAT and CPS collect data on race in a similar manner, but the collection of data on ethnicity is different. The three SESTAT sources of Hispanic-origin data (1990 census, SED, NSRCG) ask directly whether the respondent is of Hispanic origin (with slightly different wording). In CPS, respondents are asked to select their origin (or the origin of some other household member) from a \"flash card\" listing 20 ethnic origins. Individuals of Hispanic origin are those who indicate their origin is Mexican American, Chicano, Mexican (Mexicano), Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic. That is, Hispanic origin is self-reported in SESTAT and coded from origin data in CPS. The total S&E population in the 1997 SESTAT includes more than 12 million individuals who (1) have a bachelor's or higher degree in an S&E field or 2have a bachelor's or higher degree in a non-S&E field and had worked in an S&E occupation in the 1993 NSCG. The definition of the S&E population in SESTAT depends on both degree field(s) and occupation. CPS, which is based on a nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States, provides an alternative source for studying the S&E population. However, CPS does not collect data on degree field. Thus, although CPS conceptually covers the same S&E population as SESTAT (with the exceptions noted below), it can only be used to study a subset of the S&E population, namely, the roughly 3 million individuals with bachelor's or higher degrees who are employed in S&E occupations. CPS can also be used to obtain estimates for the population working in S&E occupations without a bachelor's or higher degree.\nLAST WEEK, did you do any unpaid work in the family business or farm? If 2 and 3 are both \"no,\" ask 4."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "The coverage of the S&E population in SESTAT and CPS differs in several ways: SESTAT does not cover a portion of \"foreign-trained\" scientists and engineers, that is, U.S. residents who (1) were not eligible for inclusion in the 1993 NSCG who received an S&E bachelor's or higher degree from a non-U.S. institution only or 2 of SESTAT). It also includes those who entered the United States between January and April 1990 and thus would be covered in NSCG. Therefore, the estimated 210,200 recent immigrants (SE = 25,000) provide a rough upper boundary on the number of immigrants from 1990 or later who are excluded from SESTAT. The SESTAT data system indicates that an estimated 594,000 individuals with non-S&E bachelor's or higher degrees were employed in S&E occupations in 1993 (table 1). The SESTAT estimate for this group decreased to 334,100 in 1995, and then to 292,000 in 1997. The drop-off reflects the fact that the SESTAT design does not include provisions for updating the original sample of those in S&E occupations who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree in an S&E field. Assuming that the actual number of such individuals has not decreased since 1993, an estimated 302,000 or more people may not have been covered in the 1997 SESTAT data system.\nLAST WEEK, were you on layoff from a job? If 5 is \"yes,\" ask 6. If 5 is \"no,\" ask 8."}, {"section_title": "7.", "text": "After accounting for the coverage differences noted earlier to the extent feasible, weighted estimates of the numbers of individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree who are employed in S&E occupations derived from the two data sources are roughly comparable for 1997: the SESTAT estimate is 3.35 million (SE = 26,600) and the CPS estimate is 3.33 million (SE= 98,700; table 9).\nHave you been doing anything to find work during the last 4 weeks? If \"yes,\" ask 9."}, {"section_title": "8.", "text": "Individuals who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree who are working in S&E occupations are not included in SESTAT by definition. In the April 1997 CPS sample, only 431 individuals without 4-year college degrees were working in S&E occupations (appendix C, table C-18). On a weighted basis, these 431 sample individuals represent about 997,600 individuals without bachelor's degrees who are working in S&E occupations (SE= 54,400; table 12). The majority of these people were employed in computer/mathematics or engineering occupations.\nWhat are all of the things you have done to find work during the last 4 weeks? Individuals are classified as employed if they say \"yes\" to questions 9.  Despite these differences, the definition of \"employed\" is similar in the two survey systems. In CPS, an individual is classified as employed if during the reference week (1) the person did any work for pay or profit; (2) the person did unpaid work in a family business or farm and worked 15 hours or more per week or received profits; or (3) the person had a job, including any job from which he or she was temporarily absent. For the SESTAT labor force variable (LFSTAT), an individual is classified as employed if he or she was working for pay or profit during the reference week, including being self-employed or temporarily absent from a job, even if unpaid. The main difference is that CPS specifically asks about work on a family business or farm and classifies the individual as employed if working 15 hours or more per week or receiving profits, whereas SESTAT simply instructs the individual to include self-employment. The two survey systems contain additional differences in how they define \"unemployed.\" In CPS, an individual who is not working is classified as unemployed if (1) the person is on layoff from a job and has been given a date to return to work or has been given any indication of being recalled to work within the next 6 months or (2) the person has been trying to find work during the last 4 weeks and lists a job search method that could have brought him or her into contact with a potential employer. For the SESTAT labor force variable, an individual who is not working is classified as unemployed if (1) the person is on layoff from a job or (2) the person was looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the reference week. Both SESTAT and CPS collect information on full-time or part-time employment status during the survey reference week. In both survey systems, full-time or part-time status can be determined for either principal job alone or for all jobs combined. CPS collects the number of hours worked per week on the main job and the number of hours worked per week on all other jobs. SESTAT collects the number of hours worked per week on the main job and the full-time or part-time status for all jobs combined. In this report, full time is defined as working 35 or more hours per week for all jobs combined. The following questions are used to collect full-time and part-time employment data: What (are/were) (your/his/her) usual activities or duties at this job? Dependent interviewing for the industry and occupation questions is used for households that were included in the sample the previous month. Respondents are provided with the name of the employer they provided in the previous month and asked if they still work for that employer. If the answer is \"no,\" respondents are asked the independent questions on industry and occupation. If the answer is \"yes,\" respondents are asked, \"Have the usual activities and duties of your job changed since last month?\" If the answer is \"yes,\" the duties have changed, then the respondents are asked the independent questions on occupation and activities or duties. If the duties have not changed, then the respondents are asked to verify the previous month's description through the question, \"Last month, you were reported as (previous month's occupation or kind of work performed) and your usual activities were (previous month's duties). Is this an accurate description of your current job?\" If the answer is \"yes,\" the previous month's occupation is brought forward and no coding is required. If the answer is \"no,\" respondents are asked the independent questions on occupation activities and duties. After collection, the new monthly CPS cases and cases in which the industry or occupation changed from the previous month are sent for coding by the industry/occupation coders. These specialized coders use a computer-assisted coding system and assign codes based primarily on the respondent-provided verbatim occupation, industry sector, and job duties. Ten percent of each month's cases are selected to go through a quality assurance system to evaluate the work of each coder. The selected cases are verified by another coder after the monthly processing is completed. CPS coders have a short time to complete their work and are evaluated on speed. They may also be penalized for inconsistent coding identified during the quality assurance process. In the SESTAT surveys, the respondent is asked to provide two types of occupation information: (1) a verbatim description of the occupation and (2) a self-selected occupation code. First, the respondent is asked to describe his or her occupation in an open-ended question format. In the mail questionnaire, the respondent is then asked to select a job code from a printed list of approximately 120 codes. These SESTAT codes are organized in categories listed in alphabetical order by major occupational group. The questions used on the mail survey to collect occupation are as follows: In the SESTAT CATI survey, the respondents are first asked for the verbatim occupation description, as in the mail survey. The SESTAT interviewers are trained to collect as detailed a response as possible, including a job title. The CATI system then uses an occupation dictionary that was developed for the SESTAT system. Once the interviewer has finished collecting the occupation verbatim and description data, the CATI system compares the description to the occupation dictionary. This dictionary contains two sections, an autocoding section and a branching section. If the description matches an occupation in the autocoding section, CATI will automatically assign the appropriate three-digit SESTAT occupation code, and no additional occupation information is collected from the respondent. If the description matches an occupation in the branching section, CATI will display the appropriate screen that offers a reduced number of categories. The respondent will then be asked to select the category on that screen that best describes his or her occupation. Based on this selection, CATI assigns the appropriate three-digit code or proceeds through a sequence of additional occupation coding screens until a code can be assigned. If the occupation description does not match any of the dictionary items, then CATI will display the standard main heading screen. This screen offers the respondent a choice of eight main headings, such as \"sales or marketing\" or \"scientific or engineering occupations,\" as well as an \"other\" option. The respondent will be asked to select a main heading. CATI will then continue to display occupation coding screens until a three-digit code can be assigned. The code assigned through one of these processes is considered the respondent's self-selected occupation code. After survey collection, both mail and CATI SESTAT surveys undergo a \"best coding\" process; the purpose is to verify the respondent's self-reported occupation code. [11] Trained occupation coders assign a \"best code\" to each occupation after considering the open-ended response and self-selected code provided by the respondent, as well as other relevant survey data such as employer type, number of people supervised, educational degrees, work activities, and salary. Coders receive detailed training and instructions, and at least 10% of their work is verified. SESTAT coders are encouraged to take the time needed to review and analyze all the available information and choose the best code. Coders are not penalized for choosing a different code than the one chosen during verification. In the SESTAT surveys, occupation data are collected independently during each survey cycle. Unlike CPS, no dependent interviewing is used for SESTAT occupation data collection. However, SESTAT coders on follow-up surveys are instructed to consider the best occupation code assigned in the previous cycle under certain conditions: the respondent reports working for the same employer and in the same job as the previous cycle, the start date of the current job is before the reference date of the previous cycle, and the previous and current verbatim descriptions appear reasonably similar. The difference between CPS and SESTAT is that SESTAT coders are trained to consider the previous code, whereas CPS uses the previous code without review by a coder. Another important difference is that the previous CPS data are generally 1 month old, whereas the previous SESTAT data are 2 years old. Different occupational taxonomies are used in CPS and SESTAT, but both taxonomies were developed from the 1980 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [12] Therefore, the two taxonomies are generally consistent. However, the SESTAT system uses broad categories for non-S&E jobs and more specific categories for S&E jobs. The CPS data are coded in both detailed and broad classifications for all jobs. Although the taxonomies are generally consistent, differences in training instructions and decision rules could result in differences in occupational classifications across the two survey systems. In particular, SESTAT occupation coders are trained to review the respondent's self-selected code and assign a new code only when it is more accurate; when it is not possible to determine a better code, the respondent's self-selected code should be maintained. Coders are instructed not to change responses unless sufficient evidence exists that the respondent has made a mistake and the information provided allows the assignment of a better code. In contrast, CPS coders do not have a self-selected code and instead assign codes based on the verbatim responses, duties, and industry sector. In summary, both CPS and SESTAT collect verbatim occupation descriptions using similar questions. However, the rest of the occupation coding process is different for the two survey systems. In CPS, an additional open-ended question is asked to collect job activities and duties. The CPS occupation coders use the occupation description, duties, and industry to assign a code after collection. During follow-up months, CPS uses dependent interviewing. In SESTAT, respondents are asked to select their own occupation code, either from a printed list or through a series of CATI screens. SESTAT occupation coders review these codes along with the occupation descriptions, employer name, employer sector, work activities, supervisory responsibilities, salary, educational history, and information on the respondent's job during the previous survey round. These different collection and code assignment processes could cause differences in the quality of occupation data for the two survey systems. In addition, differences in coder training, emphasis on coding speed, and coding decision rules could also result in differences in the data."}, {"section_title": "9.", "text": "The cumulative response rates in SESTAT are generally lower than the corresponding response rates in CPS. Thus, the SESTAT estimates may be subject to somewhat greater nonresponse biases than the CPS estimates. Because portions of SESTAT are panels that are followed over time, response rates in each SESTAT panel may decrease in each subsequent round of data collection. Although the weighting adjustments used in both survey systems are designed to minimize nonresponse biases, complete elimination of nonresponse biases is not certain and comparisons of estimates between the two survey systems may be affected. On the other hand, the large amount of information available for nonrespondents who were surveyed in the past is used to improve nonresponse adjustment techniques in SESTAT."}, {"section_title": "10.", "text": "The sample sizes for CPS are considerably smaller than those for SESTAT for the population of interest. For example, in the April 1997 CPS sample, there are 1,541 individuals with bachelor's or higher degrees in S&E occupations, compared to 48,488 in the 1997 SESTAT (table 16). Thus, the CPS estimates are subject to much larger sampling errors than the corresponding SESTAT estimates. Even if several CPS samples are accumulated over time, the effective sample size will not increase appreciably because of the considerable overlap between successive monthly samples. The relatively small sample size of CPS limits the detail of analyses of the S&E population. However, CPS can provide useful information about individuals who do not have a bachelor's or higher degree, such as the number who are working in S&E occupations by occupation category. For example, combining the CPS information about individuals without a bachelor's or higher degree with an analysis of the SESTAT 11. population for those with at least a bachelor's degree may provide limited information for the study of S&E graduates as they make their transition into S&E occupations."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A. Detailed Comparison of SESTAT and CPS Procedures for Collecting and Processing Data", "text": "This appendix provides a detailed comparison of the SESTAT and CPS procedures for collecting and processing data, as summarized in \"Data Collection and Processing Procedures.\" The two systems use different modes of data collection. SESTAT data are collected primarily by mail and telephone, with some follow-up by personal interview. Most CPS data are collected through personal interviews during the first and fifth months of participation and through telephone interviews during the other months of participation; all CPS data are collected using CATI or CAPI. In addition to these differences in data collection mode, other important differences include the following: Different strategies for asking questions (i.e., question wording and flow) Extent to which proxy reports are allowed Length of time between the survey reference week and data collection Different coding schema and definitions Different rules for imputing missing data This appendix examines aspects of the SESTAT and CPS designs that could give rise to differences in the estimates from the two systems. The discussion is divided into six sections: (1) data collection procedures, (2) data processing procedures, (3) questions about academic degree, (4) questions about employment status, (5) questions about occupation, and (6) questions about other respondent classifications. In each section, a brief description of the SESTAT and CPS procedures is provided, followed by an explanation of how these procedures might affect the estimates."}, {"section_title": "Recording Accuracy", "text": "Interviewers for both SESTAT and CPS receive extensive hands-on training in questionnaire administration, whereas sample members who are asked to self-administer the SESTAT questionnaires receive no training. This factor may lead to differences in reporting errors between the CPS and SESTAT surveys. However, as mentioned earlier, the reinterview studies have generally found consistent responses in the SESTAT data. All CPS responses are collected using computer-assisted technology, whereas only 37% of the 1997 SESTAT responses were collected using this technology. These systems take advantage of built-in range checks and internal consistency checks. Out-of-scope and discrepant responses can be reviewed and resolved with the respondent during the interview. Although all SESTAT responses are subjected to editing once they are received, telephone follow-up to resolve discrepancies is conducted only for a small number of critical items. However, it is important to note that the primary variables used in this report, including degree level completed, working during the reference week, and occupation, are critical SESTAT items. Any editing problems with the critical items are resolved with the respondent during the initial interview or during data retrieval contacts. Additionally, in SESTAT, the critical items are divided into \"critical completes\" and \"critical callbacks.\" Any cases for which critical complete items are not resolved with the respondent are considered incomplete and are not included in the final data system. Editing rules and imputation are used to resolve any items that are not considered \"critical\" in the SESTAT system."}, {"section_title": "Reliance on Self-Reports Versus Proxy Reports", "text": "Because CPS collects roughly one-half of the data (including labor force data) from household proxies, and any \"knowledgeable adult\" living in the household is eligible to serve as proxy, the possibility exists for the use of proxy reports to lead to some differences between SESTAT and CPS data."}, {"section_title": "Availability of Visual Aids", "text": "The self-administered SESTAT surveys and the CAPI-administered months of CPS (one-quarter of the April 1997 CPS respondent households) allow for the visual presentation of materials to the respondents. In the SESTAT mail questionnaires, respondents can read the question and all response options and can review the lists of occupation and education codes. In the CAPI CPS, respondents can view response options (i.e., show cards) for at least some items. In the CATI surveys, respondents must rely entirely on auditory perception. However, rarely in CPS are CATI questions asked for which there were CAPI visual aids."}, {"section_title": "English Language Skills", "text": "Both SESTAT and CPS include respondents for whom English is not their primary language. Most SESTAT respondents are graduates of U.S. colleges and therefore have some English language skills. [3] By comparison, CPS includes some respondents with limited English skills and is likely to capture more individuals without U.S. degrees than SESTAT. Language problems are expected to be more of an issue for prebachelor's degree respondents than for postbachelor's respondents. Cases with language problems are also affected by the mode of data collection. Although the self-administering respondents can enlist the help of family or friends or refer to a dictionary if they need assistance with the survey, it is less likely that CATI respondents will do so. To the extent that this is true, the SESTAT CATI component and CPS will either count these individuals as nonrespondents or include the data they provide, which may have higher levels of response error than mail surveys. CPS relies on interviewers who live in the areas where they interview. These interviewers can collect data in some languages other than English."}, {"section_title": "Level of Detailed Responses to Open-Ended Questions", "text": "Both the SESTAT and CPS surveys include open-ended questions. Respondents to self-administered questionnaires often do not provide the same level of detailed responses to open-ended items as they do when interviewers administer the questionnaires because interviewers are trained on the intent of the question and on proper probing techniques. The extent to which coders must perform their task using respondents' answers that lack probing information will increase the likelihood of coding error. Occupation is the main data item used in the report that is collected (at least partially) with open-ended questions. The collection and coding of occupation is discussed in detail in the section \"Occupation.\""}, {"section_title": "Social Desirability", "text": "Many studies have shown that survey respondents tend to report higher levels of socially undesirable behaviors, attitudes, and characteristics when they are allowed to respond without interviewer involvement. (This is not always the case, however. See Fowler [1993], p. 58.) In a study of mode effects on the 1993 NSCG conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau (Keathley, Riker, and Hicks 1995),[4] social desirability was cited as a possible reason for differences found in the reporting of labor force status between the mail and telephone groups. However, this was considered to be a small factor in the differences. Because few of the questions in SESTAT and CPS would be considered sensitive by most respondents, social desirability issues are expected to have only a small effect in both survey systems."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Reference Week and Survey Day", "text": "Memory decay is a problem in any survey that collects data on dynamic characteristics such as education, employment, and income. The more time that elapses between the reference week and the survey administration, the more likely it is that a response error will occur. As described earlier, SESTAT and CPS study designs are very different in this regard-SESTAT data collection periods continue for several months and the CPS data collection period is for only 1 week. However, it is important to note that the response variance study conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1993 NSCG found that the NSCG displayed good reliability, with an index of inconsistency exceeding 50 for only one question and an index of 30 or more for one-quarter of the questions."}, {"section_title": "Record Checks", "text": "Self-administration typically gives respondents more time than telephone surveys to consult records that might improve response accuracy (see Fowler [1993], p. 58). On the other hand, the short time period between the interviewer-administered CPS survey and the reference week might minimize the need for record checks. However, the interviewer-administered SESTAT interviews, which might occur months after the reference week, might suffer from memory decay and record checks would probably be used infrequently. The SESTAT mail surveys, since they are self-administered, would benefit insofar as respondents consult their records. Although this is true in typical survey work, few variables other than salary would be affected by record check differences in SESTAT versus CPS comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Item Nonresponse", "text": "Paper-and-pencil questionnaire self-administration typically results in a larger amount of missing data than either CAPI or CATI administration. The 1993 NSCG mode effect study found that for the 12 characteristics included in the study, the mail group had significantly higher item nonresponse rates than the telephone group, with few exceptions. However, most of the questions had low nonresponse rates for both groups (less than 3%). Also, as discussed previously, the primary data items used in this report, including working during the reference week, looking for work during the reference week, and occupation, are critical complete items in SESTAT, meaning they have zero-item nonresponse. The additional SESTAT question used to determine labor force status, whether the respondent is on layoff from a job, generally has an item nonresponse rate of 1% or less. For CPS data, the item nonresponse for January 1997 data is 0.3% for labor force status and 1.7% for occupation. Methods used by SESTAT and CPS to handle item nonresponse are discussed in the section \"Statistical Issues.\""}, {"section_title": "Academic Degree", "text": "Unlike SESTAT, CPS includes respondents both with and without bachelor's or higher degrees (see \"Coverage Issues\"). Following is a discussion of the collection of education data in the two survey systems. Both CPS and SESTAT collect information on completed degrees, but SESTAT collects more detailed education data. CPS respondents are asked to report the highest level of education completed as follows: Two types of edit screens can be displayed for this item. First, if the respondent reports a lower level degree than reported in an earlier interview, the respondent is asked to resolve the discrepancy. Second, if a household member's age is less than expected for a reported degree level, then an edit screen is displayed. CPS collects no information about the field of degree or about the institution that awarded the degree. To be eligible for SESTAT, a sample member must have completed a bachelor's or higher degree in any field. In the NSCG and NSRCG surveys, education history is collected during the baseline survey cycle and includes high school graduation year and state/country, whether an associate's degree was completed, and number of bachelor's and higher degrees received. [6] For bachelor's and higher degrees, detailed information on the most recent degree, second most recent degree, and first bachelor's degree is also collected during the baseline survey. This degree history (including 2-year degrees) is updated with new degree information during the follow-up surveys. For the SDR, a complete degree history is collected with the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), which is used as the sampling frame for the SDR and updated with new degree information during each SDR survey cycle. In all three SESTAT surveys, data collected for bachelor's and higher degrees include the college/university that awarded the degree, month and year awarded, degree level, and the major field of study. In the follow-up surveys, data are also collected for postbaccalaureate and postmaster's certificates. The questions used to collect degree level in the baseline and follow-up surveys are as shown below. [7] Baseline SESTAT Surveys "}, {"section_title": "Type of Degree/Certificate: ________________", "text": "For degree level, both CPS and SESTAT use the same categories of bachelor's, master's, doctorate, and other professional degree; therefore, these data are expected to be consistent across survey systems. The main differences between CPS and SESTAT in the collection of degree information is that CPS collects the highest level of school or degree completed and does not collect the field of degree, whereas SESTAT collects the school, level, date, and field for degrees at the bachelor's level and higher."}, {"section_title": "Employment Status", "text": "Both survey systems collect data on workforce participation, including principal and secondary jobs, during the survey reference week.

For NSCG cases sampled from the decennial census, the sex variable comes from the census long form and the information is carried forward into the SESTAT data system. For the SDR, the information is collected on the SED and carried over into the data system, but it was verified in 1993 because there had been a major redesign in the survey system and some cases were very old. For the NSRCG, the mail survey asks the respondent to choose male or female and the CATI survey instructs the interviewer to code without asking or to ask if necessary. For all SESTAT follow-up surveys, this item is asked periodically for sample person verification but the original value from the sampling frame or baseline survey is always carried forward in the data system. The CPS survey instructs the interviewer to code sex without asking unless the interviewer is unable to determine by voice or appearance."}, {"section_title": "Age", "text": "Both SESTAT and CPS determine age by collecting the respondent's birth date and resolving any discrepancies with birth date information collected in earlier survey cycles. The SESTAT interviews (both self-administered and interviewer administered) include the question, \"What is your birth date?\" Respondents are asked to provide the month, day, and year of their birth. This question is included in each survey cycle. During follow-up surveys, the birth date collection is used for sample person verification. If the respondent gives a birth date that is not consistent with a prior cycle, then editing and data retrieval procedures are conducted to resolve the discrepancy. These data are recoded into \"age\" for analysis. CPS respondents are asked, \"What is (name's/your) date of birth?\" Again, interviewers record the month, day, and year and the data are recoded into \"age\" for analysis. The CPS survey provides the interviewer with data from previous interviews with the household. This information allows the interviewers to ask for clarification if the answers are discrepant. CPS also uses a scripted follow-up question after asking for the birth date, \"As of last week, that would make (name/you) ((age)/approximately (age)/less than 1/over 98) (years/year) old. Is that correct?\"[13]"}, {"section_title": "Race and Ethnicity", "text": "The SESTAT data for race/ethnicity[14] come from the sampling frames or the baseline surveys. For NSCG cases sampled from the decennial census, race/ethnicity comes from the census long form and the information is carried forward into the SESTAT data system. For the SDR, the information is collected on the SED and carried over into the data system, but it was verified in the 1993 cycle. Race/ethnicity is collected in the NSRCG survey each cycle. In all of these surveys, Hispanic origin is collected in a separate question from race. The census form asks the race question before the question on Hispanic origin, whereas SED and NSRCG ask Hispanic origin first. The Hispanic question has slight wording differences between the census long form, SED, and NSRCG. The census form includes subcategories of Hispanic as part of the same question, but SED and NSRCG collect this information in a separate question. The race categories for NSRCG are white, black or African American, Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Other -specify. The responses to the \"Other\" category are backcoded into existing categories after data collection according to the SESTAT backcoding rules. The race categories for SED are the same with a slight wording difference, and there is no \"Other\" category. The 1990 census form contains categories similar to NSRCG except the census form uses the designation \"Black or Negro,\" asks American Indians to record the tribe, lists Eskimo and Aleut as separate categories, and lists subcategories for Asian/Pacific Islander. CPS asks respondents to select a race category from the same list of options used in the NSRCG surveys, with slight wording differences. CPS asks the race question before the ethnicity question. In addition, CPS collects the verbatim race responses provided by the respondents but edits any such responses back into the four main race groups. As described in the CPS Glossary of Subject Concepts, persons of Hispanic origin are determined on the basis of a question that asks for self-identification of the person's origin or descent. Respondents are asked to select their origin (or the origin of some other household member) from a \"flash card\" listing 20 ethnic origins. Persons of Hispanic origin are those who indicated that their origin was Mexican American, Chicano, Mexican (Mexicano), Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Hispanic.
