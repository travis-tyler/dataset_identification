Although the direction of sea level is upward and unequivocal, the causes, rate, and periodicity are under study and debate. Based on observations from a worldwide network of tide gages over many decades, eustatic sea level rose at least 1-2 millimeters per year (mm/yr) in the 20th century (Melillo and others, 2014). Within the last two decades, sea-surface heights, as determined from satellite altimetry, have confirmed a global eustatic rise exceeding 3 mm/yr (Melillo and others, 2014). It is yet unclear whether this near doubling rate change in recent years is related to natural decadal variability of solar, orbital, or climate systems or is indicative of a longer term trend sped by human activity. Whether mostly a human or natural consequence, rising sea level will affect our coastal ecosystems and infrastructure through the consequences of coastal flooding if no action is taken. The purpose of this guide is to describe and categorize the suite of data, methods, and models and their design, structure, and application for hindcasting and forecasting the potential impacts of sea-level rise in coastal ecosystems. Various climate and coastal wetland models have been developed to address the interaction and impact of changing climate and land use from a sea-level rise perspective. Simple models using generic datasets and constructs of the behavior of natural systems may provide only limited confidence and certainty suitable for instructional or educational purposes, whereas more complex models require expert development and more site-specific parameterization and validation for aiding coastal planning and ecosystem management. In 2012, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted more than 30 training and feedback sessions with Federal, State, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) coastal managers and planners across the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to evaluate user needs, potential benefits, current scientific understanding, and utilization of resource aids and modeling tools focused on sea-level rise. In response to the findings of these sessions, this sea-level rise modeling handbook has been designed as a guide to the science and simulation models for understanding the dynamics and impacts of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems. The handbook is organized into two major sections, the first describing factors, rates, and models of observed and projected sea-level change and the second categorizing the suite of simulation tools for forecasting potential impacts of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems. First, we present the physical properties and forms of the water cycle of the Earth's hydrosphere to constrain the discussion of how sea levels change in relation to the forces, data, and models that have been developed to reconstruct historical sea levels and to predict future sea levels."}, {"section_title": "Earth's Hydrosphere", "text": "There is a finite supply of water on the Earth, of which ocean water and open seas make up the largest portion. Oceans cover nearly three-fourths of the Earth's surface (361 million square kilometers [km 2 ]) and hold 97 percent of the total water volume. The remaining 3 percent is freshwater that is mostly frozen water of different forms and permanency, referred to as the \"cryosphere,\" and includes snow cover, freshwater ice in lakes and rivers, sea ice (from saltwater), glaciers, ice sheets, and permafrost (frozen ground). The residency times and coupling of the different forms and sources of water vary with the seasons, decades, and millennia in relation to a warmer or cooler planet and geological periods ( fig. 1). Ice depth and volume are greater in Antarctica (about 77 percent of the cryosphere), but more exposed areal extent and ice surface (about 23 percent of the cryosphere) lie in the Northern Hemisphere as snow, glaciers, frozen tundra, and polar ice. Sea ice, snow cover, and freshwater ice fluctuate seasonally or over years between solid and liquid forms but affect sea level only marginally and temporarily by volume and cyclic behavior. A large or small block of floating sea ice does not affect sea level relative to equivalent weight displacement. Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere fluctuates annually from highs of 46.5 million km 2 in winter to lows of 3.8 million km 2 in summer. Long-term observations and more current satellite imaging of snow cover over North America and Eurasia show little variability of areal cover change between years but more change with timing (for example, earlier melt) in recent decades. Freshwater frozen in glaciers, ice sheets, or ground ice has much longer melt periodicities, from 10 to 100,000 years or longer, and for deep polar ice the melt periodicity may exceed millions of years. Permafrost and seasonally frozen ground occupy the What causes the sea level to change?

Permafrost thickness can extend 500 meters (m) below surface and varies by location, prevailing temperatures, and surficial factors of ground moisture content, vegetation cover, winter snow depth, and aspect. Thawing and freezing of permafrost, and advances and retreat of glaciers, have been monitored directly over decades and centuries, as well as on millennial time scales based on carbon dating of organic debris and tree ring analysis. Deglaciation, or \"icemelt,\" accounts for most of the sealevel change and cycles of recent Earth history, which amount to about 120 m or more every 100,000 years. As recently as about 20,000 years ago, the Earth was undergoing the Last Glacial Maximum of covered ice across North America and Europe, during which sea level was approximately 120 m lower than current levels and shorelines. In the last 8,000 years, sea-level rise has slowed and reached an expected maximum extent, having risen 4 m above current levels and fallen 4 m below current levels multiple times. Glacier and ice sheet melting alters sea levels on decadal and centennial cycles, thereby representing variation that is of most concern and potential impact to coasts today. Sea level rises or falls in concert with glacial retreat and advances at rates that vary by hemisphere and region and are not necessarily uniform. Of most concern to climate change scientists is the potential rise of sea level of 1-60 m based on the available mass balance of freshwater in vulnerable glaciers and polar ice if warming and icemelt continue. A relatively minor storage of the Earth's hydrosphere is on or under the land surface in the form of surface water and groundwater. While these water sources have little to do with historical changes in sea levels comparable to glaciers and other ice forms, they have become a valuable resource and commodity for drinking supply, industrial use, and agricultural irrigation. In addition to natural lakes and rivers, the area of surface water exposed to evaporation has increased with the advent of dams and reservoirs built for hydropower, recreation, and water supply. The associated effects of regulated streamflow have changed the storage, routing, timing, and quality of water resources. The withdrawal of surface water from rivers and of groundwater and other fluids from aquifers for societal needs and consumption has altered the timing and magnitude of flow to downstream ecosystems and organisms dependent on or adapted to premodern flood frequencies. Withdrawal of surface water and groundwater has also increased the rate of natural geological subsidence of deep sedimentary formations. The connection of sea level to freshwater withdrawal is most apparent in receiving estuaries that become more saline with less freshwater flow over time and in locations where land subsidence from subsurface fluid withdrawal accelerates saltwater intrusion. The atmospheric portion of the water cycle in liquid form is precipitation. The interannual and multidecadal variabilities of precipitation are evident in wet and dry years or arid versus mesic landscapes. Gradients of hydrological, geological, and biological significance controlled by precipitation rates, forms, patterns, and periodicity exist globally and across single continents. The withdrawal of surface water from rivers and the creation of man-made reservoirs have effectively mimicked a climate change effect equivalent to drought, or reduced freshwater flow to coastal estuaries. Although climate models agree on increased warming in the future, there is less certainty or agreement concerning amounts of precipitation in the future. In general, future projections of climate models account for less precipitation on the basis of warmer air holding more water, delivered in punctuated rain events with greater intensity, and longer periods between such events. It is important to consider that any climate model projections of less precipitation across a given region should account for an increase elsewhere because of the mass balance of water in the hydrosphere, which only changes in form and distribution rather than in overall quantity."}, {"section_title": "Factors, Rates, and Models of Sea-Level Change", "text": "In this section, we outline the various factors, processes, and evidence of sea-level change over the centuries and cycles of Earth's climate system.

We then progressively review the rates and models of sea-level change of the modern era of deglaciation and contemporary records of tide gage and satellite observation. Lastly, we address future projections of sea-level rise from predictive climate models to understand the probabilities and timing of accelerated sealevel rise of the next century."}, {"section_title": "Ancient Sea-Level Reconstructions", "text": "Sea-level changes over the short and long terms of geological periods have been recorded and show in many mutually corroborating ways that in deep sediments there is a sequenced coastal overlap profile, indicating a globally consistent and repetitive pattern of sea-level change over time and space. The various disciplines have developed suites of models for reconstructing sea-level history that are beneficial for forecasting climate change direction and impacts for natural and cultural resource assessments. In most cases, we are primarily concerned for societal and conservation planning to know how and when current shorelines will flood with increasing sea level under warming climate. A review of the factors and rates of sea-level change over the course of the Earth's history expands the different types and disciplines of sea-level rise models."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Stratigraphy Geology Models", "text": "Deep beneath the ocean floor and land surface are the different layers of rock and sediment from terrigenous and marine sources that chronicle the interchange of terrestrial weathering of the exposed landform at low sea levels and aquatic life forms of a submerged condition during high sea levels. Together they tell the story of ancient sea levels before and since the age of dinosaurs. It was only decades ago that an understanding of the Earth's crustal movement was proposed and that the process of plate tectonics, in which continents and oceans reside on moving plates crashing into or sliding under or spreading from each other, was accepted. Geologists have since refined their understanding and constructed tectonic models to reconstruct the placement, movement, emergence, and submergence of land and sea over geological time. It was discovered that the order of geological formations and sedimentary layers is shared worldwide by fossil association, thereby representing progressive and subsequent time periods of varying sea level. Interpretation of these layers of associated fossil organisms and their isotopic composition has further shown that the Earth has been warmer and cooler than at present, with and without glaciation as a contributing factor. As the Earth has cycled through cooling and warming periods, so has sea level cycled between minimum limits or levels, called lowstands, and maximum extents, known as highstands. Highstands occur during warming and icemelt periods when sea levels reach a high plateau before eventually reversing direction and falling again to another lowstand during cooling periods. Different geological methods and models of stratigraphic sequencing have been developed to interpret this pattern and history of sea-level change; these methods and models agree on concept and direction but differ with respect to magnitude, timing, and accuracy. Stratigraphic sequencing of common layers of rock type, fossil associations, marine terraces, alternating depositional sources (marine and terrigenous), and magnetic patterning, among other types of evidence, provides an analog of land-sea highstand and lowstand extents and periods. What can be determined from the various models is the direction of change, which indicates the process or contributions of plate tectonics on sea-level variation. The long view of hundreds of millions of years is that the spread and movement of continental plates have been increasing ocean basin volume since the sea-level highstand of the Late Cretaceous period, during which time sea level was nearly 120 m higher than present day. Two different methods for interpreting the stratigraphy of deep sedimentary layers largely agree on the long view of increasing and decreasing ocean basin volume and continental plate dynamics ( fig. 2). Plate tectonics constantly changes the number, shape, geographic position, and shoreline relations of continents. When the continents are more consolidated, the lower extent of shoreline contributes to decreasing sea level. When the continents are breaking up and adding shoreline margins and land area, sea level subsequently rises. Related rifts or spreading of the ocean floor below the waterline can cause 101-point moving average (Haq and others, 1987, data) 10 mil yrs moving average (Kominz and others, 2008, data) Datasets of sea level over geologic history Figure 2. Sea-level reconstruction from sediment stratigraphy dating over geological time (modified from Haq and others, 1987;Kominz and others, 2008; used with permission). similar effects on sea-level rise or fall. When spreading rates for deep ocean ridges collectively decrease, basin volume effectively increases and results in sea-level fall. In the case where there is net ridge subduction, a major loss of ocean floor features will precipitate a drop in sea level. For hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have controlled ocean basin volumes and long-term sea-level change by accommodation or displacement. These stratigraphic models of sea-level change show that ocean basin volumes are still increasing after the last major highstand more than 90 million years ago."}, {"section_title": "Glaciation and Sea-Level Cycles", "text": "Global sea level is controlled by geological and climatological processes of different scales and timing. In the last million years of Pleistocene history, glaciation acted as a prominent factor in cycles of sea-level rise and fall of 100 m or more over roughly 100,000-year cycles. The regulation of these highstand and lowstand sea levels is the result of greater or lesser glaciation that has been linked to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit over a 96,000-year cycle known as the Milankovitch theory. Other prominent cycles in sea-level fluctuation of 41,000 and 21,000 years are tied to the periodicity of the Earth's tilt and the precession (wobble) of its axis, respectively. Acting in concert, these cycles interact in complicated phase relations of solar proximity and seasonal variance, both regionally and globally, driving differential icemelt and freeze, glacial advance and retreat, and consequentially, sea level. Reconstructions of ancient sea level have been generated from multiple data sources, including oxygen isotope ratios of Foraminifera (a single-celled protist) deposition in ocean sediments, permanent ice core thickness, gas and particulate concentrations, sediment stratigraphy and fossil grouping, carbon dating, and others. The different methods of reconstruction capture similar timing and magnitude of major cycle inflections and only vary on fine resolution aspects on the basis of robustness of technique. Multiple oxygen-18 ( 18 O) reconstructions have been completed worldwide involving independent collections, analyses, and publications with repeatable results of sea levels, timing, and magnitude. These reconstructions demonstrate high rates of sea-level rise from lowstand to highstand and relatively low rates of sea-level fall over the longer period of the cycle with intermittent cycles of lesser magnitude ( fig. 3). This pattern implies that orbital eccentricity and solar proximity drive a constant warmup that more effectively melts extended ice forms readily, whereas ice accumulation is a much slower and prolonged process. During glaciation periods of regular cyclic sea-level rise, the highest eustatic rates were more than an order of magnitude higher than current rates of sea-level rise (more than 20 mm/ yr). If the pattern of past highstand and lowstand periods of glaciation repeats as expected, notwithstanding overriding greenhouse effect projections, sea levels would be subject to a cyclic fall for the next 90,000 years."}, {"section_title": "Holocene Sea-Level Rise", "text": "The recent history of sea-level rise begins less than 20,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, when a vast ice sheet covered the Northern Hemisphere and sea level was about 120 m below present. The evidence of this period includes various biological data (for example, tree rings, coral remnants and growth rates, marsh and mangrove peat age, fossil associations), datable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and structural features of past shorelines and marine terraces. The numerous biological indicators provide an array and history of sea-level effects and conditions reported by many authors for many species and sites and include evidence from above and below present-day shorelines and ocean surface. A composite of calculated dates and heights of sea level during the Holocene epoch taken from various techniques and oceans shows a general sea-level curve with a slope and shape that is universally accepted and applicable worldwide ( fig. 4). Since the Last Glacial Maximum, sea level has risen at an average rate of nearly 8 mm/yr, comparable to some of the highest current rates, such as those in high subsidence zones of delta systems worldwide. This rate is not uniform over the Holocene epoch; the highest rates approached or exceeded 20 mm/yr. For the past thousand years or more, sea level has been at a relative standstill subject to further icemelt and thermosteric effects of an extended warming climate or an eventual cyclic fall in the next few thousand years."}, {"section_title": "Contemporary Sea-Level Rates", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Relative Sea and Land Motion", "text": "Globally, sea level is relative spatially and temporally until referenced by some fixed point, commonly referred to as a \"datum\" or \"plane of reference.\" Datums are mathematical expressions or models of the Earth's surface and sphere (geoid) for aiding navigation and referencing horizontal distance and direction and vertical depth or height. Many horizontal and vertical datums have been established to approximate flat and curved land surfaces; they are not necessarily universal but are generally defined by political and geographic boundaries of parochial significance. Datums are based on unique empirical and theoretical models of the Earth's shape, size, and density. As such, a conversion (or rectification) is required to calculate and to compare distance and elevation differences between two or more points (or measurements) referenced to different datums. Referenced datums have known mathematical properties and are adopted into a geodetic control network. Over time, new or revised datums have been created for greater accuracy and utility.

Satellite navigation systems are likewise based on geoid and ellipsoid models of space that can be expressed or converted to a specified datum. The distinction of datums is an important aspect of all of the different kinds of models of land and water that will be discussed hereafter in this handbook. Modeling sea-level rise is a challenge because both the land and sea are moving vertically and differentially by location, spatially and temporally. We easily envision how the ocean moves with the ebb and flow of tides, but it is more difficult to observe how the ground beneath our feet moves on a daily or seasonal basis or laterally in geological time. Land and sea motion together account for the relative sea-level rate at a given coastal location. While ocean volume (eustasy) is currently increasing and sea level is rising on a global scale, some coastal environments and communities are actually experiencing uplift of land surface (for example, in the Pacific Northwest) and drop in sea level both locally and regionally. To effectively model the process and impacts of sealevel rise, models of both land surface and sea surface are required. Land surface and sea floors are measured and referenced differently, but all are part of the same landform that is covered or exposed with rising and falling sea levels spatially and temporally. The use of geodetic networks and tidal benchmarks provides a basis for referencing height or depth in relation to the sea surface. The intersection of land and sea may appear obvious (such as a beach), but it is much more difficult to ascertain when, where, and how much flooding occurs in and across the intertidal zone with the changing tide. This intertidal zone is where tide gages are so important and why the data are so valuable. Tide gage observations are used to predict tide behavior, to establish tidal datums of the different tide phases, and to determine mean sea level for a period of record. Predictive tide models require this information to reliably predict the astronomical timing and height of low and high tides. Tidal datums are also important for boundary determinations of private and public land, navigational aids and infrastructure, coastal development ordinances, and other political and economic uses. A number of factors control the types and range of tides for a given coastal reach, and these factors are important for sea-level rise models and applications. First and foremost, every coastal reach has a unique tidal behavior and magnitude that are taken into account in more robust sea-level rise models. Although the general characteristics of sea and tide motion are shared for proximal coastal reaches and tide gages, the bathymetric shape of bay and harbor bottoms and the coupling to open seas can produce unique tidal dynamics locally. The nature, direction, and circulation of nearshore currents and the geological properties of the underlying sediments also interact to account for higher or lower sea levels and the need for more frequent tidal analysis and datum updates."}, {"section_title": "Thermal Expansion of Seawater", "text": "From a global perspective, there are two main factors that control sea-level change, icemelt balance and ocean temperature, usually concomitant with respect to whether the global average or eustasy is relatively static or dynamic (rising or falling, slow or fast). Warmer climate periods of higher solar insolation and insulation melt the collective ice forms, glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and snow, effectively transferring a balance of icebound water in high latitudes and altitudes (that is, mountains) into the seas and oceans. At the same time, higher temperatures of air and surface waters over the Earth's hydrosphere cause thermal expansion of ocean waters and thus higher sea level. Effectively, a kilogram of warmwater displaces more volume than would a kilogram of coldwater. The volume (or height) for a given water mass and density increases under warmer temperatures ( fig. 5). To illustrate further, a 1-degree Celsius (\u00b0C) change in ocean temperature over a depth of 1,000 m equals an expansion effect of 23.03 centimeters (cm). Although the properties of  water have long been known with regard to density and mass relations of freshwater and seawater, a complex mathematical model is required to calculate and integrate the nonlinear response for the range of ocean conditions (app. 1)."}, {"section_title": "Tide Gage Records and Relative Sea-Level Trends", "text": "Linear regression models are commonly applied to tide gage records to calculate relative sea-level trends based on long-term monthly or annual means of observed water level. A comparison of select tide gage records from the more geologically stable eastern Gulf Coast in Florida (Key West, Pensacola) with those from river deltas of the western Gulf Coast in Louisiana (Grand Isle) and Texas (Galveston) illustrates the extreme slope differences attributed to sustained low and high land subsidence, respectively ( fig. 6). Tide gage records are readily available from two principal sources that can now be accessed via the Internet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service maintains a user-friendly data portal of tide gage data and utility programs for public access, Tides Online (http://tidesonline. noaa.gov). Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (http://www. psmsl.org) is another organization that maintains global tide gage records from contributors and cooperating government sources. Detailed descriptions of tide station history, datums, benchmarks, and semiprocessed data, such as long-term trend rates and seasonal variation, are often available. Published sea-level trends are also readily available from government documents and peer-reviewed journal outlets but may be somewhat dated by time of publication. This report includes a record of published trends over the decades from NOAA tide specialists and sources (Flick and others, 2003;Hicks and Crosby, 1974;Lyles and others, 1988;Zervas 2001Zervas , 2009 for the larger set of U.S. tide gages (app. 2). These trends are derived from available records for each gage, some older and more continuous than others. Although current or past rates of sea-level rise by reach or region can be used for hindcasting and forecasting purposes, the differences in rate change from period to period demonstrate the dynamic nature of tides and sea level that warrants careful choice of record gap interpolation and trending method. Missing records are especially problematic if not rectified or interpolated prior to applying any trending process or calculation. Often the missing record is related to extreme low and high events or tide gage function critical for a representative sea-level trend calculation and appropriate gage-to-gage comparisons. The choice of start and end dates alone can influence the slope or trend calculation when using least squares regression or quadratic models for fitting purposes. Failing to balance the start and end dates by equal months is enough to introduce undue weight and error of a disproportional high or low seasonal effect on either end of the period of record. This issue is more evident for seasonally driven and high-latitude locations with greater tidal variance. Removal of seasonal and storm effects (for example, hurricanes, cyclones, tsunamis, and extratropical fronts) will inherently generate more conservative estimates of true slope or trend; this practice is rarely applied but is herein recommended. The position of these events in the record, earlier or later, and near the start and end dates, can add bias of inflated or deflated trending depending on overall record length. Longer records with fewer such events will tend to mediate the positional bias with nominal effect on rate change or magnitude. There is currently much interest and debate regarding whether short-term satellite and long-term tide gage records can be used reliably for detecting accelerating and (or) decelerating sea-level change. Relatively few tide gages have been in operation with maintained continuous readings longer than a century. Short gaging records are problematic for trend analysis and accounting for confounding factors of eustatic and land motion influences that contribute to the actual (secular) change over time. The cycles of influenceclimate, subsidence, fault movement, and crustal reactionmay be longer term than the records themselves, or there may be acute events not easily distinguished from seasonal variation or storm occurrences. There are, nevertheless, long and reliable gage records that provide trends of relevant influences (for example, subsidence) and expectations of future direction; however, to compare tide gage records with more recent satellite observations, it is necessary to compare complete records for each tide gage and for the same period of record. Considering the sea-level rate for the current tidal epoch (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012) with appropriate overlap with satellite observations, we provide the range of relative sea-level rates for the different coastal reaches of the United States, thereby illustrating both high and low rates of sea-level rise and fall ( fig. 7)."}, {"section_title": "Satellite Altimetry and Eustatic Sea-Level Rise", "text": "The advent of satellites with sensors of different types and levels of accuracy has provided means to measure changes in the Earth's land cover, ocean levels, ice layers, and other surface characteristics useful for climate and sea-level assessment. A specific series of satellites similar to those of the Global Positioning System have been launched since 1992 to monitor global sea-surface height change over time. These satellites orbit the Earth many times in a single day on tracks that vary to capture a record of sea level and variation across the world's oceans and seas every 10 days. Although tide gages are useful for calibrating and validating satellite observations of sea-surface height, the gages are not evenly distributed across the globe and are subject to shoreline effects and tidal variance from differential bathymetric configuration, ocean currents, wave lapping, upland runoff, and land motion effects that confound determination of a definitive global mean sea level. Satellites provide a reference perspective that is independent of the Earth's surface above or below the dynamic water line that is commonly referred to as \"local mean sea level.\" Because these satellites have gathered sea-surface height data since 1992, affording calibration checks and sustained observations for more than 20 years, the record length exceeds an entire tidal epoch (18.6 years), the astronomical cycle of gravitational tides of planetary and lunar orbits. A major question with sea-level data from satellites concerns how they compare to longstanding, reliable tide gage records. Because the first reports of satellite-derived sea-level trends were published in the mid-1990s, the higher sea-level rate, above 3 mm/yr, supposedly verified acceleration in global mean sea level above tide gage rates of geologically stable coasts at 1-2 mm/yr over the last century (Melillo and others, 2014). Rate comparisons for different periods of record, short and long, are problematic, however, and warrant an understanding of the differences in sea-level measurements and rate calculations from satellite and tide gage data. The first difference is that the gage and the satellite are observing the water surface but one oriented upward from beneath sea surface and the other oriented downward from a geocentric orbit, respectively, with different measurement intervals and accuracy. Tide gages typically record seasurface height at 6-minute (min) intervals at one location on the coast; these single locations are influenced by local factors of tidal behavior, upland runoff, and land subsidence or uplift. Satellites measure a series of single returns of an electromagnetic pulse to the sea surface and back, calculating an altimeter height of sea surface on the basis of signal time lapse. Both measures are then rectified to a common geoid or datum, which involves referencing the height of tidal benchmarks on land and satellite orbit in space. The geodetic rectification of observations from both tide gages and satellites is complex and beyond the scope of this handbook, but measurements should be expressed in the same datum and for the same period of record for direct comparison. Although it is challenging to match a single sea-surface observation from an instantaneous satellite reading and a simultaneous 6-min reading of an associated tide gage, an average of measurements over weeks, months, and years is comparable. Satellite observations are not as exact or repetitive for a given location as are measurements from a tide gage, but instead, satellite observations are area specific and offer a wide distribution of locations, which is advantageous for continuous global monitoring. Satellite observations near coastlines are often not available or usable because of the proportion of altimeter readings that are on land rather than open water; however, satellite observations of seasurface height provide a comprehensive regional and global measurement of absolute sea-level change that is independent of local land motion (subsidence or uplift). The difference in sea-level rate between satellite-derived records and tide gage records for the same observation period provides the degree and direction of land motion at that location. In effect, we therefore need both satellite observations and tide gage records for different purposes that are complementary. For illustrative purposes, we analyzed satellite data from U.S. and European satellite services monitoring sea-surface heights for the Gulf of Mexico for comparison with select Gulf Coast tide gages. Water-level records for northern Gulf Coast tide stations can be used to contrast relative sealevel rates of high-subsidence zones in deltaic settings of Louisiana and Texas to that in geologically stable coasts of western Florida to the concurrent satellite-observed rate for the Gulf of Mexico. The rate of sea-level rise for the period 1994-2012 for the select tide gages exceeded the eustatic sea-level rise trend of 3.32 mm/yr for satellite altimetry; both the U.S. (Topex/Poseidon/Jason) satellite dataset (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center [NASA GSFC], 2013) and the U.S. plus European satellite dataset (AVISO+ Satellite Altimetry Data, 2013) provided the same estimated rate of eustatic sea-level rise for this tidal epoch (1994-2012) (table 1). The residual of the difference between the higher sea-level rise rates for each gage and the eustatic sea-level rise rate for the satellite observations for this tidal epoch shows the degree to which the tide gage and landform are sinking (subsiding). In this case, the lower rates of subsidence for the eastern Gulf of Mexico gages at Key West and Pensacola demonstrate a fairly stable landform. In contrast, the higher rate of sea-level rise of the Grand Isle gage illustrates the rapid subsidence expected of a relatively new and thick deltaic platform undergoing compaction and perhaps affected by subsurface oil and gas withdrawal. The rate of subsidence along the Texas coast is comparatively moderate but shows signs of slowing from historical rates related to groundwater withdrawal and regulation. The spread and slope of monthly values and residual differences from these gages and satellite sea-surface heights for the tidal epoch 1994-2012 are shown in figure 8. In some cases, quadratic fits match the curvilinear trends and residuals better than linear regression models ( fig. 8). To determine whether the rate of sea-level rise during the most recent tidal epoch (1994-2012) is higher than in earlier tidal epochs, it is necessary to calculate the rates of sea-level rise for each tidal epoch similarly for equal 19-year segments. Table 2 shows the different sea-level rise trends by tidal epoch for each tide gage over their respective periods of record. The Key West and Pensacola tide gages show similar rates, ranging from about 1 to nearly 4 mm/yr for preceding tidal epochs. Slope calculations for the Galveston tide gage show higher rates, up to 10 mm/yr, corresponding with periods of high groundwater withdrawal associated with high industrial and population growth. Groundwater regulation and aquifer monitoring have reduced the effective withdrawal rates and related subsidence over the past few decades (Kasmarek and others, 2014). Although it is acceptable to compare rates of sea-level change over periods no less than 19 years, considering the length and effect of an astronomical cycle, it is best to calculate trends on even longer time periods or as long as possible for use in sea-level rise modeling applications."}, {"section_title": "Future Sea-Level Rise Projections", "text": "The IPCC has relied on general circulation models (GCMs) as the most advanced tools available for simulating the response of the Earth-climate system to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. These models represent advanced knowledge of the coupled hydrological processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface to provide projections of future climate change. There are dozens of GCMs from different research laboratories, universities, and government agencies worldwide. These GCMs similarly simulate the Earth-climate dynamics and processes but differ mostly in spatial and temporal resolution. The more complex GCMs depict the climate system by using a three-dimensional grid over the Earth, typically having a horizontal resolution between 250 and 600 kilometers (km), 10-20 vertical layers in the atmosphere, and sometimes as many as 30 layers in the oceans. Model-to-model differences translate into differences in the sensitivity to changes in greenhouse gas emission scenarios and in their predicted results. Predicting future sea-level change from GCM simulations is based on a set of likely scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions depending on population growth and economic considerations of greenhouse gas controls and regulations. Emission scenarios are assumptions more than predictions or forecasts, and no probabilities are associated with them. Projections of future global mean sea level are based on thermal expansion of warmer oceans and the degree of melting glaciers and ice sheets as predicted from GCMs for different emission scenarios with greater or lesser greenhouse gas concentrations. IPCC reports of climate change projections originally considered selected model output in the Third Assessment Report (2001) but have since reported composite findings for host institutions and countries providing GCM contributions.  The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007) resulted in a comparatively conservative projection for sea-level rise with likely low and high ranges of 18 and 59 cm, respectively, by 2100. The most recent National Climate Assessment report (Melillo and others, 2014) raised the upper estimate of sealevel projections from icemelt to 2 m (6.6 feet [ft]) by 2100 ( fig. 9). The low projection of 20 cm (0.66 ft) by 2100 is an extension of the historical global mean sea-level rate of the last century without acceleration. The two intermediate forecasts between the low and high extremes indicate a likely sea-level rise of 0.3 m (1 ft) and 1.2 m (4 ft), respectively, by 2100.

Uncertainty in the extent of inundation for a particular sea-level rise scenario (such as 50 cm by 2100) is related to both the uncertainty in transformation of water-level datums (for example, orthometric to tidal) and the uncertainty in coastal elevation data. The combined amount of uncertainty from datum transformation and elevation sources can present critical limitations to sea-level rise applications.

SLRRP was designed to provide other USGS coastal ecosystem models with corresponding sea levels rectified to NAVD 88. SLRRP uses the mean monthly tide records of NOAA tide gages projected into the 21st century with the addition of curvilinear rates of eustatic sea level expected from climate change. The historical tide gage record is \"wrapped\" or extended into the future to mimic the natural cycle of high and low tidal variations attributed to astronomical and meteorological causes of seasonal and interannual variability including wind and storm tides. The mean monthly water levels capture both short-term seasonal variations and long-term trends of sealevel change for the respective gage and coastal reach selected. Projected data records are given in stage heights for different tidal datums such as mean low water, mean tide level, and mean high water, rectified to NAVD 88 to allow comparison with land-based elevations of tidal wetlands, roads, and other features of interest. The default tidal parameter simulated by SLRRP is the mean higher high water (MHHW), which corresponds with the upper boundary of the tidal-upland ecotone and higher flood extent to establish flooding potential of ecological and cultural importance. SLRRP utilizes a graphic user interface of sequential pop-up windows to facilitate user selection of a desired tide station, GCM, emission scenario, or alternative customized inputs ( fig. 10). The SLRRP customized mode allows users to manually enter a local subsidence rate and eustasy rate or elevation over a given time frame instead of using model defaults. The program gives the user options for saving graphical and digital formats of generated sea-level projections. SLRRP prompts the user to execute a seawater inundation option that builds a supplemental graph of the timing and rate of flooding for an elevation entry of a land surface or other feature ( fig. 10). In effect, the model shows the prospective date and time period for which sea level may likely overtop and permanently submerge a given landscape feature under a future sea-level projection. Flooding potential is the percentage of months within a year when there is inundation by seawater for a given elevation determined by the user, assuming hydrological connectivity.

A semi-empirical approach is a reasonable alternative to process-based GCMs given their accuracy limitations to reproduce historical sea-level trends of the 20th century. Modern climate records show a highly significant correlation of global temperature with sea-level change by rate and direction. It is expected that, with every 1 \u00b0C change in global air temperature, sea levels will rise or fall by 10-30 m. The linear approximation of sea-level change with this semi-empirical approach provides reproducible results of modern sea-level trends within centimeters.

What wetland type and plant species may be found within the intertidal zone is controlled by persistent salinity concentrations. Saltmarsh and mangroves are known for their tolerance of high soil salinities that can well exceed the average or typical concentration of open seawater, 35 parts per thousand (ppt). As sea level rises, the circulation of seawater penetrates farther inland with each tidal cycle, as well as episodically by storm tides and waves from tsunamis and hurricanes. A major cause of coastal forest retreat is saltwater intrusion by way of major storm tides and surge events occurring during a local or regional drought. During times of low water, marshes dehydrate and compress below normal elevations such that refilling by seawater as opposed to rainfall or other freshwater input can elevate interstitial pore water salinities in the soil layer. Increases of 1 or 2 ppt of soil salinity concentrations are sufficient to cause plant mortality and shifts in vegetation dominance."}, {"section_title": "Expert Hydrodynamic Models for Engineering Applications", "text": "There are a host of expert hydrodynamic models for engineering applications that are used for coastal restoration purposes of different kinds that likewise have the capacity to evaluate future sea-level rise projections.

These tools are becoming commonly available online for public access as interactive maps. These tools allow Internet browsers to visualize the potential impact of future sea-level rise scenarios on land maps at local, regional, and global scales as determined by tool design and capability. Tool developers include Federal, State, university, and nongovernmental organizations utilizing GIS data, software, and graphic user interfaces to display developer-specified images or user-specified choices of geospatial extent and sea-level rise options (table 4). As a rule, these are non-expert tools lacking scientific credibility that display maps of potential coastal inundation based on public-domain digital elevation models (DEMs) (app. 3) and arbitrary sea-level projections. These mapping tools are often referred to as \"bathtub\" models for the overly simplified approach of water-over-land relations, an approach that disregards important biological, hydrological, physiographic, and geodetic considerations. At best, these mapping tools provide only a visualization of the future extent of tidal wetlands and shorelines suitable for facilitating discussion of coastal issues and, more importantly, highlighting the need for expert model application and accuracy. Advantages of GIS sea-level rise mapping tools include their relative simplicity and ease of construction such that many organizations and individuals are able to produce their own versions by relying on the same or similar GIS mapping software and public-domain mapping sets of digital land elevation, vegetation, and land-use data. In this way, they are inexpensive and quick to build but also very limited functionally. Limitations of GIS sea-level rise mapping tools are numerous in places and situations where accuracy of coastal process, built features, differential land movement, ecosystem functions, and vertical rectification of water and land datums are lacking. Most importantly, these tools are almost exclusively unrectified and unverified for use or application as predictive models in the same context as more sophisticated ecological and engineering models (see following sections). The more accurate predictive models for simulating sea-level change and coastal impacts require datum transformations of water and land sources that are rectified to the same units and reference plane to make legitimate comparison of flooded or unflooded land surface. Tidal datum and land datum are measured and reported differently and cannot be directly compared or analyzed without proper rectification to the same datum type and epoch. As discussed previously, there are many reference datums that have been established over the years of numerous local and regional origins that make rectification somewhat complex and subject to expert knowledge. In most cases, GIS sea-level rise mapping tools use arbitrary heights or rates of sea-level rise that are not based on any datum or measured local or global tide history. The more accurate sea-level rise applications by contrast consider the relative sea-level rate by coastal reach because of the variable conditions, causes, and directions of land movement and tidal behavior. In addition to not being rectified, GIS sea-level rise mapping tools are not verified (verification is the measure to which they have been tested for accuracy or function that adds to the sense of predictive reliability). Modeling that simply forecasts a predicted future condition without verification is akin to extrapolating beyond the boundary conditions and data of a statistical model. Although it may be useful to apply GIS sea-level rise mapping tools to consider \"what if\" scenarios for limited planning and educational purposes, these tools do not have any certainty bounds or other verification measures that ensure results, particularly given all of the limitations of data sources, design, and functionality. GIS sea-level rise mapping tools may have an appearance of greater utility because of the busy display characteristics served from the quality and accuracy of DEMs incorporated (app. 3). The more detailed DEM sources of higher spatial resolution, however, have the advantage or disadvantage of being increasingly challenging to utilize because of file acquisition, size, and other factors that require greater computing skills and capacity to manage properly. Local features such as levees, dikes, revetments, and canals may not be included in associated public databases, which add to limitations of model application. A major assumption of GIS sea-level rise mapping tools is that there is uniform hydrological connectivity from open bays, oceans, estuaries, and rivers to adjacent or inland land units both in accessibility and in elevation.

In this section, we describe the class of wetland change models designed to predict changes in land cover at the ecosystem (habitat) level in terms of presence or absence (table 5). In these models, there are no quantitative features or attributes applied to the cover type other than a descriptive classification. The wetland type or habitat cover descriptions vary in detail and discrimination from generic classification of terrestrial or aquatic forms to surficial qualifiers of tidal flat, beach, low marsh, high marsh, swamp, upland, or other cover type. These models are similar to GIS sea-level rise mapping tools (\"bathtub\" models; see section \"Geographic Information System (GIS) Sea-Level Rise Mapping Tools\") in that they predict change on the basis of the relation between land and water, but wetland change models assign a vegetative cover or habitat change effect. Further, whereas GIS sea-level rise mapping tools predict which and when land grid cells are overtaken by rising sea level to become open water, wetland change models generally have a simple rule set that assigns a given habitat type by degree of submergence. As the land grid cell becomes more inundated over time, these models account for the loss or gain of the different habitat types as a measure of impact from sea-level rise. Wetland change models differ largely on the delineation of habitat types or classification scheme used and the degree of inundation at which a habitat switches from one type to another. Predicted loss of habitat is generally a matter of erosion or submergence by surface inundation when a marsh, swamp, or mudflat eventually transitions to open water. As with GIS sea-level rise mapping tools, with wetland change models the sea-surface height is modeled as a static rise in adjoining water cells over annual or longer time steps assuming connectivity rather than any dynamic process. Most of these models have the capacity to parameterize the land elevation dataset with protective features of dikes, seawalls, or levees to mimic decoupling from adjacent water bodies, in which case the wetland type usually stays the same until the protective feature is overtopped by rising sea level."}, {"section_title": "Barataria-Terrebonne Ecological Landscape Spatial Simulation (BTELSS)", "text": "The Barataria-Terrebonne Ecological Landscape Spatial Simulation (BTELSS) ( fig. 14) others, 1999, 2007;Martin and others, 2000;others, 2000, 2004;Binder and others, 2003) and its predecessor, the Coastal Ecological Landscape Spatial Simulation (CELSS) (Constanza and others, 1990;Sklar and others, 1991), represent a processbased ecological model design of coastal wetland change and water constituents within a watershed context for evaluating potential impacts of restoration projects, river diversions, saltwater intrusion, climate change, and sea-level rise. The model framework is composed of raster cells representing interconnected 1-km 2 land units for a defined watershed. Each cell is connected to neighboring cells on all sides, involving a mass balance exchange of water volume and constituents of sediment, salt, and nutrients. The buildup of land or erosion to open water in a cell depends on the net balance of elevation gain by sedimentation and organic accretion or net loss from scour or subsidence. The effect of net surficial change is critical for predicting how marsh succession is affected by natural and human activities. Time-series data of Atchafalaya River and Mississippi River discharges, Gulf of Mexico salinity, river sediments and nutrients, rainfall, sea level, runoff, temperature, and winds are inputs to the model affecting water and constituent movement through the watershed.

Hydrological characteristics of these low-relief coastal forests in intertidal settings are dictated by the influence of tidal and freshwater forcing. The Sea Level Over Proportional Elevation (SLOPE) model (Doyle and others, 2010) is a USGS product that predicts coastal forest retreat and saltmarsh/mangrove migration from projected sea-level rise on the basis of a proxy relation of saltmarsh/mangrove area and tidal range ( fig. 16). The model as applied to the Gulf Coast is subdivided into separate reaches defined by each of the 60 coastal counties from Texas to Florida. Summaries of saltmarsh/mangrove area for each coastal county were obtained from published sources on the basis of detailed grid sampling of the NWI database and habitat classification scheme. Tidal ranges were obtained from NOAA tide stations for more than 300 locations and filtered to assign corresponding maximum tide range for each coastal county. The SLOPE model assumes that the sum area of saltmarsh/mangrove habitat along any given coastal reach is determined by the slope of the landform and vertical tide forcing.

More often the implicit assumption of GIS sea-level rise mapping tools is that, as sea level rises above surface elevation, marsh habitat succumbs to inundation and is consequently converted to open water. Wetland change models work similarly, but some assign fixed or static accretion rates by habitat type such that, as sea-level rise rate exceeds these values, the habitat type and land unit undergo inundation (that is, submersion, erosion), resulting in habitat loss and conversion to open seawater. Field studies of marsh soil stratigraphy and age demonstrate that saltmarsh and mangrove species can keep pace with sea-level change of past centuries and millennia even in delta settings subject to high rates of land subsidence, such as in the Mississippi River coastal platform.

Geographic position of barrier island and mainland shorelines from maps dating to the European discovery of North America has been compared with more recent map sources to demonstrate shifts, erosion, and aggradation of coastal features linked to longshore currents and riverine influences. New observational tools and techniques to monitor surface elevation and soil salinity change within coastal wetlands have improved understanding of the dynamic nature of subsidence, accretion, sedimentation, eutrophication, and saltwater intrusion with changing hydrological forcing connected with hurricanes, sea level, streamflow, climate, and biotic factors. In this section, we describe different tools and techniques for monitoring and modeling surface elevation, shoreline change, and storm influences of coastal systems.

The CVI is a probability index designed to assign relative risk and future threat of shoreline change under rising sea level. The index is based primarily on empirical measures of physical changes determined from comparative shoreline surveys or maps related to physical forces and features of tidal range, wave height, coastal slope, geomorphology, and relative sea-level trend by coastal reach. This approach, using combinations of measured change, coastal attributes, and physical forcings, provides a relative vulnerability, or erodibility, measure for guiding coastal planning and research. Prediction of shoreline retreat and land loss rates is critical to planning future coastal development and management strategies. CVI provides a useful construct and decision-support tool on a national and regional basis for assessing economic risk and threats of coastal erosion, flooding, and storm damage. For example, along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, high-vulnerability areas are typically barrier islands having small tidal ranges, large waves, a low coastal slope, and high landform subsidence, such as in the Mid-Atlantic region ( fig. 17). Coasts with rocky cliffs or steep slopes are generally associated with large tidal ranges and low subsidence rates, such as most of the coastline in the Northeast, and are represented as low vulnerability (that is, low CVI). A Bayesian Network (BN) analysis has been developed to complement the historical perspective of the CVI to predict long-term shoreline change for the different projections of sea-level rise. The BN analysis links the relations between driving forces, geological constraints, and coastal response for the U.S. Atlantic Coast that include observations of local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. Probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat can be generated in response to different sea-level rise projections, mostly demonstrating that shoreline retreat increases with higher rates of sea-level rise ( fig. 17)."}, {"section_title": "Marsh Substrate Geochronology Methods", "text": "A number of well-established methods are used to date peat and mineral layers of marsh substrates and biological deposits with different radioactive isotopes, mainly carbon-14 ( 14 C), lead-210 ( 210 Pb), cesium-137 ( 137 Cs), beryllium-7 ( 7 Be), oxygen-18 ( 18 O), and uranium-238 ( 238 U). The concentration and ratios of the different radioactive isotopes for each element have been used successfully to age the different depths of soil and fossil deposits for reconstructing ancient sea level, glacial advance and retreat, fossil age, and marsh accretion rates (DeLaune and others, 1989;Appleby and Oldfield, 1992;Turner and others, 2006;Mudd and others, 2009). The different radioactive isotopes are used for different purposes and time periods but provide similar results of identifying dates for organic debris, fossils, and mineral layers of marsh soils and bog peats. Geochronology is the science of aging (dating) rocks, fossils, peats, and sediments that is inherent to the accuracy and limitations of the isotope and properties of radioactive decay or half-life. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose and, depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying radioactive isotopes are useful for dating longer periods of time but are less accurate in absolute years. Radiocarbon dating is well known and commonly used for reconstructing ancient sea level of the more recent Holocene epoch of the last 12,000 years. Cesium-137 dating of marsh substrate is a reliable method for estimating near-term sediment accretion rates as an artificial radionuclide product of bomb testing and peak fallout in 1963-64. Isotopic analysis, such as 18 O and 16 O ratios, is also used to relate the climate conditions under which fossils grew, which correlate with ocean temperature and salinity that can be further extrapolated to sea-level equivalents."}, {"section_title": "Saltmarsh Stratigraphy and Evolution Models", "text": "There are a number of field and modeling studies that have attempted to understand the process and feedback mechanisms of marsh accretion of different coastal settings and environmental drivers (Allen, 1990;French, 1993;Morris, 1995;Rybczyk and others, 1998;Fagherazzi and others, 2012;Kirwan and Mudd, 2012). Conceptual, analytical, and numerical models have been developed to predict the process and rate on the basis of the different biotic and abiotic factors that vary with coastal position and degree of marine influence. In most applications, vegetation health and productivity are important components controlled by degree of inundation and submergence by tidal influence relative to mean sea level. Model types vary with complexity of processes and parameters to predict the genesis of saltmarsh soils controlled by relative rates of nutrient mineralization and inputs of organic and inorganic matter. Processes include sedimentation of exogenous and endogenous organic and inorganic matter, decomposition, aboveground and belowground biomass and production, and nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization. Models vary with vegetation type, tidal relations, and deposition rates as a function of surface elevation and distance from a channel. Distinctions of refractory and labile forms of organic fractions, aboveground and belowground production models, and decay rates add to model detail and functionality ( fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Surface Elevation Tables (SETs)", "text": "The surface elevation table (SET) others, 2002a, 2002b;Krauss and others, 2010;Rogers and others, 2012) is composed of a benchmark set in wetland soils and environments that is repeatedly resurveyed with a portable mechanical device for precise releveling of the soil surface. The SET provides a nondestructive method for making highly accurate and precise remeasurements of sediment elevation of intertidal and subtidal wetlands over long periods of time relative to a fixed benchmark attached to a subsurface rod usually deep and driven to refusal (fig. 18). This technique overcomes many of the limitations of methods currently used to estimate elevation, such as sedimentation pins and precision surveying. The rod SET can be attached to either deep or shallow rods driven to different depths below surface into stable geological formations ( fig. 18A). This flexible design allows the rod SET to be used to monitor elevations across different depths of the soil profile. A number of SETs may be established in a network for a particular site along a landscape or geomorphic gradient or in different wetland types to determine rates and processes of elevation change in different settings relative to abiotic and biotic factors. SETs are typically revisited quarterly, annually, or after storm events to monitor change over time and to identify what sources, mechanisms, and factors are contributing to elevation loss or gain. Clay feldspar pads are used in conjunction with SETs to establish a marker horizon of a known date on the wetland surface ( fig. 18B) from which organic and mineral deposition rates can be estimated from subsequent core sampling. A data record of SET readings over years provides a definitive picture of the various contributing factors of accretion, deposition, subsidence, and storms that determine whether a given soil surface is either increasing or decreasing in elevation and is either keeping pace with or falling behind relative sea-level change for a given coastal setting."}, {"section_title": "Tidal Channel Network Models (TIGER)", "text": "Beyond the coarse coastline-change measures on a national or regional scale are the local and more fractal changes of tidal creeks and river outlets that relate to the process of marine and riverine coupling with marsh platforms, which is important to hydrological exchange and biophysical controls of marsh evolution, species composition, and productivity. Various numerical models have recently been developed to describe the morphogenesis and long-term dynamics of saltmarsh channels and tidal creek networks during periods of rising sea levels (Fagherazzi and Sun, 2004;D'Alpaos and others, 2005;Kirwan and Murray, 2007). Current understanding of coastal landform evolution is still more conceptual than certain in ability to validate quantitative predictions of how, when, where, and whether saltwater and freshwater systems can or will keep pace with different rates of sea-level rise. Tidal channels are related conduits that shape the marsh landscape and are in turn affected by the marsh landscape. The composition and constituency of marsh substrate and its exposure to tidal forcing and storm surge flooding dictate the proximity and dendritic patterns of tidal creeks, as do human influences of coastal modifications, dredging, and channelization. Where static models are simple to apply and to simulate flooding of marsh surfaces, they assume that surface water is delivered instantaneously rather than with temporal and spatial variability across the marsh platform. More advanced hydrodynamic models consider the time-dependent processes of flooding path, depth, and duration on the basis of distance, shape, and function of associated tidal creeks and marsh platforms. The rate of flooding and draining varies sharply at the highest and lowest elevations of the tidal range more than around the mean condition because of the different astronomical tide types and meteorological extremes. Sea-level rise models should be improved or more accurate as more realistic tidal hydrodynamics are incorporated rather than static \"bathtub\" treatment."}, {"section_title": "Niche-Based Species Distribution Models", "text": "Niche-based species distribution models describe the interrelation of environmental factors or conditions thought to define or limit species range on the basis of geographic extent. These models assume that modern distribution of species is controlled by associated climate and edaphic factors that can be quantified and expressed as favored and adapted ecological space. Fundamental niche space is theoretically all sets of factors controlling species presence, colonization, and persistence, whereas realized niche space (actual species range) is a limited expression of full ecological potential. Commonly, the overlap of precipitation and temperature datasets coincident with species range is used to construct niche space and project potential spread with changing climate. This approach assumes that environment solely controls species spread and success apart from event-driven causes or other physiographic, hydrological, or biotic factors. A prime example of how niche-based modeling may be deficient for some plant species is the range extent of Taxodium distichum (baldcypress) across the Eastern United States. The range boundary is not uniform with latitude or longitude, including disjunct distribution and populations. One biological attribute of baldcypress is its modest but comparatively elevated salt tolerance among freshwater tree species. Baldcypress is more readily known for its site preference and dominance in flood zones and growth production under high-precipitation conditions. Its interrupted range extent in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas is indicative of arid conditions less suitable for baldcypress sustainability. Studies of tidal freshwater forests along coastal margins of the Southeastern United States indicate that, as residual soil salinities of these systems become elevated above 3 ppt from storm tides, prolonged drought, and saltwater intrusion, baldcypress persists in degraded, monospecific stands along the marsh-estuarine ecotone. The distribution and range of baldcypress correspond with the elevation of ancient sea level (about 120 m above current sea level) dating back to highstand shorelines of the Late Cretaceous epoch around 65 million years ago ( fig. 19). State records of champion baldcypress trees provide evidence that planted baldcypress persists to mature age and size in nearly every northern State and Canada, beyond its natural range, suggesting that colder climate is not a limitation to growth. Mangroves are another group of wetland species whose range is related to sea level by adaptation to saltwater conditions and propagule spread by ocean tides and currents. As tropical plant species that dominate coastal areas in tropical zones worldwide, mangroves also delineate intertidal zones of higher latitudes over geological periods under favorably warm climates with an absence of freeze events and of lower, equatorial latitudes during cooling periods ( fig. 20). A weakness, therefore, of many sea-level models is the singular factor approach, in which only sea level by submergence controls loss or gain of coastal habitat with its projected rise or fall, and there is a lack of an interactive or integrated approach of allowing mangroves to supersede saltmarsh under warmer, frost-free, climate. A niche-based species distribution model with sea-level controls does not exist, but the related Climate-Envelope Mangrove Model (Osland and others, 2013), developed by the USGS, demonstrates how projected climate warming allows for mangrove expansion to higher latitudes. This species distribution model was developed to predict potential mangrove expansion latitudinally with rising temperatures and lower freeze probabilities under a future climate scenario. By using existing mangrove distribution across the northern Gulf of Mexico, an empirical relation was derived to explain mangrove presence and abundance with a host of multidecadal winter climate parameters, and the niche-based modeling approach was applied by using current mangrove distributions for the five Gulf Coast States-Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida-to determine whether and where mangroves might expand in the absence of freeze events for different emission scenarios. The resulting Climate-Envelope Mangrove Model is based on winter severity climate parameters to predict either potential loss or injury from freeze or population spread and abundance with warming climate. Mean annual minimum temperature (MAMT) was identified as the winter climate variable that best explained mangrove presence and abundance. Model simulations were applied to predict where mangrove colonizers can establish and spread under different cases of future temperature regimes under climate change. The northern Gulf of Mexico represents a broad longitudinal expanse within a narrow latitudinal band within a subtropical zone where only slight changes in rising temperatures will favor spread of tropical species (fig. 21). In this case, sea-level rise alone is not sufficient to predict the fate of mangrove spread but requires additional predictors such as favorable temperature regimes."}, {"section_title": "Leaf to Landscape (L2L) Ecosystem Models", "text": "Leaf to landscape (L2L) ecosystem models are the most sophisticated ecological models developed for sea-level rise application. These models predict ecosystem change at the species and organism level on the basis of the physiological tolerances and ecological requirements of a species and specific environmental conditions of an organism or individual plant (table 6). L2L ecosystem models incorporate a hierarchical integration of ecological processes and response from the leaf level, where photosynthesis, water exchange, and carbon allocation take place on an individual tree or plant basis, to the stand level, where interplant competition, biomass, and diversity are measured, to the landscape level, where physical factors of soil, watershed, climate, and disturbance differences affect system-level response."}, {"section_title": "Coupled Saltmarsh Biogeochemical and Demographic Model", "text": "A coupled biogeochemical and demographic model (Simas and others, 2001) was developed for saltmarsh in the Tagus estuary in Portugal to predict potential effects of sealevel rise on distribution of C 3 and C 4 plant species (plants that use a carbon fixation pathway with 3-and 4-carbon molecules, respectively, in the first stable photosynthetic product). Saltmarsh processes are simulated as a function of C 3 and C 4 species carbon production from light-and temperaturedependent functions of growth, respiration, and leaf mortality. A class transition model simulated the demographics of plant population density per unit area. A GIS tool was used to track changes in elevation with constant sedimentation inputs over time and the various production attributes of lower marsh (C 4 ) and upper marsh (C 3 ) with sea-level rise of 95 cm by 2100. The model does not simulate marsh migration upslope but rather simulates the loss of marsh habitat cover and production over time."}, {"section_title": "Hammock-Mangrove Vadose Zone Model", "text": "The ecotone of vegetation boundaries between tidal freshwater and saltwater wetlands is often fairly discrete but can be overlapping and intermingled. In The Everglades, mangroves have expanded upslope into zones once dominated by freshwater wetlands over the past century concomitant with sea-level rise and freshwater drainage effects. Mangrove propagule transport by landward wind and storm tides pushing up tidal creeks and drainage canals allows for regeneration opportunities far inland. Saltwater intrusion simultaneously occurs with redirected freshwater drainage and increasing sea level. The Hammock-Mangrove Vadose Zone Model (Teh and others, 2008) was developed by the USGS to investigate the process of species distribution and productivity response of changing salinity concentrations with sea-level rise. The simulation model is of hypothetical design for a 1-hectare landscape (made of 100-by-100 1-m grid cells) at the ecotone of hardwood hammock and mangrove vegetation with an assumed elevation gradient of 10 cm/km.  The Hammock-Mangrove Vadose Zone Model simulates daily changes and diffusion of saltwater intrusion on the basis of difference calculations or infiltration rates of precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration distinguished by wetland type. Daily tide values are compared with cell elevation to determine flux additions of salinity that is subsequently diffused among neighboring cells and with soil depth based on salinity concentrations. A single 1-m grid cell can contain both hammock and mangrove species. Physiological parameters are species specific to account for species growth rates and litter production. The model was developed principally to evaluate the process of self-organization under chronic sealevel changes and acute impacts of storm surge synoptics. The model predicts species biomass and distribution spatially and temporally for exploring the process of regime shifts of species dominance."}, {"section_title": "SELVA-MANGRO Model", "text": "The near-sea-level elevation and flat slope of the protected ecosystem of The Everglades account for one of the largest contiguous tracts of mangrove forests found anywhere in the world and emphasize the potential vulnerability of coastal wetlands to rising sea level and changes in freshwater management. An L2L ecosystem model known as SELVA-MANGRO (Doyle and Girod, 1997;Doyle and others, 2003b;Berger and others, 2008) was developed for Neotropical mangrove forests by the USGS to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on the quality and distribution of future coastal wetland habitat of The Everglades. SELVA-MANGRO predicts mangrove displacement of freshwater marsh and swamp habitat with increasing tidal inundation in proportion to the rate of sea-level rise. SELVA-MANGRO represents a hierarchically integrated landscape-scale vegetation model (SELVA) spatially linked to an individualbased stand simulation model (MANGRO) (table 6) for predicting change in the structure and distribution of mangrove forests at a park, a refuge, or regional scale. Both models are spatially explicit, thereby accounting for arrangement of trees within a forest stand and stand distribution within a landscape. SELVA-MANGRO comprises multiple linked hierarchical relations at the leaf, tree, species, stand, ecosystem, and landscape level. The location of each individual tree and stand is explicitly mapped within the same coordinate system, akin to a GIS. SELVA and MANGRO represent trees and space in three-dimensional architecture of horizontal and vertical articulation. SELVA contains a regionally interpolated DEM of south Florida based on a 1-ft contour survey conducted in the 1950s (fig. 22). SELVA tracks predicted changes in the biotic and abiotic conditions of distributed land units, including forcing functions and environmental conditions on an annual time step for the entire simulated landscape. SELVA passes necessary information of environmental change to the MANGRO model at the stand level for each and all land units in the landscape profile. MANGRO returns a system condition of stand structure and composition to SELVA as predicted for each growth season or calendar year. Composite maps are produced that exhibit the predicted changes in species composition and forest migration, loss, or gain as influenced by changes in climate, sea level, hurricane disturbance, and freshwater flow ( fig. 22). SELVA is composed of several primary data layers delineating ecosystem boundaries, land elevation, tidal range, sea level, river stage, and disturbance conditions. Classified vegetation maps of the study area are imported into SELVA from all available sources to distinguish ecosystem distribution across the simulated landscape including mangrove and non-mangrove vegetation of other habitat types, such as saltmarsh, freshmarsh, swamp forest, and upland forest. Tidal inundation and circulation are key factors controlling marsh and forest distribution. Subsidence and accretion rates are user-specified inputs that SELVA accepts to affect annual elevation change. Boundary zones of major habitat classes are used to delineate the lower and upper elevations of the intertidal zone as defined by mangrove extent relating to mean low tide and mean high tide by coastal reach. Tide gage records are used to interpolate tidal range across the land-sea interface of the study region and to define the intertidal plane. MANGRO is an individual-based model composed of a species-specific set of biological functions predicting the growth, establishment, and death of individual trees. Species selection and function include mangrove species common to Florida and the Neotropics: Avicennia germinans (black mangrove), Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove), and Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove). MANGRO includes empirically based algorithms for tolerance of each species to shade on the basis of light-response experiments and the ability of each species to regenerate and grow under flooded conditions. MANGRO predicts the tree and gap replacement process of natural forest succession as influenced by stand structure and prevailing environmental conditions ( fig.  22B). MANGRO assigns attributes to each tree including latitude, longitude, species, stem diameter, height, crown dimensions, leaf area, and spatial position relative to neighbors (distance and azimuth). Growth of individual trees is dependent on species, stem diameter, crown size, leaf area, light availability, flooding, salinity, and competition from neighboring trees. Crown growth and structure are explicitly modeled as a function of crown space and preeminence as to which tree fills space first for a given crown height and class. Canopy structure is modeled as a three-dimensional process of crown height, width, and depth in relation to sun angle and shading by neighboring trees. Tree growth is modeled as a function of growth potential for a given tree size reduced by derived crown volume, light availability to the individual tree, and species response to shade. Tree death results from prolonged growth suppression, senescence, or disturbance by hurricane, logging, or lightning strike.

Although aquatic, these meadows are also at risk under rising sea levels. Seagrasses exist within a restricted depth range as influenced by substrate, water quality, and most importantly, turbidity, which can limit light penetration and growth. A change in sea level, whether rise or fall, affects their distribution and survival in nearshore waters. The ability of certain species to persist or migrate with rising sea level depends on how and where sediment deposition occurs as sea level changes over time. The Spatial Relative Elevation Model (SREM) (Kairis and Rybczyk, 2010) was developed for Padilla Bay, Washington, to predict changes in bathymetry on the basis of distribution and productivity of seagrass meadows dominated by Zostera marina (eelgrass). SREM is a modified version of a marsh soils cohort model for coastal Louisiana adapted to consider the processes of sediment deposition affecting bathymetry of an aquatic bay system. SREM is a spatial model of Padilla Bay at a 50-m grid resolution with no interaction between neighboring cells. Each cell simulates processes of seagrass productivity, aboveground and belowground, and standing stock resulting in net changes in bay-bottom elevation. Survival is determined by discrete depth ranges, taking into account that water can be too shallow or too deep. A number of sea-level rise scenarios were applied to forecast bathymetric changes of Padilla Bay and the threat to eelgrass communities. Results show that, except for the most extreme sea-level rise projections, eelgrass communities will not diminish and may even flourish because of the proportion of shallow mud flats that will become favorable colonization sites."}, {"section_title": "WETLANDS", "text": "The WETLANDS L2L ecosystem model (Doyle and others, 2003a) predicts plant-species distribution and migration with changing land-water relations. The WETLANDS model is a USGS product that uses empirical relations of species occurrence by elevation within the tidal plane to project marsh regression or transgression with sea-level fall or rise, respectively. The model uses data from a field study that was conducted to relate plant-species distribution and ecotones to surface elevation and tidal inundation by using differential leveling surveys ( fig. 23). The WETLANDS model contains functional probabilities of species tolerance to flooding conditions that dictate the rate and process of ecological succession and coastal retreat  with sea-level rise. Map information of hypsography and bathymetry of the coastal zone was digitized and interpolated to construct a regional-scale DEM prior to the availability of NED and lidar datasets. Classified Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery of aquatic and terrestrial habitat at a community level was used to initialize model simulation by species and vegetation type. The WETLANDS model, assuming hydrological connectivity of adjacent open water cells, tracks the process and pattern of coastal inundation spatially and temporally. The model predicts migration of marsh habitat and transgression of coastal forest habitat as sea level moves upslope. Simulated forecasts of the tidal regime are based on mean monthly sea-level projections from regionally relevant tide gage records. The model contrasts the predicted mean sea-surface height with surface elevations of each land unit (that is, 30-m pixel) to determine flood height. Flood height is then used to predict favored habitat condition on the basis of probability functions of species and community tolerance to coastal inundation and elevation calibrated from field surveys. In years in which flood height exceeds tolerance for the prevailing species complement or habitat condition, new or updated species cover and community type are assigned to the habitat array to reflect a change in ecological succession. Model output consists of pixel counts and hectares of converted habitat (loss and gain) by calendar year."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Changes in climate during past ice ages and warming periods have affected sea levels and coastal extent as evidenced from ice, sediment, peat, and fossil records. Ancient sea-level reconstructions from multiple disciplines and techniques demonstrate worldwide consistency of high and low sea-level cycles of 120 meters (m) or more for long glaciation periods and higher and lower rates during the rise and fall segments. Current sea-level rates of more than 3 millimeters per year (mm/yr) in global ocean volume (eustasy) are moderate by historical calculations but when amplified by high rates of land subsidence may prove consequential to wetland stability and persistence on a local or regional basis. Tide gage records show that some coastal reaches are undergoing uplift from glacial rebound that accounts for an effective sea-level fall counter to the prevailing global rise of sea level elsewhere. Satellite altimetry provides a more accurate rate of global ocean volume (eustasy) exceeding 3 mm/yr for the most recent tidal epoch (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012). Tide gages for the same time period generally show higher sealevel rise rates where there is active subsidence or crustal tilt. Sea-level rise rates for U.S. tide gages along the Gulf of Mexico coastline exhibit comparatively lower and higher rates in earlier tidal epochs of the 20th century, confounding any certainty of short-or long-term acceleration based on satellite observations. In this handbook, we explain and illustrate proper evaluation of sea-level rates between satellite observations and tide gages, which requires observed records that are longer than a tidal epoch (greater than 19 years), have the same start and end dates, are seasonally balanced, have equal frequency modulation, and are complete (without data gaps). Otherwise, it is improper and problematic to contrast a sea-level rate from long-term tide gage trends with short-term satellite observations, as has been done in media and scientific reports. In effect, tide gage records and satellite observations are compatible and complementary, and there is value and need for both. Satellites account solely for the change in eustasy, whereas tide gages also capture the rate and direction of land motion (rise or fall). No matter the degree of human or natural consequence, rising sea level is already affecting our coastal ecosystems and infrastructure to an extent that society must deal with the problems and setbacks of coastal flooding. Various Earthclimate and coastal wetland models have been developed to address the interaction and impact of changing climate and land-use from a sea-level rise perspective. Simple models utilizing coarse datasets and constructs of the behavior of natural systems may only provide limited utility and certainty suitable for instructional or educational purposes, whereas more complex models require expert development and more site-specific parameterization and validation for aiding management decisions. The dynamic nature of the components of the Earth's hydrosphere and climate that account for the net balance of ocean volumes combined with the interactive effects of rebound and tilting of continental plates, as well as differential local and regional subsidence, presents a complicated process to model easily or with certainty. Models help our understanding of these interacting processes and provide the basis for forecasting potential change useful for land management and conservation planning. In 2012, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted more than 30 training and feedback sessions with Federal, State, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) coastal managers and planners across the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to educate and to evaluate user needs and their understanding of concepts, data, and modeling tools for projecting sea-level rise and its impact on coastal habitats and wildlife. It was our goal to introduce the non-expert to the broad spectrum of models and applications that have been used to predict or forecast environmental change and ecosystem response for sea-level rise assessments. We have compiled a fairly comprehensive treatise of the data, models, and methods from various related disciplines to offer a condensed synthesis of the science and simulation models of sea-level rise, past, present, and future. As demonstrated, the models vary greatly in design and detail, functionally and structurally, spatially and temporally, physical to biological, from leaf to landscape, and so on. It is our hope that coastal managers, engineers, and scientists will benefit from a greater understanding of the dynamics and models for projecting causes and consequences of sea-level change on the landscape and seascape.

Elevation and Vegetation Data Sources for Sea-Level Rise Modeling", "text": "The recent advent of geospatial software, digital modes of cartographical referencing, and remote sensing applications has greatly expanded the scope of data visualization and spatial modeling critical to the study and analysis of Earthclimate systems and sea-level rise. Fundamental to the process of assessing the impact of rising sea levels on a natural or cultural feature, park or refuge, ecosystem or species range, or coastline or continent is knowing where you are and whether you are above or below a past, present, or future waterline. Geographic information systems (GIS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are common tools on the job, in the home, or on mobile phones and are useful for placing oneself or any physical or natural feature in time and space. Most sealevel rise analyses or applications have some spatial context and depend on geospatial data sources and software to make assessments and predictions. Fundamental geospatial data inputs include model boundaries or study area; land, water, or feature elevations; and cover type, usually vegetation, species, ecosystem, or cultural. This appendix provides a basic overview of commonly used geospatial datasets of sea-level rise models and an evaluation of data utility for sea-level vulnerability assessments. Topography and bathymetry are key parameters of the process and consequence of coastal change based on elevation above or below past, present, or future sea level. Relating the surface elevation of the terrestrial to the marine environment requires a compatible reference datum with respect to sea surface (such as mean high water [MHW] or mean higher high water [MHHW]). Historically, the records and datums for land and water have been collected and referenced differently in orthometric and tidal datums that are not directly comparable without rectification or transformation from one to the other. Depending on the date, age, and process of data gathering, the records also may be of different orthometric and tidal datums of different eras, thereby requiring additional rectification to match modern datums. The subject of datum transformations is critically important but beyond the scope of this handbook except to educate potential users and modelers of the need to rectify all data sources and elevations into a compatible format and the same reference plane. The choices of digital data for surface elevations and habitat type are becoming increasingly diverse and are generally improving in detail, spatial resolution, and accuracy. In this appendix, we describe various publicdomain topographic and bathymetric data products of global, national, and regional significance that have been or can be used for sea-level rise modeling. Important considerations are addressed regarding the data source, spatial resolution, temporal period, and the data vertical and horizontal accuracies (table 3-1).

SRTM data are available in two spatial resolutions: 3 arc-seconds (approximately 90 meters [m]) globally and 1 arc-second (approximately 30 m) for the United States and its territories. others (2005, 2006) assessed SRTM errors globally. For North America, more than 90 percent of errors were within 12.6 m for absolute horizontal accuracy, 9 m for absolute vertical accuracy, and 7 m for relative height accuracy. The errors were roughly consistent globally. The vertical datum for SRTM data is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid. It is important to note that SRTM elevation data do not always map the ground surface because radar cannot penetrate dense tree canopy or can be reflected off man-made structures or objects. The elevation data from SRTM, therefore, can be considered more of a DSM than a \"bare-earth\" DEM. There are multiple versions of the SRTM data. Version 1, released in 2003, is considered \"research grade\" data and should be avoided for sea-level rise applications for several reasons, including the following: (1) these data are unedited and may contain areas with no data or anomalous data, (2) coastlines are typically not well delineated, and (3) these data have not been evaluated for conformance with National Mapping Accuracy Standards. Version 2.0, also known as the SRTM finished data, was released in 2005 and contains edits to fill voids and to better delineate coastlines and water bodies, specifically oceans, lakes, and rivers. Version 2.1 was released in 2009 and had a low filter (3\u00d73) applied to clean remaining voids from version 2.0 data. Version 2.1 is available for only SRTM 3-arcsecond (approximately 90-m) data. The accuracy associated with SRTM is notable considering the scale of a near global mapping effort; however, these data are not recommended for local, regional, or national sea-level rise modeling."}, {"section_title": "National Elevation Dataset (NED)", "text": "NED (Gesch and others, 2002) is a seamless DEM produced by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for the entire United States and its territories. NED is a dynamic dataset that is continually updated as new elevation data, particularly lidar data, become available. NED data are referenced to a 1-by-1 degree latitude/longitude index. NED products are available at various spatial resolutions. NED 1 arc-second is a DEM product with a spatial resolution of 30 m, whereas NED 1/3 arc-second and NED 1/9 arc-second are interpolated at finer resolutions of 10 m and 3.3 m, respectively. The vertical datum for these products is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). NED source data vary by DEM product and by geographic area. NED 1-arcsecond data are created by using stereophotogrammetry of aerial photographs and linear interpolation of cartographic contours. NED 1/3-arc-second and 1/9-arc-second data are resampled with different degrees and combinations of simple linear interpolation of cartographic contours, digital photogrammetry, and polynomial interpolation of lidar data. The accuracy of these NED products is variable depending on the actual data sources used by geographic location. The absolute vertical accuracy of the NED 1-arcsecond DEM products was assessed by using control points from the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and has been found to have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.44-m horizontal accuracy and 1.64-m vertical accuracy. Although this accuracy assessment provides a useful baseline, it was conducted by using about 13,000 control points for the entire conterminous United States. If possible, a separate assessment is recommended for more localized accuracy estimates for any NED product. Accuracy assessment is particularly important for NED 1/3-arc-second and NED 1/9-arc-second data, for which there is not a reported accuracy. Another way to determine the vertical accuracy is to investigate the vertical accuracy of the source data. To check availability of NED products, updates, methods and source data, and currency of data, visit the USGS National Elevation Dataset Viewer (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/?p=ned)."}, {"section_title": "Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar)", "text": "In 1960, the first optical laser was developed by Hughes Aircraft, Inc. (the technology is similar to sonar and can gage distance below), and shortly thereafter, early lidar technology was used to develop topographic profiles (Jensen, 2007). Modern lidar system surface elevation data are generated by firing a laser beam from an airplane-based instrument and recording the time increment required for the beam return. Elevations are calculated on the basis of the time it takes for the laser beam to bounce from the surface and return to the aircraft, the position of which is recorded by highly accurate GPS. Lidar data provide both horizontal positions in planimetric geographic coordinates (x,y) and vertical (or elevation) coordinates (z). Lidar sensors can receive one or more returns from one pulse of light. If multiple returns exist for a sample area, then the first return is considered the elevation of the first object that the light contacts, and the last return is often some point below the first return and sometimes considered to be bare earth. Raw data (often received as files in LASer file format [.las]) contain all returns. DSMs can be created from lidar data containing first returns (that is, tree canopy and structures). Lidar products are commonly available in raw format (as .las files) containing all returns and as lidar-derived products (for example, DEMs or contour maps) that have undergone advanced postprocessing to ensure that elevations represent bare earth. There are two main types of lidar systems. Terrestrial lidar systems fire laser pulses that have a spectral resolution of near-infrared (0.75-1.4 micrometers [\u03bcm]). Near-infrared light is absorbed by water and therefore may not record elevations below the surface of the water. Bathymetric lidar systems use a laser-visible, green band length in addition to the infrared band length. The return pulse of the infrared laser indicates the surface of the water body, and the return pulse of the green laser indicates the bottom of the water body (Fowler, 2001). Lidar data availability in the United States is increasing. Although much of the lidar data available are topographic lidar data collected for mapping floodplains, some bathymetric lidar data are available for coastal areas. Lidar data are obtained on a mission-by-mission basis by agencies and organizations such as Federal agencies (for example, the USGS, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) or State and local governments (for example, county or city governments). The spatial resolution, accuracy, and temporal resolution, therefore, vary by dataset. Generally, the spatial resolution of lidar-based DEMs is less than 5 m, and the reported horizontal and vertical accuracies are highly accurate and are 0.25 m or less. For information pertaining to the spatial resolution and horizontal and vertical accuracies of individual products, check the metadata that accompany the product, contact the vendor, or contact the entity that provided the data. Lidar data have limitations in areas with dense canopy or vegetative cover. Generally, if one is standing under dense tree canopy and cannot see the sky, then it is unlikely that a laser pulse will strike the ground there. Accuracy estimates are reported over the entire mission area, which can be large and include a large number of different land covers. It is recommended, therefore, that if possible the lidar data and related products are assessed locally for relevant accuracy estimates for the area of interest in any modeling effort. Recently, easy to use portals such as the United States Interagency Elevation Inventory and the NOAA Coastal Lidar Portal have been developed to view and obtain readily available lidar data."}, {"section_title": "Bathymetric Data", "text": "Seafloor topographic data are often combined with terrestrial DEMs (see section \"Digital Elevation Models\") to create a DEM that extends above and below the water surface (that is, a topobathy DEM). Multiple sources of bathymetry data exist, including NOAA nautical charts radar, marine geophysical trackline surveys, multibeam sound navigation and ranging (sonar) surveys, bathymetric lidar, and satellite altimetry. The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center has an extensive archive of bathymetric data collected by various sources and methods. For some areas, NOAA National Geophysical Data Center has created DEMs containing topography and ocean bathymetry for coastal areas. Bathymetric data sources can be found in the United States Interagency Elevation Inventory. Bathymetric data were collected during the SRTM; however, the data (known as SRTM Plus) have a coarser resolution (that is, 1.85-km resolution) than do the SRTM topographic data. A few considerations for selecting bathymetric data include the objective(s) of the sea-level rise application, the extent of the study area, and the scale and limitations of the existing data used (that is, topographic elevation data, land cover data)."}, {"section_title": "Topographic Survey", "text": "Topographic surveys conducted with a total station or GPS equipment may be available for certain localized areas along a coast or within managed lands where a topographic survey may have been conducted. These data may be used to enhance an existing DEM, but because of the time-consuming nature and cost of these surveys, they would rarely be done at a scale large enough for a sea-level rise modeling effort."}, {"section_title": "Vertical Accuracy and Uncertainty", "text": "Vertical accuracy of elevation data is one of the most critical elements in sea-level rise applications. The National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) uses the RMSE to estimate the linear error with a 95-percent confidence level by multiplying the RMSE by 1.96. As previously mentioned, uncertainty can present critical limitations to sea-level rise applications, particularly regarding modeling a sea-level rise rate (such as 50 cm by 2100) for relatively small time steps (such as 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100) (Gesch, 2013). Elevation data with the lowest amount of uncertainty (that is, highest vertical accuracy), therefore, should be used for modeling inundation associated with sea-level rise."}, {"section_title": "Land Cover Data", "text": "Numerous sources of land cover data may be available for any given area where one may want to conduct sea-level rise modeling. In this section, we introduce and discuss a few widespread and readily available land cover sources. We identify where these datasets may be obtained and sources of supplementary information. Important considerations regarding land cover data include the classes mapped (that is, vegetation types, habitats), scale of source data, spatial resolution of the data, temporal period of the data, minimum mapping unit (that is, area of the smallest features mapped), and the accuracy of the land cover dataset (table 3-2)."}, {"section_title": "Classification Systems", "text": "Classification systems provide standards for a land cover mapping product in regards to classes and the definitions of classes. A few common classification systems include Anderson Level I and II (Anderson and others, 1976), the classification of wetlands and deepwater habitats (Cowardin and others, 1979), and NatureServe's Terrestrial Ecological Systems (http://www.natureserve.org/library/ usEcologicalsystems.pdf). The objectives and focus of the sealevel rise application should determine the level of detail in a classification system required."}, {"section_title": "Methodology for Commonly Used Land Cover Data", "text": "There are numerous land cover products that are available throughout the conterminous United States. The methodology used to create these land cover datasets can be lumped into two different categories: (1) photointerpretation of aerial photography (for example, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory [NWI] and Florida Land Use, Cover, and Forms Classification System [FLUCCS]) and 2 "}, {"section_title": "Photointerpretation Land Cover Classifications", "text": "Photointerpretation is a manual process that typically involves mapping features in a highly detailed manner by using expert opinion, aerial photography, and ancillary data. Features are delineated by using heads-up digitizing (that is, manual digitizing by tracing over features displayed on a computer monitor) or created by using a more robust vectorization of imagery (that is, segmentation by using image properties such as spectral bands, texture, and hue) and then are assigned a class in a classification system via photointerpretation. Some examples of photointerpretation land cover maps include the NWI, some State land cover mapping efforts, particularly FLUCCS, and localized habitat maps (for example, park maps and maps developed by ecologists of habitat for managed lands). By using the Cowardin and others (1979) classification system, NWI maps not only differentiate a wide spectrum of wetland types but also classify wetland water regime (for example, saturated, seasonally flooded, permanently flooded) and in some cases apply special modifiers to wetlands to indicate special characteristics of the wetland (for example, presence of mangroves, salinity concentration). The date and scale of photography used for NWI maps vary by area. In some cases, the NWI has been updated recently, and in other cases, the NWI may be from the 1980s or earlier. If NWI is incorporated into a sea-level rise application, it is important therefore to assess the date and scale of source imagery for NWI maps available for the study area (http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/mapper.HTML). The spatial resolution of these classifications makes them better suited for more localized sea-level rise applications."}, {"section_title": "Satellite-Imagery-Based Land Cover Classifications", "text": "Many of the other land cover classifications that are widely available are created from automated or manual classification of satellite-based imagery with a moderate spatial resolution of 5-30 m. In most cases, these types of classifications tend to be less detailed than those created with photointerpretation of aerial photography. Satellite-imagery-based classifications include NLCD, NOAA C-CAP land cover, National Gap Analysis Program (GAP), LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Cover, and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation North America Land Cover (table 3- 2). C-CAP land cover was developed for coastal areas of the United States with a goal of increasing the level of detail at which coastal wetlands were mapped in the NLCD.  "}]
