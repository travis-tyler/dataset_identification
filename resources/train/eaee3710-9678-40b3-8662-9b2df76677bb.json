In these cases, tests for statistical significance take both the study design and the number of comparisons into account. NCES publications only discuss differences that are significant at the 95 percent confidence level or higher. Because of variations in study design, differences of roughly the same magnitude can be statistically significant in some cases but not in others. In addition, results from surveys are subject to nonsampling errors. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, and other systematic error.

NOTE  In embarking upon the endeavor known as TIMSS (the Third International Mathematics and Science Study), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) was determined to create a new kind of international comparative education study. In the past, international studies relied either on qualitative methods (such as observing relatively small numbers of teachers in the classroom) or on quantitative methods (such as administering surveys to nationally representative samples of students and teachers). Too often, however, the kinds of questions that one wanted to answer were answerable only by using methods of both types. This situation presented challenges to a statistical agency that is more comfortable with quantitative than with qualitative techniques. Nevertheless, NCES decided to combine these approaches in TIMSS, which was administered in 1995 and 1999 and has another round of data collection scheduled for 2003. In addition to including some components that are primarily quantitative and others that are primarily qualitative, TIMSS includes one major componentthe video studythat integrates both approaches."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Components", "text": "T1MSS 1995 and TIMSS 1999 included the questionnaires and written assessments that are the key traditional components of a quantitatively oriented international education study At the core of both administrations of TIMSS were in-depth surveys of 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-grade students, their principals, and their teachers. In addition, mathematics and science assessments were given to the students at all three grade levels. Results from the surveys and assessments were released in a series of national and international reports that provide national estimates of student performance as well as other information about mathematics and science teaching and learning."}, {"section_title": "Qualitative Components", "text": "TIMSS was cofunded by the National Science Foundation, which has a long-standing interest in curriculum development and its impact on mathematics and science teaching and learning. In TIMSS 1995, as in a few earlier international education studies, development of the student, teacher, and principal surveys was preceded by qualitative curriculum studies that examined opportunities to learn mathematics and science in various countries. The TIMSS 1995 curriculum studies covered more than 50 countries and served as the basis for many of the survey questions. In addition to the curriculum studies, TIMSS 1995 included a set of case studies that looked at four questions: How are national standards implemented in the classroom? What is the life of the secondary student like? How are student ability differences handled? and What kind of training do new teachers get before they teach and as they become more proficient? Schools in one principal city and two other cities in each of three countries Japan, Germany, and the United Stateswere selected as the focus of the case studies. Indepth interviews and observations were the data collection methods used to come to an understanding of mathematics and science education. Information from the case studies was used to enrich and illustrate the data from the TIMSS 1995 surveys and assessments."}, {"section_title": "The Video Study Component", "text": "One of the most exciting and innovative parts of TIMSS involved observing teachers in the classroom, recording the observed lessons on videotape, and coding these lessons for quantitative analysis. The resulting statistics provide measures of the commonness or rarity of the observed dimensions of teaching and learning. Conversely, the qualitative observations that have been captured on videotape allow us to reconnect the statistics to the social milieu in which they occurred. A video study was conducted in both 1995 and 1999. In 1995, teachers and their classrooms were observed in Japan, Germany, and the United States for an hour of instruction in mathematics. A nationally representative sample of 100 classrooms was selected in each country. Because both the results of the mathematics assessment and the results of the video study for Japan in 1995 were so different from the results for Germany and the United States, the decision was made to replicate the video study in other countries with relatively high achievement on the assessment. Thus, in 1999, classrooms in Australia, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States were videotaped. Featured in this issue of the Quarterly are findings about mathematics instruction from the TIMSS 1999 Video Study."}, {"section_title": "Future Components", "text": "As with all NCES international projects, we will continue to innovate and seek ways to address ongoing policy issues. Just as the TIMSS video component evolved as a better way to understand what actually takes place inside classrooms, we anticipate that other components will surface in the future to address emerging and different needs in the field of international statistics.

Release of the TIMSS 1995 Video Study results garnered attention from those interested in teaching and learning. In part, this attention was due to both the novel methodology, in which national samples of teachers were videotaped teaching an eighth-grade mathematics lesson in their regular classrooms, and the differences in teaching among the countries. Three countries participated in the 1995 Video StudyGermany, Japan, and the United Statesand comparisons of the results suggested that each country had a distinct cultural pattern of teaching mathematics. Discussion of results from the 1995 Video Study can be found in  and Stigler and Hiebert (1999). In many ways, the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of eighth-grade mathematics lessons begins where the 1995 study ended. Some findings address lingering questions that could not be answered in the first study or questions that have emerged over time as many audiences have interpreted the results. Other findings address new questions arising from advances in the field and from advances in the research methodology used in the studythe \"video survey.\" The mathematics portion of the TIMSS 1999 Video Study included 638 eighth-grade lessons collected from all seven participating countries. This includes eighth-grade mathematics lessons collected in Japan in 1995 as part of the earlier study2 In each country, the lessons were randomly selected to be representative of eighth-grade mathematics lessons overall. In each case, a teacher was videotaped for one complete lesson, and in each country, videotapes were collected across the school year to try to capture the range of topics and activities that can take place throughout an entire school year.' Finally, to obtain reliable comparisons among the participating nations, the data were appropriately weighted to account for sampling design. Sampling and participation rate information, as well as other technical notes, are detailed in an appendix to the complete report from which this article presents highlights.

It is the process that brings the curriculum into contact with the students and through which national, regional, or state education goals are to be achieved. It is reasonable to assume that teachers and teaching make a difference in students' learning. However, methodically studying the direct effects that teachers and teaching may have on student learning is difficult, though not impossible. The TIMSS 1999 Video Study is based on the premise that the more educators and researchers can learn about teaching as it is actually practiced, the more effectively educators can identify factors that might enhance student learning opportunities and, by extension, student achievement. By providing rich descriptions of what actually takes place in mathematics and science classrooms, the video study can contribute to further research into features of teaching that most influence students' learning. 1 0 BEST COPY AVAIl .ARLP Comparing teaching across cultures has additional advantages. Comparing teaching across cultures allows educators to examine their own teaching practices from a fresh perspective by widening the known possibilities. In addition to examining how teachers across one's own country approach mathematics, opening up the lens to include an examination of how teachers in another country approach the same topic can make one's own teaching practices more visible by contrast and therefore more open for reflection and improvement. Comparing teaching across cultures can reveal alternatives and stimulate discussion about the choices being made within a country. Although a variety of teaching practices can be found in a single country, it sometimes requires looking outside one's own culture to see something new and different. These observations, combined with carefully crafted follow-up research, can stimulate debate about the approaches that may make the most sense for achieving the learning goals defined within a country. Using national video surveys to study teaching has special advantages. Video enables detailed examination of complex activities from different points of view. Video preserves classroom activity so it can be slowed down and viewed multiple times, by many people with different kinds of expertise, making possible detailed descriptions of many classroom lessons. Collecting a random national sample provides information about students' experiences across a range of conditions, rather than exceptional experiences only. The ability to generalize nationally can elevate policy discussions beyond the anecdotal. Therefore, it is important to know what actual teaching looks like, on average, so that national discussions can focus on what most students experience. What Are the Major Findings From the T1MSS 1999 Video Study of Eighth-Grade Mathematics Teaching? Based on the coding and analysis of the eighth-grade mathematics lessons videotaped for this study, the following points can be made: Eighth-grade mathematics teaching in all seven countries shared some general features. The comparative nature of this study tends to draw attention to the ways in which the seven countries differed in the teaching of eighth-grade mathematics. But it is important to remember that both differences and similarities are expected in cross-country and cross-cultural comparisons. When a wide-angle lens is employed across countries, it is clear that all seven countries shared common ways of teaching eighth-grade mathematics. Viewed from this perspective, some similarities are striking. In all of the countries, eighth-grade mathematics was often taught through solving problems; at least 80 percent of lesson time, on average, was devoted to solving mathematics problems. Eighth-grade mathematics lessons in all seven countries were organized to include some public (whole-class) work and some private (individual or small-group) work. During the time that students worked privately, the most common pattern across the countries was for students to work individually, rather than in pairs or groups. On average, lessons in all of the countries included some review of previous content as well as some attention to new content. At least 90 percent of lessons in all the countries made use of a textbook or worksheet of some kind. Teachers in all of the countries talked more than students, at a ratio of at least 8:1 words. While there were some shared general features, there was discernible variation across the countries in teaching eighthgrade mathematics. Distinctions included the introduction of new content, the coherence across mathematical problems and within their presentation, the topics covered and the procedural complexity of the mathematical problems, and classroom practices regarding individual student work and homework in class. A sample of these findings is summarized below. Eighth-grade mathematics lessons in the Czech Republic placed a greater emphasis on reviewing previously learned content than those in all of the other countries except the United States; lessons in Japan placed a greater emphasis on introducing new content than those in all six of the other countries; and lessons in Hong Kong SAR placed a greater"}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY -VOLUME 5, ISSUE 1, 2003 emphasis on practicing new content than those in the Czech Republic, Japan, and Switzerland (figure 1). Although, on average, eighth-grade mathematics lessons in all of the countries included some time reviewing previous content and some time introducing and practicing new content, there were differences in emphases in each country. Combining the time spent on both introducing and practicing new material provides another way of detecting differences: Australia, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland devoted more time, on average, to studying new content (ranging from 56 to 76 percent of lesson time) than reviewing previous content; the Czech Republic spent more time, on average, reviewing previous content (58 percent of lesson time) than studying new content; and in the United States there was no detectable difference between the average percentage of lesson time devoted to reviewing previous content and studying new content (53 and 48 per-cent of lesson time, respectively). Moreover, while a single mathematics lesson could combine time spent reviewing and introducing and practicing new content, there were a number of lessons that were entirely devoted to just one of those purposes. In the Czech Republic and the United States, a greater percentage of eighth-grade mathematics lessons were spent entirely in review of content previously presented than in Hong Kong SAR and Japan (28 and 28 percent of lessons compared to 8 and 5 percent, respectively). Eighth-grade mathematics lessons across the seven countries focused on a range of topics, from whole numbers and fractions to solving linear equations and trigonometry Among the almost 15,000 mathematics problems identified and examined as part of this study, at least 82 percent of problems per lesson, on average, focused on three topic "}, {"section_title": "Country2", "text": "Practicing new content3 Introducing new content4"}, {"section_title": "Reviewing5", "text": "'Japanese mathematics data were collected in 1995. "}, {"section_title": "BESTCOPYAVAILARLE", "text": "areas: number, geometry, and algebra. In one country, Hong Kong SAR, 14 percent of problems per lesson, on average, focused on trigonometry. In some lessons, all problems encountered by students focused on one topic or one subtopic (e.g., linear equations), whereas in other lessons, problems were identified as being from more than one subtopic or even from more than one topic (e.g., number and geometry). No single lesson is likely to include a range of problems related to all topics and subtopics typically covered in grade 8 mathematics. The level of procedural complexity of problems in Japanese eighth-grade mathematics lessons was different from that in the other countries (figure 2). The overall complexity of the mathematics presented in the lessons is an important feature of the mathematics but is difficult to define and code reliably. This is due, in part, to the fact that the complexity of a problem needs to take into account the experience and capability of the student encountering the problem. What is complex to one student may be less complex to his or her classmate. One type of complexity that can be defined and examined independent of a student is procedural complexity: the number of steps it takes to solve a problem using a common solution method. Three levels of complexity were defined: low, moderate, and high. Low complexity was defined as a problem that required four or fewer decisions by a student to solve it, using conventional procedures. Moderate complexity was defined as a problem that, using conventional procedures, required more than four decisions by a student to solve it and could contain one subproblem. High complexity was defined as a problem that required more than four decisions by a student, and at least two subproblems, to solve it, using conventional procedures. Across the three levels of complexity, each of the countries, with the  exception of Japan, included, on average, at least 63 percent of problems per lesson of low procedural complexity. At the other end of the scale, up to 12 percent of problems per lesson, on average, were of high procedural complexity, again with the exception of Japan. In Japan, 39 percent of problems per lesson were of high procedural complexity, a greater percentage than in any of the other six countries. The relationship between one mathematics problem and the next in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson was different in Japan than in the other countries. The relationship between the various mathematics problems presented in a lesson is of interest because the clarity and coherence of a lesson may be influenced, in part, by the way in which problems are related to each other. Four kinds of relationships between problems were identified: repetition, mathematically related, thematically related, and unrelated. Each problem presented in a lesson after the first problem was examined for the relationship to the prior problem. A problem was identified as a repetition if it was the same or mostly the same, requiring essentially similar operations to solve as the preceding problem in the lesson. A problem was identified as mathematically related if the problem used the solution to a previous problem for solving this problem, extended a previous problem by requiring additional operations, highlighted some operation of a previous problem by considering a simpler example, or elaborated a previous problem by solving a similar problem in a different way Analysis of the data revealed that, on average, Japanese eighth-grade mathematics lessons contained a higher percentage of problems per lesson that were mathematically related (42 percent) than lessons in any of the other countries. Moreover, Japanese lessons contained a lower percentage of problems per lesson that were repetitions (40 percent) than those in any of the other countries. In all of the countries except Japan, at least 65 percent of the problems per lesson, on average, were identified as repetitions of the preceding problem. Teachers in Hong Kong SAR and Japan presented different types of mathematics problems to their eighth-grade classes than did teachers in the other countries (figure 3). When mathematics problems were classified into three types of mathematical processes implied by the problem statementsusing procedures, stating concepts, or making connections among mathematical facts, procedures, and conceptslessons in Hong Kong SAR contained, on average, a larger percentage of problems per lesson targfted toward using procedures (84 percent) than the other countries in figure 3, except the Czech Republic.4 In the other countries, the range was from 41 to 77 percent of problems per lesson, on average. Mathematics teachers in Japan presented a larger percentage of problems per lesson that emphasized making connections (54 percent) than the other countries in figure 3, except the Netherlands. In the other countries, the range was from 13 to 24 percent of problems per lesson, on average. Using the same information in another way, an examination in each country of the relative emphases of the types of problems per lesson implied by the problem statements shows that in five of the six countries where data were available, a greater percentage of problems per lesson were presented as using procedures than either making connections or stating concepts. The exception to this pattern was Japan, where there was no detectable difference in the percentage of problems per lesson that were presented as using procedures compared to those presented as making connections. In Australian and U.S. eighth-grade mathematics lessons, a smaller percentage of making-connections problems were solved in a way that actually made the connections among mathematical facts, procedures, and concepts evident during classroom discussions than in the other countries. For this analysis, problems were examined and coded twice: the first time according to the way they were stated at the outset, and the second time according to the way they were actually discussed in the eighth-grade mathematics classroom. This double-coding was necessary because problems can be initially stated in one form, and then transformed into a different form as they are discussed in the classroom. Among the six countries where data were available, when problems initially stated as making connections were classified a second time based on the subsequent classroom discussion, mathematical connections or relationships were emphasized least often in the Australian and U.S. eighthgrade mathematics lessons. In these two countries, respectively, on average 8 percent and less than 1 percent5 of problems per lesson that were initially stated as making connections led to classroom discussion of the problem that actually made the connections. The percentages in the other countries ranged from 37 to 52. Examination of problems 4Switzerland was not included in the analyses of mathematical processes associated with mathematics problems. 5Rounds to zero. that at the outset seemed designed to focus on using procedures revealed that mathematics problems were more likely to be followed through by actually using procedures in U.S. lessons than in either Czech or Japanese lessons. Eighth-grade mathematics lessons in Japan and the Czech Republic employed different methods to summarize the point of a lesson or a mathematical problem than those in almost all of the other countries. Teachers may employ various techniques to help students recognize the key ideas in either a lesson or a particular mathematical problem or set of problems. One way that teachers can help students identify the key mathematical point of a lesson is to describe the goal of the lesson. To be included in the analysis, a goal statement about a specific mathematical topic to be covered during the lesson had to be explicitly written or said by the teacher. Across all seven countries, a higher percentage of eighth-grade mathematics lessons in the Czech Republic contained goal statements (91 percent) than in all the other countries except Japan. Dutch lessons included the fewest goal statements of any of the countries (21 percent). A second way to help students recognize key ideas in a lesson is a summary statement at the end of a lesson. For all the countries, summary statements were less common than goal statements. Lesson summaries were identified in at least 21 percent of eighth-grade mathematics lessons in Japan, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong SAR, and in 10 percent of lessons in Australia. In the other countries where reliable estimates could be calculated, between 2 and 6 percent of lessons included summary statements. After an individual mathematics problem has been solved, teachers might also summarize 'Japanese mathematics data were collected in 1995. 2AU=Australia;CZ=Czech Republic; HK=Hong Kong SAR;JP=Japan;NL=Netherlands; and US=United States. 3Making connections:JP>AU, CZ, FIK, US. 4Stating concepts:AU>CZ,HK,JP; NL,US>HK,JP. 5Using procedures: CZ>JP, NL; HK>AU,JP, NL, US; US>JP.

Percentages may not sum to 100 because of rounding.The tests for significance take into account the standard error for the reported differences.Thus, a difference between averages of two countries may be significant while the same difference between two other countries may not be significant. the points that the problem illustrates. On average, mathematics teachers in Japan summarized a higher percentage of problems per lesson (27 percent) than in any of the other countries. Mathematics problems in eighth-grade lessons in the Netherlands emphasized the relationships between mathematics and real-life situations to a greater extent than those in most of the other countries (figure 4). Students in the Netherlands were more likely than their peers in four of the other six countries to encounter problems that included a real-life connection (i.e., word problems or other presentations that place problems in the context of a real-life situation; 42 percent of problems, on average, per lesson). The mathematics problems teachers presented to their students in all of the other countries were more likely to use only mathematical language and symbols than the problems presented in Dutch mathematics lessons (69 to 89 percent of problems, on average, per lesson  compared to 40 percent). Australian, Dutch, and Swiss eighth-grade mathematics lessons devoted more time, on average, to students working individually or in small groups than did lessons in the other four countries. Eighth-graders in Australia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland spent a greater percentage of lesson time, on average, working individually or in small groups (rather than engaging in whole-class interaction) and working on mathematics problems assigned as a set than eighth-graders in the other four countries. Moreover, when eighth-graders in Australia and Switzerland were assigned mathematics problems to work on as a set, the problems were less likely to be presented and discussed publicly (i.e., with the whole class) than in two of the four other countries; and these sets of mathematics problems were less likely to be presented and discussed publicly in the Netherlands than in any of the other countries.  4Set-up used mathematical language or symbols only:AU, CZ, HK,JP, SW, US>NL;JP>AU, SW, US.

(Originally published as figure 5.1 on p. 85 of the complete report from which this highlights summary is drawn, Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries:Results From the T1MSS 1999 Video Study [NCES 2003-013]). The emphasis on eighth-grade students working privately on mathematics problems was seen with particular consistency in the Netherlands. In addition to the private-work indicators cited above, students in the Netherlands were assigned a larger number of homework problems per lesson (10 problems), on average, than students in all the other countries except Australia. The range in the other countries was from less than 16 to 5 mathematics problems per lesson, on average. Based on estimates, Dutch students appear to have spent, on average, a greater amount of time during the lesson working on these problems (10 minutes) than did students in all the other countries (ranging from 1 to 4 minutes). Among the many resources that could be used in mathematics lessons, calculators were used in more lessons in the Netherlands than in the other countries, and computers were used in relatively few eighth-grade mathematics lessons across all the countries. Eighth-grade Dutch students frequently used calculators for computation during their mathematics lessons. Calculators were used in 91 percent of lessonsa rate higher than in any of the other countries for which reliable estimates could be determined. Use of computational calculators in the other countries ranged from 31 to 56 percent of lessons, with too few cases in Japan to report a reliable estimate. Graphing calculators were rarely observed in the eighthgrade mathematics lessons, except in the United States, where they were used in 6 percent of lessons. Computers were actually used, rather than simply present, in relatively few of the eighth-grade mathematics lessons across the countries. Nonetheless, they were incorporated into 9 percent of Japanese lessons, 5 percent of Hong Kong SAR lessons, 4 percent of Australian lessons, and 2 percent of Swiss lessons. In the other countries, computers were used too infrequently to produce reliable estimates. A broad conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that no single method of teaching eighth-grade mathematics was observed in all the relatively higher achieving countries participating in this study. All the countries that participated in the TIMSS 1999 Video Study shared some general features of eighth-grade mathematics teaching. However, each country combined and emphasized instructional features in various ways, sometimes differently from all the other countries, and some-'Rounds to zero."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "times no differently from some countries.

The report Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries: Results From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study is a significant attempt to describe and analyze the teaching of mathematics in the seven participating countries: Australia, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong SAR,' Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States. The authors are to be commended for carrying through such a massive undertaking and providing a detailed analysis on the teaching of mathematics based on data from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1999 Video Study. For this study, numerous eighth-grade mathematics lessons in the participating countries were videotaped and then coded on dozens of dimensions. If nothing else, the report displays the complexity of teaching and the risk one takes in separating the teaching of mathematics from the culture in which that teaching takes place. No easy answers are provided for those seeking explicit direction on how to improve the teaching of mathematics or how to develop better teacher education programs. Nevertheless, there is much to be learned if one is willing to comb through the extensive data and consider the possible relevance of these data. The report has credibility given that the participating teachers felt that their videotaped lessons were typical of the way they teach mathematics."}, {"section_title": "The Complexity of Mathematics Teaching", "text": "The complexity of teaching is particularly evident when one compares the teaching styles in the seven countries that participated in the 1999 video study with the same countries' achievement levels on the TIMSS 1995 and 1999 mathematics assessments.

No other country's teachers spent less time on review or more time on new content than teachers in Japan and Hong Kong. In contrast, teachers in the United States spent more time on review and less time on new content than teachers in any other country except the Czech Republic. It is striking that 60 percent of Japanese lesson time was devoted to introducing new content a higher percentage than in any other country. The second highest percentage was 39 percent (in Hong Kong and Switzerland), compared with 23 percent in the United States. One is reminded of the research by Good, Grouws, and Ebmeier (1983) in which they advocated that teachers spend approximately 45 percent of class time developing new material. Although Hong Kong teachers were relatively high on introducing new content, they also talked more than their Japanese counterparts. Thus, one might get the impression that, although lessons in both countries concentrated on new material, Japanese lessons focused on student thinking, while Hong Kong lessons were very lecture oriented. Yet both Japan and Hong Kong were highachieving countries. With regard to the procedural complexity of mathematics problems, Japanese lessons had the highest percentage of high-complexity problems and the lowest percentage of low-complexity problems, although these findings may have been biased because the Japanese teachers were primarily teaching two-dimensional geometry. Even when only two-dimensional geometry problems were considered across all countries, however, no other country had a higher percentage of high-complexity problems or a lower percentage of low-complexity problems than Japan. Considering problems from all topic areas, Japan had not only the lowest percentage of low-complexity problems, but also the lowest percentage of repetition problems for students to solve. One gets the distinct impression that Japanese lessons were forward looking rather than repetitive and review oriented. The United States had a high percentage of teachers (63 percent) who felt that their assessment of students' interests or needs played a major role in their decisions on how to teach the content. This result is encouraging although in sharp contrast to Senk, Beckmann, and Thompson's (1997) finding that there is little support for the notion that teachers base their instruction on students' cognitions, a finding also consistent with that of Wilson, Cooney, and Stinson (2003). One possible interpretation is that teachers in the United States are sensitive to students' needs as youngsters but are not particularly attuned to students' developing mathematical thinking. Nevertheless, teachers in the United States felt well informed about current issues regarding the teaching of mathematics. Thus, 76 percent of U.S. lessons were taught by teachers who indicated that they were familiar with current ideas in mathematics teaching and learning, compared with only 22 percent of Hong Kong lessons. Consistent with this finding was that 86 percent of U.S. teachers felt that their video lessons were in accord with current ideas about teaching and learning mathematics. (No data were reported for Japan.) The influence of Hans Freudenthal and his followers (see, e.g., Freudenthal 1991) was evident in the Netherlands, where mathematics problems were more likely to include connections to real-life situations than in most of the other countries. For example, the percentage of Dutch problems per lesson with real-life connections was nearly double the percentage of U.S. problems. The teaching of mathematics in the Netherlands was also characterized by the fact that more lesson time was devoted to students' private work on problems than to whole-class interaction, the only country for which this was true. This finding represented one of the few real differences in teaching styles across countries."}, {"section_title": "Conservatism and the Role of Reform in Mathematics Teaching", "text": "A certain conservatism pervaded most of the lessons across all countries, with the possible exception of Japan and, to some extent, the Netherlands. For example, the ratio of teacher talk to student talk was high in every country. Some variation was evident across countries, however. For example, the ratio was higher in Hong Kong than in the United States, largely because U.S. students contributed more to classroom discussions. A relevant question is whether the ratio of teacher talk to student talk was related to class size (in larger classes, one would expect teacher talk to dominate). It was disappointing that technology (computers and calculators) did not play a more prominent role in the teaching of mathematics. Dutch teachers made extensive use of computational calculators, whereas in other coun-tries they were less frequently used. Across countries, graphing calculators were rarely used, and computer use was also sparse or virtually nonexistent. Another conservative characteristic was that alternative solutions to problems were seldom presented publicly. Alternative solutions to problems were presented for a maximum of 5 percent of problems per lesson in all countries except Japan (17 percent). It seems clear that multiple solution methods per se were not viewed as an instructional goal. This apparent conservatism raises serious questions about the role of reform in the teaching of mathematics. The experience level of teachers in the TIMSS 1999 Video Study was considerable; they had a median of 7 to 21 years' experience teaching mathematics. Also, the teachers were reportedly well trained. It seems reasonable to assume that within each country these teachers were a cut above their counterparts. Yet, in their own way, the teachers were remarkably consistent in conducting what appeared to be primarily teacher-centered lessons. The authors noted this commonality on several occasions. So why is it that the teaching looked so similar, allowing for a few exceptions? If these intelligent teachers were defining the teaching of mathematics in mostly similar ways, what factors led to this circumstance? If society is mandating that mathematics be taught in this rather conservative style, why is this the case? I am not sure what the answers to these questions are, but I am fairly confident that the answers are not implied by intrinsic features of mathematics education per se. This gives me great pause when thinking about efforts to reform the teaching of mathematics."}, {"section_title": "The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)", "text": "Standards promote a vision about the teaching of mathematics that entails teachers using technology, emphasizing the processes of doing mathematics, and basing their instructional decisions on students' thinking. Generally, reform in the United States is defined or at least guided by these standards. Not surprisingly, then, most studies of attempted reform have focused on issues within the academic component of mathematics education, such as placing more emphasis on problem solving and students' conceptual understanding, making greater use of technology, and adopting a broader, more open system of assessment. These studies have generally reported mixed results; some teachers embraced certain elements of reform, while others did not. Usually mathematics educators focus on the more academic aspects of reform at the risk of neglecting the very circumstances that determine the way in which mathematics gets defined and taught. Teachers' shared culture of mind is shaped by these circumstances, yet this culture is rarely addressed explicitly in most teacher education programs. The literature abounds with findings about teachers who subscribe to reform but in the crucible of the classroom often embrace more conservative teaching styles (see, e.g., Wilson and Goldenberg [1998], Lloyd [1999], and Skott [2001). This raises the question of what should constitute reasonable expectations for classroom reform, especially over an extended period of time; most reported studies take place within a calendar year."}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Future Research", "text": "The TIMSS 1999 Video Study provides a major opportunity for researchers to consider country differences and similarities and to juxtapose their own research with this study's findings. It would be interesting to know, for example, the extent to which beginning teachers (those with 1 or 2 years of experience) differ from their more experienced counterparts. Although the median level of teacher experience was quite high across countries, the within-country variance was considerable. For example, the experience of U.S. teachers ranged from 1 to 40 years. The smallest range (from 1 to 33 years) occurred in the Netherlands. What would the analysis have looked like had only beginning teachers been considered? At various times when I read the report, I wanted to know what mathematics the authors were really talking about. When low-complexity problems were pitted against highcomplexity problems, what were examples of each type of problem? Further, I had trouble with the notion of what were called application problems. These problems were apparently defined in terms of the number of steps needed to solve the problems, regardless of whether the problems' contexts involved real-life situations (the usual definition of application). In countries other than the Netherlands, only 9 to 27 percent of problems per lesson involved real-life connections. Much research in the United States, particularly that conducted prior to the 1990s, has focused on-efficient ways of teaching mathematics. For example, McKinney (1986) and Leinhardt (1988) revealed that expert teachers could cover more problems in a given class period than could 44. novice teachers, and they could do so with greater flexibility. However, the lesson pattern, or \"signature,\" for Japanese teachers suggests that the number of problems covered in a given lesson is not as important as the depth with which the content is addressed. Whereas U.S. teachers spent an average of 5 minutes per independent problem per lesson, Japanese teachers spent an average of 15 minutes. Although research in the United States over the past decade has become decidedly more interpretive, researchers would be wise to focus more explicitly on the interplay between what gets taught, how it gets taught, and the depth with which mathematics is taught. In the United States, the length of mathematics lessons varied a great deal, showing a considerably greater range than in the Czech Republic, Japan, and Switzerland. This finding, juxtaposed with the fact that only 22 percent of problems per U.S. lesson focused on geometry, suggests that some U.S. students may not be getting much geometry, including both two-and three-dimensional geometry. The role of school geometry in the United States, particularly at the middle school level, deserves careful consideration in developing teacher education programs for both preservice and inservice teachers."}, {"section_title": "A Concluding Thought", "text": "It was both exhilarating and exasperating to read Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries: Results From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study. Given the multitude of classrooms observed, there seemed to be a boundless number of strategic research sites. Overall, teachers in the United States appeared more conservative in their teaching styles than did their counterparts in other countries, although not markedly so. One wonders why. We can only conclude that there is much work to be done if the teaching of mathematics in the United States is to bear some family resemblance to the NCTM Standards. The question is, \"Where in the world do we begin?\" Leinhardt, G. (1988) National and international assessments of student achievement provide ample evidence that American students learn far less mathematics than is desired. For example, in the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics assessment, only about one-fourth of American 4th-and 8th-grade students performed at or above the Proficient level, and the percentage was even lower for students in grade 12 (Braswell et al. 2001). Moreover, findings from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1995 and 1999 mathematics assessments indicate that U.S. students at grade 8 performed below the level attained by students in many other developed nations of the world (Beaton et al. 1996;Mullis et al. 2000;Schmidt et al. 1999). In response to findings such as these, a number of initiatives have been proposed to raise the mathematics achievement of U.S. students. There is widespread agreement that higher student achievement is unlikely to occur unless and until higher quality teaching becomes more prevalent in U.S. classrooms (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future 1996; U.S. Department of Education 2000). Thus, it is common for educators and policymakers to design initiatives aimed at leveraging higher student achievement by enhancing the quality of mathematics teachers and teaching. And the clamor for improving teacher quality is not restricted to professionals within the field of education. A recent survey of American adults regarding education issues found that teaching quality was one of the major concerns of the American public (Educational Testing Service 2002). Despite the strong desire to improve the quality of mathematics teaching in the United States, designers of educational improvement initiatives lack a complete picture of instructional practices at this time. What is known about instructional practices in American mathematics classrooms comes almost entirely from two types of sources: observational data collected in studies of relatively small numbers of teachers and classrooms, and teacher self-report data collected in large-scale surveys of mathematics teachers. Large-scale surveys, such as those conducted by NAEP (Braswell et al. 2001) and by Horizon Research (Weiss et al. 2001), have been a primary source of information for educators in constructing portraits of mathematics teachers and their instructional practices (e.g., Grouws and Smith 2000). These sources of information are valuable, but they are limited due either to their small samples or to the indirect nature of the evidence provided. Similarly, some other valuable sources of data drawn from large-scale, direct observation in classrooms (e.g., Stake and Easley 1978) are now quite dated. Efforts to improve mathematics instruction (and, ultimately, students' mathematics achievement) are likely to be hampered by this limited corpus of credible data regarding the current nature and quality of teaching. A notable exception to the general lack of first-hand data on mathematics teaching practices in U.S. classrooms is provided by the T1MSS 1995 Video Study Stigler and Hiebert 1999), in which a relatively large sample of mathematics lessons from Germany, Japan, and the United States were analyzed. This study pointed to distinct styles of mathematics teaching in the three countries considered and identified some differences between mathematics teaching in the United States and in Japan that might be related to the large student performance differential between the two countries. In addition, the corpus of data on current mathematics teaching in the United States and in many other parts of the world has just been enriched by the release of findings on mathematics teaching from the TIMSS 1999 Video Study, which is a successor to and expansion of the TIMSS 1995 Video Study. The 1999 study expanded the number of countries under consideration from three to seven and included more countries with high achievement on TIMSS assessments in comparison to the United States. in this issue of the Education Statistics Quarterly. The study involved an analysis of 638 eighth-grade mathematics lessons. One randomly selected mathematics lesson was videotaped in each school in a nationally representative sample of schools in Australia, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong SAR,* the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States. In addition, the lessons collected in Japan for the T1MSS 1995 Video Study were reanalyzed as part of the 1999 study. Students from these countries were among the highest performers on the TIMSS assessments of mathematics achievement in 1995 and 1999. In 1995, eighth-graders in all of these countries scored significantly higher than did U.S. eighth-graders. In 1999, U.S. eighth-graders were again outperformed by eighth-graders in all of the countries except Switzerland (which did not participate in the 1999 assessment) and the Czech Republic (which experienced a decline in scores between 1995 and 1999). The multidimensional analyses of the videotaped lessons revealed not only some similarities in mathematics teaching across the countries but also a number of discernable differences. For example, eighth-grade mathematics lessons were generally organized similarly in all countries to include some public work involving the whole class and some private work, with students usually working individually and occasionally working in small groups. But mathematics lessons varied across the countries in the way that time was distributed to the review of previously learned material, to the introduction of new content, and to practice on new content. Other differences across countries were noted in the way that instructional time was allocated to various kinds of mathematical activitiesusing procedures, stating concepts, and making connections among facts, concepts, or proceduresand the patterns of transformation that were evident between the original presentation of the task by the teacher and the eventual enactment by the students in the classroom. The information available in Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries will undoubtedly be useful both to researchers who study mathematics teaching and to the designers of educational interventions intended to transform and enhance current teaching practices, especially when considered in light of findings available from other research studies. For example, the findings of the TIMSS 1999 Video Study supplement and reinforce findings of other analyses of classroom instruction (e.g., Stein, Grover, and Henningsen 1996;Henningsen and Stein 1997)  pointed to the tendency in U.S. classrooms for teachers to transform intellectually demanding tasks in ways that reduce the cognitive challenge for students. Given that patterns and factors associated with this transformation of cognitive demands have been related to student achievement (Stein and Lane 1996) and to teacher professional development (Stein et al. 2000), the findings of the TIMSS 1999 Video Study with respect to this and other aspects of classroom instruction should be of great interest. From an international comparative perspective, a major finding of the study is that no single method of mathematics instruction was observed in all of the high-performing countries examined. With respect to most features of instructionincluding some that have been hotly debated in the United States, such as using calculators or embedding mathematics problems in applied contextsthere was considerable variation in the teaching observed across the sample of countries with high-performing students on the T1MSS mathematics assessments. The findings of the TIMSS 1999 Video Study might help to quell the so-called math wars, in which proponents of one view of mathematics instructional reform do battle with opponents of that view. A careful examination of the findings of the TIMSS video study report, and a viewing of the video clips available on the accompanying CD-ROM, should instead stimulate a substantive, civil, professional discourse about the nature and qualities of effective mathematics teaching. These findings and images can be a resource to direct attention away from superficial features of instruction and toward a focus on the extent to which different teaching methods can succeed in stimulating serious intellectual engagement on the part of students in a mathematics classroom. Researchers, in particular, will find much to gain from the report's descriptions of the video survey methodology and the video analysis scheme (which are described more completely in a forthcoming technical report [Jacobs et al. forthcomingp. The report offers a cogent argument for the use of video surveys as a method of analyzing teaching within a country and comparing teaching across countries."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Caveats", "text": "The foregoing should make it clear that Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries is an indispensable resource for educators, researchers, and policymakers. Yet even the large, exceedingly complex study on which the report is based has some limitations worth noting because they suggest important types of additional information that the study does not provide. One limitation worth noting is that the study focuses on \"typical\" instructional practice rather than \"best practice.\" Knowing what teachers are willing and able to display when their typical practice is captured does not reveal what they might be able to do under optimal conditions. A second limitation is the analytic focus on commonality rather than variation. One major outcome of the video analysis was the development of a lesson signaturea characteristic pattern of instructional features that characterized teaching in a country To arrive at a lesson signature, the study authors examined typical instructional activities over time across the lessons observed in each country to discern patterns of regularity. As valuable as this analysis may be, it does not attend to patterns of variation across teachers that might be equally interesting and potentially more important. A third limitation that bears noting is the unit of analysis in the study. The decision to analyze individual lessons rather than coherent sequences of lessons allowed the inclusion of a large number of teachers in the sample, yet it also limited the generalizability of the study's conclusions. Although some variation in student achievement is likely due to factors at the lesson level, it is likely that many other important factors are evident only if one considers larger units of analysis, such as sequences of related lessons or coherent instructional units."}, {"section_title": "Closing Comments", "text": "Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries: Results From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study is an essential resource for those interested in analyzing, understanding, or improving the teaching of mathematics. By illuminating critical features of mathematics teaching around the world, the findings and methods presented in this report, along with the images of teaching provided on the accompanying CD-ROM, should enrich the work of scholars and practitioners alike.  Over the past decade, technology has changed at such a rapid pace that computers and Internet access are fast becoming indispensable features of modern life. Computer literacy and skills are increasingly necessary in a knowledge-based economy. More children are being introduced to computers than ever before, evidenced by the fact that in 2000 65 percent of children had access to a home computer, compared with 32 percent in 1993 (Newburger 1999(Newburger ,2001). Students' use of computers at school also increased from 61 percent in 1993 to 71 percent in 1997 (Newburger 1999). 107-110), the Enhancing Education Through Technology (ED Tech) program seeks to improve achievement in elementary and secondary schools through the use of technology, to assist students to become technically literate by the eighth grade, and to ensure that teachers integrate technology into the curriculum to improve student achievement. There are also provisions in the act to provide funding for schools to purchase technology resources to further the program's goals. As computers become more prevalent and computer skills more necessary, there continues to be a \"digital divide\" between those with computer access and skills and those without.  (Newburger 2001). These differences are less pronounced in schools, where children's access to computers and the Internet is more prevalent. In a 1999 U.S. Department of Education study, almost all public school teachers (99 percent) indicated that computers were available in their schools, and the nationwide ratio of students to instructional computers was about 6 to 1 (Smerdon et al. 2000). The Department also reported that 95 percent of all public schools had access to the Internet in 1999, compared with only 35 percent in 1994 (Snyder and Hoffman 2002). Few studies have focused exclusively on kindergartners' and first-graders' access to and use of computers in different settings. Reports that exist on students' computer access and use either focus on upper elementary and high school students (Becker 2000), or combine prekindergarten and kindergarten children into one category and elementary school children (grades 1-8) into a second category (Snyder and Hoffman 2002) when reporting information. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) provides a unique opportunity to describe children's access to and use of computers in their schools, classrooms, and homes as they begin formal schooling. The computer resources identified in this report include access in schools to computer labs, CD-ROMs, local area networks (LAN), and wide area networks (WAN)/ Internet; access in classrooms to computer areas and teachers trained in using computers and technology; and access in homes to computers and the Internet. The report also looks at the ways in which young children use computers at home and school. For example, information is provided on children's frequency and types of home computer use, and on the frequency with which children use computers in their classrooms for different instructional purposes. In addition, the report examines changes in computer resources and use from kindergarten to first grade and looks at the relationship between computer resources and computer use. Children's access to and use of computers in their schools, classrooms, and homes are examined overall and in relation to children's sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES),' and disability status. In addition, children's use of computers for various instructional purposes is compared by several characteristics of their teachers and classrooms."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "Data from the ECLS-K are used to examine 10 questions related to young children's access to and use of computers.

The ECLS-K includes measures of children's health and socioemotional status, their academic achievement, and their family, classroom, school, and community environments. The study collects information directly from the children and their families, teachers, and schools.

The first set of results on computer resources showed significant differences in kindergartners' computer access by school control (public vs. private). Thus, the majority of the report presents results for public school children so that any variations found in computer access and use related to child and classroom characteristics would not be confounded by school control. The majority of this report is based on 14,666 public school kindergartners and 11,456 public school first-grade children. 2"}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Findings in this report are organized into the two sections identified by the research questions. Part one describes parents', teachers', and school administrators' reports of young children's access to computer resources in their schools, classrooms, and homes. Results are presented for the population of kindergarten and first-grade children and in relation to child and family characteristics. Part two describes ways in which young children were reported to use computers in their classrooms and homes. Results in this section are presented for the population of kindergarten and first-grade children and in relation to child, family, teacher, and classroom characteristics.\nThe ECLS-K data show that 61 percent of schools administer entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten (figure 1). Schools are more likely to use information from such tests to evaluate the needs of children and to help guide instruction than to make decisions about whether children should be allowed to enter school or not. These findings are described below in greater detail. Use of entrance or placement testing prior to kindergarten A higher percentage of public schools (69 percent) than private schools (47 percent) administer entrance or placement tests to children prior to kindergarten (figure 2). Combined (71 percent), elementary (65 percent), and primary (68 percent) schools are more likely than schools that end with kindergarten (21 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten (table 1). Schools with larger student enrollments (more than 300 students) are more likely to administer entrance or placement tests (69 to 72 percent) than schools with enrollments of less than 150 students (44 percent). Among public schools, no differences were detected in the use of entrance or placement testing by school poverty.  Testing to determine eligibility when a child is below the cut-off age Schools use tests prior to kindergarten to inform admission decisions (Rafoth 1997). For example, if a child is ageineligible for kindergarten (i.e., younger than the district's kindergarten cut-off age) but the parent wishes the child to attend, a test may be administered to inform the decision regarding whether to admit the child. Thirteen percent of all schools with kindergarten programs use entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten to inform entry decisions when a child is below the cut-off age (figure 1). No significant differences were detected in the use of tests for this purpose by school type or level of instruction (table 1). Also, no clear pattern of difference was detected by school size. Among public schools, no differences were detected by school poverty in schools' use of testing to determine eligibility when a child is below the cut-off age. Testing to-cletermirii-children's class placement Testing to determine children's class placement can have two meanings. It can mean that children are assessed prior to entering kindergarten and assigned to homogeneous ability groups in a classroom. Or, it can mean that children are identified early as having special needs and assigned to classrooms that are equipped to serve these children's needs. The latter interpretation may fall more accurately under the use of testing to identify children who need further evaluation or individualized instruction and is discussed later in this report. School administrators across the country reported that 19 percent of schools administer placement tests to determine children's class placements (figure 1). While no differences were detected in this use of tests by school type or school size, differences were detected by the school's level of instruction (table 1). Combined (23 percent) and elementary (19 percent) schools are more likely to administer entrance or placement tests prior to kindergarten to determine children's class placement compared to schools ending with kindergarten (6 percent). This finding is not entirely unexpected, for schools ending with kindergarten (i.e., preschools terminating with kindergarten) tend to be smaller and may not contain as many kindergarten classrooms; therefore, testing for this purpose may be a nonissue. Public schools with a high percentage of lowincome children are more likely than public schools with fewer low-income children to use tests to determine children's class placements. Testing to identify children who may need additional testing and evaluation Schools may use placement test information to identify children who need additional evaluation for possible receipt of special services. In fact, the initial purpose of using entrance and placement tests was to identify children with special needs. Developmental assessments are used to help ensure that children with disabilities receive appropriate services (Shepard 1994). Overall, 47 percent of schools use tests to identify children who may need additional evaluation (figure 1). Public schools (55 percent) are more likely than private schools (33 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests for this purpose (figure 2). Primary (57 percent), elementary (51 percent), and combined (50 percent) schools are more likely than schools that end with kindergarten (22 percent) to administer entrance or placement tests for this purpose (table 1). Also, a higher percentage of schools with between 300 and 499 students (57 percent) use these types of tests to identify children who may need additional evaluation, compared to schools with less than 150 students (35 percent). Among public schools, low-income schools are more likely than non-low-income schools to use tests to identify children who may need additional evaluation."}, {"section_title": "Young children's access to computers", "text": "Almost all young children had access to computers, either at home or in their classrooms and schools.

Classroom Internet use for young children was not prevalent; 4 percent of public school kindergartners and 9 percent of public school first-graders accessed the Internet on a weekly basis in their classes. Young children's use of computers in the classroom for different instructional purposes tended to vary by teacher and classroom characteristics. For instance, kindergartners participating in fullday kindergarten programs and those with computer areas in their classrooms were more likely to be in classes that used the computer on a weekly basis for reading, writing, and spelling; mathematics; social studies; keyboarding instruction; art creation or music composition; and fun than children in part-day kindergarten programs and those without computer areas in their classrooms. Also, kindergartners whose teachers participated in computer/technology workshops and those whose teachers did not spend more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, whole-class activities were more likely to be in classes that used the computer on a weekly basis for these purposes than kindergartners whose teachers had not attended computer/technology workshops during the school year or those whose teachers spent more than half of the instructional day in teacher-directed, whole-class activities.

Young children's access to most computer resources in public schools did not differ greatly by child and family characteristics; however, in kindergarten some minority children, those from lower SES families, and those without home computer resources were less likely to attend schools that provide student access to the Internet. In terms of classroom computer resources, kindergartners and first-graders from the lowest SES group were less likely to have a computer area in their classroom than children in the highest SES group. In first grade, public school Hispanic children were less likely to have access to computers in their classrooms than White children, and Hispanic firstgraders were less likely to have teachers who had attended a computer/technology workshop than White and Black firstgradersfindings that did not occur in kindergarten. In terms of home computer resources, public school children's access varied by race/ethnicity and family SES, with minority and disadvantaged children being less likely to have home access to computer resources in kindergarten and first grade. Public school children's access to computer resources at school and home tended to increase as they moved from kindergarten to first grade. Over half of all public school children attended classrooms where computers were used for various instructional purposes at least once a week. Young children's use of computers in their classrooms differed, however, by several classroom characteristics, including kindergarten program type (part-day vs. full-day), teachers' attendance at computer/technology workshops during the school year, presence of a computer area in the classroom, and the proportion of time classes spent in teacher-directed, wholeclass instruction. For those public school young children with access to home computers, all children used their home computers an average of about 3 to 4 days each week. However, the purposes for which young children used home computers during the school year and over summer vacation (e.g., to access the Internet, play educational games) varied by children's sex, race/ethnicity, and SES. The ECLS-K provides a wealth of information on children's cognitive, socioemotional, and physical development from kindergarten through fifth grade across multiple contexts, including the home, classroom, school, and community. Since this report shows differences in computer access and use between public and private school children, additional analyses could focus on child and family characteristic differences within private school settings. Based on the findings from this report, future research could also examine how children's access to and use of computers in different settings relate to their academic achievement over time. Also, information on computer resources and use could be further explored at the school and classroom level to identify differences based on characteristics of the schools that young children attend. For example, children's access to school computer resources could be examined in terms of school size, grade range, federal program participation, urbanicity, and region. Research on the relationship between children's early care and education and school readiness has shown the potential importance of enriching learning experiences for young children and, in particular, the positive outcomes of early intervention for educationally disadvantaged children (Love, Schochet, and Meckstroth 1996;Barnett 1995;Haskins 1989). In fact, the National Research Council suggests that a finding that young children who are at risk of school failure have a greater likelihood of success if they attend high-quality early childhood programs seems to emerge across studies of early care and education (Bowman, Donovan, and Burns 2001). In recent years, renewed attention has focused on the role that public schools might play in providing high-quality programs for prekindergarten children (Saluja, Early, and Clifford 2001;Hinkle 2000). Educators and policymakers have considered the possibility of public schools drawing upon existing resources to expand and improve prekindergarten programs and thereby help prepare young children for school (Dwyer, Chait, and McKee 2000;Hinkle 2000). Unfortunately, data on the role public schools play in providing early childhood education are limited and are sometimes clouded by a lack of common terminology. Most of the available data do not differentiate public school programs from other early childhood education programs; the data often include programs offered by private schools, public and private day care centers, and Head Start classes operating outside of the public school system. The results presented in this report are based on questionnaire data from 1,843 public elementary schools in the United States. The data provide national estimates representing all special education and regular public elementary schools in the nation.\nOffering accommodations in state NAEP to students who receive them in their regular classroom assessments increases inclusion in some states and other jurisdictions, but the magnitude of the increase varies across jurisdictions. At grade 4, the increase in inclusion of special-needs students and the provision of accommodations was associated with lower average scale scores in nine states, but not in the nation. At grade 8, there was no pattern of statistically significant differences by accommodation status. Readers are cautioned not to overgeneralize the results of this study for several reasons. First, within the reading subject area, the lack of difference between samples with accommodations permitted and those without accommodations permitted in the national data in 1998 did not continue in the 2000 fourth-grade national assessment, where a statistically significant difference did appear in favor of the sample without accommodations. Second, patterns may vary depending on the academic subject area. For example, in the present discussion of 1998 state reading assessment results, more states at grade 4 had lower average scale scores for their accommodated samples than at grade 8. However, for the mathematics assessment in 2000, the findings were differentmore states at grade 8 had statistically significant lower average scale scores in accommodated samples than at grade 4. Finally, the fact that the reading assessment did not permit a Spanish translation suggests that the findings for LEP students may not generalize to other subjects, such as mathematics, where this accommodation may be offered. In 1995, half of the states (25) had content standards in mathematics; by 1998, this number had increased to 42 (Council of Chief State School Officers 2000). Forty-five states had student assessments in mathematics in 1994; by 1999, 47 states had such assessments. The existence of standards and assessments at the state level does not guarantee that classroom teachers are familiar with the standards or with the specifications of assessments (Cohen and Hill 2000). Neither does it guarantee that classroom instruction reflects the standards and assessments. In fact, mathematics standards have created significant controversy over the efficacy of different types of instruction for improving student performance (Loveless 2001; see, especially, the chapter by Loveless). The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (T1MSS) assessments of 1995 and 1999* take a representative sample of eighth-grade students. This Issue Brief draws on surveys administered to these students' mathematics teachers. Using the survey results, this analysis examines the degree of teacher familiarity with various standards and assessments in 1995 and 1999. It then compares teacher reports of their instructional practices in classrooms with teacher reports of their familiarity with standards and assessments. Instruction is compared on the kinds of problem-solving activities advocated by national and state standards during the mid-1990s and on computational skill practice, which received more emphasis in the standards at the close of the 20th century (Loveless 2001). How Familiar Are Teachers With Standards, Curriculum Guides, and Assessment Specifications? Teacher familiarity with state education department documents, such as curriculum guides and assessment specifications, appears to have increased between 1995 and 1999 (table 1). In 1999, fewer students had teachers who were not familiar with assessment specifications (44 percent in 1999 compared with 57 percent in 1995). In *In other documents,TIMSS 1999 is also referred to as TIMSS-R (TIMSS-Rep-eat). 1999, students were also less likely to have teachers who reported they were not familiar with their state education department curriculum guides (20 percent) compared with students in 1995 (33 percent). Students with teachers who were more familiar with national, state, and local standards for practice were more likely to be asked to do problem-solving activities. For example, in 1999, students with teachers who were very familiar with state education department assessment specifications were more likely than students with teachers who were fairly or not familiar with these documents to be asked to represent and analyze relationships using tables, charts, or graphs in most lessons or every lesson (41 per-cent of those with teachers who were very familiar compared with 22 and 19 percent, respectively, of those with teachers who were fairly familiar and not familiar; table 2). In 1999, students with teachers who were very familiar with these documents were also more likely to be frequently asked to write equations to represent relationships than students with teachers who were not familiar with these documents (69 percent and 44 percent, respectively). Similarly, students with teachers who reported being very familiar with state education department curriculum guides were more likely than students with teachers who were fairly or not familiar to be asked to explain the reasoning behind an idea in most lessons or every lesson in 1999 BEST COPY AVAILABLE (86 percent, 68 percent, and 62 percent, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in 1999 in the percentages of students who were asked to practice computational skills in most lessons or every lesson by teacher familiarity with state education department assessment specifications. Did Relationships Between Teacher Awareness and Classroom Practices Change Over Time? There were stronger relationships between teacher awareness of standards and assessments and classroom practices in 1999 than in 1995 on several measures. These stronger relationships were especially apparent for students with teachers who were familiar with state education department documents, such as curriculum guides and assessment specifications. Students with teachers who were very familiar with state education department curriculum guides were more likely to have teachers who reported asking their students to work on problems for which there is no obvious method of solution in most lessons or every lesson in 1999 than in 1995 (22 percent and 9 percent, respectively). Students with teachers who reported being very or fairly familiar with these guides were more likely to be frequently asked to write equations to represent relationships in 1999 compared with 1995 (58 percent compared with 33 percent and 49 percent compared with 30 percent, respectively). Similarly, students with teachers who were very familiar with the state education department assessment specifications were more likely to be frequently asked to represent and analyze relationships using tables, charts, or graphs, to write equations to represent relationships, and to practice computational skills in 1999 than in 1995 (41 percent compared with 20 percent, 69 percent compared with 45 percent, and 68 percent compared with 38 percent, respectively). Students whose teachers were fairly familiar with this type of document were more likely to be frequently asked to work on problems for which there is no obvious method of solution and to write equations to represent relationships in 1999 than in 1995 (26 percent compared to 6 percent and 53 percent compared to 26 percent, respectively). At the school level, students with teachers who were very familiar with school curriculum guides were more likely to be frequently asked to represent and analyze relationships using tables, charts, or graphs, to work on problems for which there is no obvious method of solution, and to write equations to represent relationships in 1999 than in 1995 (28 percent compared with 15 percent, 24 percent compared with 12 percent, and 59 percent compared with 38 percent, respectively). Students with teachers who reported being not familiar with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards or school district curriculum guides were more likely to be frequently asked to do problem-solving activities, such as explain the reasoning behind an idea, in 1999 than in 1995 (68 percent compared with 42 percent and 73 percent compared with 38 percent, respectively).\nThis analysis shows that teacher awareness of state curriculum guides and state assessments increased between 1995 and 1999. At the end of the last decade, teachers who were very familiar with these policy instruments were more likely than their peers to employ instructional practices that are consistent with the current state curriculum guides and state assessments. In addition, this Issue Brief provides modest support for the existence of a relationship between familiarity with policy instruments and teacher practices (see also Cohen and Hill 2000). In particular, students with teachers who were more familiar with state education department curriculum guides and assessment specifications were more likely to be frequently given various instructional tasks reflecting the problem-solving and computation emphases of the current policies in 1999 than in 1995. aid received.

Extended day care was offered by 18 percent of public elementary schools with prekindergarten classes, and 5 percent of all prekindergarten children received this service. A survey of state education departments was conducted between October 1999 and January 2000 to collect information on state policies and practices pertaining to the assessment of kindergarten children (Saluja, Scott-Little, and Clifford 2000). According to the findings from this survey, 18 states reported that they had statewide screening or assessment of children beginning kindergarten; 26 states responded that though there was no statewide assessment effort, some local districts were assessing children before or as they entered kindergarten; 16 states said they were working toward a statewide assessment program; and 6 states responded that there was no assessment effort at either the state or local level. The most often cited use of the information from these tests was to improve instruction by providing teachers with information about their incoming kindergarten class (12 states). The data were also used for school improvement purposes by helping to identify high-need schools (7 states) and to identify children with special needs (6 states). Because many states give local school officials the authority to make decisions about whether or not to assess kindergarten children, how to assess these children, and how to use the information from these assessments, it is important to know more about these practices at the school level.

The administration of such tests and how the information from these tests is used varies by several school characteristics, such as school type, the grade levels taught, and school size. For example, schools that end with kindergarten differ from primary, elementary, and combined schools in their use of such tests (e.g., use of test information to individualize instruction). Schools that end with kindergarten are significantly less likely to use entrance and placement tests in general (21 percent vs. 65 to 71 percent). Therefore, it is not surprising that they also differ in how they use the information from these tests. Whether or not these patterns of use are different from the past is difficult to judge. The 1999-2000 survey results reported by Saluja, Scott-Little, and Clifford (2000) and results from earlier surveys conducted in the mid-1990s (Shepard, Kagan, and Taylor 1996) and mid-1980s (Gnezda and Bolig 1988) focus on the policies and practices of states (not schools). The ECLS-K provides information about schools' use of assessments. However, both at the state level and at the school level, the findings seem consistent.

Authorized by Congress, administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the U.S. Department of Education, and overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), NAEP regularly reports to the public on the educational progress of a representative sample of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. Because NAEP's purpose is to report on what students know and can do, it is important that its student samples and assessment results represent the performance of all students. This includes the results for special-needs students students with disabilities (SD) and limited-English-proficient (LEP) students. Although the intent of NAEP has consistently been to include special-needs students in its assessments to the fullest degree possible, the implementation of assessments has resulted in some exclusion of SD and LEP students. In order to participate in the NAEP assessments, some special-needs students require accommodations in the test administration. In 1996, NAEP began offering accommodations on a trial basis and conducting research to explore possible psychometric effects that the inclusion of accommodated special-needs students might have on assessment results in various subject areas. The NAEP 1998 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States (Donahue et al.1999) included national results for fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-graders, as well as results for fourth-and eighth-graders in those states and other jurisdictions (i.e., U.S. territories and the District of Columbia) that volunteered to participate in state-level assessments.* In order to allow comparisons with results in 1992 and 1994, when accommodations were not offered, the report card did not incorporate the 1998 results for special-needs students who were tested with accommodations."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of This Report", "text": "There are two purposes to this report.

Persistence/Attainment Risk A common method of characterizing undergraduate students is to separate students into \"traditional\" and \"nontraditional\" categories. In a 1996 NCES study, a broad definition of nontraditional was used that included seven characteristics: delaying enrollment; attending part time; being financially independent; having dependents other than a spouse; working full time while enrolled; having no high school diploma; and being a single parent. Nontraditional status was defined on a continuum based on the number of these characteristics. The nontraditional status index ranges from minimally nontraditional (one characteristic) to moderately nontraditional (two or three characteristics) to highly nontraditional (four or more characteristics) (Horn 1996). The same characteristics that define a nontraditional student have also been termed risk characteristics because they have been shown to be negatively associated with persistence and attainment (Horn 1996;Horn and Premo 1995). This report uses the index to examine the percentage of each type of borrower group with different numbers of risk characteristics and applies the same continuum used to define nontraditional to characterize the degree of risk from minimal to high.

Students who entered college with good academic preparationthose who received mostly As in high school:, took two or more Advanced Placement (AP) tests, or had high SAT scoresalso had higher completion rates than others. About 80 percent completed a bachelor's degree within 6 years, and more than one-half (55-61 percent) graduated within 4 years. Among beginners with a bachelor's degree goal, women had higher completion rates than men and were more likely to finish in 4 years. Hispanic and Black, non-Hispanic students had lower completion rates than Asian/Pacific Islander and White, non-Hispanic students. Low-income dependent students had lower completion rates than high-income dependent students.  Table B. Percentage of students beginning at 4-year institutions in 1995-96 with a bachelor's degree goal who completed a bachelor's degree at the first institution attended or at any 4-year institution by June 2001,and the number of years to complete the degree, by type of first institution, enrollment patterns, academic preparation, and student characteristics NOTE:These completion rates are based on the number of months between the date of first enrollment and bachelor's degree completion.The 4-year rate includes those who completed in 48 months or less after they first enrolled.These rates may differ slightly from bachelor's degree attainment percentages based on status at the end of an academic year, such as those in figure A. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. children, being a single parent, being financially independent of parents, and working full time while enrolled. In prior studies, a persistence risk index was developed based on the number of these adverse characteristics (Horn 1996). All of these risk factors.are also associated with \"nontradi-_ tional\" students, and the more risk factors a student hasAhe 66 more nontraditional the student may be considered to be. Conversely, students with none of the risk factors may be considered to be highly traditional students: they enroll immediately after receiving a high school diploma, attend full time in the first year, are financially dependent on their parents, and work part time or not at all while enrolled."}, {"section_title": "66", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE Beginners who started at 4-year institutions in 1995-96 were predominantly traditional students: most of them had entered college without delay after high school, and most had none of the characteristics associated with a high risk of not completing a degree. This pattern is reflected in the profile of those college graduates who started at a 4-year institution in 1995-96 and had completed a bachelor's degree by June 2001: 91 percent had entered college immediately after high school, and 86 percent had no persistence risk factors when they first enrolled in 1995-96. Students who graduated with a bachelor's degree within 4 years were well prepared when they entered college. More than one-half had received mostly As in high school (62 percent) or had SAT test scores in the highest quartile among college freshmen (56 percent), and 30 percent had taken two or more AP tests. Women represented a majority (62 percent) of the college graduates who started at a 4-year institution in 1995-96 and completed a bachelor's degree in the expected 4-year period. Students who began at public 2-year institutions were more likely to be nontraditional students than those who began at 4-year institutions. Almost one-half of the beginners at public 2-year institutions had delayed starting college after high school, and about one-half had two or more persistence risk factors when they started. Traditional students (those with no risk factors when they began) represented about one-half (56 percent) of the bachelor's degree recipients who had transferred from public 2-year institutions. The other half were nontraditional students who began their education in 1995-96 with a higher risk of not completing a degree at all, but had been able to enter a bachelor's degree program via a community college."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusion", "text": "Differences in the bachelor's degree completion rates of students who began at community colleges and those who began at 4-year colleges and universities reflect differences in the degree goals, academic preparation, enrollment patterns, and demographic characteristics of these students. Compared with students who started at 4,7year institutions, those who started at public 2-year institutions were less well prepared for college and were less likely to be continuously enrolled. Beginners at public 2-year institutions were also more likely to enroll part time, to have delayed enrolling after high school, and to be nontraditional students starting postsecondary education with one or more persistence risk factors. Beginners at 4-year institutions were predominantly traditional students with no persistence risk factors when they started college, and they were usually enrolled full time. Among those with a bachelor's degree goal, 55 percent of the beginners at 4-year institutions completed a bachelor's degree at the institution where they had started. When transfer students who completed their degrees at a different institution are also included, a total of 63 percent of the students who began at a 4-year institution with a bachelor's degree goal completed that degree within 6 years. Although the expected length of time required to complete a bachelor's degree is 4 years, 37 percent of the students with a bachelor's degree goal who started at a 4-year institution in 1995-96 actually finished their degree in that period of time. The characteristics of the students who were most likely to graduate within 4 years with a bachelor's degree fit a commonly held perception of what a college student looks likehe or she receives good academic preparation in high school, enters college immediately after high school, enrolls in college full time, and is continuously enrolled."}, {"section_title": "FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES", "text": "The AERA Grants Program  1996, 1998, and 2001.

The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 1999 Video Study examines classroom teaching practices through in-depth analysis of videotapes of eighth-grade mathematics lessons. The study provides rich descriptions of mathematics teaching as it is actually experienced by eighth-grade students in the United States and six other countries: Australia, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Students in these six countries were generally among the top-performing students on the TIMSS 1995 mathematics assessment and, in particular, outperformed their U.S. counterparts. This 12-page publication presents highlights of results, based on the full report Teaching Mathematics in Seven Countries: Results From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study (NCES 2003-013).
