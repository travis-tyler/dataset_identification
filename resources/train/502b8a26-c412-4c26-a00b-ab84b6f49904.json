[{"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report examines the demographic and language characteristics and educational aspirations of Asian and Hispanic eighth graders and relates that information to their mathematical ability and reading comprehension as measured by an achievement test. Special attention is paid to students who come from homes in which a non-English language is spoken. The report uses information selected from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 is a large-scale study designed and sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), with support from the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). NELS:88 provides a variety of data about the 1988 eighth graders as they move through the U.S. school system and into the many and varied activities of early adulthood. The study began with the administration of questionnaires and teats to a nationally representative sample of 25,000 eighth graders in more than 1,000 public arid private schools in the spring of 1988. Data were also collected from the student's parents, teachers, and school principals. NELS:88 has continued with a second collection of information from the 1988 eighth graders in the spring of 1990. A third data collection, along with the collection of high school transcripts, will take place in 1992. The NELS:88 data supply an incredibly rich source of info nation about factors that contribute to a student's academic performance and social development. We hope that this report on Hispanic and Asian eighth graders will inspire other researchers to use these data to pursue their own interests and concerns."}, {"section_title": "Paul Planchon, Associate Commissioner Elementary/Secondary Education Statistics Division", "text": "Jeffrey Owings, Branch Chief Longitudinal and Household Studies Branch f; Their aspirations Asian LM students with a low English proficiency are less likely than those with greater proficiency to plan on enrolling in an academic program while in high school (24 percent versus 46 percent, after adjusting to control for SES).

Similar percentages of Asian non-LM and LM students were unable to achieve the basic level in reading (23 percent and 24 percent, respectively) and in math (27 percent and 23 percent, respectively). Among Asian LM students, English proficiency is related to achievMg the basic reading level, but not to achieving the basic math level. Overall, Asian students with no aspirations for further education after high school failed to achieve basic achievement levels at higher rates than did students with plans for college. Forty-five percent and 51 ?ercent of students with no further educational plans failed to achieve the basic levels on the reading and math tests. Although smaller percentages of students with plans for a college degree failed to achieve the basic levels, these percentages are still substantial. Twenty-one percent and 22 percent of Asian students intending to graduate from college were unable to achieve the basic reading and math levels, respectively.\nSimilar percentages of Hispanic non-LM and LM eighth graders failed to achieve the basic levels of performance on the reading (30 percent and 31 percent, respectively) and math (36 percent and 37 percent, respectively) achievement tests. Among LM students, those with low proficiency in English failed to achieve at a much higher rate than did students with high proficiency.

Overall, Hispanic students with no aspirations for further education after high school failed to achieve basic achievement levels at higher rates than did students with plans for college. For example. 43 percent and 52 percent of stude:;ts with no further plans failed to achieve the basic levels on the reading and math tests, respectively, while 24 percent and 29 percent of students who planned to graduate from college were unable to achieve those same levels. The following chart presents a few of the findings from both the Asian and Hispanic eighth-grade populations, in order to illustrate the similarities and differences between the two groups. Chapter 4 presents a more detailed and thorough comparison betwezn the two populations.     The challenge of educating students with limited English language skills is not a new one for American educators. In a society with a population that contains mostly immigrant peoples from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, historically, the school has played a major role in naturalization. Many immigrant children first learned English by hearing teachers and classmates use it in the classroom, by studying their textbooks, and by participating to whatever extent they could in both the instructional lessons conducted within school and in extracurricular and social activities occurring outside the classroom. However, acquisition of the English language did not come easily to all immigrant children. In recent years, educators have become increasingly concerned that during the crucial period that students are beginning to learn and understand the English language, they are not able to adequately comprehend the lessons that are more readily understood by their English-speaking peers. However, learning the English language is only one of many complex problems facing immigrant children. High dropout rates and low academic achievement, persistent major societal problems, are widespread among language minority students. Indeed, both educators and the courts have identified language and related cultural differences as key factors contributing to the educational failure of minority students.1 As different methods and programs have been proposed to teach English skills to children who use languages other than English, a number of terms have been used to classify these children. Two of these terms are Language Minority (LM) and Limited English Proficient (LEP). Language minority refers to children who come from homes in which a non-English language is spoken. The English lant,uage skills of language minority children range from not being able to speak English at all to being very fluent in English. Since those who study language acquisition are still debating about definitions, Limited English Proficient has several definitions; conceptually, however, LEP means that the children have sufficient difficulty with English that they are at a disadvantage in classes taught entirely in English. During recent decades, a series of events have called particular attention to the problem of low achievement among language minority students. First, growth in the immigration of families and children from countries in Latin America and Asia, coupled with the now famous (and largely Anglo) \"baby bust\" of the 1970s, has led to larger proportions of language minority children enrolled in our nation's schools. Furthermore, as the international economy has become more competitive and technologically sophisticated, the quality of the U.S. work force has been more carefully scrutinized. Finally, because fewer new jobs are available to poorly educated workers, educational failurewhatever the causeis a growing problem. These developments have prompted educators and policymakers to intensify their efforts to enhance the educational achievement of all studentsespecially that of language minority students. In addiessing the problems of this rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population, much research has been conducted on the educational experiences of language minority students. A number of related studies have concentrated on the educational experiences of ethnic minorities overall, a group that includes language minority students. The findings of many of these studies have shown that Hispanics have lower high school achievement, higher dropout rates, and lower college attendance than whites. Because Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the United States, this is a matter of grave concern.2 Asians, on the other hand, have often demonstrated high achievement, particularly in mathematics, but researchers point out that some Asian ethnic subgroups, such as Filipinos and Pacific Islanders, have not been as academically successful. They also note the importance of separating the more recent waves of immigration from previous ones to differentiate upper class students from those of other backgrounds. Finally, researchers have been somewhat concerned that Asian students do not develop their language potential because their high achievement in math and science makes schools reluctant to allocate resources toward improving their other talents and pow,. al5.3 Some research has focused on isolating the factors in school achievement. Much of this research indicates that socioeconomic status, English language ability, and place of nativity specifically affect Hispanic students' achievement in school. For instance, Hispanic high school students have indicated more often than white, non-Hispanic students that their school progress has been thwarted by financial problems, family obligations, parental disinterest, and lack of a study space at home.4 Finally, other research points to inadequacies in the schools that Hispanic students often attend and reports that they are underfinanced, overcrowded, and lacking in bilingual staff.5 Despite the recent attention these issues have received, few studies have been conducted on the academic achievement of language minority youth using nationally representative samples, especially those that include students with limited English proficiency. However, a recent study conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) does use a nationally representative sample of language minority students. In a supplement to its regular assessment, NAEP conducted a special study of the reading and mathematics performance of language minority children. This study confirmed somewhat the importance of English language competence, particularly in the educational attainment of Hispanics, although other factors were found to influence language competencyparental education and aspirations, language use, socioeconomic status, nativity, locus of control, and school characteristics.6 Nevertheless, this study had several weaknesses: its most serious shortcoming was that Limited English Proficient (LEP) students were not included. The purpose of this study is to build upon research that has already been conducted, exploring some of the factors that influence the achievements of Asian and Hispanic students in this country using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Because it contains suitably large numbers of students of various ethnicities as well as LEP students who have been excluded from previous longitudinal surveys, the NELS:88 survey is particularly suited to exploring a variety of questions about students' ethnicity and language skills. This particular report establishes a basic understanding of the backgrounds, language skills, and academic abilities of the 1988 Asian and Hispanic eighth graders, providing an initial level of information to which changes measured during the follow-up surveys of 1990 and 1992 can be compared. NELS:88 asked each of the students and one of their parents in-depth questions about their nativity and length of residence in the United States; their communication skills in English and in their home language, if applicable; and their expectations of the student's future education. In addition to providing more information on language usage and skills than previously available data sets, NELS:88 oversampled Asian and Hispanic students with funds from the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA). Of the approximately 25,000 eighth-grade students sampled for NELS:88, about 3,000 are Hispanic and about 1,500 are Asian or Pacific Islanders.1 For each student participating in the base-year survey, data were collected from two eighth-grade teachers, a school administrator, and a parent of the student. Several procedures were instituted to ensure a high response rate from parents of Hispanic and Asian students. First, when necessary, the contractors provided a parent questionnaire in Spanish. In addition, Spanishspeaking interviewers contacted parents to encourage them to complete the survey and often administered it over the telephone. Finally, although parent questionnaires were not available in any Asian language, letters urging parents to complete the survey and to seek help with translafion if needed were sent to non-English-speaking Asian parents who were identified by the schools. Out of the 25,000 students who participated in the NELS:88 survey, approximately 1.5 percent (107 Asian and 220 Hispanic students) were identified by their teachers as LEP. Missing from this percentage, how-,er, are those students whom principals excluded from the study because of language difficulties. The NELS:88 survey excluded certain kinds of students: specifically, mentally handicapped students and those not proficient in English, for whom the NELS:88 tests would be unsuitable, and students having physical or emotional problems that would make participation in the survey unwise or unduly difficult. Seven ineligibility categories were employed at the time of the student sample selection; school coordinators at each sample school were given student rosters on which to mark the eligible and ineligible students. One of the seven categories pertained to language, and referred to students who do not have English as the mother tongue and who have insufficient command of English to complete the NELS:88 questionnaires and tests. It was up to the schools to define who they thought would be incapable of completing the instruments in English. The decision was to be made on an individual basis, and LEPs were NOT to be excluded categorically. Among the total number of eighth-grade students enrolled in the 1,000 participating schools (202,966 students), 1.9 percent (3,831 students) were declared ineligible for the survey because the principals felt that language limitations would cause these students to have difficulty completing questionnaires and/or cognitive tests. If these students (those with language limitations) had not been excluded from the sampling frame, it is estimated that the number of additional students who may have been classified as LEP by their teachers may have increased by approximately 460 (12 percent sampling ratio times 3,831 excluded) students. This 12 percent sampling ratio was used to create the original sample of 25,000 students from a total number of 202,966 eighth-grade students who were enrolled in the 1,000 participating schools. Because these students were excluded from the survey, there is a potential for bias in the base-year data. Thus, the base-year NELS:88 sample is clearly not representative of all eighth-grade language minority students. For the purposes of this report, the population being studied are those Asian and Hispanic students (4,500) whom the principals felt could complete the survey instruments. Although the sample of LEP students included in the base year of NELS:88 is smaller than it would have been if excluded 3tudents had been sampled, sufficient numbers are available (327) to 7The specific ethnic subgroups included in these categories will be outlined in chapter 1.

While 83 percent of high SES students have a high Eng'ish proficiency, only 56 percent of low SES students have such a proficiency. Among Hispanic LM students, 64 percent have a high English language proficiency, 32 percent have a moderate proficiency, and 4 percent have a low proficiency.

By contrast, only 14 percent of the highly English proficient have no plans after high school, and 24 percent intend to continue their etlucation after college. (These figures have been adjusted to control for differences in SES.)"}, {"section_title": "General Approach", "text": "This study capitalizes on the oversampling of ethnic minority students, the inclusion of a sufficient number of teacher-identified LEP students, and the lessons learned from previous studies. Four considerations figured into the design of this analysis: the unique characteristics of each of the two populations, the diversity within each population, the importance of finding better measures of language background and ability, and the need to compare student performance with behavioral standards, rather than attempting intergroup comparisons. First, the Asian Kid Hispanic students weft always analyzed separately. Given the cultural differences of these goups and their individual histories in this country, it did not seem useful to combine these groups for an overall analysis, nor to use one group as a standard by which to measure the other. At the end of the report, however, differences and similarities between the Asian and Hispanic populations are noted. Second, because of the diversity within the Hispanic and Asian student populations, whenever possible, the analysis focused on subgroups of similar students. One traditional approach has been to focus on ethnic subgroups within the Asian and Hispanic populations, which is based on the perception that there are important differences among Hispanic students of different ethnic descents (for example, Cubans versus Mexican-Americans) and among students of different Asian descents (for .txample, Chinese versus Southeast Asians). When possible, this distinction has been made in this study. Another approach focuses on distinguishing natives from non natives and on differentiating students who have been living in the United States for a brief time from those who have resided here for several years.9 Recent work suggests that for Asians and Hispanics, as for wl:ite non-Hispanics, differences in socioeconomic status are more important than variations in ethnic background. In analyzing the results of the tabulations, all these factors were considered. The third principle, the importance of finding better measures of language background and ability, reinforces the fact that language minority (LM) students and students with limited English proficiency (LEP) are not homogeneous populations in terms of their language proficiency or language use. In this analysis, students were analyzed according to their LM and LEP status, as identified by their teachers, and also with regard to how they themselves assessed their English skills. Finally, when analyzing academic achievement, Asians were not ;ompared to Hispanics nor were either group compared with the white non-Hispanic populatioo. Instead, the language patterns of students in these two racialethnic groups were described as accurately as possible, with the objective of determining both how these patterns relate to other background 8Given the potential for undercoverage bias, NCES has taken steps to correct this situation in future NELS:88 followups and reports by subsampling students who were excluded during the base year. During the spring of 1991, approximately 600 base-year ineligible students were resurveyed to determine status (e.g., dropout) and eligibility to complete modified questionnaires. As an additional measure to reduce potential bias, at the request of OBEMLA, NCES has freshened the first follow-up sample with tenth-grade LEP students who probably would have been excluded from the base-year survey. These students (e.g., base-year ineligible and freshened) will be added to followup files. All future NELS:88 language minority and LEP reports will utilize these corrected files. 90ther approaches include distinguishing refugees from non-refugees, or one wave of immigrants from another. However, the NELS:88 data do not provide this information. characteristics and how their language usage and ability affect their academic achievement. The NELS:88 test battery scorts, converted into behaviorally anchored levels of performance, provide an objective comparison measure when relating background and language characteristics to achievement. These performance levels are described in further detail in chapter 1."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "This report is divided into four chapters. The first chapter, Measures and Definitions, discusses the issues and definitions of the language variables used to categorize students in the analysis, describes an adjustment procedure that is used to control for the influence of socioeconomic status, and presents the measures of academic achievementthe achievement tests the students took when partiapating in the NELS:88 Survey. This chapter also defines key terms that are used throughout the report. The next two chapters of the report discuss the major findings of the research and are very similar to one another in format. Chapter 2 presents a profile of the Asian eighth graders, while chapter 3 is devoted to the Hispanic eighth graders. Each chapter contains three sect:ons, with each section describing a particular facet of the bilingual student population such as ethnicity, language proficiency, nativity and residency; teachers' perspectives; and the students' educational experiences and aspirations. Occasionally, the characteristics of ihe entire Asian or Hispanic student population are described, but the focus is on the language minority students. Each of the three sections concludes with an investigation of the differences among the students who were not able to achieve the basic level of performance on the reading and math achievement tests.\u00b0 At the end of both chapter 2 and chapter 3 is a brief review of the general findings and the background factors most strongly related to underachievement. The report concludes with a chapter that briefly compares the findings from the Asian and Hispanic student populations.

The following section briefly summarizes how these categories were created and applied. Students were also divided into subgroups on the basis of ethnicity; the peoples or nationalities that comprise the Asian and If spanic groups are discussed below. This chapter concludes by describing the achievement tests taken by the students and the interpretation underlying the possible levels of achievement."}, {"section_title": "Language Proficiency Measures", "text": "A number of questions in the NELS:88 survey explore the students' language history, use, and abilities. Students who responded that a non-English language was spoken in the home were asked for more detail about their use of both languagesEnglish and the non-English language used most often by the student.11 Throughout this report, the non-English language has been called the students' home language. The term home language, however, ought to be interpreted with caution; it often conveys the idea that this is the language the student learned first, speaks most often, or most often uses at home. However, in response to the follow-up question, \"What language do the people in your home usually speak?\" (survey emphasis), 30 percent of both the Asian and Hispanic students with two languages spoken in the home responded \"English.\" Two series of questions in the NELS:88 survey asked students to assess their ability to communicate with others; each series contained four items. Only language minority students those who reported that a language other than English was spoken in their home--had the opportunity to respond to these sets of questions. The four items contained in the first language assessment series requested the students to determine how well they understood spoken English, as well as how well they spoke, read, and wrote English. The second language series asked students to assess these same four skills in their hom:.'! language. Two similar series of questions on the parent questionnaire asked about the parent's English and home language communication skills. One problem in interpreting the students' responses to the language ability questions is the difficulty of determining what point of reference students used for comparison when answering the question. For example, when assessing their English speaking skills, students could respond to the question \"How well do you speak English?\" in four possible ways: (a) very well, (b) pretty well, (c) well, or (d) not very well.12 Given such subjective responses, students whose first language was other than English might be comparing their English abilities to monolingual English speakers, to their siblings, or perhaps to their parents, with each different reference point presumably affecting their response. For example, if a student's first language is Vietnamese, but she has been speaking English for some time, she might compare her present ability to her original language skills when just beginning to learn the language. Or perhaps she might compare her English-speaking skills to her Vietnamese skills. It is also possible that students with low self-I1The screening question was worded \"Is any language other than English spoken in your home?\" Students responded either \"yes\" or \"no.\" esteem might assess themselves at a lower level than an equally skilled person with greater selfesteem. Another limitation of the study was the exclusion of many Limited English Proficient (LEP) students from the sample. The base-year NELS:88 sampling procedures instructed principals to exclude eighth graders who they thought were not suffic;ently proficient in English to complete the questionnaire, which resulted in the elimination of 3,831 students (1.9 percent) from the eighth-gade sample population. Among the students who were included in the survey, only 327 were identified as LEP by their teachers; thus, those included are the most proficient of the LEP students. To call attention to the fact that these students may not be representative of all LEP eighth graders, they are identified throughout the report as non-excluded teacher-identified LEPs, abbreviated as NET/Ls. Despite the limitations of the data, answers to the four questions within each language assessment series were used to construct a single language proficiency measure.13 Students' answers were averaged into a mean score. The higher the combined score, the higher the students had assessed their ability to perform these four skills. Next, this measure was converted into \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" proficiency. If a student had a score of four (meaning they had answered \"very well\" to every skill assessment), they were defined as being highly proficient. Students with scores equal to and below two (meaning that they had responded \"not very well\" or \"well\" to at least two skill assessments) were determined to have a low proficiency. The remaining students (whose mean score fell between two and four) were placed into a moderately proficient category. This scaling procedure was also used to determine the students' home language proficiency, and the parent's English and home language proficiency. Table 1.1 presents the percentages of Asian and Hispanic students with various English language and home language proficiency levels. It bears repeating that only those students who are language minority have measurable English language and home language roficiency levels; students from monolingual l'omes were not asked to assess their communication abilities. 12There were five possiblf.: responses for the home language skill assessment including those mentioned above and \"not at all.\" 13Appendix A duplicates tne survey questions used to construct the language proficiency measures. Factor and reliability analyses were conducted on this measure of proficiency to determine the propriety of combining these individual questions into a single measure. The technical notes (appendix B) contain further details about the results of these analyses. "}, {"section_title": "Language Status and Usage Definitions", "text": "In addition to reporting on their own language skills, students were also evaluated by their teachers as to whether or not they were language minority and/or limited English proficient. For each student participating in the survey, two of the student's teachers were also selected to participate. Among other questions, teachers were asked to evaluate each student as Language Minority (LM) and as Limited English Proficient (LEP). Teachers were asked to base their evaluations on the following definitions: Language Minority (LM): A studeiit in whose home a non-English language is typically spoken. Such students may inciude those whose English is fluent enough to benefit from instruction in academic subjects offered in English as well as students whose English proficiency is limited. Limited English Proficient (LEP): A student whose native language is other than English and whose skills in listening to, speaking, reading, or writing English are such that he/she derives little benefit from school instruction in English.\" Students were placed in categories of LEP or non-LEP solely according to their teachers' assessments: if at least one teacher defined the student as LEP, the student waLs defined as LEP. Two different methods were used to describe the students' language minority status. In the first, students were termed LM or non-LM solely according to their own response regarding whether or not a non-English language is spoken in their home. Throughout this report, when referring to the students' LM status, this first method is the definition most often applied. However, for certain sections, a second method of defining LM status was used. For this second method, which uses recognized and nonrecognized before LM and non-LM, teacher responses were combined with student responses. If at least one teacher defmed the student as LM and the student indicated that a non-English language was spoken in the home, the student was defined as recognized LM. Conversely, if neither teacher defined the student as LM and the student indicated that the home was monolingual, the student was defined as recognized non-LM. However, in a number of cases, neither teacher defined the student as LM, yet the student indicated that a second language was spoken in the home. These students were placed in a nonrecognized LM status category. In a smaller number of cases, at least one teacher defined the student as language minority but the student indicated that no language other than English was spoken in the home. These students were also placed in the nolirecognized LM status category. These categorizations are discussed in more detail in chapters 2 and 3. One other measure that relates to the students' linguistic ability and performance is that of language usage. Students who responded that they came from a bilingual home were asked how often the non-English language was spoken in several situations. Among the situations presented were \"How often do you speak that language to your father? How often does your father speak that language to you? How often do your brothers or sisters speak that language to you? How often do you speak that language with your best friends in your neighborhood?\" For each situation, the student was asked to respond in one of five ways: \"always or most of the time, about half the timc, sometimes, never, or does not apply.\" The answers to eight of these situational questions were combined into a mean score, and students were assigned to either a low-, moderate-, or high-usage frequency category.\u00b0B ecause some variables (such as ethnicity or educational expectations) correspond to ail Hispanic or Asian students, and others (such as language proficiency or usage) correspond only to the Hispanic or Asian language minority students, the sample sizes upon which the statistics are based may change within a table. Appendix B contains tables that display the sample sizes and response rates of the various subgroups of students for selected variables."}, {"section_title": "Ethnic Subgroups", "text": "After defining themselves as Asians or Hispanics, students were asked which specific ethnic group best categorized their background. Students were first asked to identify which racial category best described them (choosing from Asian or Pacific Islander; Hispanic, regardless of race; Black, not of Hispanic origin; White, not of Hispanic origin; or American Indian or Alaskan Native). If Asian or Pacific Islander were chosen, the student was then directed to the next questionnaire item that asked them to specify their background, choosing from the various 14U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, \"Base-Year Teacher\" survey. 1.5To examine the exact wording of the questions, see appendix A. For a more detailed explanation of this composite, see appendix B. subcategories listed in Table 1.2. Similarly, if Hispanic were chosen by the student as the best description, the student was then directed to choose from more specific background subcategories. While the set of Asian subclassifications are different from current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, they are consistent with past longitudinal studies. The exact wording and choices presented to the students are duplicated in appendix A. The socioeconomic status (SES) among ethnic subgroups sometimes varied. For example, while only 7 percent of the Koreans were in the lowest 25 percent of socioeconomic status, 40 percent of the Southeast Asians fell within that quartile. Throughout this report, the estimates for all ethnic subgroups have been adjusted for socioeconomic status; consequently, the differences among the ethnic subgroups are not attributable to differences in socioeconomic status."}, {"section_title": "Adjustment Procedure", "text": "An initial examination of the data led to the finding that socioeconomic status bore a relationship to many of the other variables of interest as well. Because this study is based on bivariate analyses, it was important to try to control, or adjust, for the effects of socioeconomic status when looking at relationships between two other variables (such as ethnicity and the student's English proficiency) so that the relationships found were not confounded by the underlying differences in socioeconomic status. The adjustment procedure uses the socioeconomic distribution for each variable being studied, factoring out the differences attributable to socioeconomic status. The adjustment procedure is best described using real data; this example is an estimate used in chapter 3. Of the Hispanic eighth graders in 1988, 64.30 percent had a high self-assessed English proficiency. One question of interest is whether differences exist between Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican students' English proficiencies. Having looked at how differences in socioeconomic status affect students' assessments of their English language skills, and having observed Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican students' dissimilar SES backgrounds, an additional question arises of whether the socioeconomic backgrounds of the students might obscure (or exaggerate) the relationship between ethnicity and English proficiency. To remove the differences due to socioeconomic status in order to look more simply at the relationship between ethnicity and English proficiency, the estimates are subjected to an adjustment procedure. Before adjusting for SES, 62.51 percent of the Mexican students, 65.82 percent of the Cuban students, and 69.33 percent of the Puerto Rican students had a high self-assessed English proficiency. Examining proficiency by socioeconomic status yields the following: 55.60 percent of low SES students had a high English proficiency; 72.61 percent of middle SES students had a high English proficiency; and 83.33 percent of high SES students had a high English proficiency. After adjusting for SES, the estimates of highly English proficient students by ethnicity change somewhat: 64.20 percent of Mexican students, 59.13 percent of Cuban students, and 68.73 percent of Puerto Rican students had a high self-assessed English proficiency. The effect of the adjustment procedure is to remove all the variation attributable to differences in die mean values of the adjustment variable (SES). The proportion of highly proficient Cuban students is exaggerated because the Cuban students, on average, have a higher socioeconomic status than the other two student populations. The adjustment procedure places a statistical control for family socioeconomic status and makes it easier to consider the ethnicity variable without forming deeply stratified tables by SES.\nAn initial examination of the data led to the finding that socioeconomic status bore a relationship to many of the other variables of interest as well. Because this study is based on bivariate analyses, it was important to try to control for the effects of socioeconomic status when looking at relationships between two other variables (such as ethnicity and the student's English proficiency) so that the relationships found were not confounded by the underlying differences in socioeconomic status. The procedure used was developed by Dennis Carroll at the National Center for Education Statistics and uses the socioeconomic distribution for each variable being studied, factoring out the differences attributable to socioeconomic status (SES). The adjustment procedure is best described using real data; this example is an estimate used in chapter 3. Of the Hispanic eighth graders in 1988, 64.30 percent had a high selfassessed English proficiency. One question of interest is if differences exist between Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican students' English proficiencies. Having looked at how differences in socioeconomic status affect students' assessments of their English language skills, and having observed Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican students' dissimilar SES backgrounds, an additional question arises of whether the socioeconomic backgrounds of the students might obscure (or exaggerate) the relationship between ethnicity and English proficiency. To remove the differences due to socioeconomic status in order to look more simply at the relationship between ethnicity and English proficiency, the estimates are subjected to an adjustment procedure. 45C. Ogden, \"StratTab User's Guide,\" MPR Associates (1989). Examining proficiency by socioeconomic status yields the following: 55.60 percent of low SES students had a high English proficiency; 72.61 percent of middle (25-75%) SES students had a high English proficiency; and 83.33 percent of high SES students had a high English proficiency. Each student has a variable (Y) representing whether or not they had a high self-assessed English proficiency; this variable Y has three The adjusted variable A was used to construct the classifications of \"Ethnic subgroups --adjusted for SES.\" As an example, before adjusting for SES, 62.51 percent of the Mexican students, 65.82 percent of the Cuban students, and 69.33 percent of the Puerto Rican students had a high English proficiency. After adjusting for SES, the estimate of highly English proficient Mexican students is 64.20 percent, of highly proficient Cuban students is 59.13 percent, and of Puerto Rican students is 68.73 percent. The effect of the adjustment procedure is to !move all the variation attributable to differences in the mean values of the adjustment variable (SES). The proportion of highly proficient Cuban students had been exaggerated because the Cuban students, on average, have a higher socioeconomic status than the other two student populations. Use of the adjustment procedure places a statistical control for family socioeconomic status and makes it easier to consider the ethnicity variable without forming deeply stratified tables by SES. This approach also enhances the power of the estimates by enabling the use of larger groups (group size would be reduced if the sample were further stratified). Finally, this approach removes all the variation attributable to differences in the adjustment variable's means rather than only the linear component (as is true with regression approaches). The procedure slightly affects the standard errors of the estimates within categories, but does not affect the standard errors of the totals. This adjustment procedure is slightly problematic in that it is possible to obtain outof-range estimates. In a number of cases within these tables, the adjusted values were less than zero. Of course, it is impossible to have a negative percentage of students, but the adjustment procedure itself resulted in negative estimates. With one exception, the unadjusted estimates and/or the sample size were fairly small. In the one exception where the estimate was not small, the unadjusted estimate was 100 percent and the adjusted estimate was slightly over 100 percent. This adjustment procedure was developed by Dennis Carroll of the National Center for Education Statistics, Longitudinal Studies Branch.

Only the results of the mathematics and reading comprehension tests were used for this report. The tests were developed by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) specifically for the NELS:88 survey. The ETS report, Psychometric Report for the NELS:88 Base-Year Test Battery (1989), discusses the properties of the test battery and item reliabilities. This report can be obtained from NCES. The items and scores on the math and reading tests are behaviorally anchored. That is, thcy were designed so that the test result, in addition to being reported as a simple number that could be compared with other students' scores, could also be reported as a performance level, indicating a student's proficiency at performing particular skills. For the reading comprehension test, students could score within three possible performance levels: basic, advanced, or below basic. At the basic reading level, students are able to recall details and identify the author's main thought. At the advanced reading level, students have mastered the basic skills, can make further inferences about the reading material, and can understand or evaluate relatively abstract concepts. Students who perform below the basic reading level are not able to accomplish any of the reading comprehension tasks in the higher two levels. Similarly, the mathematics test results were categorized into four performance levels: basic, intermediate, advanced, and below basic. At the basic math level, a student can perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on whoie numbers. At the intermediate level, a student can also carry out operations with decimals, fractions, percentages, and roots. At the advanced level, students are capable of performing these intermediate tasks and can also perform problem-solving tasks, including geometry and simple equations. Students petforming below the basic level have not mastered any of the skills in the previous three levels. When examining the relationship between background and language characteristics and achievement, the profiled students are those who were not able to perform at the basic reading and/or math levels. These students are of grave concern because they are most at risk of future educational failure."}, {"section_title": "Chapter", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Profile and Findings Asian/Pacific Islander Eighth Graders Asian Ethnic Groups", "text": "The Asian students in NELS:88 represent a wide spectrum of ethnic peoples. About onefifth (17 percent) are Chinese and another one-fifth (20 percent) are Filipino (figure 2.1). Slightly more than one-tenth (13 percent) are Southeast Asian, and another one-tenth (11 percent) are Korean. Pacific Islanders and the South Asians represent the next largest ethnic groups, with 9 percent each, followed by the Japanese, who make up 6 percent of the eighth-grade population. The rest of the students (15 percent) make up an \"other\" category that includes West Asian and Middle Eastern students. Fi ure 2.1Po. Gcmtas.uf.191aAsiEuir2jL_...ith graders,b ethnicit 8.8 The various ethnic groups within the 1988 Asian eighth-grade student population have different distributions in terms of socioeconomic status. Forty percent of the Southeast Asian students are in the lowest socioeconomic quartile, while only 12 percent are in the highest quartile (figure 2.2). The majority of the South Asian students, by contrast, are of high socioeconomic status, with 69 percent of the students in the highest SES quartile. Because of the differences in socioeconomic status among the different ethnic groups, the estimates for ethnic groups throughout this report have been adjusted to control for SES. In addition, some variables other than ethnicity have been adjusted for SES, and the reader will be alerted when these adjusted estimates are used.16  16The effect of the adjustment procedure is simply that differences among students of different ethnic groups (or the appropriate adjusted variable) are not attributable to differences in SES. A brief description of the process has been included in chapter 1 and in appendix B. Asian eighth graders are no more likely to be native-born than they are to be foreign-born. Fifty-two percent of these students were born in the United States, while 48 percent were born outside of the country (table 2.1). When breaking down the Asian population by ethnicity, the Pacific Islander students are more likely than students of all other ethnic groups (with the exception of the Japanese) to be native-born (86 percent of the Pacific Islander students are U.S. nath e;4), dhile Southeast Asian students are far more likely to have been foreign-born (85 percent).0 Although the eighth-grade students could not be disaggregated into genealogical generations, an attempt was made to divide students into generations using the students' and parents' places of birth. In this scheme, first generation refers to a student who was born in another country and who then immigrated to the United States. On the other hand, a second generation student is one who was born in the United States, but who has one or both parents who are foreign-born. Third generation students are U.S.-born, from U.S.-born parents. These definitions, of course, may include many genealogical generations within the third generation. As displayed in table 2.2, almost one-half (48 percent) of Asian eighth graders are first generation, while slightly less than one-third (31 percent) are second generation. 17The differences in percentages of native-born Pa:jfic Islander and Japanese students, although large, are not statistically significant. About 73 percent of the Asian eighth graders come from homes in which a non-English language is spoken, and who are therefore described as language minority (LM).18 A significant majority (84 percent) of the foreign-born Asian students are LM, and more than one-half (60 percent) of the native-born Asian students are LM as well (table 2.3). The Pacific Islander students are less likely to be LM than students of other ethnicities.19 Only 39 percent of the Pacific Islander students come from a home where a non-English language is spoken.20 18Students were asked \"Is any language other than English spoken in your home?\" Although their ability to speak in the non-English language may be quite limited, exposure to this language has, at the very least, made these students more bilingual than those who come from monolingual households. 19As seen in the table, the percentage of \"Other Asian\" students who are LM falls between the percentages of Pacific Islander and Japanese students who are LM. However, the small number of these students prevents the difference between them and students of other ethnicities from being statistically significant. 20The lifference between the percentages of Japanese and Korean students who are LM is not statistically significant. The majority (51 percent) of the Asian students use their home language with only moderate frequency, and only 14 percent indicate that they frequently use their home language (figure 2.4). Students who use their home language more frequently indicate a higher home language proficiency; however, even among the most frequent users of a non-English language, less than one-third report that they possess a high proficiency (figure 2.5). This relationship holds even after controlling for SES. Some researchers have found that bilingual children consistently underrate their ability to communicate in their home language, because they have been frequently corrected by their parents as to the proper form and style of their language.21 Part of the problem arises when students attempt to translate English words that have no literal equivalent in their home language. Even though students may use this \"made up\" word in a grammatically correct manner, their elders may interpret this usage as improper.   The Filipino students are more likely to report that they are highly proficient in their home language, when compared to Southeast Asian, Chinese, and South Asian students. Nineteen percent of the Filipino students indicate a high home language proficiency (table 2.4). By contrast, 8 percent of the Southeast Asian, 7 percent of the Chinese, and 3 percent of the South Asian students report a high home language proficiency. The percentage of students of other ethnicities who report a high home language proficiency fall in between these extremes, and are not significantly different from each other or from the five ethnic groups mentioned above. Even after adjusting for socioeconomic status, Asian LM students from the various ethnic groups have different assessments of their English language proficiency. The Korean and South Asian students are more likely to indicate a high proficiency while Chinese and Southeast Asian students are less likely to do so. Specifically, 75 percem of the Korean students and 78 percent of the South Asian students indicate a high English proficiency (table 2.5). By contrast, only 59 percent of the Chinese and 56 percent of the Southeast Asian students report a high English proficiency. Fifty-eight percent of the Japanese students leport a high English proficiency, but too few weir sampled to establish a statistically significant difference. Students of other ethnicities fall in between these extremes and the differences in their percentages are not statistically significant, no matter with whom they are compared. Although the relationship between English and home language proficiency at first glance seems a bit unusual, it has been noticed elsewhere. As debate on the subject continues, many experts of linguistics ascribe to theories of additive and subtractive bilingua1ism.22 An cxample of additive bilingualism would be the learning of a second language by a person already proficient in the culturally dominant language. However, subtractive bilingualism is more often experienced by ethnic minorities when their home language is replaced by the more \"prestigious\" national language of their host country. Cummins has also suggested a threshold hypothesis for language learning that distinguishes between proficient, partial, and limited bilinguals. He theorizes that proficient bilinguals have reached proficiency in both languages; partial bilinguals are in the process of adding, replacing, or subtracting a language and are proficient in one language while limited in another; and limited bilinguals lose proficiency in one language before gaining proficiency in another. Furthermore, Cummins theorizes that limited bilinguals, like Lambert's subtractive bilinguals, may never become proficient in either language. elationship between language proficiency, birthplace, and residence in the United States Asian students who are natives of the United States, not surprisingly, are more highly proficient in English than their foreign-born peers. For example, 80 percent of the native-born students report a high English proficiency, compared with 58 percent of the foreign-born students (figure 2.8). However, as the length of students' residency increases, the percentage indicating a high English proficiency rises as well. Only 31 percent of the Asian students who have resided in the United States for less than six years were highly English proficient, as opposed to about twothirds of the students who have been here for more than 9 years (figure 2.9). In fact, the percentage of foreign-born students who have resided in the United States for more than 9 years and who are highly proficient in English is not significantly different from the percentage of native-born students with a high English proficiency. (Because of the relationship between English proficiency and SES, the estimates in this sectionthose conveying the relationships between proficiency and residencyhave been adjusted to control for the effects of SES.) A relationship also exists between the home language proficiency of Asian eighth graders and the length of the students' ttsidence in the country. More than 60 percent of both the native and foreign-born Asian LM students have a low home language proficiency, with the exception of foreign-born students who have recently arrived (table 2.6). Only 34 percent of the Asian LM students living in the country for less than six years indicate that they have a low home language proficiency, while one-half report a moderate proficiency. By contrast, more than 60 percent of foreign-born Asian LM students who have resided in the United States longer than six years have a low proficiency, and only 25 percent have a moderate home language proficiency.  Relationship between parent' s and student' s language proficiency A relationship exists between Asian student's and parent's English proficiency, with parents who are more proficient in the English language being more likely to have children who are also highly proficient. For instance, 75 percent of the Asian LM students with a highly proficient parent are also highly proficient in English, compared with 54 percent of the children who have a high proficiency, but whose parents have a low proficiency (table 2.7). Similarly, 24 percent of the students with highly proficient parents have a moderate English proficiency, compared to 36 percent of the students with parents of low proficiency. (These estimates have been adjusted to control for SES.) "}, {"section_title": "Relationship of Asian Underachievement to Ethnicity and Language Proficiency", "text": "Ethnicity No significant differences could be discerned among the LM students of various Asian ethnic subgroups on the reading or math achievement tests. Although the percentage of students who could not achieve the basic reading level varied from a high of 38 percent for Pacific Islanders to a low of 16 percent for the South Asians, due to small samples, these differences were not significant (table 2.8). In math achievement, almost half (43 percent) of the Pacific Islander LM students were unable to achieve the basic math level, while South Asian and Southeast Asian LM students had the lowest percentages of their populations unable to achieve the basic math level (16 percent and 15 percent, respectively). Again, however, due to small sample sizes, these differences were not statistically significant.

As English proficiency among the Asian LM students increased, the percentage of those underachieving in reading decreased. Sixty-three percent of the least proficient students failed to reach the basic level of the reading test, while only 19 percent of the highly proficient students were unable to reach that level (table 2.8). The relationship between English proficiency and a failure to achieve the basic math achievement level was not significant among Asian LM students. (Estimates of the relationships between proficiency and underachievement have been adjusted to control for SES.) \nOverall, the same percentage of Hispanic LM and non-LM students were unable to achieve the basic level in reading (about 30 percent) and in math (about 36 percent). Even when controlling for socioeconomic status and nativity, this similarity remains. However, proficiency in the English language among Hispanic LM students was strongly related to reading and math achievement. As English proficiency increased, the percentage of those who failed to achieve the basic levels decreased. Sixty-nine percent of the low English proficient Hispanic students failed to reach the basic level on the reading test, compared with 34 percent of the moderately proficient and 28 percent of the highly proficient. On the math test, 58 percent of the low English proficient Hispanic students failed to achieve the basic level, compared with 37 percent of the moderately proficient and 35 percent of the highly proficient (figure 3.11).

Although 12 percent of high SES students could not achieve the basic reading level, more than three times that percentage of low SES students (38 percent) could not reach the basic level (figure 2.11). A similar pattern emerged on the math test: 14 percent of the Asian students with high SES did not achieve the basic level, compared with 39 percent of those with low SES. The relationship between SES and reading achievement prevails for Asian students even when controlling for English proficiency. In particular, among LM eighth graders with moderate English proficiency, 43 percent of the low SES students failed to achieve the basic reading level, in contrast to 24 percent of high SES students (table 2.9). The same pattern exists for math achievement, where SES has a strong relationship to achievement. 4f;  \nGreater proportions of Hispanic students with higher SES achieved above the basic levels on both tests than those with lower SES.

A similar pattern emerged on the math test: 22 percent of the high SES students did not achieve the basic level, compared with 42 percent of those with low S ES . The relationship between SES and achievement persisted among Hispanic students even when English proficiency was held constant. For example, among the LM eighth graders with high English proficiency, 32 percent of the low SES students failed to achieve the basic reading level, compared with only 16 percent of the high SES students (table 3.8). The same was true for math achievement.

"}, {"section_title": "Teacher Identification of Asian Eighth Graders", "text": "Two teachers for each eighth grader included in NELS:88 were also surveyed. Each teacher was asked to indicate whether or not the student was a language minority student (LM) and also whether or not the student had limited English proficiency (LEP).23 This study combined the two teachers' responses into one \"teacher identification\"; students were teacher-identified as LM if one of the following occurred: (a) both teachers indicated that a student is LM, (b) only one teacher responded to the question and indicated that the student is LM, or (c) one teacher indicated that the student is LM and the other teacher did not. Thus, if at least one teacher identified the student as LM, the student was teacher-identified as LM. The same processes determined the teacher identification of LEP: if at least one teacher indicated that the student was LEP the student was teacher-identified as LEP; the description used in this report is non-excluded teacher-identified LEP (NETIL),24 In this section, the teachers' evaluations of the eighth grader's LM and LEP status are compared with the students' report of whether or not a second language was spoken in the home and the students' self-reported English language proficiency. The results indicate that teachers and students often have different views of the LM and LEP status of the students. 23As explained in the first chapter, in the NELS:88 Base-Year survey, students were excluded if they were thought to not have enough English skills to fill out the survey forms and tests. Therefore, the most limited English proficient students were not included. 24See appendix B for further information about these two variables."}, {"section_title": "s", "text": "Recognized and nonrecognized language minority students Approximately 73 percent of Asian students indicate that a non-English language is spoken in the home. However, only 27 percent of Asian students were teacher-identified as being language minority, indicating that many more students are from bilingual homes than teachers are aware (figure 2.12). Most, but not all, of the Asian students who are from monolingual homes were identified by their teachers as not being LM: about 28 percent of Asian students indicate that only English is spoken at home, and all but 1 percent of these students weir identified by teachers as not being language minority. For this analysis, when students and teachers have a different assessment of whether or not the student is LM, no matter the nature of the disparity, those students were called nonrecognized language minority in order to relate a disparity between the student and teacher responses. Overall, 52 percent of the Asian students were in agmement with their teachers about the student's language minority status (26 percent LM and 26 percent non-LM), while 48 percent disagreed (47 percent were from bilingual homes and teacher-identified as non-LM and 1 percent were from English-only homes and teacher-identified as LM). In order to distinguish between the 73 percent of Asian students who are LM and the 26 percent of Asian students who are not only LM but also teacher-identified as such, the term recognized LM is used. Similarly, recognized non-LM denotes those non-LM students who were teacher-identified as non-language minority. The remaining students, as noted above, are termed nonrecognized LM. The English language proficiency of the recognized LM Asian students was compared with the proficiency of the nonrecognized LM students. In general, the nonr cognized LM students are more proficient in English than the recognized LM students. For example, 77 percent of the nonrecognized LM students indicate having a high English proficiency, while 51 percent of the recognized LM students report the same proficiency level (figure 2.13). Similarly, only 2 percent of the nonrecognized LM students indicate a low proficiency, as opposed to 8 percent of the recognized LM students.25 Non-excluded teacher-identified limited English proficient students About 6 percent of the Asian student body included in the survey were defined by at least one of their teachers as having limited English proficiency. Nevertheless, among these students, 33 percent indicate that they are highly Enflish proficient, and 46 percent indicate a moderate proficiency level (figure 2.14). By comparison, among language minority non-NETIL students, 70 percent consider themselves highly proficient, and 28 percent moderately proficient. 25Students who responded that only English was spoken in the home were not asked to assess their language skills. In this instance, therefore, the nomrcognized LM category does not include the 4 percent of students who stated that they came from a monolingual home and whose teachers defined them as LM. Because the more severely limited English proficient students were excluded from the NELS:88 Base-Year Survey, the degree to which students and teachers disagree about their LEP status is probably overestimated in this study. Nonetheless, a more detailed examination of the differences between students and teacher evaluation of language skills would be of interest, especially in light of the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of bilingual education programs. "}, {"section_title": "Bilingual instruction", "text": "In their first two years of school in the United States, less than 6 percent of the Asian LM students received instruction in a language other than English.26 Although these estimates apply only to students who come from bilingual homes, both students who were born in the United States and those students who am foreign-born and who may have received education elsewhere are included. Therefore, \"first two years of school in the United States\" might as easily apply to first and second grade, as to fifth and sixth grade. Only a small proportion of Asian LM eighth graders received bilingual instruction during their first two years of American schooling. About 6 percent of students were taught language arts (literature, reading, or writing) in a non-English language, and 5 percent received instruction in mathematics in another language (table 2.10). In addition, 5 percent received bilingual instruction in other subjects (science, U.S. History, government, or social studies). 76Students were not specifically asked whether these subjects were taught in their native languages, but rather if they were taught in English or in a language other than English. A third possible response was \"subject not taught.\" See appendix A for more detail on the wording of the question. Among Asian eighth graders, socioeconomic status is related to bilingual instruction in language arts, but is not related to math or other subject instruction. Thirteen percent of the LM students with low SES itceived bilingual language arts, compared with 4 percent of high SES LM students. Although only language arts instruction seemed related to SES, all subsequent estimates in this section have been adjusted for SES. Recognized language minority students were more likely than nonrecognized LM students to have received bilingual instruction in math courses. Eight percent of the Asian recognized LM students received bilingual math instruction, whereas 4 percent of the Asian nonrecognized LM students received this instruction. No significant differences could be discerned between the Asian NETIL st.t.lents and non-NETIL students in relation to bilingual instruction. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, there were no variations among the proportions of students receiving bilingual instruction who had different levels of English proficiency. Language minority students' involvement in language assistance programs LM students were also asked if they had ever been enrolled in an Er.glish language assistance program.27 Twenty-four percent of the Asian LM students responled that they had been enrolled in such a program. Of those enrolled in these programs, a large proportion (69 percent) had been enrolled in the first, second, or third grades; 40 percent had been enrolled in the fourth, fifth, or sixth grades; and 20 percent had been enr3lled in the seventh or eighth grades (table 2.11). Asian LM students with low SES were more likely to have been enrolled in an assistance program than high SES Asian LM students. Specifically, 36 percent of low SES students had been enrolled in such a program, compared with 15 percent of high SES students. Because of this relationship, all subsequent estimates in this section have been adjusted to control for the effect of SES. Among Asian eighth graders, recognized LM students were more likely to have been enrolled in a language assistance program than nonrecognized LM students (31 percent versus 18 percent). Similarly, Asian NETIL students were more likely than Asian non-NETIL students to have been enrolled in an assistance program (41 percent versus 21 percent). The differences among these groups with regard to when they were enrolled in the programs, although large, are not significant. As Asian LM students' English proficiency increases, the likelihood of their having attended a language assistance program decreases. For example, 58 percent of the students with a low English proficiency had been enrolled in an assistance program, whereas 36 percent ofi, the moderately proficient and 16 percent of the highly English proficient students had been enrolled. In addition, students with a high English proficiency are more likely than those with a moderate proficiency to have been enrolled in the program during their primary grades. Specifically, 86 percent of the students with high proficiency who attended an assistance program had been enrolled in first, second or third grade, while only 10 percent were emohed in seventh or eighth grade. By contrast, 59 percent of the students with moderate proficiency had been enrolled in the first through third grades, and 22 percent had been enrolled during the seventh or eighth. 27To examine the exact wording of the question, sec appendix A. \nDuring their first 2 years in school in the United States, less than 10 percent of the Hispanic LM students received instruction in a language other than English (table 3.9).39 Although these estimates apply only to students who come from bilingual homes, both students who were born in the United States and those who welt: foreign-born are included. Therefore, \"first 2 years of school in the United States\" might as easily apply to first and second grade as to fifth and sixth grade. A small proportion of Hispanic LM eighth graders reuived bilingual instruction in their first 2 years of American schooling. About 8 percent of e Hispanic students weie taught language arts (United States literature, reading, or writing) in a non-English language, and 8 percent received instruction in mathematics in another language. Six percent received bilingual instruction in other subjects (science, United States history, government, or social studies). A clear relationship exists between socioeconomic status and whether or not students received bilingual instruction. About 10 percent of the low SES Hispanic LM students received bilingual instruction, in comparison with less than 3 percent of the high SES Hispanic LM students. Because of the relationship between SES and bilingual instruction, estimates in the rest of this section have been adjusted to control for SES. 39Students wcrc not sp, ;fically asked whether these subjects were taught in their native languages, but rather if they were taught in Ern c r in a language othe,.. than English. A third possible response was \"subject not taught.\" See appendix A more detail on the wording of thc question. Native-born students were less likely to have been instructed in a non-',nglish language than foreign-born students. Specifically, 7 percent of native-born Hispanic LM students were taught language arts in a non-English language, and 5 percent were taught math in a non-English language (table 3.9). By contrast, 12 percent of the foreign-born Hispanic LM students were instructed in language arts, and 16 percent were taught math in a non-English language. Among Hispanic eighth grauers, recognized LM students were more likely than nonrecognized students to have received math instruction in a non-English language (9 percent versus 6 percent). However, similar differences for langtrge arts instruction and other subjects could not be discerned. After adjusting for SES, no differences could be observed between Hispanic NETIL and non-NETIL students in bilingual instruction. Hispanic LM students with a higher self-reported English proficiency were less likely than those with a moderate or low proficiency to have received English or math instruction in a non-English language. For instance, 6 percent of the highly English proficient students received bilingual language arts instruction, compared with 13 percent of the students with a moderate English proficiency. Likewise, 4 percent of the highly English proficient students received bilingual math instruction, as opposed to 12 percent of the students with moderate proficiency and 38 percent of the students with low proficiency. Language minority students' involvement in language assistance programs LM students were also asked if they had ever been enrolled in an English language assistance program.'\" Twenty percent of the Hispanic LM students responded that they had been enrolled in such a program (table 3.10). Again, LM students with low SES were more likely to have been enrolled in an assistance program than LM students with moderate or high SES. Specifically, 25 percent of low SES Hispanic students had taken advantage of such a program, in comparison with 12 percent of high SES Hispanic students. In general, a large proportion (66 percent) were enrolled in the first, second or third grades. Almost one-half (45 percent) were enrolled in the fourth, fifth oi sixth grades, and 19 percent were enrolled in the seventh or eighth grades. !Because of the relationship between SES and enroilment in language assistance programs, the following estimates have been adjusted to control for SES.) Hispanic recognized LM students were more likely to have been enrolled in a language assistance program than Hispanic non:ecognized LM students (26 percent versus 14 percent). Similarly, NET1L students were more likely than non-NETIL students to have been enrolled in an assistance program (43 percent versus 17 percent). In addition, NETIL students' nvoivement in such programs tended to be more recent than non-NETIL students. Among the Hispanic NETIL students who had participated in an assistance program, 46 percent were enrolled in the first through third grade and 38 percent in the fourth through sixth grade. By contrast, 74 percent of the Hispanic non-NETIL students who participated in a language program had been involved,. during the first through third grade and 39 percent during the fourth through sixth grade. Again, as students' English proficiency increases, the likelihood of their having attended a language assistance program decreases. For example, one-half of those Hispanic eighth graders with low English proficiency had been enrolled in a language assistance program, in comparison with 14 percent of those who are highly proficient. 40To examine the exact wording of the question, see appendix A. After adjusting for SES, LM students who weie not recognized as language minority failed the reading and math tests in similar proportions as those LM students who were recognized as language minority (tabie 3.11). On the reading test, 27 percent of the nonrecognized LM students failed to achieve the basic level, crnvared with 33 percent of the recognized LM students. On the math test, 33 percent of the nonn.cognized LM students failed to reach the basic level, while 37 percent of the recognized LM students did the same. It is interesting to note that the reading failure rates between nonrecognized LM students and non-LM students did not differ significantly. Hispanic eighth graders who came from homes where only English was spoken (non-LM) but who were identified as language minority (nonrecognized LM) were more apt to fail to achieve the basic math level (45 percent) than those students who were LM but who were not recognized as sucii (33 percent).

Not surprisingly, the same pattern that was observed between language minority status and student-reported English proficiency is also seen between teacher-identified LM status and reading achievement; that is, those students who are recognized as being LM are less proficient in English than those who are LM but who are not recognized as such. On the reading achievement test, Asian recognized LM students failed to achieve the basic reading level at a higher rate (30 percent) than Asian LM students who were not recognized as LM (17 percent).

The remaining Even after adjusting for SES, there are some differences among the percentages of students of different ethnic groups intending to enroll in an academic program. Filipino and Pacific Islandev idents are less likely to intend to enroll in an academic program when compared to South Asian students. For example, about 30 percent of the Filipino and 26 percent of the Pacific Islander students intend to take college preparatory courses, compared with about 50 percent of the South Asian students. Although a similar proportion of Japanese students (48 percent) as South Asian students intend to enroll in an academic program, too few Japanese students were included to establish statistical significance. The percentages of students of other ethnicides intending to enroll in an academic program fall between the high and low extremes, with no statistically significant differences. Socloeconomic status, in addition to being related to intended high school program, is also related to the Asian students' confidence in their graduating from high school. Overall, the majority of the Asian students (78 percent) are \"very sure I'll graduate\" from high school (figum 2.16). Twenty-one percent indicate \"I'll probably graduate\" and one percent report they probably or surely will not graduate from high school.28 Although the majority of all three socioeconomic classes are very sure of their graduation, the size of that majority increases as SES increases. For instance, while 68 percent of low SES students are very sure of their graduation, 76 percent of medium SES and 86 percent of high SES students believe similarly (table 2.14). The South and Southeast Asians are very sure of their graduation from high school, particularly in comparison with Filipino and Pacific Islander students. Specifically, 88 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of South and Southeast Asian students feel very sure of their graduation, while 72 percent and 67 percent, respectively, of Filipino and Pacific Islander students are that confident of their high school graduation. Although the percentage of Japanese students who are very confident of their graduation (72 percent) is similar to the percentage of Filipino and Pacific Islander students, too few Japanese students were sampled to establish statistical significance. Students of other ethnicities fall within those percentages and their differences are not statistically significant. Even after controlling for SES, some differences appear between the various Asian ethnic groups. Filipino and Pacific Islander students are less likely than students of most other ethnicities to plan on attaining an advanced degree (28 percent and 21 percent, respectively).30 In sharp contrast, for example, the majority of the Korean students (56 percent) have an advanced degree as their goal. The Pacific Islander students are more likely than students of all other ethnicities to discontinue their education after high school (22 percent have no educational plans for after high school); however, the difference between the Pacific Islander and Japanese students is not statistically significant. 29Students were asked, \"As things stand now, how far in school do you think you will get?\" 30The percentages of Filipino and Pacific Islander students planning to aztain an advanced degree is statistically different from those of the Korean, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Chinese students. but not different from those of Japanese and Other Asian students. High school plans of LM students English language proficien, y is related to students' decisions regarding high school even after controlling for SES. Asian students with high English proficiency are more likely than Asian students with lower proficiencies to plan on an academic program and less likely to have \"other\" or unknown plans.

By contrast, 69 percent of the moderately proficient LM students are very sure, while 31 percent are probably sure. A similar pattern held for NETIL and non-NETIL Asian students.

A greater percentage of those Asian students who are not language minority (that is, monolingual) than both the recognized and nonrecognized L I Asian students have no plans for further education after high school graduation. Specifically, 12 percent of the recognized non-LM students have no post-secondary educational plans, compared with 6 percent of the nonrecognized LM students and 4 percent of the recognized LM students.\nAlthough similar percentages of NETIL and non-NETIL Hispanic eighth graders plan to attain a graduate degree, a smaller percentage of the NETIL students intend to attain a college degree.

Moreover, some relationship between SES and parental expectations is found among Asian families, with high SES parents more likely than those of low SES to expect their children to receive an advanced degree. For example, 59 percent of the high SES students have parents who expect them to attain an advanced degree, compared with 25 percent of low SES students. Similarly, only 2 percent of high SES students have parents who expect them to receive only a high school diploma, in contrast to 15 percent of low SES stuwnts.

Comparisons betikeen the parents of recognized LM, nonrecognized LM, and recognized non-LM students revealed few significant differences except for their expectations for their children attaining advanced degrees. The parents of almost one-quarter (23 percei.t) of the monolingual Asian students expect their children to receive advanced degrees. By contrast, 49 percent of both the recognized and nonrecognized LM Asian students have parents who expect them to attain that level of education.

In contrast, 32 percent of those with other or unknown plans did not achieve the basic reading level, and 28 percent the basic math level (figure 2.18). A relationship also existed between confidence in high school graduation and achievement. In both subject areas, the more confident Asian students performed better than the less confident ones. In particular, among the students who are very sure that they would graduate, 21 percent were unable to achieve the basic reading level, and 20 percent the bag:c math level (figure 2.19). By contrast, 34 percent of those who were probably sure they wopy te failed to achieve the basic reading level, and 37 percent the basic math level.  Asian students who have no plans for further education after high school were more likely than those who plan to attend college to fail to achieve the basic reading and math levels. On the reading test, 45 percent of those with no future educational plans were unable to achieve the basic level (figure 2.20). By contrast, about 21 percent or less of those envisioning a college education or an advanced degree failed to achieve the basic reading level.

However, only slightly more than one-quarter are identified by at least one of their teachers as being Language Minority.

Only 6 percent of Asian students had received bilingual education during their first two years of American schooling; eout onequaner of the Asian students had been involved in a language assistance program. Only a small proportion of the Asian LM students indicate that they have a high proficiency in their ethnic language. On the other hand, the majority of Asian LM students feel that they have a high English proficiency. Even among the Asian NETIL students, about one-third indicate that they have a high English proficiency. About the same proportion , Asian eighth graders were born in the United States as were born in another country. Not surprisingly, most of the foreign-born Asian students (84 percent) are LM. However, a significant proportion of native-born Asian students (60 percent) are LM as well. Native-born students have the advantage of being more proficient than the foreign-born, but foreign-born students living in the United States for longer pefods of time are more likely to have greater proficiency than those with shorter residzacies. Asian LM students with a low English proficiency are less likely to plan on enrolling in an academic high school program and are more likely to have no or \"other\" plans than their more proficient counterparts. They are also less likely to be very confident of their graduation from high school. In general, Asian students with intentions for an academic program in high school have a lower failure rate on both the reading and math tests than those with unknown plans. Those with a high confidence in giaduation also tend to perform better on the tests. As a whole, Asian LM students are more likely than Asian non-LM students to have the goal of pursuing an advanced degree after college and are less likely to have no plans for further education after their high school graduation. Overall, Asian students with no aspirations for further education after high school failed to achieve basic achievement levels at higher rates than Asian students with plans for college. Socioeconomic status played a large role in many of the characteristics examined. For example, among Asian eighth graders, socioeconomic status is positively related to English proficiency, high aspirations for further education, confidence in high school graduation, high parental expectations for the students' further education, and achievement on the standardized tests. Simply coming from a bilingual home does not affect achievement for Asian students, as non-LM and LM students had basically the same failure rate on both the reading comprehension and math tests. Even after controlling for socioeconomic status and nativity, this similarity remains. English proficiency, however, is positively related to achievement on the reading test, with the more proficient students having a lower failure rate. English proficiency is not related to achievement on the math test. Among the four ethnic groups, Mexican-American and Puerto Rican students have the lowest socioeconomic status. Fifty-seven percent of the Mexican-American students and 47 percent of the Puerto Rican students are in the lowest SES quartile (figure 3.2). Cubans and \"other\" Hispanics, by contrast, are primarily of middle or high socioeconomic status. Slightly more than 20 percent of both the Cuban and \"other\" Hispanic students are in the highest SES quartile. Because of the differences in socioeconomic status among the various ethnic groups, the estimates for ethnic groups throughout this report have been adjusted to control for SES. Some variables other than ethnicity have also been adjusted for SES, and when these adjusted estimates are used, the reader will be alerted.32 A large majority (83 percent) of the Hispanic students were born in the United States ( figure  3.3). Although the eighth-grade students could not be disaggregated into genealogical generations, an attempt was made to divide students into generations using the students' and parents' places of birth. In this scheme, first generation refers to a student who was born in another country and who then immigrated to the United States. A second generation student is one who was um in the United States, but who has one or both parents who were foreign-born. Third generation students will be U.S.-born, and they will have U.S.-born parents. This definition, of course, may include many genealogical generations within the third generation. As displayed in table 3.1, only 17 percent of the Hispanic eighth graders are first generation, v:hile about 41 percent are second generation, and another 42 percent are third generation. 32'The adjustment removes the differences among students of different ethnic groups (or the appropriate adjusted variable) attributable to differences in SES. See the technical appendix for a description of the adjustment procedure.  \nAbout three-fourths of the Hispanic student population come from bilingual families. Even so, only 39 percent are identified by at lezst one of their teachers as Language Minority students. About 8 percent of the non-excluded F:spanic student body are defined by at least one of their teachers as being Limited English Proficient. Less than 10 percent of the Hispanic students received instruction in a non-English language during their first 2 years of American schooling; about 20 percent were enrolled in a language assistance program. The majority of Hispanic LM students indicate that they are not very proficient in their home language. Even among the most frequent users of their home language, about one-half of the Hispanic students indicate only a moderate proficiency in that language. Conversely, the majority of the Hispanic LM students (64 percent) state that they have a high English language proficiency. Interestingly, about one-third of the Hispanic students identified as LEP students by their teachers indicate that they havc a high English proficiency. Most of the Hispanic eighth graders (83 percent) were born in the United States. Almost all (92 percent) of the fottign-born Hispanic students are LM; about three-fourths of the native-born Hispanic students are LM. Not surprisingly, nativity is related to English proficiency. Almost three-fourths of the native-born Hispanic LM students are highly proficient in English, whereas less than one-half of the foreign-born Hispanic LM students are highly proficient. However, students living in the United States for longer periods are more likely to have greater English proficiency than those with shorter residencies. Similar percentages of LM and non-LM Hispanic eighth graders failed to achieve the basic levels of performance on the reading and math tests. A ineng Hispanic LM students, those with low proficiency in English failed to achieve at a much higher rate than did students with high proficiency. Socioeconomic status is positively related to English proficiency, with Hispanic LM students from high SES backgrounds being more likely to have a higher English proficiency than those from low SES backgrounds. For Hispanic students, socioeconomic status is also related to high aspirations for high school and further education, greater confidence in high school graduation, and high parental expectations of the students' further education. Irk addition, Hispanic students of high SES backgrounds failed to achieve the basic reading and math performance levels at a lower rate than did students of low SES. Hispanic LM students with a high English proficiency are more likely than those vt a low proficiency to plan on enrolling in an academic program while in high schoo'_ and Lid more confident of their graduation from high school. They are also more likely to indicate that they intend to continue their education after college graduation and are less likely to have no educational plans after high school graduation than their less proficient peers. Overall, confidence in high school graduation was related to reading and math achievement, with the more confident Hispanic students having a lower rate of failure on the tests. Hispanic students with no specific plans for their high school program failed to achieve the basic achievement levels at higher rates than did Hispanic students with plans to enroll in an academic program. Likewise, Hispanic students with no plans for further education after their high school education failed to achieve the basic levels in both tests at a higher rate than those Hispanic students who planned to go on to college after high school.

More frequent users indicate a higher home language proficiency; however, even among the most frequent users of a non-English language, about one-half of the students indicate that they have only a moderate proficiency (figure 3.6). This relationship remains even after controlling for SES. Some researchers have found that bilingual children consistently underrate their ability to communicate in their home language, because they are frequently corrected by their parents as to the proper form and style of their home language.34 Part of the problem arises when students attempt to translate English words that have no equivalent in their home language. Even though students may use this \"made up\" word in a grammatically correct manner, their elders may interpret this usage as improper.

On the other hand, Hispanic LM students who are moderately proficient in their home language are more likely than those with a low or high proficiency to assess their English proficiency at a lower level. For instance, 58 percent of the students with a moderate home language proficiency report a high English proficiency, and 41 percent report a moderate English proficiency. However, 69 percent of those qudents with either a low or high home language proficiency indicate that they are highly proficient in English.  Although this relationship between English and home language proficiency at first glance seems a bit unusual, it has been noticed elsewhere. As debate on the subject continues, many experts of linguistics ascribe to theories of additive and subtractive bilingualism.35 An example of t.:dditive bilingualism would be the learning of a second language by a person already proficient in the culturally dominant language. However, subtractive bilingualism is more often experienced by ethnic minorities when their home language is replaced by the more \"prestigious\" national language of their host country. Cummins has also suggested a threshold hypothesis for language learning that distinguishes between proficient, partial, and limited bilinguals. He reports that proficient bilinguals have reached proficiency in both languages; partial bilinguals are in the process of adding, replacing, or subtracting a language and are proficient in one language while limited in another; and limited bilinguals lose proficiency in one language before gaining proficiency in another. Furthermore, Cummins theorizes that limited bilinguals, like Lambert's subtractive bilinguals, may never become proficient in either language. Although there are no differences noted among ethnic groups in lylw students assess their English language proficiency, when comparing Mexican and Cuban students some slight differences in home language proficiency are apparent. F'or example, about 14 percent of both ethnic groups indicate a high home language proficiency (table 3.4). However, Cubans are more likely than Mexicans to indicate that they are moderately proficient iii their home language (57 percent versus 41 percent).36 35The theories of Lambert and Tucker (1972), Skutnabb-Kangas and Toukomaa (1979), and Cummins (1976,1978 are reviewed by D.P. Dolson in \"Bilingualism and Scholastic Performance: The Literature Revisited,\" NABE Journal, X (1985):1-35. 36The difference in the percentages of Cuban and Other Hispanic students indicating a moderate home language proficiency is also statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between language proficiency and socioeconomic status", "text": "Socioeconomic status is found to be strongly related to English proficiency among Hispanic LM students.

Likewise, less than 1 percent of high SES students indicate a low English proficiency, while 5 percent of the low SES students report this same English proficiency. Home language proficiency, on the other hand, decreases with increasing socioeconomic status among Hispanic LM students. However, the differences are not as great as they are for English proficiency. For example, 19 percent of low SES students indicate they are highly proficient in their home language, compared with 11 percent of high SES students. Thirty-six percent of low SES students have low proficiency in their home language, while 48 percent of high SES students indicate this same level of proficiency.  Relationship between language proficiency, birthplace, and residence in the United States Hispanic LM students who are natives of the United States, not surprisingly, are more proficient in English than their foreign-born peers. Specifically, 70 percent of the native-born Hispanic LM students have a high English proficiency, as opposed to 46 percent of the foreignborn Hispanic LM students (figure 3.8). However, as the length of students' residency increases, the percentage indicating a high English proficiency rises as well. In fact, the percentage of foreign-born students who have resided in the United States for more than 11 years and who are highly English proficient is not significantly different from that of native-born students with a high English proficiency (figure 3.9). (Because of the relationship between SES and English language proficiency, the estimates in the preceding and following paragraphs have been adjusted to control for SES.)

For example, 74 percent of the Hispanic nonrecognized LM students are highly proficient in English, as opposed to only 56 percent of the Hispanic recognized LM students ( figure 3.14). Similarly, only 1 percent of the nonrecognized LM eighth graders have a low English proficiency, compared with 6 percent of the recognized LM students.38 These results indicate that if the language minority status of studentY is determined solely by their teachers, a significant proportion of students who are from bilingual homes are not being evaluated as language minority. Furthermore, incluaing these nonrecognized I,M students with teacher-identified language minority students would significantly change an evaluation of the English proficiency level of language minority students. 38Students who responded that only English was spoken in the home were not asked to assess their language skills. In this instance, thcrefoic, the nonrecognized LM category does not include the 4 percent of students who stated that they came from a monolingual home and whose teachers defined them as language minority. Non-excluded teacher-identified limited English proficient students About 8 percent of the Hispanic eighth graders included in the sample are identified by at least one of their teachers as having limited English proficiency. However, among these students, more than one-third (36 percent) report that they have relatively high English proficiency, while 45 percent indicate moderate proficiency. By comparison, among Hispanic language minority non-NETIL students, 68 percent indicate they are highly proficient, and 30 peicent report moderate proficiency (figure 1.15). Because the more severely limited English proficient students were excluded from the NELS:88 Base-Year survey, the degree tc which students and teachers disagree about the student's LEP status is probably overestimated in this sty -wever, a more detailed examination of the differences between student and teacher eval.,;, Ith; anguage skills would be of interest, particularly in light of the ongoing debate about the eti .s of bilingual education programs.  "}, {"section_title": "Educational Aspirations of Hispanic Eighth Graders", "text": "High school plans Twenty-three percent of the Hispanic eighth graders plan to enroll in an academic program during their high school years, and a similar proportion of students (22 percent) plan to enroll in a vocational program. Eleven percent of the Hispanic students indicate they will participate in a general program, while 5 percent look forward to attending a specialized high school (such as a fine arts school). The remaining proportion of students do not know which high school program they will enter (figure 3A6).42 42This percentage also includes students who reported having \"other\" plans. To examine the exact wording of all questions used in the following sections, see appendix A. Most Hispanic studInts (71 percent) are very sure that they will graduate from high school. Twenty-six percent report that they will probably graduate, while 3 percent reply that they probably or surely will not graduate from high schooi (figure 3.17). Among Hispanic eighth graders, these aspiration patterns remain similar regardless of ethnicity. However, socioeconomic status is related to both the students' choices of high school program and their confidence in their eventual high school graduation. For example, far more high SES Hispanic students intend to enroll in an academic program (39 percent) than middle SES students (25 percent) or low SES students (17 percent) (table 3.12). In addition, low SES students are more likely than high SES students to be planning a vocational program (24 percent versus 15 percent). Finally, a larger percentage of low SES Hispanic students (44 percent) are unsure of their intended program in high school (or have made other plans) than either middle or high SES students (36 percent and 30 percent, respectively).  Although the majority of Hispanic eighth graders from all socioeconomic levels are very sure they will graduate, the size of that majority grows as SES increases. For example, 62 percent of low SES students are very sure that they will graduate, and 77 percent of middle SES students and 88 percent of high Si.'S students believe similarly (table 3,13). On the other hand, 5 percent of low SES students believe they probably or surely will not graduate. In contrast, only 2 percent of the middle SES students think they might not gyaduate, and not graduating is an idea that occurs to less than 1 percent of the high SES students. "}, {"section_title": "Future educational plans", "text": "With regard to educational plans after high school, 21 percent of the Hispanic eighth graders plan to continue their education after college; 33 percent plan to graduate from college; 17 percent plan to at least attend college; and 11 percent plan to attend a vocational or business school after high school g aduation (figure 3.18). About 18 percent of the Hispanic students intend to graduate from high school and have no intentions to pursue any further education.43 43Students were asked \"As things stand now, how far in school do you think you will get?\" Among Hispanic eighth graders, SES is related to students' further aspirations after high school. About 40 percent of high SES Hispanic students intend to attain a college degree, and 45 percent plan to continue their education after college (table 3.14). By contrast, less than one-third (28 percent) of the low SES Hispanic students plan to receive a college degree, and only 16 percent intend to continue their education after college. Similarly, only 3 percent of high SES students have no plans for further education after high school, while 23 percent of low SES students do not intend to continue their education after high school. Because students' high school education plans, confidence in high school graduation, and plans for further education are all related to their socioeconomic status, estimates in the following sections have beer adjusted to control for SES."}, {"section_title": "High school plans of LM students", "text": "English proficiency, as measured by Hispanic LM students' self-assessment, is slightly related to intended high school program, after taking socioeconomic status into account. For example, Hispanic LM eighth graders with a low English proficiency are less likely than those with a high proficiency to plan on an academic program (table 3.12). Specifically, 25 percent of the highl proficient students plan on an academic program, in comparison with 12 percent of the low proficient students. In addition, highly proficient students are less likely to hne \"other\" or unknown plans than students with a moderate proficiency (36 percent versus 42 percent). LM students' confidence in high school graduation NETIL students and those with a moderate English proficiency are less confident that they w:11 graduate from high school than Hispanic eighth graders who are more proficient in English. Among Hispanic NETIL students, only 56 percent are very sure of graduation, and 36 percent are probably sure (table 3.13). Among Hispanic non-NETIL students, on the other hand, 73 percent are very sure of their graduation, and 24 percent are probably sure. The confidence levels of the low and moderately proficient students mirror those of the NETIL students, while the highly English proficient students' feelings are similar to those of the non-NETIL students. Seventy-five percent of the highly proficient Hispanic students are very sure that they will graduate, and 22 percent are probably sure. In comparison, 62 percent of the moderately proficient Hispanic students are very sure that they will graduate, and 34 percent are probably sure.

A similar proportion (26 percent) expect their children to attend some college; 27 percent expect college graduation; and 23 percent expect their children to attain an advanced degree (table 3.15). Socioeconomic status is related to parental aspirations, with parents of high SES having greater ambitions for their children. For example, almost one-half (47 percent) of the Hispanic children with high SES are expected by their parents to achieve an advanced degree, compared with 15 percent of low SES Hispanic students. By contrast, 3 percent of high SES students are expected to only graduate from high school, as opposed to 25 percent of low SES students. \"For a review of some of the research on this subject, see R. Seginer, \"Parents' Educational Expectations and Children's Academic Achievements: A Literature Review,\" Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 29:1-23. After adjusting for SES, comparisons between the parents of NETIL and non-NETIL students, and among the parents of recognized LM, nonrecognized LM, and recognized non-LM students reveal very few significant differences. However, English proficiency is slightly related to parental expectations for postsecondary education. A smaller percentage of parents with low English proficient children than those with highly proficient children expect their children to graduate from college or attain an advanced degree. For example, 27 percent of the parents of highly English proficient Hispanic LM students expect their children to obtain a college degree, and an additional 26 percent expect them to receive a higher degree (figure 3.19). By contrast, only 15 percent of the parents of Hispanic LM students with a low English proficiency expect their children to graduate from college; another 16 percent expect a higher degree. Because of the small number of students described by this category (students of low proficiency whose parents expect an advanced degree), the difference between students of low and high proficiency who are expected to receive a higher degree is not statistically significant. However, the difference between students of moderate and high proficiency whose parents expect an advanced degree (20 percent versus 26 percent) is statistically significant.

In contrast, 35 percent of those with \"other\" or unknown plans did not achieve the basic reading level, and 40 percent the t math level (figure 3.20). Among Hispanic eighth graders, confidence in high school graduation and achievement on both tests were also related. For both reading and math, the more confident students performed better than the less confident students. For example, among Hispanic students who were very sure f their graduation, 26 percent were unable to achieve the basic reading level and 31 percent were unable to achieve the basic math level (figure 3.21). Forty percent and 45 percent of those who were probably sure of their graduation did not achieve the basic reading and math level, respectively. In sharp contrast to both of those groups, 62 percent of the Hispanic students who stated they probably or surely would not graduate failed to achieve the basic reading level, and 68 percent failed to achieve the basic math level.  Hispanic students with no plans for further education after high school were also more likely than those with plans to attend college to be unable to achieve the basic reading and math levels. On the reading test, 43 percent of those with no future educational plans failed to achieve the basic level. In comparison, no more than 30 per,:ent of those envisioning a college degree or an advanced degree failed to achieve the basic reading level (figure 3.22). On the math test, 52 petcent of the students with no plans for education after high school failed to attain the basic level. In contrast, 29 percent of those planning to obtain a college degree or higher failed to attain the basic math level. Parental aspirations for their children's education have an even stronger relationship to the students' achievement than do students' aspirations. Hispanic students whose parents expect them to graduate college or attain a higher degree were much more likely to achieve the basic reading level than Hispanic students whose parents have lower expectations. Specifically, only 15 percent of the Hispanic eighth giaders whose parents expect them to receive a college degree and 12 percent whose parents expect a graduate degree failed to achieve the basic reading level (figure 3.23). In contrast, 31 percent of the students whose parents expect only high school graduation did not attain the basic level of performance. On the math test, the pattern was similar. Thirty-nine percent of the Hispanic students whose parents expect only high school graduation failed to achieve the basic math level, while 23 percent of the Hispanic students whose parents expect a college degree and 16 percent of those whose parents expect an advanced degree did not achieve that level.

For example, although the proportion of native-born Asian students is far less than the proportion of native-born Hispanic students (52 percent versus 83 percent), the two populations reveal very similar language patterns. About three-quarters of all the Hispanic and Asian eighth graders are language minorities (73 percent of Asian students are LM; 77 percent of Hispanic students are LM) and the proportions of each group reporting a high, moderate, and low English proficiency are quite similar. In particular, about two-thirds of the students report a high English proficiency (Asians: 66 percent; Hispanics: 64 percent), not quite one-third report a moderate proficiency (Asians: 29 percent; Hispanics: 32 percent), and a small percent report a low English proficiency (Asians and Hispanics: 4 percent). The patterns of agreement between teachers and students when asked to indicate the students' language minority status are, again, quite similar when comparing the Asian and Hispanic populations. For over one-half of the students, teacher identification of the students' LM status match that of the students' (52 percent of Asian students agree with the teacher report of LM status; 55 percent of Hispanic students agree).

All data were drawn from the base-year survey, from the student, parent, and teacher components. All estimates for this sample were calculated using BYQWT, restricting the analysis to students who were self-identified as Asian/Pacific Islander or as Hispanic. The unit of analysis was always the student or student-parent or student-teacher pairs, thereby making the use of the student weight BYQWT appropriate. For more information on the NELS:88 surveys, interested readers should consult Inge ls, et al., National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988Base-Year: Student Component Data File Users' Manual (Chicago: National Opinion Research Center, 1989. Row variables were selected to describe student characteristics such as raceethnicity, SES, and nativity of the student and his/her parents. Most of these variables were taken directly from the student or parent data files. One notable exception is the socioeconomic status variable, which was a composite created by NCES, averaging the non-missing values of five standardized components: father's and mother':-; educational levels, father's and mother's occupations, and family income. The parent questionnaire was the primary source of these components; for students without parent data (8.1 percent), student data was substituted. There were a number of nativity and residency composites as well as several language proficiency and usage scale composites created from variables taken from the student and parent files. Language status composites were created from variables taken from the student and teacher files. Scales were created by combining responses to several items asked of the students and parents. The following tables show the composites created and the input variables and values used for each. For each of the language proficiency and usage scale composites, a factor analysis and a reliability analysis were performed to determine the feasibility of combining the items into a scale. Cronbach's alpha, shown in the upper right corner of the scale items' tables, is a measure of the internal consistency of a scale and is based on the average correlation of items within the scale; Cronbach's alpha has a possible range of zero to one.

"}, {"section_title": "Standard Errors", "text": "The NELS:88 sample, while representative and statistically accurate, was not a simple random sample. Students were initially selected within schools grouped within strata. Sampling rates for schools within different strata varied, resulting in better data for policy purposes, but at a cost to statistical efficiency. Hence, simple random techniques for the estimation of standard errors frequently underestimate the true standard errors for some estimates. To overcome this problem, standard errors for all estimates in this tabulation were calculated using the STRATTAB program, which uses a Taylor series approximation to calculate standard errors based upon complex survey designs.45 A version of this program is available from NCES upon request. The standard errors reported take into account the clustering in the sampling procedure; they are generally higher than standard errors calculated under the assumptions of simple random sampling. To compare estimates for separate subgroups, or to understand the quality of the estimates, standard errors are needed. Each estimate has an associated standard error and the standard errors vary in size as a function of sample size and the sample design. Hence, the standaid errors of the estimates for some small groups (e.g., Pacific Islander students) may be so large that the estimates should not be used. (While the estimates based on 30 or fewer cases were suppressed, the computer automatically produced estimates for subgroups with 31 or more cases.) The standard errors for all estimates used in this report have been reported in appendix C."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Generally, whether the statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability of inferring that a difference exists when in fact it does not. In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics a number of issues must be kept in mind. First, comparisons resulting in large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This is somewhat misleading, since the size of the t statistic depends not only on the observed differences in means or percentage being compared but also on the number of respondents in the categories used for comparison, and on the degree of variability among respondents within categories. A small difference compared across a large number of respondents could result in a large t statistic. Second, when multiple statistical comparisons are made on the same data it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference will be erroneously given. Even when there is no difference in the population, at an alpha-level of .05 there is still a 5 percent chance of declaring that an observed t value representing one comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of comparisons increases, the risk of making such an error in inference also increases. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple contrast was used. This method corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible contrasts (or nonredundant pairwise comparisons), where K is the number of categories. For example, since Hispanic ethnicity has four categories, K=4, and there are (4*3)/2=6 possible comparisons between the categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha-level for a single t test (for example, .05) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons, to give a new alpha that is corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made.
