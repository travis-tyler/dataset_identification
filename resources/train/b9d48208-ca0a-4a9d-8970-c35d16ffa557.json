[{"section_title": "", "text": "Instead of using cross-tabulations for control purposes in this report, a multivariate technique known as logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the simultaneous effect of a large number of variables on unemployment. The independent variables used in the logistic regression model are: degree field; place of employment or residence; years since receipt of Ph.D.; age when doctorate received; years of part-time experience; years of full-time experience; whether or not employed in April 1988; occupation in April 1988 (for employed individuals); employment sector in April 1988 (for employed individuals); parents' level of education; disability status; percent involuntarily out-offield in the 1988 occupation; foreign research experience; marital status; interaction between gender and marital status; interaction between gender and whether children are in the home; interaction between gender and race/ethnicity; and interaction between marital status and race/ethnicity. The logistic regression model was used to estimate the unemployment rate for a group of individuals who exhibited the same values on all of the independent variables except the one under consideration. For example, the observed unemployment rate for individuals with hearing disabilities was 3.0 percent, compared with a rate of 1.6 percent for non-disabled doctoral scientists and engineers; the respective standardized rates were 2.5 percent and 1.6 percent. Thus, factors listed above (other than whether the person had a hearing disability) explained some but not all of the observed difference between those with hearing disabilities and those without disabilities.

This information is of interest to individuals who are inor considering entering science and engineering, their advisors, and those responsible for programs serving them. The major questions addressed are: How high were unemployment rates for doctoral scientists and engineers in the early 1990s? The 1993 unemployment rate of 1.6 percent was the highest rate observed in the biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) between 1973 and 1995. However, the April 1993 unemployment rate for those with science and engineering doctorates was substantially below the total population rate of 7.1 percent. The 1995 doctoral unemployment rate of 1.5 percent was virtually unchanged from the 1993 rate, even though the unemployment rate in the total labor force declined considerably to 5.7 percent. How well can we predict unemployment rates in the doctoral science and engineering population? According to evaluations of past forecasts of the doctoral science and engineering job market, it is not now possibleand may never be possibleto forecast doctoral science and engineering unemployment rates with sufficient accuracy to be helpful in deciding whether or not to pursue doctoral-level careers in science and engineering, particularly in view of the long lead-time for obtaining this degree. If we can't predict unemployment rates, why is it worth asking who is unemployed? Even though it is not possible to predict total doctoral science and engineering unemployment rates, generalizations can be made about unemployment in this population. For example, in the mid-1980s, an examination of doctoral science and engineering unemployment trends would probably not have led to an accurate prediction of the 1995 unemployment rate, but could have correctly predicted that doctoral scientists and engineers would continue to experience unemployment rates below those of the general population. It is reasonable to hypothesize that there is also some stability in the relative levels of subgroup unemployment rates over time. Within the doctoral science and engineering population in 1993, who was most likely to be unemployed? Neither gender nor race/ethnicity had a statistically significant relationship with unemployment, when the other variables in this analysis were taken into account. However, having a hearing or mobility impairment or advanced age were associated with relatively high unemployment. Marital status and having children in the home have different effects on the unemployment status of the two sexes. For women, being married and having children were associated with relatively high unemployment rates; for men they were associated with relatively low unemployment rates."}, {"section_title": "Education-related decisions are important predictors of unemployment:", "text": "Age at completing the doctorate is strongly associated with unemployment. When controlling for other relevant variables, the unemployment rate ranged from 0.6 percent for those who received doctorates before age 26 to 5.8 percent for those who received doctorates at age 40 or older. Degree field is also important. In 1993, unemployment rates ranged from 0.6 percent for those with degrees in civil engineering to 2.5 percent for those with degrees in the geological and environmental sciences. Disruptions in full-time employment subsequent to receiving a doctorate increase significantly the chances of unemployment: Among those who were either unemployed or not in the labor force in 1988, the 1993 unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for those who were employed in April 1988. The unemployment rate for those who had completed their doctorates before 1988, but were not employed in that year, was 9.6 percentthe highest unemployment rate observed in the study. Unemployment decreases with the number of years of previous full-time employment, when other variables are controlled for. However, prior part-time employment is associated with above-average unemployment rates. Other career-related variables found to be related to unemployment in 1993 were: Among those employed in 1988, employment in the private-for-profit sector was associated with relatively high 1993 unemployment (2.6 percent). In contrast, prior employment in academia or the government was associated with low unemployment rates. Occupation in 1988 was also a factor in predicting 1993 unemployment. The observed rates ranged from under 0.4 percent for postsecondary teachers in the physical sciences and engineering in 1988 to 2.9 percent for chemists (excluding postsecondary teachers). In general, those employed as postsecondary teachers in 1988 had lower unemployment rates than individuals in allied fields who were not postsecondary teachers. Geographic location had a modest association with unemployment in the doctoral science and engineering population. Unemployment rates ranged from 0.3 percent in less populated states in the West North Central region (Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas) to 2.8 percent in California in 1993. This association remained even after controlling for other relevant variables. Have the factors affecting unemployment changed over time? There was a notable change between 1973 and 1993 in the association between gender and unemployment. In 1973, unemployment for men 2 was 0.9 percent versus 3.9 percent for women; in 1993, the rates were 1.6 and 1.8 percent, respectively. This mirrors a similar decrease in the gender unemployment gap in the general population. Being an older member of the labor force is more strongly associated with unemployment in 1993 than in 1973. Although field of degree has a modest relationship with unemployment in both 1973 and 1993, there is little consistency between the two years on fields with the highest unemployment rates. This is consistent with traditional economic theory that indicates markets tend toward equilibrium over time. For example, when demand for a particular skill is high, compensation for the skill increases, which, in turn, encourages more individuals to acquire the scarce skill, thereby reducing or eliminating the scarcity. For the other two career-related decisions examined (sector and place of employment/ residence), there was little difference between 1973 and 1993 in either the strength of the associations or the pattern of the unemployment rates. How well does the unemployment rate perform as an indicator of career outcomes compared to other possible indicators? The unemployment rate is viewed by economists as an indicator of the health of the economy. However, from the individual's perspective, unemployment is only one of several possible desirable or undesirable career outcomes, resulting from a combination of job opportunities, individual choices, and luck. For example, when individuals are unable to find suitable full-tim6 employment, they may decide to search for employment that is part-time and/or inconsistent with the level or field of their training. Because individual choices and job opportunities are themselves a function of many of the factors examined in this report, it is not surprising that the association between unemployment and the alternate measures of labor market stress (involuntary part-time employment and involuntary out-of-field employment) is weak."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Who is unemployed among those with doctoral degrees in science and engineering? This question is of interest to those who hold such degrees and those considering a doctorate in science and engineering. This information is also important to policy makers and administrators in the government, members of academia, and other individuals who are responsible for designing, implementing, and monitoring advanced education and career programs. To provide relevant information, data from the 1993 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) for individuals under the age of 76 with doctoral degrees in science and engineering from U.S. universities were analyzed. These 1993 results were also compared with data reported for 1973 in two National Academy of Sciences reports, Employment Status of Ph.D. Scientists and Engineers 1973and 1975and Doctoral Scientists and Engineers in the United States, 1973 Profile."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY", "text": "Three important limitations of this study need to be highlighted: Unemployment represents only a single possible outcome of career decisions. For employed individuals, a variety of job characteristics are of interestfor example, the nature of the work to be done, the work setting, the time demands, and the salary, prestige, and challenge of the position. A doctorate in science and engineering is not pursued simply to avoid unemployment but to obtain certain types of employment. Thus, a study of the factors affecting unemployment is only one of a series of studies of interest to individuals with doctoral degrees in science and engineering and those considering such degrees. This study focuses on individuals under the age of 76 with doctoral degrees in science and engineering from U.S. institutions.' Individuals not in the labor force (those neither working, seeking work, nor on lay-off) are excluded from this analysis.' This narrow focus permits an understanding of a population likely to differ significantly from the general population and from other subgroups within the science and engineering population. The multivariate approach used in this report is, at best, an imperfect substitute for a carefully controlled experiment.4 Determining that an association exists between unemployment and a particular variable does not prove that the variable caused the unemployment. Alternate explanations are that unemployment caused the variable (for example, unemployment may lead an individual to seek additional training) or that unemployment and the variable of interest are both caused by other factor(s) associated with both the variable and unemployment (for example, unemployment rate differences between two race/ethnic groups may be explained by age differences between the groups). Caution, therefore, must be exercised in interpreting the data.5 See the Technical Notes for additional information on the survey. Limiting the population of interest to those who are in the labor force is consistent with the standard Federal definition of unemployment used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In both years, the doctoral unemployment rates were less than a quarter of the national rates of 7.1 percent in April 19939 and 5.0 percent in April 1973.19 The 1995 doctoral unemployment rate (1.5 percent) was virtually unchanged from the 1993 rate, even though the overall unemployment rate declined considerably (to 5.7 percent). Although the overall doctoral unemployment rate in 1993 was much lower than the rate for the general population, it is important to note that the 1993 rate was the highest observed rate to date in the biennial SDR.\" 6 The trend data include 1995 SDR data that became available during final revisions of this report. It was not feasible to incorporate fully the new data into this report in a timely fashion. As noted in the concluding section, the new data will provide considerable opportunities for expanding the analyses in this report.

See the Technical Notes for a discussion of the likely impact of changes in methodology on the trends. This is consistent with observations that unemployment in subgroups of the doctoral science and engineering population was unusually high in the early 1990s.12 The relatively low rate of unemployment in the doctoral science and engineering (S&E) population is also consistent with the fact that unemployment rates decrease as educational level rises in the general population. Three major observations can be made about the importance of education level by comparing SDR unemployment rates with total population unemployment rates by level of education between 1973 and 1995 (chart 1). During this period of time, education level and unemployment had a strong negative correlation. The trend line for the doctoral science and engineering population lies consistently below that for the college-educated population. The unemployment rates of the doctoral population fluctuated less than that of other educational groups. The ratio of maximum to minimum unemployment rates observed over this time was 1.8 for the doctoral population compared to 2.1 for the college population and approximately 3.0 for the populations with high school or lower levels of education. There is no apparent association between unemployment rates in the doctoral science and engineering population and those in the total population (r = .08).13 Thus, predictions of future unemployment rates in the economy as a whole are not relevant for the population of doctoral scientists and engineers. The observed relationship between degree level and unemployment rate is consistent with the findings of the 1972 National Science Foundation's (NSF) unemployment study, which reported data on scientists Chart 1. Unemployment rates of persons with doctoral degrees in science and engineering and persons 25 to 64 years of age in the overall population, by educational level: 1973-95 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 S&E doctorates 1 -1 3 years of college and engineers separately. In that study, the unemployment rate for doctoral scientists was 1.4 percent compared with 3.7 percent for those holding master's degrees and 3.5 percent for those with bachelor's degrees. For engineers, the corresponding unemployment rates were 1.9 percent, 3.2 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively.'4 Similarly, in 1993, the unemployment rate was 1.6 percent for those with a doctorate in science and engineering from a U.S. institution, 2.7 percent for those with a master's degree in science and engineering, and 4.0 percent for those with a bachelor's degree in science and engineering.'s 14 NSF 1972, pp. 15 and 63. 13 Data from special tabulations of the 1993 Science and Engineering Statistical (SESTAT) database that integrates data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients with data from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates and the National Survey of College Graduates (http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm). Another view of the unemployment trends in the population of individuals with doctorates in science and engineering can be obtained by examining the ratio of unemployment in the overall U.S. labor force to that in the doctoral S&E labor force (chart 2). In both 1973 and 1995, the ratio of total unemployment to doctoral unemploymentwas relatively low, approximately 4:1. In the intermediate years, the ratio reached a maximum value of approximately 9:1 in 1983, the peak year of unemployment in the country."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE TRENDS", "text": "Predicting doctoral science and engineering unemployment requires specialized prediction models, because of the negligible association between unemployment in the doctoral science and engineering labor force and that in the general population.

Relevant literature on this topic was summarized in the Report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Supply of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (SEM Professionals (1993). The report concluded, \"It is not currently possible and will probably never be possible to predict with a high degree of accuracy shortages or surpluses of scientists and engineers several years into the future.\" A similar sentiment was echoed in a more recent publication (Tobias et al.,p. 16), \"Given the time lag in producing scientists,... it is particularly hard to predict, no less adjust, supply and demand.\" Indeed, it can be argued that publicizing job market predictions results in the predictions becoming invalid. In other words, a prediction that a field will be \"hot\" several years from now increases the attractiveness of the field. This increases the supply of individuals capable of filling positions in the field, which, in turn, prevents the predicted shortage from materializing."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Past trends indicate that there is little, if any, association between doctoral science and engineering unemployment and unemployment in the general population. Attempts to develop specialized models to predict doctoral science and engineering unemployment have proven to be unsuccessful. Accurate predictions may never be feasible given that the predictions themselves are likely to alter the balance of supply and demand.\nDifferences in unemployment rates between men and women, among racial/ethnic minorities, and between those born in the United States and those born elsewhere were not statistically significant in this study's multivariate analysis. However, unemployment rates were higher than average among individuals with mobility and hearing disabilities and individuals who completed doctorates more than 25 years before the survey, after controlling for the other variables included in the study. Further, marriage and children were associated with higher than average unemployment rates for women, but lower than average unemployment rates for men. These results, it is important to emphasize, are based on an imperfect multivariate analysis that can support, but not prove, causal relations between variables. The analysis indicates that among those who hold U.S. doctorates in science and engineering, not being employed or being employed only part-time for a period of time may negatively influence future employability. Occupation, sector of employment, and geographic location are related to the likelihood of becoming unemployed. The risk associated with these choices is small, however, compared to the risks for the general population. The highest standardized 1993 unemployment rate in these analyses was 6.8 percent for the approximately 8,000 individuals who were neither employed nor students in 1988. \nImportant changes occurred in the relationships between demographic variables and unemployment rates between 1973 and 1993. The association between gender and unemployment rates declined substantially. In contrast, age had a stronger association with unemployment in 1993 than in 1973. Considerable change in the ordering of unemployment rates by degree fields was observed between the two years. However, the relationships between unemployment and place of employment/residence and unemployment and sector were similar. 3 25 1 V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS Several analyses related to unemployment among individuals with doctoral degrees in science and engineering were presented in this report. Unemployment was relatively high in this population in 1993 compared to earlier years; however, the ratio between unemployment among doctoral scientists and engineers and total population unemployment in 1993 was essentially unchanged. Neither gender nor race/ethnicity had a statistically significant association with unemployment in 1993. A hearing or mobility disability or advanced age, however, appeared to increase the probability of being unemployed.

The unemployment rate for married men was 1.3 percent, compared to 2.8 percent for unmarried men. The comparable unemployment rates for women were 1.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.

These are discussed in Appendix B. 20 All tests of significance used in this report are approximate and calculated at the .05 level. See the Technical Notes for more information on these tests. 21 After determining that the main effect of gender on unemployment was not significant, interaction effects between gender and family status variables were introduced into the model and found to be significant.

Further decisions affecting age at completing the degree are made after enrollment. For example, a student may consider pursuing a graduate degree on a part-time basis in order to have children. Of course, decisions under the individuals' control do not always determine the age at which the doctorate is received. Changes in academic requirements, the availability of financial resources, and personal problems (such as illness) also affect the age at completing the doctorate. Age at completing the doctorate has a statistically significant association with unemployment. For those receiving a doctorate before age 26, the unemployment rate was 1.2 percent; for those who were 40 or older, the rate was 3.7 percent (chart 5). Calculating standardized unemployment rates indicates that the age at completing the doctoral degree is an even more important determinant of unemployment than was apparent from examination of the actual unemployment rates. Standardized unemployment rates ranged from 0.6 to 5.8 percent. The fairly strong relationship between age at the time of receiving the doctorate and unemployment is not surprising, since receiving a doctorate at an early age can be an indicator of an individual's ability to get work done quickly and efficiently. It is, of course, not possible to determine whether the primary reason for this relationship is because potential employers are using age at completing the doctorate as a screening device or because those who complete their doctorates at a young age do indeed possess superior work skills. Also, no distinction is made in this analysis among individuals with differing reasons for receiving their doctorates at above average ages. Additional exploration of this issue might, for example, point to differences between those who spent 12 years enrolled in graduate school and those who spent 7 years working prior to 5 years of graduate school. It should also be noted that individuals who receive their degrees later in life are older, on average, than individuals who receive their degrees at a younger age. The standardized rates do not fully control for this fact."}, {"section_title": "Amount of Work Experience", "text": "A variety of situations may cause an individual to consider voluntarily dropping out of the labor force or working part-timeincluding a desire to spend more time with young children or aging relatives, or simply taking time off to explore the world.

The unemployment rates among those with fewer than 5 years of full-time work experience were 2.6 percent; for those with 25 or more years, it was 1.8 percent. However, the unstandardized relationship does not take into account that the number of years of work experience is dependent upon the opportunity to work. For example, young workers have not had time to accumulate long work histories. After controlling for other variables in this analysis, the relationship between full-time work experience and unemployment indicates that unemployment declines with increasing years of full-time work experience. The standardized unemployment rate for individuals with 2.5 years of full-time work experience was 3.9 percent, compared to 0.6 percent for those with 30 years of full-time experience. Therefore, among individuals completing their doctorates at the same time, the factor of additional years of full-time work experience appears to decrease the probability of unemployment.

First, some of the factors that affect unemployment, such as age at  receiving the doctorate, are permanent characteristics of the individual. Second, periods of prior unemployment are likely to be viewed negatively by prospective employersat least partly due to the concern that scientific knowledge may be out-of-date after a period of unemployment. The variable in the 1993 SDR that most closely measures prior unemployment is the question on whether the respondent was employed in April 1988. Among those who were not employed in 1988, but were in the labor market in April 1993, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for those who were employed in April 1988 (table 6). Although the SDR does not permit differentiating between non-employment in 1988 associated with being unemployed and non-employment attributable to being out of the labor force, it is possible to calculate separate 1993 unemployment rates for individuals who received doctorates before 1988 and those who received them during or after 1988. For the latter group, unemployment rates did not differ significantly from those who were employed in 1988.

Although the high unemployment rate for pre-1988 doctorates who were not employed in 1988 was reduced by controlling for the other variables in this analysis (from 9.6 to 6.8 percent), the standardized unemployment rate remains high relative to that for the doctoral population as a whole.

Part-time employment may indicate a relatively low commitment to labor market participation that is viewed unfavorably by employers.

For example, in April 1993, the unemployment rate among individuals ages 16 and over within the U.S. population in managerial and professional specialty occupations was less than half that for all occupations-3.1 percent compared to 7.1 percent.\" The unemployment rate in 1993 varied by the occupation held in 1988 (table 6). The observed rates ranged from under 0.4 percent for postsecondary teachers in the physical sciences and engineering to 2.9 percent for chemists. In general, those employed as postsecondary teachers in 1988 had lower unemployment rates than those employed in nonteaching occupations in allied fields. For example, among those employed as postsecondary teachers of mathematics or computer science in 1988, the unemployment rate was 0.6 percent, compared to 2.6 percent for other types of computer scientists or mathematicians. Among those not in the science and engineering professions, those who entered managerial and professional specialty occupations were somewhat less likely to be unemployed-1.3 percent, compared to 2.1 percent for those who were in other non-S&E occupations in 1988.29 The examination of standardized unemployment rates by occupation in 1988 confirms the importance of 1988 occupation in predicting 1993 unemployment rates. The difference between individuals who held positions as postsecondary teachers and nonpostsecondary teachers in similar fields also remained after standardization. However, the difference in unemployment rates between those with employment in different types of non-S&E occupations in 1988 was eliminated by the controls. In other words, the apparent relationship was a function of other differences between the two groups.\nStandard SRS occupational groupings were used for coding the 1988 science and engineering occupations. These codes are detailed in NSF 96-302. For non-science and engineering occupations, a further breakdown of occupations into managerial or professional specialty positions was made. Non-management/ professional specialty occupations included: technologists and technicians; clerical/administrative support; computer programmers; surveyors; farmers, foresters, and fishermen; nurses; sales and marketing; service occupations other than health; and elementary and secondary teachers. Jobs in this category were selected based on the characteristics of individuals in these jobs in the 1993 National Survey of College Graduates. The remaining non-S&E occupations were considered to be managerial and professional specialty jobs. This category includes the clergy, lawyers, and managers, where high-level degrees are common."}, {"section_title": "Sector", "text": "The sector that employed the individual in 1988 had a fairly strong relationship with unemployment in 1993 (table 7).

In general, low unemployment rates were associated with employment in educational institutions in 1988 (ranging from 0.6 percent to 1.2 percent if university-affiliated research institutions are excluded). Employment with the Federal Government in a civilian capacity (1.0 percent) or with state government (0.8 percent) also resulted in low 1993 unemployment rates.

Because unemployment is higher in some parts of the country than in others,' it is reasonable to expect that state or region of employment (or residence if the individual is not employed) is associated with the unemployment rate for doctoral scientists and engineers. This is, in fact, the case (table 8). Unemployment rates for doctoral scientists and engineers ranged from 0.3 percent in the less-populated states in the West North Central region (Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas) to 2.8 percent in California.

Differences between 1973 and 1993 unemployment levels for ages 45 years and older were statistically significant, although the differences for the under-45 categories were not."}, {"section_title": "FACTORS RELEVANT TO CAREER DECISIONS", "text": "In 1973 and 1993, the relationship between degree field and unemployment was discernible, though not particularly strong (table 9). The fields that had unusually high or low unemployment were different in both years, however. For example, physics and astronomy had an above average unemployment rate in 1993; in 1973 it was only slightly (and not statistically significantly) above average. Engineering and social sciences, with average unemployment rates in 1993, had significantly below average rates in 1973. The association between the unemployment rates in the two years was negligible (r = .24). The observed changes between the 1973 and 1993 unemployment rates could be due to sampling error. For example, the observed 1993 unemployment rate for physicists and astronomers has a 95 percent confidence interval from 1.7 to 2.9 percent. Thus, it is possible that the unemployment rate for physicists and astronomers was only slightly above average for both years. These chance fluctuations contribute to the low correlation between the 1973 and 1993 rates. The true association may be more substantial than observed. The low association of unemployment rates among degree fields in 1973 and 1993 is consistent, however, with the economic theory that, over time, markets tend toward equilibrium. For example, when changing demand leads to the scarcity of a skill, traditional economic theory predicts that the market will respond by increasing salaries for that skill, which, in turn, will induce more individuals to obtain the scarce skill, thereby increasing the supply of skilled individuals. There is no a priori reason to believe that this equilibrating force is inoperative in doctoral labor markets, even though the time it takes to complete a doctoral degree may make responses slower than for more easily obtained skills. If individuals entering graduate school in 1973 had selected their degree fields on the basis of 1973 unemployment rates, they would not have significantly decreased their probability of being unemployed in 1993. The strength of the association of unemployment with region of employment or residence was also similar in both years. In 1973 and 1993, the highest regional unemployment rate was slightly less than three times the lowest rate (table 10). However, unlike degree field, the ordering of the 1973 and 1993 rates appears to show some consistency (r = .45). In all three cases in which the unemployment rate was significantly above or below average in both years, the rates were in the same direction. In seven of the nine comparisons in which the unemployment rate was statistically above or below average in only one of the two years, the other unemployment rate was consistent in direction. Thus, if doctoral graduates had used the 1973 information on unemployment rates by region to assist them in choosing where to live, they may well have decreased their probability of becoming unemployed later. Although the National Academy of Sciences studies did not report on the impact of sector on unemployment, the relative stability of employment in both academia and the Federal Government was documented in the 1972 NSF study.34 "}, {"section_title": "UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE LARGER CAREER CONTEXT", "text": "Unemployment is not merely an economic phenomenon, from the individual's perspective, but one of many career possibilities at a particular point in time. Individuals unable to obtain the type of employment they consider desirable may settle for a job that has serious drawbacks. For example, a part-time job may be accepted when a full-time job is preferred, or a position in a field other than that of the doctoral field may be accepted when an in-field position is preferred. It is reasonable to expect that the unemployment rate will not only reflect how difficult it is to obtain suitable employment, but will also reflect differences in individuals' preferences and the availability of less desirable opportunities for employment. A factor associated with an above average level of unemployment is, therefore, not necessarily associated with other adverse career outcomes. For example, in 1993, those who had degrees in psychology had a below average unemployment rate relative to other doctoral scientists and engineers, but an above average involuntary part-time employment rate. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy is the greater opportunities for self-employment in psychology than in other doctoral science and engineering fields. Over a quarter of individuals in the labor force with doctoral degrees in psychology reported they were self-employed in April 1993, compared to a range of 3 to 8 percent for other degree fields examined. Thus, individuals with psychology degrees who have difficulty obtaining full-time employment presumably have greater opportunities for part-time self-employment. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the involuntary part-time rate for those who are self-employed is relatively high-3.8 percentcompared to 1.0 percent for individuals not self-employed. Although a full exploration of these alternative measures is beyond the scope of this report, the observed unemployment, involuntary part-time employment, and involuntary out-of-field rates are presented in table A-1. Examination of the associations between unemployment, involuntary part-time employment, and involuntary out-of-field employment across all subgroups examined in this study indicated that there were weak, but positive, associations between these different indicators of stress in the labor market (r = .35 for the associations between unemployment and involuntary part-time employment and between unemployment and involuntary out-of-field employment, and r = .13 between involuntary part-time and involuntary out-offield employment). In sum, although the information in this report is of interest to individuals planning their careers, it should not be interpreted as a complete picture of potential career outcomes. Educational decisions, such as the age at receipt of degree and degree field, were associated with unemployment. Obtaining a Ph.D. at a relatively young age was associated with low unemployment. Although there were differences among degree fields, the association between degree field and unemployment was not very strong. Further, the fields that had above or below average rates in 1973 were different from those in 1993. Interruptions in a full-time career subsequent to receipt of a doctorate are associated with above average unemployment rates. Employment sector, occupation, and geographic location also influenced the probability of current unemployment. The impact of sector and place of employment/residence on unemployment appears to remain stable over time. It is important to note that unemployment is only one possible career outcome (see box, Unemployment in the Larger Career Context). Other indicators of labor market stress available from the 1993 SDR include the involuntary part-time employment rate and the involuntary out-of-field rate. Groups within the doctoral population with relatively high unemployment rates also tend to have high rates of involuntary parttime employment and involuntary out-of-field employment, though the associations are weak."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "Additional analytical work suggested by this study includes the following: Future work on the correlates of unemployment should ideally include additional variables.

It was hypothesized that receiving another degree after the first doctorate and/or taking additional courses since the last degree would increase marketability. However, the observed unemployment rate was actually higher for those who pursued additional education subsequent to the doctorate, although only the additional course work data were statistically significant.37 It is important to note that the 1993 SDR did not ask whether the individual had ever had a postdoctoral appointment. A determination of whether a postdoctoral appointment was associated with higher or lower subsequent unemployment, therefore, was not possible. Presumably, the relatively high unemployment rate associated with additional training at the doctoral level is attributable to respondents who had trouble finding suitable employment in their degree fields and decided to pursue additional training. If this interpretation is correct, it would not be reasonable to include these education and training variables in a regression model designed to estimate unemployment from a series of independent variables. The survey also contained a series of questions about work-related training received during the preceding year. For three of these variables management training, technical training, and general professional trainingthere is a statistically significant relationship in the expected direction; for example, those who had training are less likely to be unemployed than those who did not receive training. Only the category \"Other Work-Related Training\" was not associated with unemployment. However, individuals who are employed are more likely to have access to free, work-related training than those without employment. It would, therefore, be incorrect to infer that the association between training courses and unemployment is attributable to the actual training courses causing unemployment. Accordingly, these training variables were also excluded from the analysis. 37 Statistical significance is a function of the size of the sample as well as the strength of a relationship. Since few individuals receive a degree subsequent to their first doctoral degree, the lack of statistical significance may be attributable to the small sample size rather than to a lack of association between the variables."}, {"section_title": "Spouse's Work Status", "text": "Spouse's work status may well affect the likelihood of being unemployed. Individuals with spouses who have demanding careers may be constrained in their own career choices. On the other hand, having a spouse who is not employed may exert pressure to accept a suboptimal job. Among married respondents, unemployment was lowest for those who had spouses employed part-time (1.0 percent). Those with spouses employed full-time, or not employed, had unemployment rates of approximately 1.5 percent (table B-1). The pattern was similar for men and women (table A-1). Among those who had employed spouses, the type of work done by the spouse might constrain the individual's career choices and thus affect the unemployment rate. One question on the 1993 SDR that permitted exploration of this issue was whether the spouse's job required expertise equivalent to a bachelor's degree in one of the following areas: natural science or engineering, social science, or another field. Having a spouse employed in the social sciences (1.0 percent) or in non-B.A. fields (0.8 percent) was associated with slightly lower unemployment rates than was having a spouse employed in the other fields. Although these interrelationships were statistically significant, the difficulty in interpreting multiple complex interaction effects, such as the simultaneous consideration of the interaction effect of gender and spouse's work status on unemployment and the interaction effect of gender and marital status on unemployment, led to a practical limitation on the number of interaction effects included. The interaction effects between gender and spouse's work status were considered to be of less interest than the interaction effects studied in the analysis.

These were ultimately not included, because it seemed likely that associations between these variables and unemployment are indicative of actions individuals took in response to their employment situation, rather than factors that affect the likelihood of being unemployed. It would, therefore, be misleading to include them in a model designed to identify factors leading to unemployment.\nIn examining associations between single variables and the unemployment rate, the goal was to restrict analyses to groups that consisted of at least 400 sample cases. This is a relatively large cut-off, because of the high sampling variability encountered in small samples when rates are as low as 1.6 percent. Meeting the minimum sample size goal required collapsing categories. When logical combinations did not permit the desired sample size goal to be met, smaller sample sizes were retained. If this was not feasible, small residual categories were treated as missing for the purposes of examining the bivariate relationships between the independent variables of interest and unemployment status. The categories used in the bivariate analyses were also used as a starting point for creating dummy variables for the multivariate work. However, since the regression routines used in the multivariate analyses ignore all cases with missing values for one or more variables, the missing value codes were examined again before conducting the multivariate analysis. Some categories (for example, \"Other Physical Science\" under degree field) that were not displayed in the univariate analysis were used in the multivariate analysis. The remaining missing value cases were treated as if they belonged to whichever dummy variable category had been selected for omission in the dummy variable regression.

The characteristics of the detailed occupations were derived from the SRS/NSF 1993 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), a survey of individuals who reported having bachelor's or higher degrees in the 1990 Census. Two of the three variables examined did not have a statistically significant association with unemployment after controlling for the other variables in the preliminary multivariate analyses and were, therefore, deleted from the final model. These variables were the salary level of the 1988 occupation and the percent of those in the NSCG survey employed in the 1988 occupation who had a doctoral degree.

The focus of the current report was restricted to individuals in the labor market* at the time of the survey (April 1993). Thus, individuals who were neither employed nor seeking employment at that time were excluded from the analyses.

To be included in the register, individuals were required to have \"full professional standing based on academic training and work experience, as determined by the appropriate scientific professional society for the fields of science covered.\"43 Approximately 60 percent of the scientists did not have doctorates.\" Engineers were selected from a mailing list maintained by the Engineers Joint Council that \"consisted of 23 major engineering ao An individual in the labor market is defined as employed or, if not employed, having actively sought work within the preceding four months or being on layoff. 41 See the Technical Notes for a discussion of changes in the SDR over time. 42 See below (under Trend Analysis) for more information on this adjustment. 43 NSF 1972, pp. 112-113. \" NSF 1972, p. 15. societies and constituted about 40 percent of the total number of individuals in the Nation identified as engineers.\"45 Thus, the definitions of scientist and engineer in the 1972 study were not strictly comparable to one another, nor were they comparable to the 1993 definition of an individual with a doctorate in one of the science and engineering fields."}, {"section_title": "Total Population Data", "text": "Information on total population unemployment was taken from data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the Current Population Survey (CPS). The definition of unemployment used in the CPS is essentially the same as that used in the SDR."}, {"section_title": "TREND ANALYSIS", "text": "Changes in the SDR methodology over time (e.g., fluctuating response rates and population definitions) have affected the size of the unemployment rate estimates. In 1973, the response rate for the survey was 75 percent. Between 1973 and 1989, the response rate gradually declined to 55 percent. In 1991, extensive locating and telephone follow-up procedures were instituted that helped raise the response rate in 1991 and 1993 to approximately 87 percent. During the 1991 redesign of the SDR, the population definition was modified. The 1973 study used a sample frame that included many individuals who received doctoral degrees from non-U.S. institutions. However, after 1973, only individuals with doctoral degrees from U.S. institutions were added to the survey. By 1991, it was clear that the coverage of the non-U.S.-educated population was extremely poor. Since improving this coverage within the SDR was not practical, this segment was deleted entirely. To understand the likely impact of the 1991 changes on the unemployment rate, rates were calculated for 1989 and 1991 using population and methodological definitions that were as similar as possible. Foreign-educated individuals were excluded from the 1989 estimate, and individuals who responded during the telephone follow-up stage in 1991 were also excluded from this comparison. The resulting unemployment rate for the 1989 group was 0.8 percent; the 1991 rate was 1.3 percent. The published rates with the differing population definitions and methodology for the two years were 0.8 percent and 1.4 percent. Therefore, it appears that the changes in methodology and population definition resulted in a slight increase in the estimated unemployment rate between the two years. Since the impact of the changed methodology on unemployment rates did not appear to be substantial, it was decided that a fairly good approximation for trend analysis purposes could be made by adding 0.1 percent to the pre-1991 unemployment rates. There are some discrepancies in reported doctoral unemployment rates for 1973. The rate reported in the National Academy of Sciences publications was 1.2 percent, although the 1973 rate reported in the NSF's Characteristics of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers in the United States: 1989 was 1.1 percent. Since the latter rate was published as part of the trend analysis used to calculate the adjusted 1989 rate, it was assumed that the NSF rate was the best rate for use in calculating adjusted pre-1989 figures."}, {"section_title": "VARIABLE DEFINITIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Unemployment Rate", "text": "The definition of unemployment used in this report is the standard Federal definition of the percent of individuals in the labor force who were not employed. The labor force is defined as individuals who were employed, were on lay-off, or had sought work within the preceding four weeks. Although this is the most commonly used measure of unemployment, other measures are used. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example, in a 1995 article discusses a variety of alternative measures used for different purposes (Bregger and Haugen)."}, {"section_title": "Involuntary Part-Time Rate", "text": "The involuntary part-time rate is defined as the number of individuals who reported working part-time exclusively because suitable full-time work was not available, divided by the number of individuals in the labor force. Involuntary Out-of-Field Rate For this report, the involuntary out-of-field rate is defined as the number of individuals (other than those who were involuntarily part-time employed) who reported that they were working out of their doctoral field at least partially because suitable work in the field was not available, divided by the number of individuals in the labor force. This is slightly different than the definition used in the NSF report, Characteristics of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers in the United States: 1993, which combines individuals who are involuntarily part-time or involuntarily out-of-field into a single measure, referred to as involuntary out-offield. For the purposes of this report, the components are broken out.

Standard errors for these tests were calculated using the equation appropriate for a simple random sample. This is equivalent to assuming that there is no design effect. Although this methodology provides only an approximate estimate of the standard error, it greatly simplifies computation. Since the sample design for the survey was a stratified random sample, this approach should provide reasonably good estimates. Sample sizes for some of the 1973 subgroups used in comparing 1973 and 1993 unemployment rates were not readily available. Therefore, the number of cases in the subgroup was estimated by multiplying the 1993 sample size for the group by the ratio of total 1973 sample size to total 1993 sample size. Although this is a fairly rough test, it provides general guidance on the probable statistical significance of observed differences."}, {"section_title": "STANDARDIZATION METHODOLOGY", "text": "The first step in developing a model for estimating unemployment was an examination of the bivariate associations between the independent variables of interest and unemployment. Some variables were eliminated from further consideration after examination of these relationships based primarily on whether the observed bivariate relationship could reasonably be interpreted as one in which the independent variable affected unemployment. For example, non-workrelated training appeared to be associated with high unemployment rates. However, it seems more reasonable to believe that being unemployed leads one to seek additional training than that obtaining additional training increases the probability of unemployment. The bivariate relationships for these omitted variables were discussed in Appendix B. The preliminary analysis also suggested the appropriate shape of curves to fit in the multivariate analysis. For example, for variables (such as years since the doctorate was earned) that display high unemployment rates at the extremes of the distribution, parabolic relationships were fit by including squared and linear terms for the relevant independent variables. Once the preliminary independent variables were identified, a multiple regression analysis was performed to identify possible problems with multicollinearity that required the deletion of additional variables.46 Stepwise regression analysis was also used to determine if there were additional variables that could be deleted due to a lack of statistical significance. Variables omitted at this stage included gender, race/ethnicity, and whether the individual had children. At that point, a limited number of plausible two-way interactions were introduced into the analysis and tested for statistical significance (for example, gender by whether children are present). The next step was to perform a logistic regression analysis. The preliminary logistic model was simplified by eliminating variables that were not statistically significant from the model 47 The parameters for the final logistic regression model are presented in table C-1. A problem with using logistic regression analysis is that interpretation of the results is not straightforward. The impact of an independent variable on unemployment depends on the value of the other variables in the model. Since such complex relationships are difficult to comprehend, a standardization technique was used. For most variables, iterative techniques were used to select a standardization value for all factors other than the independent variable of interest. This resulted in a total unemployment rate equal to the observed unemployment rate. The standardization methodology selected was modified slightly to deal with situations where there was a logical dependence between categoric independent variables in the analysis. For example, individuals categorized as not employed in 1988 in the occupational analysis were categorized the same way in the sector variable. Logit regression parameters were calculated for each category formed by cross-classifying the interdependent independent variables. For example, chemists in the private sector would have a combined logit parameter equal to the sum of the parameters for the dummy variable for chemists, the value for the dummy variable for the private sector, and the values of the dummy variables used to indicate employment and student status. Standardization was performed for these detailed occupations by sector categories, and the value for each sector and occupation was obtained by weighting these subcategoriesfor example, sector categories within an occupation groupaccording to the observed distribution. An exception to this general treatment was made for the variable characterizing 1988 occupation by the percent of individuals within the occupation in the 1993 NSCG who were involuntarily out-of-field (an indicator of the perceived desirability of the occupation). For this variable, the standardized values for the two unemployed in 1988 categories were set equal to the values observed in the analysis of 1988 occupation and 1988 sector described prior to calculating standardized values for the remaining categories. For continuous variables, standardization was done within categories. For the purpose of evaluating the regression values, the midpoint of the category was used to estimate the dependent variable mean unless knowledge of the data suggested a different value would be more appropriate. In standardizing for disability status, the categories were not mutually exclusive, because of the possibility that an individual could have multiple disabilities. Instead of standardizing to the total observed unemployment rate or forcing the categories to be mutually exclusive, unemployment rates were standardized to a hypothetical total unemployment rate calculated from the observed values of the univariate disability categories.   Due to the small number of Native Americans in the sample, a single category of Native Americans was used. **** Unemployed indivduals were given a value equal to the mean of employed indivduals on this variable.
