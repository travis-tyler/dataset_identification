The risk of developing AD is highest in carriers of an \u03b54 allele [2] and lowest in carriers of an \u03b52 allele [3] . APOE affects several different mechanisms in AD pathophysiology, including the abnormal accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) [4] .\nGiven the role of APOE genotype in AD risk, prior studies have examined the utility of plasma or serum levels of ApoE protein as a peripheral biomarker for the presence or severity of underlying AD. However, comparisons of plasma or serum ApoE levels between AD and control subjects have produced mixed results [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The cause of these discrepancies is uncertain, but may in part be due to differences in ApoE assays or APOE genotype distributions between studies. A wide range of technologies have been used to measure plasma and serum ApoE levels, including Western blotting [11] , immunoturbidimetry [6, 8] , nephelometry [9] , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [7] , and multi-analyte profile platforms [10] . Studies that reported similar plasma ApoE levels in AD and controls [8, 9] had lower proportions of \u03b54 carriers in their AD groups than studies that reported lower plasma ApoE levels in AD [5] [6] [7] . The \u03b54 isoform is the least stable [12] and is subject to enhanced degradation [13] . Significant associations between APOE genotype and plasma/serum ApoE protein levels are seen in clinical populations [7, 8, 14] and transgenic animal models [15] , with the lowest levels seen in \u03b54 carriers.\nAlternatively, many of the studies comparing AD and control plasma/serum ApoE levels have relied on clinical diagnoses, which may not accurately represent the presence or absence of an underlying AD neuropathology, and thus skew the results. A proportion of AD subjects may have had other underlying dementia etiologies and a proportion of normal control subjects may have had underlying incipient AD changes. Therefore, another approach to determining the utility of plasma/serum ApoE levels as an AD biomarker is to examine its association with other indices of AD neuropathology that are sensitive to changes that may occur before a clinical diagnosis of AD.\nThree studies have examined the relationship of plasma ApoE levels and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of A\u03b2 deposits using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) [7, 16, 17] . Analyses of data collected in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) studies found that lower plasma ApoE levels correlated with increased global cortical PiB retention on PET imaging [7, 16] . However, in a smaller cohort of nondemented individuals enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), higher plasma ApoE levels correlated with increased PiB retention in medial temporal lobe regions [17] .\nAlthough these PiB studies suggest that plasma ApoE levels may be associated with an underlying brain A\u03b2 pathology, their conflicting results are difficult to reconcile. Therefore, we used the ADNI database to examine the association between plasma ApoE levels and another neuroimaging marker associated with AD pathology: hippocampal size as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to conventional hippocampal volumetry, we also employed a more advanced 3D shape deformation approach that incorporates hippo-campal radial distances and allows for investigations of regionally specific ApoE associations. Previous work using this methodology has demonstrated that a staged progression of subfield-specific atrophy is seen with the clinical progression from presymptomatic to prodromal to dementia stages of AD [18] . We hypothesized that this surrogate measure of AD-associated neurodegeneration would provide greater sensitivity for detecting a relationship between plasma ApoE levels and underlying disease progression than conventional clinical indices."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "ADNI is a large multi-center longitudinal study of the natural history and biological correlates of AD.

Traces included the hippocampus proper, dentate gyrus and subiculum. The final AdaBoost classification algorithm was applied to the full imaging dataset. After hippocampal segmentation, left and right hippocampal volumes were computed and retained for statistical analyses.\nTraces were converted into hippocampal contours and transformed into 3D parametric surface mesh models, thus assuring normalization of the spatial frequency of the digitized surface points, which were then separated into top and bottom components [32] . Next, a medial core through the center of the hippocampus was computed. Radial distance was measured from the medial core to each corresponding surface coordinate point in the hippocampus.

Demographic data arranged by diagnostic group are shown in table 1 . The three diagnostic groups were similar in age, years of formal education, sex distribution, body mass index, and prevalence of hypertension. However, significant group differences were seen in ethnicity, the prevalence of an APOE \u03b54 allele, and MMSE scores, which were further investigated with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons (critical p < 0.017). The AD group had a higher proportion of non-Hispanic White participants than the MCI group (p = 0.009).

When data from all participants were included, the associations between plasma ApoE levels and right or left hippocampal volumes failed to reach significance after adjustment for age, sex, and the presence/absence of an APOE \u03b54 allele (data not shown). An inspection of the right and left hippocampal volumes indicated that they became progressively smaller from the NC to the MCI to the AD group ( table 1 ) . A similar inspection of plasma ApoE levels indicated that although they decreased from the NC to the MCI group, they remained similar between the MCI and the AD group ( table 1 ) . These results raised the possibility that plasma ApoE might only serve as a marker of the severity of an underlying AD neuropathology at earlier stages of the disease due to potential floor effects at later stages. Therefore, additional exploratory multiple regression analyses between plasma ApoE levels and hippocampal volumes were restricted to the NC and MCI groups. The results of these regression analyses, which incorporated right or left hippocampal volumes as dependent variables and were adjusted for age, sex, and the presence/absence of an APOE \u03b54 allele, are shown in table 3 . Plasma ApoE levels exhibited a significant positive correlation with left hippocampal volume even after accounting for APOE genotype. Given the significant effects of APOE genotype on plasma ApoE levels reported above, we further subdivided this portion of the study cohort into APOE \u03b54 carriers and noncarriers and found that the association between plasma ApoE levels and left hippocampal volumes remained significant only in the presence of an \u03b54 allele ( fig. 1 ). Right hippocampal volumes in the NC and MCI groups were not significantly associated with plasma ApoE levels in any of the regression analyses. Similar results were obtained when these analyses were performed using raw plasma ApoE levels (online suppl. table 1; see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000368982)."}, {"section_title": "Correlations between Plasma ApoE Levels and Hippocampal Radial Distance", "text": "Additional multiple regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between hippocampal radial distance and plasma ApoE levels while controlling for age and sex.

When we focused our exploratory analyses on the NC and MCI participants, significant associations between left hippocampal radial distance and plasma ApoE protein levels were present both before (permutation-corrected p = 0.033) and after correction for the presence of an APOE \u03b54 allele (permutation-corrected p = 0.047). Although we still saw regionally significant associations between plasma ApoE levels and hippocampal radial distance among APOE \u03b54 carriers in the NC and MCI groups, these results did not survive stringent permutation correction for multiple comparisons. Across the NC and MCI APOE \u03b54 noncarriers, there were no significant associations between plasma ApoE protein levels and hippocampal radial distance."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our exploratory analyses of ADNI data for participants in the NC and MCI groups indicated a modest but statistically significant association between lower plasma ApoE levels and smaller left hippocampal volumes and radial distances. This association was seen with global left hippocampal volumes and was not driven by subfield-specific effects. It remained robust even after correction for age, sex, and APOE genotype, suggesting that plasma ApoE levels in this cohort may reflect both APOE genotype and the extent of underlying neurodegeneration. When the NC and MCI participants were subdivided into those with and without an APOE \u03b54 allele, we found that the association between plasma ApoE levels and the left hippocampal volume was driven primarily by APOE \u03b54 carriers. Taken together, these results suggest that plasma ApoE represents a potential peripheral marker of an underlying AD neuropathology in nondemented elderly APOE \u03b54 carriers, a cohort at high risk of subsequent progression to AD dementia.\nOur findings are consistent with prior analyses of data from the ADNI [16] and AIBL [7] cohorts, which indicated that lower plasma ApoE levels were seen in APOE \u03b54 carriers and were associated with another well-established AD biomarker, increased global cortical PiB retention. However, a third study from the BLSA showed an association in the opposite direction; increased plasma ApoE levels were associated with more pronounced medial temporal lobe PiB retention [17] . The seemingly counterintuitive direction of plasma ApoE-PiB association in the BLSA study is most likely due to a different study cohort composition and/ or plasma ApoE measurement techniques given that the authors reported higher rather than lower plasma ApoE levels in APOE \u03b54 carriers relative to APOE \u03b53 carriers [17] , which contrasts with several other studies, including ours [7, 8, 14] .\nWe observed a significant association between plasma ApoE levels and hippocampal size in NC and MCI but not AD subjects. Plasma ApoE levels in our MCI and AD cohorts were nearly identical, yet both groups had significantly lower ApoE levels than the NC group ( table 1 ) . We speculate that these data represent an early dynamic decline in plasma ApoE levels, which reach a floor in the early (MCI) and later (clinical AD) symptomatic stages of the disease. While this conclusion requires confirmation by longer longitudinal studies, a similar pattern has already been proposed for brain amyloidosis, as abnormal PiB retention appears to plateau in the early symptomatic stages of AD [33] . In contrast, measures of hippocampal volume showed a greater dynamic range than plasma ApoE levels through all stages of the disease in our ADNI sample. Therefore, plasma ApoE levels may only prove sensitive to progressive neurodegenerative changes in earlier stages of AD, prior to clinical dementia. An earlier ADNI study also related hippocampal volumes to plasma ApoE levels but failed to find a significant association between the latter two variables, possibly because of their inclusion of participants with clinical AD or the use of less sensitive nonparametric statistics [16] .\nPlasma ApoE levels correlated with hippocampal volumes, even after accounting for APOE genotype. However, this effect was primarily driven by the associations found in \u03b54\ncarriers. This result is consistent with prior work indicating that the presence of an APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with greater or accelerated hippocampal atrophy [34] [35] [36] [37] . APOE genotype may affect AD pathophysiology through multiple mechanisms [4] . One potential explanation for our results may be found in the relationship between APOE genotype and A\u03b2 clearance from the brain. ApoE \u03b54 has a lower affinity for A\u03b2 than ApoE \u03b53 [38] . Transgenic mice expressing human \u03b54 alleles clear A\u03b2 more slowly than those expressing human \u03b52 or \u03b53 alleles [39] . Therefore, A\u03b2 clearance in \u03b54 carriers may be particularly dependent on circulating ApoE levels. This mechanism might be expected to be more relevant to ApoE levels in the brain than in the plasma, but previous work with transgenic APOE mice indicates that APOE genotype has similar effects on brain and plasma ApoE levels [15] . Although ApoE does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier [40] , ApoE levels and isoforms modulate A\u03b2 clearance from the plasma [41] , which may in turn affect A\u03b2 clearance from the brain.\nSignificant associations were seen between plasma ApoE levels and hippocampal volumetric indices on the left but not on the right. The root cause of the hemispheric asymmetry in our findings remains uncertain. However, a prior study of CSF biomarkers and hippocampal volumes in AD only showed significant correlations between CSF levels of total and phosphorylated tau and left (but not right) hippocampal volumes [42] . A previous work has also suggested that the effects of APOE genotype on hippocampal volumetrics in AD are more apparent on the left than on the right [37] . In that report, much like in the current study, smaller hippocampal volumes were found on the right side than on the left side, leading the authors to conclude that the more advanced atrophy in the right hippocampus may have obscured the relationship between APOE genotype and hippocampal volumes on that side. Likewise, a recent analysis of the AddNeuroMed biomarker data reported stronger associations between putative plasma biomarker levels and hippocampal volumes in the left relative to the right hemisphere [43] . While prior PiB studies in MCI and AD have not conclusively shown hemispheric asymmetry in amyloid deposition [44] , PiB signal in the left, but not right, hemisphere in AD patients correlates with both cognitive performance and regional hypometabolism on FDG PET [45] . Alternatively, it has also been suggested that manual hippocampal volumetric analyses may be subject to asymmetric left-right biases [46] . This phenomenon could have theoretically impacted our results, even though our hippocampal indices were derived from automated segmentation, since the initial training set was developed through manual tracing. Although these results remain incompletely understood, they raise the possibility that the interactions between hippocampal volume and other AD biomarkers and risk factors may not always be bilaterally symmetric, particularly since greater hemispheric asymmetry in hippocampal volumes is associated with a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment [47] .\nA number of factors may limit the interpretation of our results. While hippocampal size is closely related to the clinical severity of AD [18, 33] , hippocampal atrophy can be seen in conditions other than AD [48] . The ADNI cohort is a convenience sample rather than an epidemiological cohort, which may reduce the generalizability of the results, particularly since a prior community-based study of plasma ApoE levels in nondemented elderly reported higher rather than lower levels in MCI relative to cognitively normal controls [49] . The subset of ADNI participants with plasma biomarker data may be more prone to selection bias than the larger ADNI study population [16] , as it includes a much lower proportion of APOE \u03b54 carriers (7%) than a prior study of the larger ADNI NC cohort, which reported an APOE \u03b54 frequency of 26% [50] . Furthermore, the composition of the ADNI cohort was significantly weighted towards participants with MCI, and there were far fewer participants in the NC and AD groups. These last two factors may have impacted our ability to examine the associations between plasma ApoE levels and disease progression in presymptomatic AD. Finally, although the Myriad RBM ApoE assay targets all 3 isoforms, its relative sensitivity for individual isoforms has not yet been established [Myriad RBM, pers. commun.].\nOur findings of a significant association between plasma ApoE levels and hippocampal size, when considered in conjunction with other cross-sectional studies suggesting similar associations between plasma ApoE levels and global cortical PiB uptake [7, 16] , raise the possibility that this measure may represent a peripheral marker of an underlying AD neuropathology, which may be most informative in early stages of the disease. Since the association between plasma ApoE levels and left hippocampal volumes was relatively modest and prior work suggests that alterations of ApoE levels measured from blood are present in other brain disorders [51] , this marker may be more useful when considered in conjunction with other potential plasma or CSF markers of AD. Such panels may have particular utility for enriching future AD prevention trials with participants at greatest risk for subsequent progression to AD-related dementia. It remains uncertain whether the changes in plasma ApoE levels in MCI and AD represent a cause or a consequence of an underlying AD pathophysiology [7] . Further longitudinal studies of plasma biomarker data will allow for more comprehensive determinations of the value of plasma ApoE as a marker of early stages of AD neuropathology."}]
