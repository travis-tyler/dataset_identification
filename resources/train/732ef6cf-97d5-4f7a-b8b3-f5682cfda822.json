[{"section_title": "", "text": "their risk of developing AD and memory impairment. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or common genetic variants, that are associated with hallmark pathological biomarkers of AD such as beta-amyloid plaques in the brain and phosphorylated tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 8, 9 These studies have provided important insight into biological pathways associated with AD; however, the link between PCC metabolic decline and vulnerability to AD is poorly understood. Decline in PCC metabolism correlates well with disease progression. By contrast, amyloid deposition measured with positron emission tomography (PET), appears less sensitive to disease progression. 10, 11 As such, decline in PCC metabolism over time may provide distinct and important insights into biological mechanisms underlying the disease. The primary aim of this study was to discover SNPs associated with longitudinal decline in PCC glucose metabolism that affect the (1) risk of developing AD and (2) progression of the disease (ie, cognitive decline). Although the pathways linking PCC glucose metabolic decline to AD remain unknown, there is substantial evidence supporting a role for abnormal glucose regulation in AD. Cellular uptake of glucose is closely regulated by oxidative stress signaling pathways. 12 Furthermore, impaired oxidative stress signaling has been shown to lead to reduced glucose metabolism and the eventual development of memory impairment in AD. 13 Therefore, genes involved in adaptation to oxidative stress or the regulation of glucose metabolism may contribute to PCC metabolic decline and disease vulnerability. Given that the PCC is the first and most pronounced region to undergo metabolic decline, PCC metabolism is a powerful and unexplored endophenotype for investigating unknown genetic contributions to AD. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([ 18 F] FDG) PET measures the uptake of glucose into neurons and astrocytes and can be used as a proxy for neuronal activity. Thus, in order to achieve these aims, we performed a quantitative trait GWAS of longitudinal decline in PCC glucose metabolism, as measured by [ 18 F] FDG PET imaging in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our top candidate from the GWAS was then explored further to determine its effects on AD risk, decline in cognitive performance over time, and gene expression in brain."}, {"section_title": "Patients and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participant Details", "text": "Participants included in the original imaging GWAS were part of the ADNI (http://www.adni.loni.usc.edu).

We generated a Q-Q plot to compare the observed versus the expected p values for the GWAS. The genomic inflation factor k was equal to 1.00, indicating that there is no systemic inflation of the observed p values in our data set. The minor allele of rs2273647-T demonstrated a protective effect on PCC glucose metabolic decline, with the homozygous minor allele group showing the least reduction in PCC glucose metabolism followed by the heterozygous group, and the homozygous wild-type groups (Fig 2B) . We determined that rs2273647 was an imputed SNP. Therefore, we checked the concordance rate between rs2273647 genotype in individuals who had whole-genome sequencing data in ADNI.

We were able to replicate the protective effect in an independent data set, demonstrating that the minor allele at rs2273647 is associated with a reduced risk of developing AD and a slower rate of cognitive decline in subjects who ultimately develop AD. Importantly, our findings strongly support a role for PPP4R3A in AD vulnerability and progression. Furthermore, this variant affects PPP4R3A gene expression, indicating a functional effect.

In order to evaluate the risk by genotype, we performed a competing risks regression analysis with death as the competing risk. Participants from the NACC data set who were healthy controls at baseline had longitudinal clinical visit data and had available genotype information were included in the analysis (Table 1, Table 4 ; n 5 870). These subjects are independent from those used in the ADNI GWAS. For the 870 participants included in the analysis, the mean duration of follow-up was 4.3 years and the maximal follow-up time was 7 years. Risk of conversion was considered the risk of conversion from healthy to MCI or from healthy directly to AD (whichever conversion came first). Genotype was coded using an additive model (by dosage of the minor allele). Genotype for rs2273647 was significantly associated with risk of conversion to MCI or AD in 870 healthy controls. The minor allele (T) dosage was significantly associated with a reduced probability of developing MCI or AD (Fig 3A; hazard ratio [HR] 5 0.76; p 5 0.038; n 5 870). Although the difference in risk between the heterozygote and homozygote T allele carriers was small, there was a more dramatic difference in the risk of conversion between the carriers and noncarriers of the T-allele characteristic of a dominant effect. Therefore, we also ran the competing risks regression using a dominant model (ie, minor allele carriers [CT and TT] vs noncarriers [CC] ). There was a significant dominant effect on risk of conversion (Fig 3B; HR 5 0.70; p 5 0.041; n 5 870), with T-allele carriers demonstrating a significantly lower risk compared to noncarriers.\nTo reduce the risk of bias attributed to the inclusion of individuals with a very short duration of followup, we restricted the analysis to those participants who had a minimum of 2 and 3 years of follow-up in separate analyses and tested both the additive and dominant models. When we restricted the sample to those with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up (n 5 735; mean follow-up time of 4.8 years), there was a significant additive effect of genotype on risk of conversion (HR 5 0.72; p 5 0.01; n 5 735) and an even stronger dominant effect on risk of conversion (HR 5 0.58; p 5 0.0014; n 5 735).\nWhen we restricted the sample to those with a minimum of 3 years of follow-up (n 5 635; mean follow-up time of 5.2 years), genotype was no longer significantly associated with risk of conversion for the additive model (p 5 0.13); however, there was a strong significant association between genotype and risk of conversion for the dominant model (HR 5 0.63; p 5 0.006; n 5 635). These results suggest that genotype has a consistent and significant impact on the risk of developing disease. When comparing models, the dominant model provided a better model fit with lower Bayesian information criterion.

The mean expression in FPKM of ENST00000555462 in DLPFC and temporal cortex was 1.39 (60.65) and 4.77 (60.98), respectively. First, we aimed to test whether there were differences in the expression of PPP4R3A between AD cases and healthy controls in the RNA-Seq data sets from DLPFC and temporal cortex ( Table 2, Table 5 ). We found a significant difference between cases and controls in ENST00000554684 expression after controlling for age at death, sex, APOE*4 status, and PMI. The healthy controls demonstrated lower expression compared to AD (Fig 5B; p 5 0.0038; n 5 159), suggesting that transcript expression of this gene is altered by disease. There were no significant differences between AD and healthy controls within DLPFC tissue for either transcript.\nNext, we aimed to assess whether rs2273647 genotype is associated with altered transcript expression. The rs2273647-T genotype was associated with lower PPP4R3A ENST00000555462 transcript expression in temporal cortex of healthy control participants from the MAYO data set, with carriers of the minor allele demonstrating lower transcript expression compared to noncarriers (Fig 5A; p 5 0.011; n 5 159). Our results were also significant when using an additive model (p 5 0.015). There was no significant difference in expression of this isoform in AD participants. Furthermore, there was no effect of genotype on transcript expression in the DLPFC tissue from the ROS/MAP data set.\nFinally, we took advantage of two, large, web-based expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets to test the effect of rs2273647-T dose on PPP4R3A expression in peripheral blood. Results in these data sets are only available for the additive model. We found that rs2273647 was an eQTL, lowering the expression of PPP4R3A in blood with increasing dosage of the minor allele in a large meta-analysis of nine data sets including 5,311 samples (p 5 4.75 3 10"}, {"section_title": "210", "text": "; Z5 -6.23). 29 We were able to confirm this result in a second blood eQTL data set of 4,896 participants of European ancestry (p 5 2.53 3 10\n; https://eqtl.onderzoek.io), providing further support for the involvement of this variant in modifying gene expression in blood. 30 "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Previous GWAS studies using imaging markers including hippocampal atrophy, beta-amyloid, and CSF tau have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying genetic vulnerability to AD, implicating a number of genes associated with these AD endophenotypes. 8, 9, 21, 31 The significant advantage of using PCC metabolic decline as an endophenotype in the present study is that it is a consistent early biomarker for AD that has been shown to correlate well with disease progression, to a greater extent than beta-amyloid deposition. 10, 11 Thus, using it as an endophenotype has the potential to reveal important genes that are closely associated with the mitigation (or exacerbation) of disease progression.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that rs2273647-T is associated with less metabolic decline in the PCC, a reduced risk of conversion to MCI or AD, and reduced cognitive decline. Previous studies have tested for associations between known AD risk variants and imaging markers of AD progression, including PCC hypometabolism 32 ; however, this is the first study to identify a novel genome-wide association between a common variant and longitudinal PCC metabolic decline. Taken together, these results suggest that the T allele confers a protective advantage by preserving brain glucose uptake in the face of AD pathology. We show that rs2273647-T is associated with a reduced risk of conversion to MCI or AD, suggesting that PPP4R3A plays a role in predisposition to disease. We also show that rs2273647-T is protective against language and global cognitive decline, in those individuals who progress to AD over their follow-up period. The lack of significant interaction effects in those who remain healthy or convert to MCI in our study is likely attributed to the fact that many of these participants remained healthy for a large proportion of the study and do not show substantial decline regardless of genotype (as is apparent in Fig  4) , thus obscuring the effect of rs2273647-T. Our findings demonstrate a strong protective effect in those individuals who convert to AD, especially against global cognitive decline, emphasizing that individuals carrying rs2273647-T perform better despite the onset of disease.\nIn order to provide a functional link between PPP4R3A at the molecular level and the clinical level, we aimed to assess whether rs2273647 genotype was significantly associated with PPP4R3A transcript expression. We were able to detect a significant effect of genotype in healthy controls for one of the protein-coding transcripts in temporal cortex, whereby healthy control carriers demonstrated lower transcript expression. We also demonstrated that transcript expression is significantly lower in healthy controls compared to AD, providing further evidence that PPP4R3A is altered in disease. The reason for healthy control carriers demonstrating lower transcript expression, but not AD participants, is unclear; however, it is possible that the effect of disease on transcript expression outweighs the effect of the protective genotype. The lack of replication of these results in the DLPFC may be attributed to a regional effect of rs2276347 on transcript expression within the temporal cortex, which is more strongly affected by AD progression. Gene expression changes appear to be triggered by the onset of AD-associated pathology, which is present earlier and to a greater extent in the temporal cortex than in the frontal cortex. Further work will be needed to determine the regionally specific effects of rs2273647 on gene expression in the brain.\nIn previous work, PPP4R3A was shown to be involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, reduced expression of PPP4R3A was directly linked to lower fasting blood glucose levels, whereas increased PPP4R3A expression was linked to insulin resistance. 33 This strongly suggests that PPP4R3A plays an important role in influencing glucose uptake in humans, and that increased PPP4R3A expression may be detrimental. More tellingly, the SNP identified here has been associated with reduced fasting blood glucose levels (b 5 -0.015; p 5 1.7 3 10"}, {"section_title": "24", "text": "). 34 Furthermore, we confirmed that it is an eQTL in blood in two independent data sets, significantly reducing gene expression in T-allele carriers. 29, 30 Taking this into consideration with our findings, rs2273647-T carriers may have reduced gene expression and reduced fasting blood glucose levels, which could contribute directly to a protective effect on [ 18 F] FDG decline. Conversely, higher expression of PPP4R3A may result in insulin resistance and reduced brain glucose uptake, which has been linked to AD. 12, 35 Another possibility is that T-allele carriers experience a lower risk for diabetes as a result of their differential glucose regulation, thus indirectly affecting AD risk and brain metabolic decline. 36 Reduced brain glucose uptake is an early marker of neurodegeneration, and not necessarily specific to AD. Therefore, it is possible that PPP4R3A may influence vulnerability to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. 37 Although the exact mechanism of action of PPP4R3A in AD is unknown, abnormal regulation of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism is associated with greater oxidative stress, and thus PPP4R3A may play a role in the predisposition of neuronal cells to oxidative damage and metabolic dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease pathology. Interestingly, smk-1 (PPP4R3A ortholog) has been shown to play a direct role in mediating longevity through the insulin-signaling pathway. 38, 39 Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the effective regulation of insulin signaling promotes healthy aging and is protective against toxic age-related protein aggregation, including amyloid-beta. [40] [41] [42] Thus, alterations in PPP4R3A may help slow the onset and accumulation of AD pathology through the modification of insulin-signaling pathways. In a follow-up search for previous associations between PPP4R3A and AD risk, we found that a distinct variant in PPP4R3A passed the suggestive threshold for association with risk of AD in a familybased GWAS, lending additional support for the involvement of this gene in AD. 43 Further investigations will be needed to identify the protective mechanisms by which PPP4R3A affects disease vulnerability. One limitation to our study is that we have not been able to determine definitively whether the true biological effect of rs2273647-T is dominant or additive. As is conventionally done in GWAS studies, we identified this variant in our initial analysis with an additive model. We observed in the follow-up analyses, however, that the effect of genotype on disease risk, progression, and gene expression was stronger when rs2273647 genotype was classified according to a dominant model. We therefore returned to the original GWAS and checked the p value of our SNP assuming a dominant model and found that it remains quite significant at p 5 1.32 3 10"}]
