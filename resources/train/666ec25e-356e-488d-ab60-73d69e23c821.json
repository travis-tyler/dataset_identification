[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Impaired cholinergic neurotransmission contributes to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus current symptomatic therapies for mild-to-moderate AD aim to block the acetylcholine (Ach) degrading enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The distribution and localization of AChE in normal aging and AD are well described; 1,2 however, less is known about BChE, despite its role as an important modulator of Ach metabolism. [3] [4] [5] [6] BChE inhibition is clinically significant as it provides benefit to patients resistant to AChE-specific inhibitor therapy. 7 Furthermore, BChE inhibition may have additional, disease-modifying effects as it influences brain \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide concentration and ameliorates A\u03b2-induced cognitive impairment. 8 Recently, an association was reported between genetic variation in the BChE gene locus and A\u03b2-containing amyloid pathology burden measured using florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. 9 These observations warrant continued and more detailed analyses of BChE in AD. The distribution and cellular localization of BChE in the hippocampus have been described using histochemical methods in tissue sections, 5,10 but results from this procedure vary across laboratories. 11 Furthermore, several studies, using biochemical and histochemical methods, reported increased BChE activity in AD, 12, 13 as well as an association between BChE histochemical reaction and major neuropathological lesions of AD, amyloid-structured aggregates of fibrillar A\u03b2 in plaques (hereafter referred to as amyloid plaques) and phosphorylated, fibrillar tau amyloid in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). [14] [15] [16] To extend these investigations, the current post mortem immunohistochemical study used a BChE-specific antibody to analyze BChE protein localization, distribution and immunoreaction intensity in the hippocampus from normal and AD cases, and to investigate its relation to amyloid structures of A\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary pathology, targets of PET radioligands currently in use or under development as imaging biomarkers for AD. 17 "}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cases", "text": "We examined 11 cases with clinical and neuropathological diagnoses of AD and 10 age-matched controls with no clinical history of dementia, from Choju Medical Institute, Fukushimura Hospital and Ishizaki Hospital in Japan (Table   T1 1).

Neuronal BChE immunoreactivity was localized to the cytoplasm in cell bodies and proximal dendritic segment, while the nucleus was not labeled. We also observed BChE immunoreactivity in glial cells in the stratum oriens and in occasional BChE immunoreactive fibers traversing DG and CA4 (not shown). In AD hippocampus, the overall pattern of BChE immunoreactivity was similar to that observed in controls; however, neuronal and neuropil BChE immunoreactivity were more intense (Figs 1b,d and 2b,d) , particularly in region CA2/3 ( Fig.   F3 3, both P < 0.05).

Only a minority (~10%) of X-34-labeled NFT, primarily those in the CA1 region, contained BChE immunoreactivity ( Fig. 4g-e ). BChE and AT8 immunoreactivities did not colocalize in pyramidal cells ( Fig. 5d-f ,g-i). We also observed rare extracellular ghost tangles (large NFT lacking clearly pyramidal cell shape and without visible DAPI-stained nuclei), some of them resembling tangle-associated neuritic clusters (TANC). The intensity of BChE immunoreaction product in extracellular NFT was more prominent with a more advanced fibrillar structure revealed with X-34 ( Fig.   F6   6 ). X-34-positive amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary pathology loads (% area occupied by plaques, NFT, NT or DN) were quantified separately in hippocampal fields (Fig.   F7   7) . Consistent with neuropathological diagnosis, measures of X-34 fluorescent pathology loads were greater in AD than in controls ( Fig. 7 ). There were several associations observed between X-34-labeled neurofibrillary pathology load measures (from Fig. 7) and BChE immunoreaction intensity measures (from Fig. 3 ). In the DG, greater X-34-labeled NT load correlated with greater BChE immunoreaction intensity in the granular cell layer (Table   T2 2). In CA2/3, greater loads of X-34 labeled NFT and DN correlated significantly with greater intensity of BChE immunoreaction in all layers, and greater load of X-34-labeled NT correlated significantly with greater intensity of BChE immunoreaction in the pyramidal cell layer and in stratum oriens ( Table 2 ). There were no statistically significant associations between X-34labeled neurofibrillary pathology load and BChE immunoreaction intensity in CA4 or CA1."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study provides an antibody-based analysis of the distribution and localization of BChE in normal human hippocampus, and its alteration and relation to amyloid structure of plaques and neurofibrillary pathology in AD. While our method confirmed the presence of BChE in amyloid plaques, it also led to several novel findings, including: (i) BChE is not closely associated with classic NFT, in contrast to several prior reports; (ii) BChE immunohistochemistry is a viable alternative to enzyme histochemical methods used previously; and (iii) in AD hippocampus there is selective up-regulation of BChE in the CA2/3 region, generally considered more resistant to AD pathology.\nThe results of our immunohistochemical analyses of BChE extend previous studies which used histochemical detection of enzyme activity to examine BChE in aged humans and AD hippocampus. For example, using enzyme histochemistry, Darvesh and colleagues 10 reported that BChE localized to neurons and their processes in the polymorphic layer of the DG, as well as stratum oriens and pyramidale of the CA fields, but not in the neuropils. While our study also demonstrates the preponderance of BChE in neuronal cells, we report that neuropils contain considerable BChE immunoreactivity in all hippocampal fields. The latter may be due to BChE containing glial cell processes, as suggested by Mesulam and colleagues. 5 While we observed hippocampal BChE immunoreactive glial cell bodies in the stratum oriens of CA1-3 and in the white matter of the alveus, we were not able to resolve individual glial processes in the neuropil and we did not observe BChE immunoreactive glia in other hippocampal fields. In accord with our observation of BChE immunoreactive glial cells near myelinated fiber tracks in the hippocampus, Wright and colleagues 27 reported that glia labeled with BChE enzyme histochemistry are abundant in deep cortical layers and white matter, in both control and AD brains. The functional significance of BChE in glia remains to be determined.\nIn AD cases, X-34 positive amyloid plaques in the DG molecular layer and CA fields contained clusters of BChEimmunoreactive structures resembling ballooned axonal terminals that were previously described as AChE-positive neurites in immature plaques. 28 These BChE-containing clusters did not co-label with X-34, indicating lack of dense amyloid \u03b2-sheet structure; however, their co-labeling with antibody clone AT8 suggests they contain an early (pre-fibrillar) type of phosphorylated tau aggregate. In support of our current findings, a previous immunohistochemical study in AD and nondemented control cases demonstrated that at early stages of A\u03b2 and thioflavin-S positive plaques, associated dystrophic neurites accumulating choline acetyltransferase and several neuropeptides lacked frank evidence of neurofibrillary pathology (i.e., immunoreactivity to Alz-50 or PHF Q7 antibodies 29 ). Thus, BChE-immunoreactive clusters in plaques could belong to degenerating cholinergic fibers, similar to those described using AChE histochemistry in AD cerebral cortex. 29 The cholinergic origin of the BChEimmunoreactive clusters is additionally supported by reports of similar structures detected using AChE immunohistochemistry and histochemistry in aged monkey cerebral cortex, 30, 31 and BChE enzyme histochemistry in the AD brain. 14, 15, 27, 32, 33 Our observation that the majority (>80%) of X-34 labeled amyloid plaques contained BChE is in agreement with previous reports.\nWe also observed a small proportion of diffuse, nonneuritic X-34 plaques without BChE immunoreactive clusters. This is in agreement with histochemical studies showing incomplete overlap of AChE and BChE with diffuse (thioflavin S negative) plaques. 14 These and similar observations led Mesulam and colleagues to propose that plaque-associated BChE may have a role in the hypothetical Table 2 Correlation analyses of regional BChE immunoreaction intensity and X-34-labeled plaque, NFT, DN or NT pathology loads.\nSpearman's R (P-value, two tailed)\nRegional X-34 pathology load BChE immunoreaction intensity (optical density in specific regional layers/structures) BChE, butyrylcholinesterase; GDG, dentate gyrus (SG, stratum granulosum; SM, stratum moleculare); DN, dystrophic neurites; NFT, neurofibrillary tangles; NT, neuropil threads; PL, plaque load; SO, stratum oriens; SP, stratum pyramidale; SR, stratum radiatum. \"Neuropil\" refers to the neuropil surrounding neurons in CA fields 1, 2/3, and 4. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57 conversion of diffuse plaques to compact plaques in AD. 35 This is a particularly compelling idea given the possibility that the enzymatic property of BChE in plaques differs from that in normal cells and axons 27 and is pathologically significant, 35 particularly since the enzyme influences APP processing 36 and might contribute to A\u03b2 production and accumulation in AD. This is emphasized further by recently reported evidence from a genome-wide association study in the ADNI cohort, that variations at the BChE gene locus are associated with amyloid plaque load measured by florbetapir PET. 9 Despite the presence of BChE immunoreactivity in the majority of X-34-labeled amyloid plaques, we found no significant correlation between amyloid plaque load (% area) and overall regional BChE OD intensity measures. This discrepancy could be explained by our observations that in the hippocampus: )i) BChE is predominantly localized to neurons and neuropils (regardless of plaque distribution); and (ii) BChE immunoreactivity in amyloid plaques is restricted to discrete clusters, whereas the entire plaque area occupied by \u03b2-sheet structure of amyloid (more dense in the compact core and less dense in the diffuse halo) is labeled with X-34. Additionally all AD cases in the present study had an advanced stage of dementia (CDR = 3) with similarly heavy plaque burdens (CERAD = B or C).\nSimilar to our observation of a poor co-localization of BChE and X-34-positive amyloid structure in dystrophic neurites, we found that BChE immunoreactivity colocalized with only a small proportion of X-34-positive intracellular and extracellular NFT (eNFT), some of them resembling TANC, 37 in the AD hippocampus. These results are in agreement with several analyses of cholinesterases in eNFT which reported that cholinesterase labeling of eNFT varies at various stages of eNFT dissolution, 15 and that cholinesterases are associated with A\u03b2-immunoreactive, not tau, components of eNFT. 16 The overall absence of AT8 signal in BChE immunoreactive neurons, suggests that tau protein in these cells has not yet fibrilized and, accordingly, is not detectable using amyloid-binding compounds such as X-34 (pre-tangles or early tangles). Future studies should employ a panel of antibodies against additional phosphorylated epitopes on tau, or different conformational states of the protein, to examine more closely the relationship between tau and BChE.\nThe finding that greater neurofibrillary pathology load correlated with higher BChE immunoreactivity in CA2/3, but not in CA1, warrants further investigation. This regional difference may reflect better resistance of CA2/3 neurons to fibrillary tau pathology in the AD brain. Up-regulated BChE could result in less ACh at mossy fiber terminals targeting CA2/3 pyramidal cells. Given the modulatory role of ACh in glutamate release, this response could fine-tune glutamate neurotransmission at the mossy fiber synapse, resulting in CA2/3 region-selective reduction in excitotoxicity. In contrast, plaque-associated BChE may have non-cholinergic functions and can be related to A\u03b2containing amyloid pathology progression, as hypothesized by Geula and Mesulam. 38 In conclusion, we found that in AD hippocampus, BChEaccumulating pyramidal cells and plaque-associated neuritic clusters do not contain dense amyloid structure typical of classic NFT and dystrophic neurites in neuritic plaques. However, in select areas the enzyme increase occurs in parallel with the progression of regional neurofibrillary pathology and therefore it may precede the development of amyloid aggregates or it could contribute to cells' resistance to such pathology. The functional consequences of these observations remain to be explored and could have important clinical implications for cholinergic (BChE targeted) therapies in AD. 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57 "}]
