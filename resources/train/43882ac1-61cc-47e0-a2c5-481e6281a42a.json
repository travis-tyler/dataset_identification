[{"section_title": "", "text": "assertion? A theorem without proof remains a conjecture. Mathematics without proof is science. Is it any wonder that so many English schools conflate the two subjects?\nSuch problems are compounded by the text books students typically use. Comparisons of English, French and German textbooks [4, 5] found that the English comprise shorter chapters with fewer words and examples per page. They incorporate little explanatory text, although there may be worked examples to overcome the need for teacher mediation. They place little emphasis on technical vocabulary, and comprise exercises, typically of questions similar to the worked example, with little cognitive demand or obvious scope for extension. If, and the evidence suggests this is the case, English textbooks are so poor in relation to those produced in similar cultural contexts, then perhaps it is time for government to accept appropriate regulation.\nTeachers' beliefs about mathematics, its curricular importance and teaching present an equally dismal picture. An interview survey [6, 7] of teachers from different parts of England found two-thirds of respondents espousing a belief that the curricular importance of mathematics lies in providing students with the skills of applicable number preparatory for a world beyond school. Obviously, there were other perspectives. For example, a fifth of the cohort expressed beliefs commensurate with a view of mathematics as an exploratory and problem-solving discipline; a third of the cohort believed that the curriculum was a given and that either they should not be expected to have opinions as to its content or that pursuing topics of particular interest to them may prejudice their students' opportunities; a quarter saw the mathematics curriculum as a function of the children they taught -the more able the child the more he or she should experience mathematics rather than, essentially, numeracy. By way of contrast, the same study found the whole Hungarian cohort arguing that students should learn about the structural properties of mathematics and, importantly, how to think mathematically and to solve problems. Even when they alluded to preparing students for a world beyond school they spoke about the skills of logical thinking derived from learning mathematics. This very different Hungarian perspective on mathematics presents me with an opportunity to introduce into the discussion a problem I encountered on one of my first visits to Budapest.\nA grade 6 teacher began his lesson, in typical Hungarian fashion, with a public discussion of a problem posed the previous day. It was based on determining how many isosceles triangles of area 9 cm 2 , with each vertex located at a Cartesian grid point and one, in particular, at (3, 1) could be found. Collectively, with the teacher doing little but manage students' contributions, the class collectively agreed that the key dimensions of the triangle, base and height, had to be factor pairs of eighteen; the base had to be even in order for the third vertex to lie on a grid point; and that three families -base 2 and height 9, base 6 and height 3, base 18 and height 1 -satisfied these criteria. Finally, for each family, the point (3, 1) could be any of the three vertices and, having fixed a particular vertex, rotations about that vertex would yield a further three triangles to give four triangles for each vertex at (3, 1) . Thus, each family comprised twelve triangles, giving a total of 36. Such problems exemplify a mathematics education tradition with problem-solving at its heart. Such problems integrate several topics in ways that allow for frequent revision of ideas covered earlier; they offer learners opportunities to engage in high level mathematical reasoning and represent a very different perspective on mathematical exercises from those described above by Kaiser and her colleagues.\nThus, from various perspectives, English children appear to experience an intellectually impoverished form of mathematics. A recent video study of mathematics teaching in England, Flanders, Hungary and Spain found that, in comparison with their European counterparts, English children rarely experienced mathematics as a connected body of knowledge or notions of efficiency and elegance as worthwhile objectives [8] . Moreover, English teachers, while exploiting some didactical strategies like explaining and coaching in proportions comparable to their European colleagues, rarely ask questions that challenge students' thinking or exploit students' prior knowledge in ways that help them see connections within and between topics [9] . Thus, if English mathematics is in crisis, and I believe it is, it would seem appropriate to look to other systems for possible solutions. However, knowing where to look is another problem altogether.\nIn this respect it was encouraging to note, as part of its approach to curriculum reform, that the current government has indicated explicitly an interest in how 'high performing jurisdictions' present mathematics to their children. One obvious temptation is to examine the results of TIMSS * and PISA \u2020 for likely candidates and the government has, for reasons best known to itself, identified Singapore as one source of 'adaptive potential' [10] . However, I argue that Singapore is so culturally different from the UK as to make it a worthless location for understanding how systemic mathematics success can be achieved. Singapore is unique. It is small. At 697 \u2021 km 2 , it is * TIMSS, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, is a large scale international test of mathematics and science achievement first undertaken by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement in 1995 and repeated every four years. The outcomes of TIMSS 2011 are due the end of 2012. In respect of mathematics, its primary focus is the assessment of students' abilities to perform standard mathematical tasks in grades 4 (Year 5) and 8 (Year 9). In my opinion, TIMSS is able to alert us well to how our students perform of different topics. \u2020 PISA, the Programme of International Student Assessment, is a large scale international assessment of 15-year old student literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy. Managed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, it was first undertaken in 2000 and is repeated every three years. It is an attempt to assess students' subject competences in authentic or real-world contexts. PISA is increasingly being used as a benchmark of a system's success. In my opinion, due to the nature of its assessment items, an over-reliance on the results of PISA to drive policy is misguided. \u2021 All figures can be found at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ index.html one of the smallest countries in the world and yet, at $59,900, it has the fifth highest per capita GDP in the world. By contrast, at $35,900, the UK's per capita GDP ranks 34 th on the international scale. We are poor by comparison. Moreover, when its neighbours, Malaysia ($15,600), Thailand ($9,700) and Indonesia ($4,700), are considered, it is not difficult to see that there is something special about Singapore. And one of the most special things about Singapore is that \"low-paying\u2026 jobs are done by Malaysians, who daily cross the two bridges connecting the countries to work in Singapore; by large numbers of Philippine women who come to work in Singapore, leaving their families behind\u2026 who, even in lowpaying Singapore jobs, can earn far more than they can in their home countries. These workers have children, but their children are tested in their home countries, not in Singapore.\" [11, p. 668] . In short, a good curriculum incorporating, for example, opportunities for problem-solving at all levels of the student experience, which Singapore appears to have [12] , is not necessarily a guarantee of systemic success. Being rich may help, although this is not always the case, as an examination of Norway's performance on international tests shows.\nA country typically construed as worthy of investigation is Finland. So well publicised have been its successes on the four reported iterations of PISA that it has attracted envoys from around the world [13] . Among these has been Ofsted, England's schools' inspectorate, whose visits have culminated in reports on the teaching of mathematics [14, 15] , indicating, in the oblique manner of civil servants, that repeated Finnish success may not be due to pedagogical excellence and the quality of the mathematical challenges presented to students. Interestingly, the Finns themselves have attributed their PISA-related successes to various factors. Firstly, they have lauded, with justification, the comprehensive school system, which is based on equity for all, irrespective of gender, social status or ethnicity, and a compulsory nine year basic curriculum [16, 17] . Providing education to age 16, a typical comprehensive school is local to the student, small, wellequipped [18] and sufficiently funded for it to provide free school meals for all [13] . Students, who are neither tracked [19, 20] nor streamed [21, 18] , are taught in schools typically construed as learning and caring communities [22, 23] . Interestingly, the right to choose the school their children attend has had little influence on parents' decision-making [24] and reflects what can only be construed as an enviable provision in a country in which there is, effectively, no independent educational provision.\nA second factor concerns the extensive and integrated provision for special educational needs students. This involves around 1 in 6 students, requires no formal statement of need, begins when difficulties arise and has both reduced the stigma of special needs and promoted inclusion [21, 25] . It is typically focused on supporting pupils' mother tongue and basic mathematical skills [26, 27] . Importantly, since PISA and Finnish special education both focus on the same areas -literacy and mathematics problems located in a textual narrative \u2212 \"it seems plausible that the special educational system in this country plays a positive role in relation to PISA\" [26, p. 276] , not least because Finnish students' mathematical word problem competence is a function of their reading competence [28] .\nThirdly, Finnish teachers are talented and continue to enjoy high public esteem [16, 23, 29, 30] , being considered professionals who know what is best for their students [22] . Teaching is a popular career choice among school leavers, even though fewer than 20% of applicants are successful [13, 31] . A master's degree, requiring 4 to 5 years to complete, is an essential prerequisite [13, 19, 31, 32] , ensuring \"an academically high standard of education for prospective teachers\" [33, p. 29] , a condition that has been well received by teachers who see it as enhancing their professional status [32] .\nThus, it would seem that the Finns have created an educational infrastructure appropriate for high levels of systemic achievement, which has been matched not only by high mean PISA scores but also the smallest between school variation of all OECD countries [20, 21, 34, 35] . However, despite such, rather heroic, claims, there are dissenting voices among the academic mathematics communities concerned that PISA success masks structural problems. For example, Finland has participated in one of the four TIMSS whose results have been published. TIMSS 1999, as have all the TIMSS studies, assessed students' technical competence on five broad topic areas of a typical mathematics curriculum. While Finnish overall grade 8 performance, 520, was average by European standards its performance on geometry, 494, and algebra, 498, was poor and construed by Finnish academics as reflecting a decline in the mathematical knowledge necessary for students to continue to higher education [36, 37] , not least because earlier deductive approaches to mathematics have been replaced by procedural approaches that have marginalised logical thinking, elegance, structure and proof [38] .\nSo, what sense can be made of this apparently conflicting evidence? One answer lies in the nature of PISA's assessment processes. PISA assesses 15 year-old students' application of subject knowledge -mother tongue, mathematics and science \u2212 to authentic or real-world situations [39] . Its problems, typically incorporating elementary mathematical topics, are set in textual narratives. The evidence indicates that Finnish students are better able to extract from the text and perform accurately these simple mathematical processes than students elsewhere. However, this typical form of PISA test item implies that success may be more a function of a student's comprehension than mathematical expertise. Not only would this explain Finnish PISA success but also why its performance on TIMSS was, in relative terms, poor. Support for this conjecture can be found in an analysis of Finnish culture. The Finnish people have a strong collective identity deriving from successive periods of Swedish and Russian colonialism lasting from the mid-thirteenth century until independence in 1917 [33] . For more than four hundred years reading competence was a prerequisite for receiving Lutheran sacraments; failure in the public examination, or kinkerit, meant a denial of permission to marry. Consequently, Finland has, essentially, no illiterate underclass and takes pride, collectively, in its being a culture with an appreciation for education and high expectations with respect to personal responsibility [21, 40] \u2212 the Finnish library network is among the densest in the world, with Finns borrowing more books than anyone else [23] .\nThis deep-seated cultural influence is highlighted further when one looks beyond headline figures Finnish PISA performance. Finland is largely monocultural although, in addition to the traditionally itinerant Sami population in the north, there is a substantial Swedish-speaking minority in the west. The Swedish-speaking community is a legacy of colonial times and is a particularly powerful economic group. For example, despite accounting for less than six percent of the population, Swedish-speaking Finns account for a disproportionate 24 percent of board members of the 50 largest companies listed on the Helsinki stock exchange [41] and invest, per capita, three times as much in shares as Finnish-speaking Finns [42] . In such circumstances, as would be the case almost anywhere else in the world, it would be reasonable to expect such an economically elite group to perform more highly on tests of educational achievement than the rest of the community. Yet, the figures of table 1 show clearly that this is not the case."}, {"section_title": "Finnish-speaking Finns", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Swedish-speaking Finns", "text": "Swedish-speaking Swedes 541 527 494 Despite being taught the same curriculum in equally well-resourced Swedish language schools [43] , Swedish-speaking Finns perform significantly poorer on PISA and internal Finnish assessments than Finnishspeaking Finns [44] \u2212 a finding compounded by evidence that Swedishspeaking Swedes perform even more poorly. Thus, one concludes that there must be something about the Finnish-speaking community that not only distinguishes it from others, not least because in most countries the economically powerful typically achieve more highly than the rest of the population but also makes it a less than helpful site for an exploration of adaptive potential.\nAdditionally, when analyses of Finnish classrooms are taken into consideration, there is little evidence to suggest that Finnish teachers, despite the quality of their schools and professional training, are pedagogically exceptional. For example, Finnish teaching has been described as a teacher-dominated practice that has changed little in fifty years [45] . Despite various curricular reforms advocating a \"diversification of teaching methods\" alongside a shift of emphasis from \"routine skills onto development of thinking\" [46, p.11] , an external review commissioned by government found a conservative workforce, uncertain how to adapt to expected changes, continuing to teach as it always had [47] . More recently a prime ministerial initiative aimed at improving mathematics teaching through substantial in-service opportunities for teachers seems to have resulted in little change [48] , particularly with respect to systemic expectations of mathematical problem-solving [49] .\nSuch problems remain. For example, an interview study of Finnish teacher educators found a concern that many teachers, sticking too rigidly to the textbook, present 'boring mechanical' lessons [50] . Moreover, the same study found evidence that, despite initial enthusiasms for alternative approaches to mathematics teaching, many newly qualified teachers slide into similar ways of working. Such perspectives resonate with my own experiences of Finnish classrooms derived from analyses of videotaped sequences of lessons taught by competent teachers on topics typically taught to students in the age range 10-14. Finnish teachers appear to work within a tradition of implicit didactics. They appear to offer definitions and model solution strategies without ever making things explicit. They rarely, if ever, seek or offer clarification during public discourse, typically leaving students to infer whatever meaning they can from such exchanges. To support such inferences, teachers frequently encourage, implicitly and explicitly, students to make extensive notes, supported by their writing extensively on the board, typically very slowly in capital letters. Moreover, there was evidence, in several lessons, of an expectation that students would discuss their notes and sense-making at home [51, 52, 53] .\nBy way of example, an introductory lesson on percentages played out in the following manner. Markku, the teacher, began by writing, very slowly and in silence, Prosentti (=sadasosa) * From the perspective of PISA it can be seen that Flemish students performed as least as well as the much lauded Finnish. In fact, the mean Flemish score over the four cycles is higher than the Finnish. Moreover, on the three cycles of TIMSS on which it participated, Flanders was the highest performing European system. So why has Flanders not been subjected to the same scrutiny as Finland? I think there may be two reasons. Firstly, Flemish performance on PISA is not widely known because the OECD reports Belgium as a whole, a process which has masked Flemish performance. For example, the Belgian scores over the four PISA cycles were 520, 529, 520 and 515 respectively. Fortunately, academics at the University of Ghent have produced detailed reports on Flemish performance after each PISA cycle [54, 55, 56, 57] and it is from these that the Flemish data have been extracted. Secondly, the Flemish have not engaged in the self-promotion activities of the Finns. For example, a news briefing from the Finnish London embassy announced that \"Finland is the most successful nation in the world in educating children\" (January 14, 2008), which reflects the tone adopted in much of the Finnish research published over the last decade -see some of the titles of some of the Finnish articles in the reference list below. Nothing in such a triumphant mode has emerged from Flanders. So, what is known about Flanders and its mathematics achievements? Firstly, despite its relatively small population, it is densely populated and more obviously multicultural than Finland. While nominally comprehensive, Flanders operates a school system differentiated according to whether schools are explicitly secular or Catholic [58] . With respect to secondary education, the core curriculum, including mathematics, is the same for everyone. However, under teachers' and parents' guidance, students elect to follow vocationally oriented, humanities oriented or classically oriented tracks, and there is a general understanding that these form an academic hierarchy [59] . Importantly, research has shown that school type and track influence significantly the mathematical learning of Flemish students [58, 60, 61, 62] . Thus, in relation to the UK, Flanders may be a more appropriate research site, particularly from the perspective of its multicultural demographic and plurality of educational provision.\nDespite its having a very active and well-regarded mathematics education research community, particularly at the Catholic University of Leuven, little has been published to explain Flemish PISA success, and so it remains a site of untapped interest. However, the evidence of my own work [8, 9] has highlighted several key issues likely to underpin a secure learning of mathematics. Firstly, Flemish teachers place a very strong emphasis on students' acquisition of conceptual knowledge as the basis for later procedural skills. Secondly, in making frequent reference to links between and within topics, they attend explicitly to the broader structural relationships of mathematics. Thirdly, they regularly encourage students to engage, typically in the public domain, with mathematical reasoning. Fourthly, Flemish teachers constantly engage in high level questioning and the activation of their students' prior knowledge. Fifthly, they explain and coach in similar, high, proportions of time. The totality indicates not only a sophisticated pedagogical tradition but one in which conceptual and procedural knowledge are developed simultaneously, with the former being privileged as the basis for the latter. Interestingly, although this would have had little serious impact on Flemish students' performance on either TIMSS or PISA, there was little evidence of students being encouraged to solve non-routine problems.\nBy way of example, and to highlight differences between the Finnish and Flemish approaches, the following extract derives from the first of a sequence of lessons taught to a grade 5 (year 6) class on percentages. Emke, the teacher, began by inviting her students to share the percentage-related artefacts they had brought from home before asking questions to elicit the extent of their understanding of the relationships embedded in them. For example, in the context of a yoghurt pot containing nine percent fruit, she asked, does this mean there are nine pieces of fruit in the yoghurt? Would it make a difference if the pot were larger or smaller? For the remainder of the lesson she exploited base ten number blocks. In the first instance she asked students to take four hundreds and place five cubes in front of each hundred. A short discussion led to her writing, what she called the formulation, (five for each 100) of 400 on the board. Several related tasks were completed similarly, including, for example, (8 for each hundred) of 450, before Emke shifted attention in various ways. Firstly, she invited students to construct concrete models for different formulations. Secondly, she asked students to stack their blocks rather than lay them side by side. That is, with formulations like (5 per 100) of 300 she now expected students to work with a stack rather than separately placed hundred squares. Thirdly, she presented various concrete representations from which students had to derive formulations. Fourthly, she drew representations, for example, three squares with two in front of each, and invited students to write the formulation. Finally, she offered, orally, examples like two for every hundred of three hundred and asked students to write both diagrams and the formulations. Throughout the lesson, which lasted around forty minutes, Emke's attention was on the conceptual basis of percentages. Each task was solved individually before being discussed collectively. The various shifts of attention reinforced this conceptual objective. Interestingly, her formulations, every one of which was written on the board, trailed the procedure she would introduce the following lesson, but for now procedures, while implicit in what she did, were subordinated to a deep conceptual knowledge. The underlying principle of mathematics teaching in Flanders seems to be not to rush too quickly into teaching procedures, but to allow the concepts to develop first.\nThus far, I have tried to show that an uncritical reliance on international tests of mathematical competence may not be the most helpful way of identifying appropriate sources of adaptive potential. In so doing I have highlighted what I believe are the inadequacies of both Singapore and Finland but leave Flanders open to further investigation. Importantly, underpinning this paper has been the inevitable concern, as someone committed to improving the quality of mathematics instruction in English schools, that what I may desire may conflict with, say, the aims of government. In this respect, I suspect that TIMSS is of more interest to me than PISA, while the converse may be true of politicians. My objective is to find ways of inducting as many students as possible into an intellectually worthwhile engagement with mathematics in ways that encourage and sustain students' interests in the subject beyond compulsory schooling. Governments, for reasons I still do not understand, seem focused on PISA's dubious outcomes \u2212 not least, I suspect, because the OECD asserts that PISA success implies economic growth. Against such powerful, and seemingly unwarranted, arguments it is hard to sustain a thesis that the interests of mathematics are better served by TIMSS than PISA, and yet I think it is clear, students who succeed on the various TIMSS assessments are more likely to understand mathematics than those who succeed on PISA. This is an issue the Finns are slowly coming to accept. Indeed, as Tarvainen and Kivel\u00e4 observe, \"one has to consider the possibility that the first place in the PISA study is a Pyrrhic victory: are the Finnish basic schools stressing too much numerical problems of the type emphasized in the PISA study, and are other countries, instead, stressing algebra, thus guaranteeing a better foundation for mathematical studies in upper secondary schools and in universities and polytechnics\" [37, p. 10] . Finally, in the same way that throughout my life, despite frequent explorations of other composers and their distinctive perspectives on music I always return to Bach, I return to my first professional love, Hungary. The didactical skill of Hungarian teachers, based on a profound understanding of mathematical concepts and their interrelations, is to mathematics what Bach, \"the immortal god of harmony\" (Beethoven, 1801 in [64] ), is to music. It is peerless. I close by offering two examples of exquisite Hungarian teaching.\nThe first example, for which I offer thanks to Jenni Back, derives from a grade 1 class (Year 2) working on number sequences. It began with the teacher, Klara, writing the following on the board 3 7 6 10 _ _ _ _ _ Klara asked her children to read the numbers before asking them to identify the rule for the sequence. Students volunteered that the first jump was add four, the second was subtract one, add four and so on. The class then predicted, and Klara wrote in the spaces, that the next numbers in the sequence were 9, 13, 12, 16 and 15.\nThis was followed by a series of questions, each linked to one of the numbers of the sequence. For example, nine was the answer to I am thinking of the largest one-digit number, who am I? Having been given the correct answer, Klara wrote a capital 'I' above the number. Other questions related to the value of a particular Cuisenaire rod, and concepts like more than, two digit number, double, the sum of the digits, smaller neighbour, bigger neighbour, the difference of the digits. Each correct answer prompted Klara to write a capital letter above the corresponding number.\nFinally, with all bar one number having been accompanied by a letter, Klara asked her students to suggest properties for 10. Their propositions included It is the bigger neighbour of 9. It is the smallest 2-digit number. It is the smaller neighbour of 11. The sum of its digits is 1.\nIt's an even number. It is the sum of the 1 and 9.\nKlara: Yes, it is the sum of the 1 and 9\u2026 and who knows the letter in my hand?\nChorus: SZ * Klara: Yes, so where are we going today?\nChorus: B\u00e1bsz\u00ednh\u00e1z (puppet theatre) Each time I watch this clip, and I have on several occasions, I smile. I have watched many Hungarian lessons and smiled. But I have rarely done the same in England classrooms, and this makes me sad. When I have smiled, as in the cloakroom ticket episode above, it has been for all the wrong reasons. This episode, it seems to me, was a delightfully selfcontained sequence in which Klara exploited a very simple starting point to the full. Having identified the rules and completed the missing numbers she continued to use them in a variety of ways within the larger narrative of the lesson -a narrative that can be construed both literally and figuratively. Almost every child in Klara's class was publicly involved. Like the triangular problem discussed at the start of this paper, it embodied many concepts, each of which would have been visited regularly during a sequence of lessons in which Klara only ever exposed her students to integers up to twenty. There was no expectation that they should learn algorithms before they had acquired a well-developed 'number sense' [65, 66, 67] . There were no lesson objectives on the board, although the lesson was clearly driven by many, and there were no success criteria. There was no interactive whiteboard obstructing the exploitation of the most important resources in any classroom -the subject matter and pedagogic content knowledge of the teacher and the engagement of her children. In this respect both teacher and children seemed happy to be participants in this emergent mathematical community.\nThe second example derives from the second lesson of a sequence on the teaching of linear equations reported by Andrews and Sayers [68] Finally, Emese reminded her class of the importance of checking and did so. I have always regarded this was an extremely elegant and didactically powerful piece of teaching. Admittedly, there is some scepticism in the mathematics education research community regarding the efficacy of the balance scale as an embodiment suitable for equations, typically drawing on the argument that it cannot adequately represent negative amounts or is unfamiliar to students used to electronic scales [69] . However, I think that the ways in which Emese and her students managed this and later episodes dismiss both criticisms. So why is it didactically powerful? Firstly, Emese built her exposition on a word problem that gave context to the algebra she intended to introduce. No-one in the class seriously thought she was attempting to model reality; it was a realistic problem in the tradition of the Dutch realistic mathematics education [70] . That is, it was an 'imaginably real' problem designed to scaffold students' access to powerful mathematical ideas. Secondly, having previously rehearsed mental solutions to equations with the unknown on one side of the equals sign, she did not attempt to teach formal approaches to such equations but highlighted the need to do so with an equation, due to its having the unknown on both sides, too difficult to solve by intuitive methods. In other words, she provided a clear warrant for her formal exposition. Thirdly, the ways in which she linked the various representations further scaffolded students' access to the ideas being introduced. In this respect, the removal of the same number of bags from both sides alluded very clearly to the principle of doing the same to both sides. Fourthly, she reminded her class of the need to check the result obtained against the original wording of the problem. Fifthly, the whole episodes lasted a few seconds longer than five minutes. It was very efficiently managed but never felt rushed.\nInterestingly, this lesson was videotaped more than a decade after I had observed a lesson taught, on the same topic, by a different teacher in a different school [71] . The only difference was that he actually brought a set of scales into the classroom and made even more explicit the link between what Bruner [72] described as the enactive, iconic and symbolic representations. Such similarities bring me to another important issue to be considered when examining the adaptive potential of one country's practices for another's. Hungarian teachers operate within an accepted and collectively understood didactical tradition. There is little sense that individuals teach a topic in idiosyncratic ways they think will work, as is commonplace in England, because they understand why they do things in the ways they do and, importantly, acknowledge their collective responsibility to those teachers who inherit their students in subsequent grades. Can UK governments afford to continue to avoid a prescribed, assuming it is appropriately warranted, pedagogy?\nIn closing I offer some thoughts about what a good curriculum might entail and how it may be taught. They derive not only from the material presented above but from twenty years of observing classrooms and scrutinising the literature pertaining to effective mathematics teaching in different cultural contexts. They are presented without commentary, as I believe they speak for themselves and offer a strong steer to policy makers in this country, should they have the courage to grapple with them. However, one issue, missing in all the above, is that the UK constantly steals its children's childhood. The Finns do not send their students to school until they are seven and do not start teaching formal mathematics until they are eight. This is not unique; no other European system expects children to start school, not formal mathematics but school, before they are six, let alone five. There is, it seems to me, a perverse irony that successive UK governments have seen earlier and more formal interventions as the solution to UK underachievement. This really is one issue where political and popular rhetoric, despite their convergence, defy all the evidence.\nA good curriculum expects If government is serious in its attempts to reform the mathematics curriculum then it will need to account not only for the matters discussed above but also the evidence that teachers work within three curricula [73] . They work within an intended curriculum reflecting the knowledge and skills privileged by the system in which they operate; they work within a received curriculum, amenable only to inference, reflecting the hidden and culturally derived beliefs and practices teachers acquire by dint of being who they are; and they work within an idealised curriculum, which is articulable, and reflects individual teachers' personal and experientially informed beliefs. Reform will fail if attention is paid only to the intended curriculum. The long-standing and collective practices of the received curriculum are slow to change, as highlighted above in the disappointing espoused beliefs of many English teachers. Any serious reform will need to accept that overcoming such deep-seated and largely counter-productive beliefs will be an expensive and long term enterprise -sending selected individuals for a few days' training in the expectation that they will, to use that awful word, 'cascade' to colleagues is na\u00efve and, essentially, a waste of public money. Finally, teachers will need to be persuaded that proposed changes can be made idealised. That is, until teachers see value in the proposals and can find ways to integrate them into existing articulable belief and practice frameworks, curricular intentions may be prone to subversion."}]
