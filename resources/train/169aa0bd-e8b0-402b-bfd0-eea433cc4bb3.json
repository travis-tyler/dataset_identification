[{"section_title": "Executive summary", "text": "Establishing markets for environmental goods and services has received increasing policy attention in recent years. Environmental markets have been used to leverage private investment in conservation practices, potentially reducing government outlays while achieving environmental objectives at lower costs. The environmental credit markets could provide incentives for additional environmental improvements through the supply of environmental co-benefits. Indeed, many agri-environmental practices have simultaneous effects on multiple environmental goods. These environmental co-benefits result from the jointness between a given environmental practice and multiple environmental outputs. It has been debated in this context whether a single agri-environmental practice should be able to earn credits from multiple environmental markets. Such credit stacking would allow a farmer to receive multiple payments for a single management practice on the same field parcel.\nThe stacking of environmental credits has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, allowing stacking may increase farmers' participation in government conservation programmes and environmental markets, since multiple payment and credit revenues are more likely to cover farmers' opportunity costs of environmental practice adoption. Moreover, allowing stacking may provide incentives for a more optimal combination of various environmental outputs and encourages higher quality environmental practices that may not be profitable with a single payment or credit revenue stream. On the other hand, allowing stacking may also complicate interpretations of additionality in the context of multiple environmental markets. If the credit revenue from the primary environmental market already compensates adoption costs of the practice then a question arises whether the environmental co-benefits of the given practice can be considered environmentally additional in secondary markets since due to jointness they are already provided through incentives created by the primary ecosystem credit market.\nThe key policy issues addressed in this paper are: (i) implications of stacking for environmental additionality and integrity of environmental markets, (ii) impacts of stacking on market participation, offset supply and equilibrium offset prices in interlinked offset markets, and (iii) effect of transaction costs on market participation. Analysis focused on carbon and water quality offset and credit markets. The context and starting point for the theoretical and empirical analysis is the farmers' choice of alternative soil carbon sequestration practices, such as no-till and green fallowing, and farmers' incentives to participate voluntarily in carbon offset markets without the possibility to sell water quality credits. Environmental credit stacking is then incorporated in the analysis and farmers are permitted to sell both carbon and water quality credits.\nFarmers' incentives to participate in environmental credit markets are not solely based on opportunity costs of practice adoption and revenue from environmental credit markets but also on transaction costs related to market participation. Thus, credit revenue from the markets needs to compensate both opportunity costs and transaction costs of their participation. Analysis shows that credit stacking increases farmers' participation in carbon offset markets, and through increased participation provides additionality in environmental service provision. Credit stacking also provides incentives for adoption of more environmentally effective practices due to credit revenue from water quality offsets, and thus provides additional environmental services relative to those practices that are adopted through incentives provided by a carbon offset market alone. Analysis further shows that environmental markets are interlinked so that credit price changes in one market will shift credit supply in another market, thus affecting equilibrium prices.\nEmpirical application of the framework is based on data estimates for the US Corn Belt region. Three model areas, drawn from the eastern, central and western portions of the Corn Belt region, were selected for use in the empirical analysis. The study captures production heterogeneity through regional differences in climate and land resources. Model cropping systems were identified based on two representative crop rotations for the Corn Belt regionContinuous Corn and Corn-Soybean (alternate years) -and three tillage systemsconventional, reduced and no-till. Model regions are further differentiated by Highly Erodible Lands (HEL) and Non-Highly Erodible Lands (NonHEL). Crop yield, input use and environmental parameters are generated by the Environmental Productivity and Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. Environmental parameters generated by EPIC include: (i) soil erosion, (ii) nitrogen runoff, (iii) phosphorus runoff and (iv) changes in soil carbon. EPIC parameters developed for the Corn Belt region are applied to 36 different cropping systems considered in the case study.\nIn the empirical application, the baseline scenario without carbon and water quality offset markets is analysed first. Corn yields and farmers' profits vary significantly across the regions, based on parameters from the EPIC simulation results. CO 2 -eq emissions from cultivation practices and fertilizer application are smaller than soil carbon sequestration in each Region and thus net GHG emissions are negative. Nitrogen runoff varies between regions and especially between HEL and NonHEL lands. Both erosion and phosphorus runoff are significantly higher for HEL lands relative to NonHEL lands. As regards the social value of environmental effects, agriculture's net climate impact is positive and, relative to other environmental effects, combined nutrient runoff damage from nitrogen and phosphorus runoff is significant in each Region. Agriculture's overall net environmental impact is negative in each Region, but the profitability of production makes ex-post social welfare (profits less net environmental damage) positive across Regions.\nAs regards carbon offset markets and agricultural supply of carbon offsets in the studied regions, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, provision of CO 2 -eq offsets through reduction of nitrogen application is not profitable without water quality offsets due to the relatively small impact of applied nitrogen on N 2 O emissions and thus a small amount of CO 2 -eq offsets produced. Similarly due to significant profit foregone, the establishment of green set-asides is not profitable without water quality offsets. A conversion from conventional tillage and reduced tillage to no-till is profitable in some cases although current low carbon offset prices and transaction costs have a significant negative impact on the number of participating parcels. Overall, carbon offset markets with current offset prices do not necessarily incentivize farmers to participate in environmental markets without the possibility of stacking water quality offsets.\nWhen farmers are allowed to stack water quality credits the profitability of carbon sequestration practices increases. Reduced nitrogen application levels becomes a profitable option and 21% of field parcels -representing 4.6 million acres-participate in the market with water quality offset prices at current levels of USD 3/lb for N and USD 4/lb for P. For an offset price range of USD 1-4/lb for N and USD 2-4/lb for P, the number of participating parcels varies between 9% and 38% of eligible acreage. Also, the establishment of green setaside and streamside buffer strips becomes profitable in the lower productivity and highly erodible lands with current offset prices. High participation rates among farmers may, however, result in an oversupply of nutrient credits and as a consequence equilibrium credit prices and farmers' credit revenue would decrease.\nTo conclude, analysis shows that allowing stacking of water quality credits provides additional environmental services through increased participation of farmers in carbon offset markets and through increased adoption of environmental practices that are effective in promoting both carbon offsets and nutrient credits. The agri-environmental practices analysed in this study are widely used measures in various OECD countries and although their opportunity costs and effectiveness in promoting supply of carbon offsets and nutrient credits varies over space, some general conclusions can be drawn. First, current CO 2 -eq offset prices do not necessarily compensate profit foregone when adopting these practices, and thus allowing stacking of water quality credits or government incentive payments makes adoption more profitable. Stacking of government agri-environmental payments with environmental credits increases farmers' participation in both government conservation programmes and environmental markets and can provide additional income for farmers. Secondly, if environmental markets are local and small, with limited demand for credits, then stacking may lead to oversupply of credits, resulting in decreased equilibrium credit prices. As a consequence, environmental practices that used to be profitable to adopt with credits from one market may require sale of credits to several markets in order to cover the adoption costs of the practice."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Ecosystems provide various services and goods to society, including provisioning services (e.g. related to the production of food, fiber, and fuels), regulating services (air, climate, water, pest, and disease regulation), supporting services (nutrient and water cycling) and cultural services (aesthetic values and recreation). Government incentive payments and payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been used by several countries to address the under-provision of various ecosystem services.\nThere has been increasing interest in establishing markets for environmental goods and services. The interest in environmental markets has been driven by a general shift from command-and-control policies toward market-based instruments in environmental protection, an increased capacity to value environmental goods and services, and an increased demand for environmental services and goods by governments, private firms, and consumers. Hence the creation of markets may harness additional resources and involve more stakeholders in environmental protection (Marshall and Selman, 2011) .\nIn many environmental markets, such as carbon trading and water-quality trading, government regulation drives demand for offsets: firms in the regulated sector purchase allowances from other firms in the regulated sector or offsets from unregulated sectors to comply with the regulation and to minimise their compliance costs. In these cases, markets do not necessarily provide incentives for additional environmental improvements above what is required by regulation, but ensure that environmental objectives are met at lower costs.\nEnvironmental offset and credit markets are increasingly used to address greenhouse-gas emissions and water quality in some OECD countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United States. For example, in the United States 51 water quality trading programmesactive or under development-have been identified and three major regional carbon trading programmes exist or have been proposed (Marshall and Weinberg, 2012) .\nThe establishment of environmental credit markets could provide incentives for additional environmental improvements through the supply of environmental co-benefits. Many agrienvironmental practices affect several environmental goods and services at the same time. For example, the adoption of no-till cultivation usually reduces soil erosion, nitrogen runoff and particulate phosphorus runoff (but may increase dissolved phosphorus runoff), and conversion of cropland to perennial grasses increases soil carbon sequestration while improving wildlife habitat and water quality.\nThese environmental co-benefits result from the jointness between a given environmental practice and multiple environmental outputs. It has been debated in this context whether a single agri-environmental practice should be allowed to earn credits from multiple environmental markets. This credit stacking occurs when a farmer receives multiple credit revenues for a single management practice on the same field parcel. Stacking is also said to occur when a farmer receives both a government incentive payment for an environmental practice adoption and co-benefit credits from environmental markets.\nThe stacking of environmental credits has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it increases farmers' participation in under-subscribed government conservation programmes and environmental markets, since multiple payment and credit revenues are more likely to cover farmers' opportunity costs of adopting a particular environmental practice. Moreover, allowing stacking may provide incentives for a more optimal combination of various environmental outputs and encourage higher quality multi-benefit environmental practices that may not be profitable with a single payment or credit revenue stream. On the other hand, allowing stacking may also complicate interpretations of additionality and baselines in the context of multiple environmental markets. If credit revenue from the primary environmental market already covers the adoption costs of the practice, the question arises whether environmental co-benefits of the given practice can be considered additional in secondary markets since due to jointness they are already provided through incentives created by the primary environmental credit market.\nThe key policy issues addressed in this paper are: (i) implications of stacking on environmental additionality and the integrity of environmental markets, (ii) impacts of stacking on market participation, credit supply and equilibrium credit prices in interlinked environmental markets, and (iii) the effects of transaction costs on market participation.\nThe focus of the paper is on carbon and water-quality offset and credit markets. The context and starting point for the conceptual and empirical analysis is farmers' choice of alternative soil carbon sequestration practices and farmers' incentives to participate voluntarily in carbon-offset markets without the possibility to sell water-quality credits. Then the paper considers what happens when environmental credit stacking is allowed and farmers can also sell water quality credits. The aim is to provide a theory-based analysis of additionality and credit stacking in the context of multiple environmental markets, and to provide an empirical application of the conceptual framework based on US data estimates for the Corn Belt.\nThe paper is structured as follows. A review of literature is provided in Chapter 2. The conceptual framework is developed in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, the data and the parametric model are presented. Results are provided in Chapter 5 while Chapter 6 concludes."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "Review of the literature"}, {"section_title": "Key issues and definitions", "text": "Ecosystem services are benefits that arise from the regulating, supporting, and provisioning services supplied by ecosystems (MEA, 2005) . Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have been proposed to address market failures related to ecosystem services by providing incentives to enhance their provision. According to Wunder (2007) , a PES is a voluntary transaction where a well-defined environmental service is bought (sold) by at least one buyer (provider) and the provider secures service provision under certain conditions. Environmental credit stacking, or briefly stacking, occurs when a single agrienvironmental practice produces several environmental outputs and earns credits from multiple environmental markets (Gillenwater, 2012c; Marshall and Selman, 2011; Cooley and Olander, 2011) . Cooley and Olander (2011) distinguish between three forms of stacking: horizontal, vertical and temporal stacking. Horizontal stacking occurs when a project performs more than one distinct management practice on separate parcels and the project participant receives a single payment for each practice. As the definition suggests, this approach is more about grouping of offsets and is usually not considered a problem. Vertical stacking is the most relevant form and occurs when a project receives multiple payments for a single management activity on the same field or forest parcel. Vertical stacking entails establishing more than one credit type on the same parcel. Potential problems here involve double payments and additionality. Temporal stacking differs from vertical stacking only in the sense that payments are disbursed over time. For instance, the farmer receives carbon credits from a shift to no-till cultivation, and later, when water quality markets are developed, the farmer obtains water quality credits as well.\nAs regards potential advantages of stacking, the following have been raised. On a positive note stacking can spur participation in environmental markets and environmental programmes where a single market or programme may not pay farmers enough to make an environmental practice profitable (Cooley and Olander, 2011) . Multiple programmes involving multiple payment streams are more likely to cover farmers' opportunity costs of environmental practice adoption. Hence, without stacking some cost-effective environmental practices that contribute to several environmental outputs may not be implemented. Moreover, stacking may provide incentives for a more optimal combination of various environmental outputs that reflects complementarities and trade-offs between these outputs (Gillenwater, 2012c) . Multiple payment streams also help to encourage higher quality multi-benefit environmental practices that may not be profitable with a single payment stream, such as restoring wetlands instead of planting vegetative buffer strips along watercourses (Cooley and Olander, 2011) . Approximately 1500 individuals involved in environmental markets were contacted, and replies were received from 309 individuals (20% response rate). Respondents represented the following stakeholder categories: credit sellers (117), researchers (89), policymakers (82), credit buyers (17), and credit exchanges (4). As regards the definition of stacking there was a strong consensus that stacking means establishing more than one credit type on spatially overlapping areas (83.5% of the respondents selected this definition). The selling of credits in different markets raised concerns regarding additionality and double counting. However interest in the concept of stacking was high as 73.6% of the respondents stated that they are either involved in credit stacking, or are interested in getting involved in the future. The survey showed that there is a fairly even interest across various environmental markets including species banking, wetland banking, water quality trading and carbon trading. Buyers of environmental credits are extremely interested in engaging agriculture as farmers could supply the markets with reasonably priced credits if these are jointly produced with conservation practices that were originally government-funded (so-called payment stacking).\nSource: Fox et al. (2011). However, allowing stacking also raises concerns related to additionality, that is whether offsets and credits are generated from practices that would have occurred without payment. Hence, questions have been raised as to whether the environmental improvements provided by the offsets and credits are enough to fully mitigate all impacts they allow and whether the offsets and credits are indeed truly additional.\nA prerequisite for earning credits is to assess whether the environmental benefits provided by a given practice are additional relative to a baseline. Gillenwater (2012a) defines additionality and a baseline as follows:\n\uf0b7 \"Additionality is the property of an activity being additional. A proposed activity is additional if the recognised policy interventions are deemed to be causing the activity to take place. The occurrence of additionality is determined by assessing whether a proposed activity is distinct from its baseline (see below).\n\uf0b7 A baseline is a prediction of the quantified amount of an input to or output from an activity resulting from the expected future behaviour of the actors proposing, and affected by, the proposed activity in the absence of one or more policy interventions, holding other factors constant (ceteris paribus). The conditions of a baseline scenario are described in a baseline scenario.\"\nAdditionality is a key criterion in many environmental markets. Additionality ensures that an environmental practice compensates (offsets) the allowed impact and thus ensures environmental integrity of market mechanisms (Bennett, 2010; Cooley and Olander, 2011) .\nAs regards additionality, a project is eligible for a payment only if the offsets generated come from practices that would not have occurred in the absence of the payment (Gillenwater, 2012c) . Thus, offsets must go beyond the current or projected business-as-usual emissions. From this standpoint selling offsets is not additional if these offsets are provided from management practices that are privately optimal for the farmer. Precise determination of baseline emissions and emissions reductions from adopted conservation practices at each individual farm and field parcel can be very costly due to the heterogeneous nature of agriculture. Thus, in practice less costly approaches to estimate baseline emissions, based on observed technologies and practices, such as a baseline technology or practice, are typically used for determining a baseline. The baseline technology or practice acts as a proxy for actual or expected emissions and may not accurately present baseline emissions on a particular field parcel (Marshall and Selman, 2011) . Models and other tools, such as the NRCS/EPA Nitrogen Trading Tool (NTT), can be used to estimate baseline emissions on the basis of geographic, agronomic, and land-use information (Ribaudo et al., 2010) . Bennett (2010) discusses alternative ways to ensure additionality in PES schemes and ecosystem markets. In a project-specific assessment, additionality is evaluated on a project by project basis and the regulating entity is generally allowed discretion when granting credits. Standardised additionality assessments use general criteria in the evaluation of additionality."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "They are likely to perform well when the difference between business-as-usual and the environmental practice is clear, and relative to a project-specific assessment they may have lower administrative costs (Bennett, 2010) .\nDue to the inherent uncertainty related to various environmental outputs of a given environmental practice trading ratios can be used to discount environmental benefits and thus the environmental credits provided to a farmer. Trading ratios enable the use of conservative estimates of environmental benefits, and thus help to secure the environmental performance of markets. On the other hand, discount rates that are too high may reduce farmers' willingness to participate in environmental markets and thus will have implications for the economic and environmental performance of the markets (Bennett, 2010 )."}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "Standardised assessments include, for example, legal, time, financial and technology criteria. Thus, a proposed environmental practice fails the additionality test if: (i) it is required by law, (ii) it has already been adopted, (iii) it could be implemented without a payment stream from credits, or (iv) it employs common practice or business-as-usual technology (Bennett, 2010) .\nAnother approach for safeguarding the environmental integrity of offset markets is to require farmers to achieve a certain environmental baseline before participating in offset markets (Marshall and Selman, 2011) . Figure 1 shows that an environmental performance requirements for entering the offset market shifts the supply curve of nutrient credits (NC) and rotates it up due to the baseline requirement (NC w/BL). More stringent baseline requirements (NC w/BL stringent) further shifts the nutrient credit supply curve and results in fewer credits supplied and increased equilibrium credit prices. The lower part of Figure 1 shows how the baseline requirements and stringent baseline requirements reduce the quantity of nutrient credits supplied while increasing additional environmental benefits (Marshall and Selman, 2011 ).\nGillenwater (2012b) develops a conceptual framework for a standardised assessment of additionality and baselines for environmental credits and offsets. The framework builds on explicitly recognised policy interventions, theories of behaviour, and objective models. In order to have more objective standardised approaches for the assessment of baselines and additionality it is necessary: (i) to define the type of policy intervention and specify treatment variables that represent it, (ii) to make assumptions regarding the theory of behaviour (pure rationality, bounded rationality, or altruism), and (iii) on the basis of (i) and (ii), to develop a decision model (causal model) for assessing baselines and additionality. Source: Marshall and Selman (2011) . Marshall and Weinberg (2012) analyses potential tradeoffs between the precision of environmental baselines and associated costs with defining, measuring, and verifying of environmental baselines across heterogeneous landscapes. A tradeoff exists between the implementation costs of verifying additionality and the potential environmental performance loss if additionality is not properly verified. They analyse the following baseline standards: (i) a baseline technology or practice, (ii) a baseline year, (iii) a static or a dynamic performance baseline, and (iv) the farm level or the sector level baseline. In the case of a baseline technology or practice, environmental improvements beyond the environmental performance of the baseline technology or practice are considered creditable while in the case of a baseline year improvements relative to performance in a baseline year are considered creditable. A dynamic baseline incorporates projected changes in farming practices, technology development and adoption, and resulting environmental performance. Farm-level baselines compare a farm's environmental performance relative to a baseline determined on the basis of the farm's historical, current or projected production patterns while a sector baseline compares a farm's environmental performance to that of the sector average (Marshall and Weinberg, 2012) . Figure 2 describes how the number of credits awarded to a farmer depends on the definition of the environmental baseline (Marshall and Weinberg, 2012) . In this example, the farmer is an early adopter of good environmental practices and has environmental performance that exceeds the sector average. Depending on the definition of the baseline, the environmental credits awarded to the farmer could vary from (a) to (a+b+c+d+e), representing a move from the actual environmental performance in 2012 to a level associated with a new environmental practice adoption (red star). If sector-level average is used as a baseline, the environmental benefits of practice adoption would be overestimated and \"non-additional\" credits (b+c+d+e) would be awarded to the farmer. In an opposite case (not shown in Figure 2 ) where a farmer's environmental performance is below the sector average, using the sector-level average would underestimate the environmental benefits of a given farmer's practice adoption and thus the farmer would receive fewer credits than should be awarded from an additionality viewpoint.\nFinancial additionality requires that adoption of an environmental practice is not financially viable without a credit payment. In the context of multiple environmental markets farmers can sell credits into multiple markets, but they need to demonstrate that an environmental practice adoption is not viable without the combined credit revenue from the multiple markets (Marshall and Selman, 2011) . For example, if a farmer establishes a green set-aside and a carbon payment fully compensates the farmer's foregone profit, this practice adoption would fail the financial additionality test in water quality markets, and thus water quality co-benefits of the green set-aside would be considered non-additional.\nBundling refers to a case where the adoption of an environmental practice receives a single payment for the provision of multiple environmental outputs. Through bundling, multiple environmental goods can be traded as a single environmental credit that reflects environmental improvements in multiple environmental outputs. In contrast, unbundling means that multiple environmental outputs of an environmental practice are divisible and each of them could earn specific credits. Thus, unbundling is a necessary condition for stacking as there will be nothing to stack if multiple environmental outputs are bundled in a single environmental credit (Gillenwater, 2012c) .\nEnvironmental markets can be developed for bundled environmental goods or services. Bundling, however, requires the use of environmental indices to describe the effects of agrienvironmental practices on various environmental outputs, or, at least a good proxy for these effects, such as an acre of wetland (Cooley and Olander, 2011; Marshall and Selman, 2011) . One way to organise markets for bundled environmental goods is to establish an aggregator institution that buys bundled credits from farmers and then unbundles and sells them to different individual markets (Binning et al., 2002; Marshall and Selman, 2011) . Cooley and Olander (2011) analyse different forms of stacking and their impacts on net environmental outcome. Government incentive payments (or PES) stacked with other incentive payments (or PES) will not create negative net environmental outcomes, since these payments do not allow adverse impacts elsewhere. Allowing producers to sell environmental goods and services that have been partially paid for with government funds can distort the offset market, however, which can affect the ability of the market to actually achieve costeffective reductions. Stacking of mitigation credits with other environmental credits, however, may create negative environmental outcomes due to double counting. For example, if a wetland establishment receives both bundled wetland credits (including water quality) and single water quality credits, then one mitigation action would allow two separate impacts on water quality of which only one would be offset, leading to a net loss of environmental services (Cooley and Olander, 2011) .\nParticipants in environmental markets include sellers (e.g. farmers), buyers (e.g. wastewater treatment plants) and regulators. Regulatory agencies are responsible for making decisions about which practices are eligible for generating credits, establishing record keeping and reporting tools, determining and enforcing trading ratios and conducting verifications (Lal et al., 2009) . Trading facilitators ease exchange of credits and include brokers, aggregators and central exchanges; their role is to bring credit sellers and buyers together under the rules set by regulators. State agencies, local conservation districts, NGOs, private firms and entrepreneurs can act as trading facilitator. Brokers help in drafting a trade agreement between the seller and the buyer while aggregators usually collect credits from several sellers and sell them in bulk to the buyers and thus they have trade contract with both the seller and the buyer. Similarly central exchanges purchase credits from multiple sellers and sell them to different buyers (Lal et al., 2009 ).\nIf a buyer of environmental goods and services were to enter into a contract to pay a farmer to use specified practices, the farmer's compliance with the terms of the contract would have to be monitored. When the practices are easily observable, such as changes in land cover, monitoring can be done at relatively low cost using remote sensing technology (CAST, 2000) . However, if environmental service credit contracts specify other changes in management, such as tillage practices and reduced use of fertilizer and pesticides, the cost of monitoring compliance may be substantially higher."}, {"section_title": "Box 2. Principles of double funding", "text": "IEEP (2012) analyses the discussions related to double funding in the context of CAP 2014-2020 policy proposals. Double funding refers to a case where the same compliance costs for the same environmental action are funded twice from public funds, and is not permitted under the rules for public expenditure in the EU. As regards CAP 2014-2020 policy proposals, the double funding debate relates to the interrelationship between greening measures in Pillar 1 and the agri-environment-climate measure (AECM) in Pillar 2. The Commission's original proposals were clear that AECM measures need to be additional to greening measures and thus, greening measures establish a new baseline for the AECM in Pillar 2. Indeed the Commission's CAP-REFORM Fiche No 17 clearly states that crosscompliance and the greening measures of Pillar 1 will form a new and higher baseline for the more targeted AECM measures in Pillar 2 and that the AECM payments shall not cover any compliance costs of Pillar 1 greening measures.\nAccording to the Commission proposal, farmers that comply with requirements of organic farming legislation will be entitled to the greening payment under Pillar 1. This is not considered double funding, since the intervention logic or rationale is different for Pillar 1 (environmental improvement) and Pillar 2 (compensation for loss of income and extra costs incurred from switching to organic production). Thus, the adopted practice and environmental outcome may be the same, but if the payment rationale is different, then this is not considered to raise the double funding problem. The Commission's proposals received criticism from both Member States and the European Parliament as well as from various stakeholders, and a number of counterproposals were put forward. For example, farmers' unions (such as Copa-Coega) proposed that farmers who comply with AECM in Pillar 2 should be de facto eligible for Pillar 1 green payments on top of their agri-environment payments. In the political agreement on a new direction for common agricultural policy a technical solution was adopted to address double funding: to apply a reduction rate to Pillar 2 payments for certain measures that are not deemed to be environmentally additional to the greening measures.\nThe European Commission adopted on March 11, 2014 the so-called \"delegated acts\" for the new CAP, clarifying how the CAP reform is to be implemented on farms across the EU. According to the delegated act on rural development Pillar 2 payments must cover only the additional costs and/or income foregone related to the commitments that go beyond the relevant obligatory practices set out in the Pillar 1 greening provisions. For those measures for which it is not possible to identify accurately which elements go beyond the greening provisions the agri-environment-climate payment must be reduced by a lump sum corresponding to the part of the Pillar 1 greening payment."}, {"section_title": "Sources: IEEP (2012) and AgraEurope (2014).", "text": "For example, if carbon offset contracts are carried out through private-market trading programs, various transaction costs will have to be borne by project participants (McCarl, 2002; van Kooten, et al, 2002; Mooney et al., 2004a, b) . Transaction costs include normal financial transaction expenses (legal and broker fees, etc.), as well as costs associated with verifying contract compliance. Very few reliable data are available to estimate transaction costs for implementing carbon and water quality offsets and credits. Based on experience with two pilot programs, McCarl (2002) estimated that market transaction costs (costs of organizing and participating in the market) for carbon credits could be around USD 0.83 per acre. However, it is difficult to generalize this estimate to other cases. Moreover, the costs of implementing programs are likely to decrease with experience, new measurement and monitoring technologies and with competition among service providers. Mooney et al. (2004a, b) estimated the measurement and monitoring costs that are likely to be required to verify compliance with carbon credits produced by agricultural soil carbon (C) sequestration. In a case study of their prototype measurement scheme, the upper estimate of measurement costs is 3% of the value of a C credit. While these estimates should be interpreted with caution-because they are not based on an actual contract implementationthey suggest that measurement costs would not necessarily prevent farmers from participating in a market for carbon offset credits. Figure 3 . Transaction costs have the effect of creating a threshold price for the C supply curve. When C sequestration rates are relatively low, as is the case with the wheat system, transaction costs create a relatively high price threshold (equal to about USD 30 per metric tonne C). For the relatively higher C sequestration rates associated with the corn and soy beans, the threshold is about USD 20 per tonne. Figure 3 also shows that the effect of the transaction costs diminishes at higher C prices. Thus, it can be concluded that transaction costs are likely to be particularly important when C prices are low and in regions where C storage rates are low."}, {"section_title": "Antle et al. (2007) incorporated transaction costs in C supply curves, as illustrated in", "text": "As regards water quality trading it has been estimated that finding trading partners and conducting verification plans amounts to USD 0.05 per pound of N credits if a clearinghouse is used and USD 0.10 if the trade is bilateral (Pennvest, 2012) . Farmers' credit estimation and verification costs have been estimated to be 5% of farmers' total offset revenue (Newburn and Woodward, 2011) .\nThe environmental effectiveness of management practices may vary greatly over space due to spatial heterogeneity and stochastic weather conditions. The environmental integrity and credibility of environmental markets, however, requires reasonably accurate estimates of how various practices perform under heterogeneous conditions. Accurate performance estimates help to reduce uncertainty about the quality and quantity of credits supplied from agriculture and increases demand for environmental services from agriculture as potential purchasers of credits find them more reliable. While monitoring environmental practice performance through edge-of-field or ambient quality measurement would be the most precise method for verifying environmental credits, it would be extremely costly and impractical due to the non-point nature of many environmental services provided by agriculture (Ribaudo et al., 2010) . Model-based estimates can be developed for many services from agriculture that can be seen as reasonably accurate by market participants (Kroeger and Casey, 2007) . Moreover, government can support research on the effectiveness of environmental practices in the provision of environmental services. For example, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) supports the development of tools and methods for quantifying environmental services provided by different environmental practices. These tools help farmers to estimate environmental credits produced from a given practice while increasing confidence among other market participants regarding creditable practices (Ribaudo et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "2.2.", "text": "Environmental credit markets and stacking Woodward (2011) provides a formal analysis of credit stacking in environmental markets. In his analysis the key question is whether there are economic reasons to allow or forbid stacking. Stacking is possible when two or more environmental effects are complements in the firm's abatement cost function. At the firm level, complementarity means that the abatement cost is lower than the sum of the costs of abating each pollutant separately. Woodward shows that credit stacking can be welfare increasing if the emission caps for all pollutants are set at their optimal levels, taking into account that complementarity lowers abatement costs and thus increases the socially optimal level of abatement and thus environmental quality. Hence, if the optimal level of pollution abatement is sought and emissions caps in separate markets are established with complementarity in mind then a policy allowing stacking leads to the least-cost allocation of abatement and thus maximizes social net benefits. However, single-market restrictions may work better if the multiple markets are not well coordinated or set optimally. The slopes of the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves affect the efficiency of stacking. When the marginal benefit curve is relatively steep or the marginal cost curve is relatively flat then stacking is efficient and improves social welfare relative to a situation where stacking is not allowed. Horan et al. (2004) analyses the stacking of government agri-environmental payments and water quality trading credits. Joint implementation of these two policy mechanisms provides insights as regards efficiency and distributional implications of stacking. In the analysis the government incentive payments are provided to farmers to reduce the use of polluting inputs. Incentive payments are either targeted (farm-specific level that takes into account marginal damage from each farm) or non-targeted (payment level is averaged across all farms). The analysis examines both the coordinated and non-coordinated use of agri-environmental payments and water quality trading. In the uncoordinated case agri-environmental payments already exists and the trading authority takes this into account when designing the trading programme. If stacking is allowed, then these two programmes cross-subsidise each other and if it is not allowed, then the agri-environmental programme reduces the ability of the water quality trading programme to achieve environmental gains at least cost (since additional units of abatement from farms are more costly to purchase than the initial units). The degree of improved policy performance among these policies is found to depend on whether programmes are coordinated or not, whether stacking is allowed, and whether agrienvironmental payments are targeted. Under policy coordination stacking provides efficiency gains through both programmes' joint influence on farmers' marginal decisions. As regards the non-coordinated policies stacking increases (decreases) welfare if agri-environmental payments are targeted (non-targeted). The analysis also shows that stacking may not solely benefit farmers, but may transfer part of the value of agri-environmental payments to point source polluters. Lentz et al. (2013) analyses water quality trading and credit stacking in a case when both buyers and sellers of credits can only reduce pollution with large, discrete investments that yield discontinuous supply and demand of credits. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) pay farmers to reduce nutrient runoff through establishment of wetlands and farmers may or may not be allowed to earn multiple environmental service credits from one wetland (nitrogen, phosphorus, and wildlife credits). Simulation results from the US Corn Belt show that establishing wetlands is a more cost-effective way to reduce nitrogen runoff than abatement by WWTPs. Stacking of environmental credits may improve social welfare and change market outcomes by altering the set of wetlands established if the demand for the primary market (nitrogen) is strong enough to cover most of the establishment costs of the wetlands and the supply of nitrogen credits is not exhausted. However, simulations further show that stacking may not have an effect on market outcomes under several circumstances and that stacked credits may not be truly additional. For example, stacking does not change the market outcome if either demand is so limited that a single large wetland would suffice to fulfill demand for credits or demand is so strong that supply of primary nitrogen credits is exhausted and thus market factors would not change the composition of wetlands that are established. The timing of credit sales is also important; if co-benefit credits (phosphorus and wildlife) are sold only after the wetlands are established to sell credits to the primary market (nitrogen), stacking does not affect real market outcomes.\nMarshall and Selman (2011) discuss extensively the key design features of environmental markets when an explicit objective is to ensure environmental improvement and the integrity of environmental credits in addition to minimizing compliance costs of the regulated sectors. These key design features include: (i) baseline practice or performance requirements for credit and offset suppliers, (ii) retirement ratios altering the proportion of credits demanded to those supplied, and (iii) the role of ancillary benefits (co-benefits). Furthermore, they analyse the potential implications of environmental co-benefits on compliance costs and environmental objectives in the context of multiple environmental markets. Environmental co-benefits and stacking may complicate interpretations of additionality and baselines in the context of multiple environmental markets. For example, if a carbon offset market drives farmers to adopt no-till and if joint water quality benefits are created, a question arises whether those benefits can be considered additional in water quality markets since due to jointness they are already provided through incentives created by the carbon offset market (Marshall and Selman, 2011) .\nIn their discussion Marshall and Selman (2011) distinguish between the primary market (the one that triggers the adoption of an environmental practice) and the secondary market (potential environmental credits from co-benefits). Additionality for the primary market is straightforward as it represents the difference between the current practice and the new adopted environmental practice.\nBut what is the correct baseline for the secondary market? Is it the current practice or the newly adopted environmental practice incentivised by the primary market? The former represents a case where multiple environmental markets are independent and work as a single market for a given environmental good, while the latter indicates that the existence of the primary market has already incentivised the adoption of the environmental practice with cobenefits, without the existence of the secondary market, and thus these co-benefits cannot be considered additional from an inter-market additionality viewpoint (Marshall and Selman, 2011) .\nIf environmental markets are interlinked and revenue from the primary market already covers adoption costs of the environmental practice, then allowing farmers to receive cobenefit credits from the secondary markets represents a windfall gain for farmers and a decrease in the environmental effectiveness of the combined regulation and offset market since non-additional credits are sold as offsets for increased emissions elsewhere (Marshall and Selman, 2011) . Thus, a financial additionality test can be employed in the context of multiple environmental markets: if the adoption of an environmental practice is already profitable with credit sales to the primary market, secondary markets fail the financial additionality test (Marshall and Selman, 2011 ).\nMarshall and Selman (2011) present a graphical analysis of environmental credit supply in interlinked environmental markets. In the example, farmers supply nutrient credits to the water quality market by adopting environmental practices that jointly produce carbon credits, such as no-till or green fallowing. If the secondary market for carbon exists and farmers earn revenue for carbon credits, the supply curve for nutrient credits will shift as revenue from carbon credits reduces supply cost of nutrient credits ( Figure 4) . As a result, due to returns from the carbon credit market, farmers are willing to supply more nutrient credits (Q*) at a lower price (P*). Revenue from the carbon credit market fully covers the cost of supplying Q** of nutrient credits and thus from a water quality market viewpoint, these credits are nonadditional and the total expenditure (P*Q**) for these credits represents wasted conservation resources.\nAs shown in Figure 4 , stacking can change the value of environmental credits by increasing the aggregate supply and reducing the equilibrium credit price in the market. Thus, allowing stacking provides farmers multiple payment streams, but simultaneously reduces credit prices and therefore revenue from each individual market (Cooley and Olander, 2011) . Hence, if environmental credit prices decrease due to stacking, environmental practices that used to be profitable to adopt with credits from one market may require sale of credits to several markets in order to cover adoption costs of the practice. This may have implications for financial additionality in the secondary markets as well. Environmental practices that were originally financially non-additional in the secondary markets may become additional if reduced credit revenue from the primary market no longer covers adoption costs (Cooley and Olander, 2011) . Marshall and Selman (2011) discuss alternative regulatory design options for addressing additionality in interlinked environmental markets. The first option is to allow the sale of credits only to one (primary) market and treat environmental co-benefits from the adoption of a practice as ancillary benefits rather than creditable additional benefits. The shortcoming of this option is that some low-cost multi-benefit practices may not be adopted if the revenue stream from one market alone does not fully cover the adoption costs. The second option is to allow credit sales to several markets as long as the additionality criterion for each individual market is fulfilled; in this case there is no requirement for inter-market additionality -that is, for each market the baseline is the current practice. The disadvantage of this option stems from the supply of non-additional credits from an inter-market viewpoint. The third option is to employ financial additionality criteria to decide which practices are eligible for sale of credits to multiple markets. The fourth option for addressing inter-market additionality is to create a single aggregator institution that buys bundled environmental services from farmers and then unbundles them and sells credits within the individual markets (Marshall and Selman, 2011) .\nTo conclude discussion in this section, in many cases the driver of offset demand is flexibility in government regulation which allows the regulated sector to purchase offsets from unregulated sectors to comply with the regulation. This flexibility enables reduction of total abatement costs if non-regulated sectors can reduce emissions at a lower cost. In this case the offset market does not provide incentives for additional environmental improvements above what is required by regulation, but ensures that environmental objectives are met at lower social costs. The environmental integrity of the offset market requires that all offsets are additional, because offset purchasers are allowed to increase their emissions above permitted levels. Hence, if the fundamental purpose of the offset market is to reduce the compliance costs of the regulation, while achieving the emission-reduction target, then non-additional offsets or credits should not be allowed. Because credit stacking complicates interpretations of additionality and baselines, it may produce some non-additionality in offset and credit markets, which in turn compromise environmental targets of the regulation."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "A framework of agricultural supply of carbon and water quality offsets A framework of agricultural supply of carbon and water quality offsets is provided in this chapter."}, {"section_title": "Baseline cultivation: No offset markets", "text": "Consider cultivation under heterogeneous land productivity illustrated for simplicity by two productivity classes, high and low. Land productivity within both classes is assumed homogenous. Each farmer owns one field parcel so that the total number of land equals total number of farmers. Both land productivities can be cultivated using two alternative tillage methods: conventional tillage based on moldboard plowing or conservation tillage, say no-till, based on direct drilling of seeds and fertilizer in the soil. The crop is produced using fertilizer as variable input and a set of other inputs (seeds, labor, and capital) that can conveniently be regarded constant per hectare. Crop yield as a function of fertilizer input varies depending on the tillage method.\nIn the baseline with no offset markets, farmers choose optimal fertilizer application, based on relative prices and allocate each parcel of land to the tillage method which produces highest profits. It is assumed that no-till is more suitable for high productivity land and conventional tillage for low productivity land.\n2 Under these assumptions and based on the optimal use of inputs, high land productivities are allocated to no-till and low productivities to conventional tillage. This baseline is the point of departure for the analysis of agricultural production in the presence of carbon offset markets. Note that the baseline within each productivity class of land entails that the farmers are homogenous, that is, they face identical relative costs. This feature will change when a voluntary carbon offset market is introduced to the analysis as farmer-specific transaction costs start to matter for farmers' willingness to participate in carbon and water quality offset markets."}, {"section_title": "Cultivation under voluntary participation in carbon markets", "text": "It is assumed that the farmer primarily participates in a voluntary carbon market and produces carbon offsets. Carbon offsets provide potential additional revenue. If a farmer wishes to produce offsets and participate in carbon markets, three measures are in principle available to produce carbon offsets from crop cultivation.\nFirst, the farmer may reduce applied nitrogen fertilizer, which stimulates microbial conversion of soil nitrogen to nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Reducing nitrogen application below the baseline optimum for a given tillage method yields carbon offsets from reduced N 2 O emissions, based on the relative heat-trapping potential of CO 2 and N 2 O. Second, if the farmer applies conventional tillage, then offsets can be produced by switching to no-till, which increases carbon storage in cropland soils. Third, the farmers may allocate some field parcels to long-term green set-aside which enhances carbon sequestration. Participation in 2. Ogle et al. (2012) conducted a literature review to compile results from studies evaluating changes in yield following the adoption of no-till cultivation. Their results of corn (maize) yields are influenced by nitrogen application levels so that yield losses are relatively lower (higher) when nitrogen application level is high (low).\ncarbon offset markets involves transaction costs, which may represent an important constraint on market entry. Transaction costs are comprised of costs of participating in the offset market as well as additional, farmer-specific transaction costs relating to gathering and producing information on offset markets and implementation of measures needed to produce offsets. Thus, while farmers within both land productivity classes face similar yields and relative costs, transaction costs may differ. 3 Hence, farmers in each productivity class can be arranged by the size of transaction costs from lowest to the highest cost. For farmers facing high transaction costs, it may not be optimal to participate in offset markets.\nUnder the carbon offset market optimal fertilizer intensity is reduced relative to the baseline. Once optimal fertilizer application is known, farmers in each land productivity class choose the tillage method. In the high productivity class, no-till was the baseline cultivation technology and the possibility of selling carbon credits reinforces its superiority relative to conventional tillage. In the low productivity class, carbon offset revenues improves returns to no-till cultivation relative to conventional tillage, yet both benefit from the carbon market. Depending on the revenue of the generated offsets under no-till relative to those generated under conventional tillage, either no-till is introduced or farmers continue employing conventional tillage.\nIn the high productivity class, farmer participates in the carbon offset market provided that profits from cultivation plus offset revenue less transaction costs is higher than baseline profits from cultivation. Farmer is indifferent between participation and nonparticipation when transaction costs are equal with the difference of profits under carbon market participation and baseline. For transaction costs below this threshold value, farmers participate in offset markets and for costs above this value they do not participate but continue with the baseline cultivation technology.\nIn the low productivity class, conventional tillage is the baseline technology but farmers may adopt no-till if it provides higher revenue and participation in the carbon offset market is profitable. Based on the two alternative possibilities for tillage method choice, the participation decision can be expressed as follows. Suppose first that no-till is the superior tillage method for farmers who participate in the carbon market. Then the farmers with transactions costs below critical value participate in carbon markets using no-till but farmers with transaction costs above critical value will not participate and continue to employ conventional tillage. If instead conventional tillage is more profitable under carbon markets, both participating and non-participating farmers continue with conventional tillage, and participating farmers only reduce their fertilizer application for generating carbon offsets.\nThe supply of offsets to carbon markets from crop production can be defined as the sum of offsets over participating farmers in high and low productivity classes. The offset supply is generated by reduced fertilizer use and possibly by a discrete shift from conventional tillage to no-till in participating lands from low productivity class. Furthermore, on low productivity land green set-aside establishment may become profitable and thus affect offset supply.\nThe impact of an increase in carbon offset price on supply of carbon offsets is positive, as number of participating farmers increases in offset price and fertilizer intensity decreases in it. Hence, the total supply of carbon offsets from crop production is an increasing function of carbon price. The supply function of offsets from crop production is illustrated in Figure 5 . For an exogenous offset price b the optimal amount of supplied carbon offsets is Q.\n3. Mettepenningen et al. (2009) have analysed the variation of farmers' private transaction costs in the context of European agri-environmental policy. They found that \"search costs\", including the costs of looking for information on specific agri-environmental measures and comparing these with alternatives, show wide variation. Mean search costs were EUR 11.1/ha with a standard deviation of 54.2."}, {"section_title": "-ENVIRONMENTAL CO-BENEFITS AND STACKING IN ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N\u00b072 \u00a9 OECD 2015", "text": "Figure 5.

Reduced fertilizer use decreases nutrient runoff, while green setaside planted to perennial grasses (without applied fertilizer) may significantly reduce all forms of runoff. No-till adoption generally decreases erosion, nitrogen runoff and particulate phosphorus runoff (but may increase dissolved reactive phosphorus runoff). 4 It is assumed in the analysis that a farmer can either participate in one market (the carbon market) or multiple markets (both carbon and water quality markets).\n5 Additionality is an important policy concern in the establishment of environmental markets. Two alternative interpretations of additionality in environmental services are employed in the analysis below. The first interpretation is based on financial additionality: an increase in the number of participating farmers in the carbon market due to the possibility of stacking water-quality credits. Providing more revenue from stacked water-quality credits makes participation in the carbon market profitable for those farmers who would not have participated without the possibility to stack water-quality credits. The second interpretation for additionality used in this analysis is inter-market additionality, which requires that farmers who are willing to sell water-quality offsets need to employ abatement practices that go beyond those required by participation in the carbon-offset market. One possibility to increase the use of abating inputs is to establish vegetated field strips (buffer strips) between waterways and the field parcel. These can very effectively reduce both soil erosion and nutrient runoff."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "Water quality credits from no-till adoption depend on whether nitrogen or phosphorus or both are traded and the trading ratio needs to reflect the fact that no-till may increase dissolved phosphorus runoff."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": "Note that by assumption a carbon market is the primary market in this analysis and thus the possibility of participating just in the water quality market is not analysed here.\nOffsets produced, CO2-eq. tons "}, {"section_title": "A. Financial additionality", "text": "Let the price of water-quality offsets be \u03c4. It was discussed above that in both high productivity land and low productivity land farmers with transaction costs higher than threshold value do not participate in the carbon markets. When stacking of water-quality offsets is allowed and farmers get additional revenue from water-quality offsets, the new threshold level of transaction costs increases by the value of water-quality offsets. The supply of water-quality offsets, \u03b2, from increased participation in carbon markets depends on its own price and the carbon price. The impact of an increase in the price of water-quality offsets increases participation and the supply of water-quality offsets. The impact of a higher carbon price is generally ambiguous due to two opposing mechanisms. A higher carbon-offset price invites more farmers to participate in the carbon market. This reduces the number of participating farmers in water-quality offset markets. This impact is counter-affected by the further decrease in fertilizer use intensity, which increases water quality offsets for a given water offset price. If the former dominates, the supply of water-quality offsets decreases, but if the latter one dominates then it increases. In the special case the two opposing effects may offset each other and the supply of carbon offsets does not change. Whether the increased revenue from water-quality offsets dominates depends largely on the distribution of transaction costs. Water-quality offset supply decreases if differences between transaction costs increase sharply at the tail of the distribution. Thus, in the general case an increase in the carbon price may increase, decrease or maintain the supply of water quality offsets. Figure 6 illustrates these possibilities. In the left-hand side panel, carbon price increases from b to b* (for simplicity carbon price is treated as exogenous). Supply of carbon offsets adjusts along the supply curve and the amount of supplied carbon offsets shifts from Q to Q*. In the right-hand side panel, the original equilibrium in the water quality offset market is given by price \u03c4 and amount of offsets A. Increasing carbon price may lead to three alternative equilibria: equilibrium remains constant or the supply function shifts upwards or downwards. Analysis becomes more complicated when the possibility of project quality differentiation is allowed so that combination of practices generates higher level of offsets and not only participation rate but also conservation and input use intensities change. "}, {"section_title": "B. Inter-market additionality", "text": "A participating farmer may optimize fertilizer intensity and tillage method for both carbon and water quality offset markets in order to achieve a greater revenue stream from offsets. To this end the farmer is allowed to establish a vegetated field strip to support the production of both carbon and water quality benefits on working cropland. The baseline for the carbon markets is the same as above but the baseline for the water quality offset markets changes. This baseline must account for the fact that farmers participating in carbon markets produce additional benefits above the level determined by optimal input use for participation in carbon markets in the absence of water quality offsets. Thus, the new baseline in water quality offset markets is defined by fertilizer intensity under participation in carbon markets in the absence of water quality offset markets.\nThe farmer chooses both fertilizer intensity and filter strip width so as to maximize profits. The optimal fertilizer intensity is now smaller than in the case where fertilizer use was optimized only in terms of carbon benefits. The vegetated field strip width depends on the establishment cost of the practice, the foregone income lost from cultivation and on the revenue from carbon offsets and water quality offsets. A field strip is only established provided the return to its establishment is high enough. If a field strip is established, only part of the parcel is allocated to it, because the marginal increase of produced water quality offsets decreases with the width of the field strip. Both choices provided indicate increased use of abating inputs and higher quality of the project in terms of environmental benefits.\nAs before, a farmer compares profits under nonparticipation and participation and is indifferent between them at the threshold value of transaction costs. Given that farmers are allowed to optimize both fertilizer application and field strip establishment under a positive water quality offset price, the number of participating farmers increases and the practice adoption supplies more carbon offsets and water quality offsets than in the previous cases. Supply of carbon offsets expands with carbon price as before. Furthermore, carbon offset supply expands also with the higher water quality offset price. In both cases, the number of farmers participating in carbon markets increases and farmers increase use of abating inputs. Figure 7 illustrates the impact of water quality offset price on carbon offset supply.\nFrom Figure 7 , an increase in the price of water quality offsets shifts the carbon supply curve outwards so that the equilibrium carbon price decreases and the amount supplied to the market increases. Water quality offset supply increases in offset price via two mechanisms: increased participation and increased use of abating inputs.\nAn increase in the carbon offset price has an impact through multiple channels. Higher carbon price increases the number of those farmers who would participate even without water quality offsets, which decreases water quality offset supply. But it also increases the number of those farmers for whom participation in the carbon market is profitable only with the water quality offset. Depending on which impact dominates, this effect is either positive or negative. Higher carbon price increases the use of both abating inputs, which tends to increase supply of water quality offsets. Again, all possibilities are present: supply of water quality offsets may increase, decrease or remain constant. Relative to the previous case, however, an increasing supply impact is more likely.

It is worth noting that the share of conservation tillage (reduced tillage and no-till combined) is already very high in the baseline in every Region, exceeding 82%.\nAggregate corn production and farmers' profits are significantly higher on NonHEL lands, especially in Regions 1 and 2. As already indicated by per acre results, soil carbon sequestration exceeds CO2-eq emissions from fertilizer and cultivation practices, and nitrogen runoff dominates negative environmental effects based on damage costs assumptions in the analysis. However, ex-post social welfare estimates are driven largely by profitability of production. With the largest land area and mean productivity, Region 2 has the largest aggregate profits and net-environmental damage, but also the highest ex-post social welfare effects. "}, {"section_title": "Carbon offset markets", "text": "As discussed in the conceptual framework it is assumed here that if a farmer wishes to participate in voluntary carbon markets, three measures are available to generate carbon offsets from crop cultivation. First, the farmer may reduce fertilizer intensity below the baseline optimum under each tillage method (conventional, reduced, and no-till) in order to reduce N 2 O emissions. Second, the farmer can switch from conventional and reduced tillage to no-till. Third, a farmer can allocate some field parcels to long-term green set-aside in order to sequester soil carbon.\nThe analysis further assumes that participation in carbon offset markets involves transaction costs (TCs) for farmers. Three levels of costs are assumed: TCs = 0, TCs = USD 1/acre, and TCs = USD 2/acre, reflecting a range of costs that might conceivably occur in the marketplace. In addition, farmer-specific randomised transaction costs are included in order to represent variation in farmers' cost of gathering and producing information on offset markets and implementing conservation measures needed to produce offsets.\nThe first option for producing CO 2 -eq offsets involves reduced nitrogen application levels and related reductions in applied phosphorus. It was assumed here that farmers reduce 30% of their nitrogen application in order to decrease N 2 O emissions.\n15 Although a 30% reduction in applied nitrogen is significant from a production and profits standpoint, it has only a small impact on N 2 O emissions. CO 2 -eq offsets provided by this option vary from 65 to 132 lbs/acre. In none of the cases does offset revenue compensate farmers' foregone profit and transaction costs of market participation, even with zero transaction costs and offset price as high as USD 100/ton of CO 2 -eq.\nSimilarly, establishment of green set-asides to produce CO 2 -eq offsets alone is not profitable for farmers in any of the cases. Farmers' profit foregone plus establishment cost of green set-aside are not compensated by offset revenue, even with TCs of zero and a carbon offset price of USD 100/ton of CO 2 -eq."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "Farmers' incentives for generating offsets through tillage system conversion vary across Regions. Without accounting transaction costs, a switch to no-till is profitable for conventional tillage and reduced tillage farmers only in Region 3 NonHEL lands with carbon offset prices starting from USD 3/ton of CO 2 -eq. With zero TCs, carbon offsets will be supplied from a total of 2.4 million acres, or 68% of NonHEL acreage in the region. With positive TCs, profitability of offset supply in the region decreases, and depending on the level of TCs and offset price, the share of participating parcels ranges between 8% and 13% (representing 1.7 -2.7 million acres). Figure 9 shows the total carbon offset supply as a function of offset price (between USD 3 and USD 100 per ton of CO 2 -eq) under differing cost assumptions regarding TCs. This figure clearly illustrates the impact of transaction costs on carbon offset supply.\nAs regards carbon offset markets and agricultural supply of carbon offsets in the case study the following observations can be drawn. First, due to the relatively small impact of applied nitrogen on N 2 O emissions and thus the small amount of offsets produced, reduced nitrogen application is not a profitable option for farmers without compensation for water quality offsets. Similarly, the establishment of green set-aside is not profitable without water quality offsets due to significant profit foregone. In contrast, a switch from conventional tillage and reduced tillage to no-till is profitable in some cases, although prevailing carbon offset prices and transaction costs have significant impact on the number of participating parcels. One reason why current carbon offset prices do not incentivize farmers to participate carbon offset markets without stacking is the fact that there is already widespread adoption of no-till in the baseline and consequently, marginally, switching additional acreage to no-till is much more costly. Overall one can argue that carbon offset markets with current offset prices do not adequately incentivize farmers to participate in environmental markets without the possibility of stacking water quality offsets. "}, {"section_title": "15.", "text": "Analysis assumes a 30% reduction of nitrogen application for each case considered. Another option would be to optimize the amount of reduced nitrogen application for each case with alternative levels of carbon offset price and transaction costs."}, {"section_title": "16.", "text": "Note that the current offset price is USD 3/ton of CO 2 -eq."}, {"section_title": "17.", "text": "Current carbon offset price is USD 3/ton of CO 2 -eq and social damage estimate is USD 24/ton of CO 2 -eq. So, there is a large difference between social value and market value of carbon offsets. Moreover, as shown in the analysis above even if carbon offsets prices would coincide with social value of CO2-eq emissions they would not be high enough to make adoption of the practices profitable without stacking of water quality credits. "}, {"section_title": "Water quality offset markets", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Financial additionality", "text": "As shown in the theoretical analysis, farmers' production choices regarding the supply of carbon offsets have implications for water quality. Reduced fertilizer use decreases nutrient runoff while no-till conversion and green set-aside reduce both soil erosion and nutrient runoff. With the added potential revenue from water quality offsets, farmers' participation in carbon offset market becomes more profitable. Thus, the possibility of selling co-benefit credits should enhance the profitability of carbon offset options (analysed in the preceding section) and potentially increases farmer participation in offset markets.\nAs regards water quality offsets, the following assumptions are made on the basis of the recent literature (O'Hara et al., 2012 and Pennvest, 2012) . Base prices for nutrient credits are fixed at USD 3/lbs of N and USD 4/lbs of P. Credit estimation and verification costs for farmer are assumed to be 5% of offset revenue and other transaction costs are set at USD 0.1/lbs of N and P.\nRecall that the first option to provide carbon offsets involves reduced nitrogen application level. Note that the baseline here is farmers' applied nitrogen without carbon offset sales since there was no carbon market participation in this option. The potential to sell water quality offsets increases the profitability of adopting reduced nitrogen application. This option is especially profitable for continuous corn rotations on NonHEL lands but also on HEL lands. Overall this option is profitable for 21% of field parcels, representing 4.6 million acres, with offset prices of USD 3/lbs of N and USD 4/lbs of P. Reduction in offset prices decreases the number of participating parcels while an increase in prices expands participation. For offset prices from USD 1 to USD 4/lbs N and from USD 2 to USD 4/lbs P the number of participating parcels ranges between 9% and 38% across all regions.\nWith the possibility of selling water quality offsets, the establishment of green set-aside becomes profitable for highly erodible lands within the lowest productivity Region 3. Total number of participating parcels is 48 000 acres representing 0.2% of the total acreage in the study with offset prices of USD 3/lbs of N and USD 4/lbs of P. These offset prices may be viewed as minimum prices for farmer participation, since with lower prices the participation rate in the carbon market falls to zero. With higher offset prices of USD 4/lbs of N and USD 5/lbs of P, acreage in participating parcels increases up to 1.34 million acres representing 6.1% of total acreage. Hence, in the case of green set aside, allowing sale of water quality offsets increases farmer participation in carbon offset markets and as a result total carbon offset supply increases."}, {"section_title": "Inter-market additionality", "text": "Establishing vegetative buffer strips between field parcels and watercourses represents inter-market additionality, since new abatement practices and abating inputs are employed that exceed the requirements of carbon-market participation. The analysis assumes that a participating farmer establishes a buffer strip to supply both carbon and water quality offsets. Note that streamside buffer strips were not an option in the case of carbon offset markets without water quality offsets, and thus the baseline for buffer strips is the same for both carbon and water quality offset markets. It is assumed here that buffer strips cover 1.5% of the field parcel area (equivalent to 1.5 meter buffer in a field 100m*100m in size). It is further assumed that 10% of field parcels in the modelled area are bordering surface water courses, which provides a rationale for field strip establishment from a water quality viewpoint. With prevailing offset prices of USD 3/lbs of N and USD 4/lbs of P, field strip establishment would be profitable in 29% of field parcels in the modelled area. However, taking into account the criterion of field parcel proximity to surface water reduces the total acreage affected to 3% of field parcels. Due to effectiveness of vegetated field strips in nutrient runoff reduction and the relatively small profit foregone, incentives for establishment are highest on HEL lands and they are established even with the lowest nutrient credit prices (USD 1/lbs of N and USD 2/lbs of P). Total carbon offset supply increases by 4% with buffer strip establishment (their technical sequestration potential being similar to green set-aside per unit land area). Figures 10 and 11 show the total supply of nitrogen and phosphorus credits under various credit prices, aggregated across the three model regions.\nDemand functions for water-quality credits were derived based on reported N and P credit prices in a water-quality trading clearinghouse established in Pennsylvania (O'Hara et al., 2012) . Because of the size of the modelled regions, nutrient credit supply easily leads to oversupply of credits and a resulting reduction in equilibrium credit prices. For example, the nitrogen credit supply from reduced fertilizer use alone would reduce equilibrium market price from USD 3.7/lbs N to USD 2.1/lbs N. The phosphorus credit market is even thinner; P credit supply from reduced fertilizer use would decrease equilibrium market price from USD 4.3/lbs P to USD 1.2/lbs P."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Figure 12 shows farmers' profit increase (USD/acre) from the adoption of no-till as a function of CO 2 -eq offset price with and without possibility of stacking water quality credits from no-till adoption.

Table 3 provides a summary of aggregate results for acreage response, carbon offset and nutrient credit supply, and farm profits under various offset scenarios and environmental practices. Allowing stacking of water quality credits with carbon offsets has significant impact especially in the case of reduced fertilizer application. Recall that carbon offset revenue alone was not sufficient to compensate farmers' foregone profit and transaction costs of participating in carbon offset markets, even with zero transaction costs and a carbon offset price as high as USD 100/ton of CO 2 -eq. Allowing stacking of water quality credits makes it a profitable option, with adoption on 21% of total modelled acreage. Due to the large acreage affected, this option results in the highest carbon offset and nutrient credit supply as well as the greatest increase in aggregated farm profit. Note: Acreage response for vegetated field strips represents acreage with vegetated field strips. Effective vegetated field strip area is 0.009 million acres (1.5% of 0.6 million acres).\nSimilarly, while carbon offsets alone do not provide sufficient incentives for adoption of vegetated field strips and green set-asides, the stacking of water quality credits make them profitable option. Despite the fact that only small acreages are affected, these measures contribute relatively significant levels of both carbon offsets and nutrient credits. "}, {"section_title": "Potential non-additional carbon offsets due to stacking", "text": "Inter-market additionality analysis in this paper has been based on the assumption that a farmer can either participate in one market (the carbon market) or multiple markets (both carbon and water quality markets). If two markets exist, however, a farmer has usually the option to participate in one (e.g. carbon) or the other market (e.g. water-quality), and if stacking is allowed and a farmer participates in both markets then a question of inter-market additionality in offsets and credits produced arises. If a farmer can participate in just the water-quality market then part of the carbon-offsets supply would come from farmers participating in just the water-quality market and if the adoption of a particular environmental practice is profitable for them solely on the basis of credit revenue from the water-quality market then these carbon offsets are not additional to the carbon market and the stacked payment. Allowing stacking in this situation would result in non-additional credits from an inter-market additionality perspective. In fact, in most of the cases analysed in this section (reduced nitrogen application, the establishment of green set-asides and vegetated field strips) participation in the water-quality market alone supplies most of the carbon offsets and thus from an inter-market additionality viewpoint these offsets cannot be considered additional to the carbon market and the stacked payment."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and policy implications", "text": "The key policy question addressed in this paper is whether a single agri-environmental practice should be allowed to earn credits from multiple environmental markets when the economic and environmental performance of these markets is considered. The case of interlinked carbon offset and water quality credit market is investigated. The choice of alternative soil carbon sequestration practices and incentives to participate voluntarily in carbon offset markets is examined with and without a possibility of selling water quality credits. Farmers' incentives to participate in environmental credit markets are affected by opportunity costs of practice adoption, revenue from environmental credits, and transaction costs.\nA conceptual analysis shows that credit stacking increases farmer participation in carbon offset markets and through increased participation provides additional environmental services. Credit stacking also provides incentives for adoption of more environmentally effective practices due to credit revenue from water quality offsets. It was further shown that environmental markets are interlinked so that credit price changes in one market impact credit supply and the equilibrium credit price in another market.\nThe empirical application of the model was based on data estimates for the US Corn Belt region. In the empirical application, the Baseline scenario without carbon and water quality offset markets was analysed first. Both corn yields and farmers' profits exhibit significant heterogeneity between the regions. Net GHG emissions are negative in each model region, since CO 2 -eq emissions from cultivation practices and fertilizer application are smaller than soil carbon sequestration. All runoff types (sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus) vary between regions and especially between highly and non-highly erodible lands. An ex-post social welfare calculation shows that agriculture's aggregate net environmental impact is negative but the profitability of production makes ex-post social welfare clearly positive.\nFarmers had several options to sequester carbon and reduce GHG emissions in order to supply carbon offsets: reduced fertilizer application, a switch from conventional and reduced tillage to no-till, establishment of green set-asides and the establishment of streamside buffer strips. The following conclusions arise from analysis related to carbon offset markets without the possibility of stacking water quality credits. Provision of CO 2 -eq offsets through a reduction in applied nitrogen is not profitable without water quality offsets, since the impact of nitrogen application on N 2 O emissions is relatively small and as a result offset supply and offset revenue are small relative to profit foregone even with highest offset prices. Similarly due to significant profit foregone the establishment of green set-asides is not profitable without water quality offsets. Only a switch from conventional tillage and reduced tillage to no-till is profitable in some cases. However, carbon offset prices and transaction costs have a significant impact on the number of participating parcels and current CO 2 -eq offset prices do not provide strong incentives for farmers to participate in carbon offset markets without stacking of water quality offsets.\nWhen farmers are allowed to stack water quality credits the profitability of carbon sequestration practices increases. Reduced nitrogen application levels becomes the profitable option and 21% of field parcels participate in the market when water quality offset prices are at current levels of USD 3/lb for N and USD 4/lb for P. Also the establishment of green setasides and streamside buffer strips becomes profitable in lowest productivity and highly erodible lands with current offset prices. Farmers' high participation rate may, however, result in an oversupply of nutrient credits and significantly affect equilibrium prices of nutrient credits. For example, N credit supply from the reduced fertilizer use alone would reduce equilibrium market price for N from USD 3.7/lb down to USD 2.1/lb. The phosphorus credit market is even smaller and the P credit supply from reduced fertilizer use would decrease equilibrium market price from USD 4.3/lb down to USD 1.2/lb.\nTo conclude, analysis shows that allowing stacking of water quality credits provides additional environmental services through increased participation of farmers in carbon offset markets and through increased adoption of environmental practices that are effective in promoting both carbon offsets and nutrient credits. The agri-environmental practices considered in this study (reduced fertilizer use, vegetated field strips, green set-asides and notill) are widely used across OECD countries to achieve environmental goals for water quality and greenhouse gas mitigation. While their opportunity costs and effectiveness in promoting supply of carbon offsets and nutrient credits vary over space, some general conclusions and policy implications can be drawn. First, current CO 2 -eq offset prices do not necessarily compensate the foregone profit resulting from practice adoption. Allowing stacking of water quality credits and potentially government incentive payments makes adoption more profitable. Stacking of government agri-environmental payments with environmental credits would increase farmer participation in both government conservation programmes and environmental markets while providing additional income for farmers. Secondly, if environmental markets are small, with limited local demand for credits, then stacking may lead to an oversupply of credits and resulting declines in equilibrium credit prices. As a consequence, environmental practices that may have been profitable to adopt with credits from one market may require sale of credits to several markets in order to cover adoption costs of the practice."}]
