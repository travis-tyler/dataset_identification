Functional decline is associated with risk and can be efficiently assessed by participants and study partners (SPs). We tested the hypothesis that SP-reported functional decline is an independent predictor of dementia risk and cognitive decline. Methods: In 1048 older adults in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we measured associations between Everyday Cognition Scale scores (ECog, self-and SP-reported versions) and (1) baseline and longitudinal change in neuropsychological test (NPT scores) across multiple cognitive domains; (2) diagnostic conversion to MCI or dementia. Models included Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score and ApoE e4 genotype (APOE) as predictors. Model fits were compared with and without predictors of interest included. Results: SP-reported ECog was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline across multiple domains, as well as diagnostic conversion. Self-reported ECog was associated with baseline NPT scores in some cognitive domains, and diagnostic conversion to MCI in participants with biomarker evidence for AD (elevated brain b-amyloid, Ab). Models including SP-reported ECog were significantly stronger at predicting outcomes. Conclusions: SP-reported functional decline is an independent indicator of cognitive decline and dementia risk, even when accounting for cognitive screening, genetic risk, demographics, and self-report decline. The results provide a rationale for greater utilization of SP-reported functional decline to identify those at risk for dementia due to AD and other causes. 2448"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Identification of individuals at risk for cognitive decline, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia, including dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a critical need. In older adults, functional decline is associated with AD pathology, [1] [2] [3] ,and predicts future decline and disease progression. 4 Furthermore, preservation of everyday functioning is important to patients and their families. 5 Subjective functional decline can be measured by asking the individual him/herself or a study partner (SP) about recent changes in activities of daily living.\nA number of validated instruments that measure subjective decline are used in AD clinical trials and research studies. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] SP report of decline is associated with magnitude of cognitive impairment determined from neuropsychological test (NPT) assessment, 12, 13 and with diagnosis of MCI and dementia due to AD. 10, [13] [14] [15] [16] SP report of impairment is associated moderately with abnormal levels of AD biomarkers, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) b-amyloid (Ab) burden, and regional brain volume 1, [17] [18] [19] ; although some studies fail to find such a relationship. 20 Thus, there is accumulating evidence that the SP report of functional and cognitive abilities can provide important information for early identification of preclinical AD and for predicting objective cognitive status. The same relationship is not observed as consistently for self-reported subjective cognitive and functional decline, where factors such as depressed mood [21] [22] [23] and lack of awareness associated with dementia 13,24,25 limit its usefulness.\nAlthough previous studies have examined the association between SP-reported cognitive and functional information and various outcomes related to cognitive decline and progression along the dementia disease continuum, the additional predictive power of SP-report compared to other predictors has not been established. Understanding this is important because it will indicate whether the SP report, in the absence of additional clinical measures, can help identify those at risk for or with disease. Such findings would support the approach of several initiatives to identify people at risk remotely, such as through registries, 26 including remotely collected, SP-reported Everyday Cognition scale (SP-ECog). 27 Determining the predictive value of SP-reported functional decline is likely to facilitate screening and recruitment for AD clinical trials, screening of older adults at risk for AD dementia and other dementias in various healthcare settings, and identification of individuals who are good candidates to receive future novel treatments. We investigated this issue using SP report of functional decline in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Novel aspects of our approach include (1) use of the ECog, which measures SP-and self-reported subjective decline in instrumental activities of daily living that map to multiple cognitive domains; (2) inclusion of cognitive screening tool (Mini Mental Status Exam, MMSE) and genetic risk (APOE) in our multivariable models; and (3) analysis of the association between baseline SP report of subjective decline and future decline in NPT scores across multiple domains. We tested the a priori hypotheses that: SP-ECog is significantly associated with baseline and longitudinal change in NPT scores, and diagnostic conversion from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to MCI or MCI to dementia. (2) SP-ECog is significantly associated with outcomes, even when accounting for self-reported ECog (Self-ECog), MMSE, APOE, and participant demographics; (3) Models without SP-ECog are significantly less powerful than those with SP-ECog at predicting outcomes; (4) SP-ECog is associated with cognitive decline and diagnostic conversion in Ab+ participants. Analyses of associations in Ab+ participants allow us to address the extent to which SP-report subjective decline, measured by ECog, can specifically identify cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia that is likely due to AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this manuscript were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Each model included random intercepts and time effects, main effect terms for Self-ECog, SP-ECog, age, education, MMSE, gender and APOE status, and interactions of each predictor with time. The time by predictor interaction terms were used to assess the magnitude of the association of each predictor with change in NPT score. Trails A and B scores were log transformed and estimates back transformed to percentage effect. We also performed similar analyses in a cohort limited to Ab+ participants. We accounted for multiple comparisons (multiple NPTs) using false discovery rate analysis.\nPrevious studies found associations between subjective decline and baseline cognition, 13 or between cognitive complaints and NPT decline in CU and MCI. 20, 39 Novel aspects of our study were identification of associations between subjective decline and decline in NPT scores across multiple cognitive domains; inclusion of many years of longitudinal NPT scores; use of the ECog, which measures changes in activities of daily living that map to multiple cognitive domains; and the use of multivariable models accounting for APOE, MMSE, and participant demographics. Several interesting findings emerged from this approach. In CU, participants themselves more accurately identified their current memory and verbal fluency abilities compared to their SPs (Fig. 1B) , but SPs were better than participants in identifying low baseline attention and executive function (Trails A and B), as well as predicting decline in overall cognition and memory (Fig. 1A) . These results are novel and surprising, and do not support our a priori hypothesis that in CU participants, who are not likely to lack insight about their own functioning level, Results of linear mixed effects models measuring the associations between the variables of age, gender, education, APOE, and MMSE; and change in NPT scores (columns) broken down by diagnostic group (CU, MCI).

Edu, Education; Age, advanced age was associated with greater decline in NPT scores; APOE, APOE+ was associated with greater decline in NPT scores; MMSE, lower MMSE scores were associated with greater decline in NPT scores; Male, greater decline in NPTs in males; Female, greater decline in NPTs in females. participant self-report and SP-report would be equally predictive of cognitive status and decline. Our findings contrast those of, 40 which found that self-reported subjective cognitive concerns predict future cognitive decline in the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). The differences may stem from differences in instruments used (ECog vs. Subjective Cognitive Complaints; individual NPTs vs. PACC) and in the study population.\nIn MCI, SP-ECog scores were significantly associated with most baseline and longitudinal scores. Thus, in MCI SP-report outperforms self-report in identifying cognitive status across multiple cognitive domains, including memory. Surprisingly, there were no significant associations between participants' self report of decline and actual decline in any NPTs for CU or MCI. (Fig. 1A) . Our findings argue for greater reliance on SPs to recognize early changes in everyday functioning that map to future cognitive decline. Such information can be used to identify CU individuals at risk for cognitive decline for clinical trials and in various healthcare settings.\nTo determine the extent to which subjective decline, measured by ECog, specifically identifies cognitive decline associated with increased risk for AD, we measured the associations between ECog and NPT scores in Ab+ participants. There were three major findings from these analyses. First, associations between SP-ECog and cognitive decline in Ab+ CU closely matched the associations found in the entire MCI group. This can be explained by the fact that Ab+ CU have worse prognoses in terms of cognitive decline, and therefore more closely resemble MCI participants.\nSecond, in Ab+ participants, for some NPTs, participants who self-reported greater decline had significantly less objective decline in NPT scores over time. In MCI, this inverse relationship between self-reported decline and actual decline in MCI is likely due to loss of insight about one's own level of functioning. However, the inverse relationship between self-report decline and actual decline in Ab+ CU is surprising, and its cause requires further exploration. Ab+ CU older adults are unlikely to have impairments affecting their insight about recent changes in their functional abilities. Their failure to report changes that reflect actual changes in cognition may therefore be due to other factors, such as anxiety or denial about recent changes in function.\nThird, in Ab+ MCI, significant associations between SP-reported ECog and decline in NPT scores were restricted to ADAS13 and a few memory tests. This contrasts with findings in the overall MCI cohort, in which SP-ECog is also significantly associated with decline in executive function (Trails) and lexical retrieval (Boston Naming). This finding may reflect the fact that the Ab+ MCI groups are more amnestic than the overall MCI cohort. This idea is described in more detail below.\nA major goal of this work was to assess the predictive power of SP-ECog in relation to other variables. We found that in MCI, advanced age was significantly associated with greater decline in multiple NPTs, and females had significantly greater decline in some NPTs (Table 2) . Conversely, MMSE, APOE, and education had limited predictive power, as shown by the lack of significant associations between these variables and longitudinal change in NPTs in our multivariable models. Therefore, in predicting future cognitive decline, subjective decline eclipses the contribution of genetic risk and cognitive screening instrument in identifying older adults at risk. These findings, argue compellingly for the use of SP-reported decline to identify older adults at risk for cognitive decline, including CU individuals."}, {"section_title": "Associations with diagnostic conversion", "text": "Weibull survival regression models were used to accommodate interval censored observations. 38 We did not observe the exact dates of conversion, only that the conversion happened between two study visits. To assess the associations of longitudinal changes in ECog with conversion, we obtained participant-specific changes in each ECog variable by fitting linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes and time as the single predictor with each ECog variable as an outcome.\nPrevious reports demonstrate that SP report of memory problems could distinguish CU from dementia due to AD and predict future diagnosis of AD dementia. 41, 42 Few studies have explored the relationship between ECog and diagnostic conversion. 14 In addition to the use of the ECog, the novelty of our multivariable approach was to identify the relative predictive power of subjective decline compared to other variables. We found that SP-ECog was the strongest predictor of diagnostic conversion from CU to MCI or from MCI to dementia, compared to other variables. Furthermore, removing SP-ECog from the models resulted in a significant decrease in the predictive power of both models.\nIn order to determine the ability of SP-ECog and other predictors to specifically identify risk of conversion to MCI or dementia likely due to AD, we performed the same analyses in only Ab+ participants. In the Ab+ subgroup, only Self-ECog significantly predicted conversion to MCI, whereas, SP-ECog was significantly associated with conversion from MCI to dementia. Therefore, self report of subjective decline has a unique ability to predict conversion in Ab+ CU. No variables other than ECog were significantly associated with CU to MCI conversion. The results argue for greater utilization of both self-reported and SP-reported subjective decline to identify older adults at risk for MCI likely due to AD.\nWhat is the underlying cause of different results when we consider only Ab+ individuals? A simple interpretation is that, since Ab+ participants decline more than Ab-participants, the association between predictors and outcomes is stronger in Ab+ participants. As described above, this could explain why SP-ECog is more strongly associated with cognitive decline in Ab+ CU. But why, then, is SP-ECog more strongly associated with diagnostic conversion to MCI in the overall cohort versus the Ab+ subgroup? SP-ECog may be detecting changes that lead to decline in cognition and conversion to MCI that is not due to AD, but is instead due to other causes. A related idea is that the ability of study partners to detect functional decline is somewhat cognitive domain specific. Although all ADNI MCI participants meet criteria for amnestic MCI, Ab-participants are likely to be less amnestic than those who are Ab+. SPs may be better able to predict conversion from CU to MCI in Ab-participants because SPs can detect decline in domains other than memory, such as language, and attention. Some recent evidence supports the idea of domain specificity in subjective decline. 43, 44 Further studies exploring the relationship between SP-reported subjective decline across different domains and AD related outcomes, including biomarkers other than Ab, are necessary to address these issues."}, {"section_title": "Likelihood ratio tests", "text": "For the Weibull survival models described above, three variations of each model were run (1) "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Associations between subjective decline and neuropsychological test scores", "text": "Overall results\nWe measured associations between ECog and NPT scores (baseline and longitudinal change in scores) in CU and MCI participants.
