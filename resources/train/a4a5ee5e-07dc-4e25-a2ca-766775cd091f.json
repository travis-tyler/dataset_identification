It is unclear, however, whether such changes begin before the clinical onset of the disease.\nOBJECTIVE To determine whether increases in neuroticism, declines in conscientiousness, and changes in other personality traits occur before the onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia.\nA cohort of 2046 community-dwelling older adults who volunteered to participate in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging were included. The study examined personality and clinical assessments obtained between 1980 and July 13, 2016, from participants with no cognitive impairment at first assessment who were followed up for as long as 36 years (mean [SD], 12.05 [9.54] years). The self-report personality scales were not considered during consensus diagnostic conferences.\nChange in self-rated personality traits assessed in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer disease and other dementias with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, a 240-item questionnaire that assesses 30 facets, 6 for each of the 5 major dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.\nOf the 2046 participants, 931 [45.5%] were women; mean (SD) age at first assessment was 62.56 (14.63) years. During 24 569 person-years, mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 104 (5.1%) individuals, and all-cause dementia was diagnosed in 255 (12.5%) participants, including 194 (9.5%) with Alzheimer disease. Multilevel modeling that accounted for age, sex, race, and educational level found significant differences on the intercept of several traits: individuals who developed dementia scored higher on neuroticism (\u03b2 = 2.83; 95% CI, 1.44 to 4.22; P < .001) and lower on conscientiousness (\u03b2 = \u22123.34; 95% CI, \u22124.93 to \u22121.75; P < .001) and extraversion (\u03b2 = \u22121.74; 95% CI, \u22123.23 to \u22120.25; P = .02). Change in personality (ie, slope), however, was not significantly different between the nonimpaired and the Alzheimer disease groups (eg, neuroticism: \u03b2 = 0.00; 95% CI, \u22120.08 to 0.08; P =.91; conscientiousness: \u03b2 = \u22120.06; 95% CI, \u22120.16 to 0.04; P = .24). Slopes for individuals who developed mild cognitive impairment (eg, neuroticism: \u03b2 = 0.00; 95% CI, \u22120.12 to 0.12; P = .98; conscientiousness: \u03b2 = \u22120.09; 95% CI, \u22120.23 to 0.05; P = .18) and all-cause dementia (eg, neuroticism: \u03b2 = 0.02; 95% CI, \u22120.06 to 0.10; P = .49; conscientiousness: \u03b2 = \u22120.08; 95% CI, \u22120.16 to 0.00; P = .07) were also similar to those for nonimpaired participants.\nNo evidence for preclinical change in personality before the onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia was identified. These findings provide evidence against the reverse causality hypothesis and strengthen evidence for personality traits as a risk factor for dementia."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "C hanges in personality and behavior are one clinical criterion for the diagnosis of dementia.\n1 Little is known, however, as to whether personality changes before the onset of clinical dementia. The neuropathologic processes that underlie Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias start years before onset of clinical dementia. [2] [3] [4] It is, therefore, possible that changes in personality (eg, loss of motivation or increased irritability) might be an early sign of AD that precedes the onset of cognitive and functional impairment. Consistent with diagnostic criteria, 1 change in personality traits is commonly observed by caregivers after the onset of clinical dementia. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Several studies have asked family members to rate the care recipient's personality before and after the onset of dementia and have consistently found large changes on the 5 major dimensions of personality, especially for neuroticism and conscientiousness. 9 These informant-based retrospective studies, however, cannot determine the timing of personality change, and the changes may have occurred after the onset of cognitive impairment. A few studies suggest that personality might change even before the onset of clinical dementia. 10, 11 Previous prospective studies have either not assessed all 5 major dimensions of personality or the assessments were close to the diagnosis of dementia (within 2 years or at the time), 12, 13 which blurs the distinction between personality change that occurs before the onset of cognitive impairment with changes during the dementia prodrome or at the time of diagnosis. The present study examined personality change before the onset of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or all-cause dementia in an ongoing longitudinal study of older adults who have completed a 5-factor model personality questionnaire 14 since 1980. Using data up to 3 decades before onset of the disease, we tested the hypothesis that individuals later diagnosed with AD would show greater changes in personality before symptom onset compared with unaffected individuals (Figure 1 ). In particular, we expected increases in neuroticism and declines in conscientiousness 9 as early signs of the underlying neurodegeneration before the onset of clinical symptoms of dementia. We focused on AD because it is the most common cause of dementia but also examined change before the onset of MCI and all-cause dementia. In addition to the 5 major traits, we examined changes in 30 facets of personality to provide a detailed account of personality change. This research advances knowledge on the preclinical course of a psychological feature that is altered by AD. It also provides a test of whether reverse causality may explain the association between personality traits and risk of AD and dementia found in prospective studies. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] That is, if there is evidence that personality traits change before the onset of dementia, it could indicate that the personality traits associated with AD are a consequence of the neuropathologic process rather than independent risk factors for AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) began to study physical and cognitive changes associated with aging in 1958. 21 The BLSA is carried out by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging. Healthy individuals of different ages are continuously enrolled in the study and assessed with regular follow-up visits. Current follow-up care occurs annually for individuals aged 80 years or older, biennially for those aged 60 to 79 years, and every 4 years for younger participants. Eligibility criteria have been reported. 22 The BLSA participants receive an in-depth physical and cognitive evaluation and complete a detailed personality assessment. Participants provide written informed consent approved by the National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board. The analyses in this article were also approved by the Florida State University Institutional Review Board. Participants do not receive financial compensation. We excluded 536 individuals from an initial sample of 2582 individuals with personality data (Figure 2 ). Participants were excluded mainly because they were younger than 50 years at the last personality assessment or because they completed the personality questionnaire only after the onset of cognitive impairment (ie, MCI or dementia). Because we were interested in changes in the preclinical phase of the disease, we also excluded all personality assessments that occurred in the year of the disease onset or after. We replaced missing education information with the sample mean for 6 nonimpaired individuals.

"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "The primary aim was to examine the course of personality change before the onset of symptoms of MCI or dementia.\nWe used multilevel modeling (ie, hierarchical linear modeling [HLM] 30 ), also known as mixed models or growth curve analysis, to estimate the trajectory of each trait. In HLM, the number and spacing of measurement observations may vary across individuals given that the time-series observations for each person are used to estimate the individual's trajectory (level 1), and those individual parameters are the basis of group estimates (level 2). Using HLM, we examined the association between cognitive status and the intercept and slope of each personality trait, with primary interest in the slope (ie, the rate of change). For individuals who developed MCI or dementia, time was coded as time to onset of MCI, with the year of onset coded as 0. For individuals who remained nonimpaired, time was set as 0 for the date of the most recent personality assessment. With this coding, the intercept parameters refer to the most recent assessment and not the usual baseline. The nonimpaired cohort was the reference group in all analyses. The primary analyses examined the effect of AD on the intercept and slope of each trait; MCI and dementia other than AD were excluded from this analysis. Then we examined a broader model that included all-cause dementia and MCI. To examine whether changes from the NEO-PI (1980 -1986 to NEO-PI-R (1989 -2016 had an effect on the results, we excluded the 1980-1986 assessments in sensitivity analyses. We included participants with only 1 personality assessment in the HLM models because such information can contribute to more robust HLM estimates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether the results were similar when excluding cases with only 1 assessment. All models included age, age squared sex, race, and educational level as covariates for the intercept and slope because these demographic variables have been associated with both personality and risk of dementia. Age in decade and educational level were grand-mean centered. Because we expected the changes in personality to accelerate in the last few years before the onset of cognitive impairment (Figure 1) , we repeated the analyses by estimating models with curvilinear slopes (ie, time squared). We also plotted personality trajectories based on the last 2 assessments. Using these last 2 assessments, we evaluated rank-order stability to test whether it declines in the preclinical phase."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Descriptive statistics for the overall sample and by cognitive status are presented in Table 2 reports estimates from the HLM analysis. The basic parameters for the slope indicated that, in the reference group, there were small declines in neuroticism, extraversion, and openness and small increases in agreeableness and conscientiousness. These patterns are consistent with previous reports. 31 We tested our primary hypothesis by comparing the personality trajectory of the nonimpaired group with the trajectories of the AD group. Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no significant differences in the rates of change between the nonimpaired and AD groups for neuroticism (\u03b2 = 0.00; 95% CI, \u22120.08 to 0.08; P = .91), conscientiousness (\u03b2 = \u22120.06; 95% CI, \u22120.16 to 0.04; P = .24), and the other personality traits.

The trajectory of personality traits and facets for individuals who were later diagnosed with MCI or dementia did not differ significantly from that of nonimpaired older adults. We further found that personality remained stable even within the last few years before the onset of the disease, and the high rank-order correlations supported the reliability of the data. However, we found differences of approximately 0.3 SD between the AD and nonimpaired groups on the intercept of neuroticism and conscientiousness, which were not an emerging prodromal sign of the disease and were consistent with results from other prospective studies. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] These findings provide evidence against the reverse causality hypothesis as an explanation for the association between personality and risk of incident dementia. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] From a clinical perspective, these findings suggest that tracking change in selfrated personality as an early indicator of dementia is unlikely to be fruitful, while a single assessment provides reliable information on the personality traits that increase resilience (eg, conscientiousness) or vulnerability (eg, neuroticism) to clinical dementia. This research has relevance to the question of reverse causality for the association between personality and risk of incident AD. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] That is, if personality changed in response to increasing neuropathology in the brain in the preclinical phase, the association between personality and AD could have been due to the disease process rather than personality as an independent risk factor. We did not, however, find any evidence that neuroticism and conscientiousness changed significantly as the onset of the disease approached. Thus, rather than an effect of AD neuropathology, these traits appear to confer risk for the development of the disease. Our findings are also relevant for delineating the natural history of personality change in relation to incident dementia and should be interpreted in the context of previous studies that have tracked the course of clinical and psychological traits before the onset of dementia. Weight loss and cognitive decline, for example, precede the onset of clinical dementia, 34-37 but evidence for changes in depressive symptoms in the prodromal phase of dementia is more mixed. 37-39 For personality traits, 2 previous studies reported that personality change preceded the clinical diagnosis. These studies, however, were based on items from the Blessed Dementia Scale or the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly. 10,11 These instruments are not standardized measures of major personality traits, and both instruments include questions about changes in personality that ask informants to make retrospective evaluations. It is unclear whether such retrospective evaluations are accurate. 40, 41 In a large study of healthy adults, for example, perception of personality change was mostly unrelated to actual change measured with prospective assessments."}, {"section_title": "41", "text": "Another important difference across personality studies is the use of self-report vs informant ratings.

Selfreported personality might remain stable and reflect premorbid functioning more than current traits. Contrary to this idea, however, there is evidence that self-report personality traits change with the onset of cognitive impairment and dementia: a large study has found that rank-order stability declines to r tt = 0.43 with the onset of dementia. 33 The present study extends knowledge by indicating that such changes do not begin in the preclinical phase of AD (r tt >0.80)."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "Among the strengths of the study are the prospective design, the long-term follow-up, the relatively large sample size, and the in-depth personality and clinical assessments.

The NEO PI R has been administered to BLSA participants since 1989. The analyses included 414 assessments from 1980 (NEO PI), 516 assessments from 1986 (NEO PI), and 7,735 assessments completed between 1989 and 2016 (NEO PI R). The NEO PI overlaps with the NEO PI R for neuroticism, extraversion, and openness items. However, in 1980 there were no items for agreeableness and conscientiousness, and in 1986 there were 18 items each for agreeableness and conscientiousness. To examine the comparability of scores on NEO PI R with the earlier NEO PI, we examined the correlation and the mean level differences between the 1986 scores and the first available NEO PI R scores (an average of 8.32 years later) in a sample of 380 participants with available data. The correlations were 0.78 for neuroticism, 0.83 for extraversion, 0.85 for openness, 0.67 for agreeableness, and 0.71 for conscientiousness (p < .01). There were small mean level differences between the 1986 NEO PI and the first available NEO PI R, with significantly higher extraversion (d =.14; p < .01) and lower openness (d =.10; p < .01) with the NEO PI R. For the other traits the differences were not significant, and overall these results suggest that the data across the two versions are comparable.\nTo examine the potential impact of change in the personality instrument, we repeated the primary analyses excluding the 1980 and 1986 assessments that used the earlier version of the NEO PI R. These sensitivity analyses were thus based on data from 1989 and later years all of which were collected with the same questionnaire, the NEO PI R. The results of these analyses were essentially identical to those found in the full sample (eTable 2). "}]
