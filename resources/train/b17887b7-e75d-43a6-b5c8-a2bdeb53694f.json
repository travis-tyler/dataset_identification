In both, cognitive symptoms worsen over time, where early symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can progress to dementia. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is considered an early clinical symptom in AD pathology, and in PD, early executive dysfunction is followed by deficits to visual spatial and memory domains [5] . However, there exists substantial individual variation in the type of cognitive presentation and rate and extent of progression.\nThe apolipoprotein-\u03b54 (APOE-\u03b54) allele is a genetic risk factor that may contribute to the manifestation of amnestic symptoms in both disorders. Individuals with a heterozygous-\u03b54 allele have a 47% increased risk of developing AD, whereas those with a homozygous-\u03b54 allele have a 91% increased risk [6, 7] . Healthy older adults with an APOE-\u03b54 allele require an increased area of cortical activity during cognitive tasks, suggesting a genetic link to neuropathological changes that precede cognitive symptoms [8] . More so, APOE-\u03b54 appears to account for memory-related cognitive dysfunction in PD [9, 10] , similar to that seen in aMCI attributed to AD pathology. Patients with PD with an \u03b54 allele have higher odds of developing dementia, lower scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and reduced episodic memory performance [6, 11, 12] . However, the causative role of APOE-\u03b54 on the development of PD-related dementia is still unknown, as some studies report a lack of association between the APOE-\u03b54 allele and PD-related dementia [13, 14] .\nAdvancing AD is accompanied by progressive neuropathological accumulation of b-amyloid and tau protein aggregates, whereas increased a-synuclein deposition, or Lewy bodies, accumulates in PD. In vivo cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) measures of b-amyloid (Ab 42 ), tau, and a-synuclein can inform concomitant neuropathologic accumulation in brain parenchyma, where reduced CSF levels of b-amyloid (Ab 42 ) appear quite reliable in assessing concomitant brain amyloid aggregation [15] . Indeed, b-amyloid (Ab 42 ) is a well-described contributor to disease pathologic progression of AD and reduced levels inform the risk of progression from aMCI to AD [16, 17] .\nBrain regions of the default mode network appear vulnerable to b-amyloid accumulation, especially in APOE-\u03b54 carriers [18, 19] , and symptoms of aMCI localize to this network. These regions include the posterior cingulate, medial frontal, and lateral parietal cortices, and diseaserelevant changes to this network are evident in both AD and PD [20] [21] [22] . In AD, reduced connectivity between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate accounts for aMCI presentation [21, 23, 24] . Likewise, patients with PD have reduced connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal regions [22] , and this appears responsive to dopamine therapy [25, 26] . A limited number of studies have investigated the association between APOE-\u03b54 and the default mode network region in PD either with respective to functional or structural integrity.\nIn this study, we compare morphometric measurements in the default mode network regions (no cerebellar regions were included) between cognitively normal older adults and aMCI subjects at risk of AD, as well as aMCI subjects at risk of PD. Our objective was to identify default mode network regions that show significant atrophy in the aMCI subjects (irrespective of disease origins, i.e., AD or PD) compared with cognitively normal older adults. This goal will identify common mechanisms that can be targeted for relief of similar amnestic symptoms in the future. A supplementary objective was to evaluate neuropathologic vulnerabilities associated with APOE-\u03b54 carrier status in individuals with aMCI.\nRecently, we investigated the differences in morphometric measurements due to variations in T1 imaging protocols in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Progressive Parkinson's Markers Initiative (PPMI) [27] [28] [29] [30] . These are public databases with imaging data for AD and PD. They provide an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses of pathological and systemic overlap in the two diseases. One challenge is the different imaging parameters in the two databases that may introduce a systematic bias and increased variability, thus negatively impacting the comparisons. We have identified data from the same scanner manufacturer with identical imaging parameters in the two databases that will be leveraged for this study."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI and PPMI databases 2.2. Subject selection and clinical phenotyping", "text": "All scans were baseline scans. ADNI comprises older adults at risk of AD, who are further subdivided into early MCI (EMCI), MCI, and late MCI (LMCI). Although the MCI classification is an older classification scheme, LMCI subjects have more severe cognitive deficits, less likely evident in early PD subjects from PPMI. Therefore, we restricted our sample to EMCI participants from ADNI but included all PD subjects from PPMI.\nDespite the large number of neuropsychological assessments in ADNI and PPMI, there is very little overlap [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Memory proficiency is assessed using delayed recall verbal learning tests: the Auditory Verbal Learning Test in ADNI and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test in PPMI [40, 41] . Both tests provide similar outcomes [42, 43] . We classified patients as aMCI based on delayed recall scores of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test in ADNI and of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test in PPMI. To accomplish this, the scores from the two assessments were z-transformed to account for differences in the scoring systems. Within ADNI, the mean result was subtracted from the individual score and then divided by the standard deviation of the scores in the cognitively normal controls. Identical transformation was performed in PPMI. Subjects with z , 20.5, that is, half a standard deviation below normative sample, were considered to be aMCI. ADNI uses a similar definition based on delayed recall to define EMCI subjects.\nA total of 231 subjects were identified that completed Hopkins Verbal Learning Test/Auditory Verbal Learning Test assessments, had documented APOE-\u03b54 gene status, and completed a similar imaging protocol. All patients had CSF biomarkers analyzed in the same run (to minimize batch effects). We repeated the above comparisons in amyloid-negative controls (n 5 49, 9 APOE-\u03b54), amyloidpositive MCI (n 5 25, 14 APOE-\u03b54 carriers), and PD subjects (n 5 28, 4 APOE-\u03b54 carriers), to obtain phenotypically similar but pathologically distinct groups. The prevalence of APOE-\u03b54 in PD is much lower than in AD in this study."}, {"section_title": "Image analysis and statistical considerations", "text": "For the default mode network, we included the middle temporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal regions, medial orbitofrontal regions, and hippocampus (Fig. 1A) . We applied the standard FreeSurfer (v5.1.0) pipeline comprising intensity normalization, skull tissue removal, tissue segmentation, resampling to a 1 ! 1 ! 1 mm 3 resolution, and registration to the standard FreeSurfer brain (fsaverage) [31] . Briefly, this pipeline includes removal of nonbrain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure, automated Talairach transformation, segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures, intensity normalization [44, 45] , tessellation of the gray/white matter boundary, automated topology correction, and surface deformation following intensity gradients to optimally place the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class [46, 47] . No manual editing was performed. However, 10% of the data were randomly sampled and visually inspected to ensure accurate segmentation.\nWe applied two linear regression models. The first evaluated association of regional atrophy in the default mode network regions and aMCI status. This association was adjusted for age and gender. Comparisons were made between cognitively normal controls and the aMCI group comprising both ADNI and PPMI together, irrespective of disease pathology. Post hoc, two separate comparisons between cognitively normal controls and the aMCI group with reduced CSF amyloid, and PD, were performed. The second regression model was used to assess regional atrophy as function of APOE-\u03b54 allele status while adjusting for age and gender within each group. For the above seven regions and two evaluations (group difference and interaction with age while adjusting for age and gender), a correction for multiple comparisons was applied separately for each regression model at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1. Significance was evaluated using the Benjamini Hochberg procedure. All P values reported in the text are original uncorrected P values for regions that satisfied the FDR criteria for significance. FDR-based significance is indicated for these region by an \"*\" in the tables with statistical results. Effect sizes are also reported (0.2 5 small, 0.5 5 medium, 0.8 5 large [48] ). Hippocampal volume comparisons were adjusted for brain size using intracranial volume (eTIV in FreeSurfer).

The incidence of APOE-\u03b54 in the cognitively normal older adults is similar in ADNI (25%, n 5 27) and PPMI (28%, n 5 8) but higher in the AD-MCI group (26%,n 5 24) compared with the PD-MCI group (12%, n 5 4)."}, {"section_title": "Anatomical differences in cognitively normal older adults and aMCI", "text": "Individuals with aMCI from both ADNI and PPMI had reduced cortical thickness in default mode network regions, with steeper negative correlation of age and hippocampal volume. Fig. 1B illustrates the regions of the default mode network that were significantly different between controls and aMCI groups. Table 1 outlines statistical differences, where reductions in the parahippocampal gyrus and the middle temporal region are greatest in the aMCI phenotype (P 5 .007, P 5 .005, and P 5 .009, respectively). Amnestic MCI individuals with presumed AD and PD showed a decrease in cortical thickness (Fig. 1C) in the middle temporal and parahippocampal gyrus.

No relationship between parahippocampal gyrus thickness and age of noncarriers of APOE-\u03b54 was evident.\nIn the amyloid-negative controls (CSF-Ab 42 .192 pg/ mL), the APOE-\u03b54 carriers had significantly greater cortical thickness in the inferior parietal, middle temporal gyrus, and precuneus regions (Fig. 2B , inferior parietal, P 5.002, effect size 1.18; middle temporal gyrus, P 5 .005, effect size 0.88; and precuneus, P 5 .01, effect size 1.08).\nIn the aMCI subjects, the middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal region, and the precuneus had significantly reduced thickness in the 28 APOE-\u03b54 carriers compared with the noncarriers (Fig. 3A) .

ADNI aMCI participants with APOE-\u03b54 had reduced cortical thickness values in the middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal region, and the precuneus: 2.59 6 0.16 mm, 2.18 6 0.16 mm, and 2.11 6 0.14 mm, versus 2.70 6 0.15 mm, 2.28 6 0.10 mm, and 2.20 6 0.11 mm in APOE-\u03b54 noncarriers, respectively.

Note that there were only four APOE-\u03b54-positive patients with PD, but they had markedly lower cortical thickness in the inferior parietal regions. In the amyloid-positive MCI subjects in ADNI and PD subjects from PPMI, precuneus region was significantly thinner (P 5 .001, effect size 5 0.92) compared with healthy amyloid-negative control subjects. Again, this difference was observed in both AD-MCI and PD-MCI subjects as shown in Fig. 3C ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We show that across two distinct neurodegenerative disorders, patients with clinical symptoms of aMCI localize to common regions involved in the default mode network. Furthermore, the APOE-\u03b54 carriers from both AD and PD populations showed similar atrophy patterns when compared with cognitively normal controls. These findings are consistent, even when accounting for amyloid status and lend support to the hypothesis that clinical symptoms of memory dysfunction converge on default mode network-related regions. That is, significantly reduced thickness of the middle temporal and parahippocampal cortices are evident in aMCI and aMCI-PD patients with lower verbal memory scores. Together, the estimated rate of hippocampal volume decline Thinning cortex in the APOE-\u03b54 carriers (blue) compared with the noncarriers (pink) was consistent across disease pathologies. Note that there were only four APOE-\u03b54 carriers in the PD amnestic phenotypes. The differences in cortical thickness in the middle temporal gyrus are minimal in the PD group. (C) In the refined cohort with amyloid-negative controls, amyloid-positive AD-aMCI individuals, and amyloid-negative PD-aMCI individuals, the \u03b54 carriers show lower cortical thickness in the precuneal region compared with the noncarriers.

Although these findings are in agreement with multiple studies [49] [50] [51] linking cortical atrophy to MCI status, especially the middle temporal gyrus, we extend these findings beyond studies of patients with AD and emphasize that these findings are consistent in patients with PD. Patients with a similar aMCI phenotype have reductions in cortical thickness in the same regions. These results emphasize the role of network-based changes and memory-related symptoms that span clinicopathologic classifications.\nUsing CSF-Ab 42 as a marker of aMCI patients with concomitant AD pathology and comparing this cohort to PD patients with a motor-confirmed diagnosis, we are able to emphasize the role of hippocampal volume as a marker of aMCI status between groups. Very few studies have shown hippocampal atrophy in PD, but hippocampal atrophy has been reported in advanced PD patients with dementia [52, 53] . In this analysis, we show that middle temporal and parahippocampal regions are most different as compared with healthy controls, where aMCI participants with presumed AD pathology had an estimated 1.7% smaller mesial temporal cortical thickness with an effect size of 3.59, and patients with PD had 2.8% lower thickness, with effect size 5 0.48. In the remaining default motor network regions, the percent reductions ranged from 0.8% to 1.6% but were not significant. Taken together, these results emphasize that faster rates of hippocampal atrophy and thinning in the mesial temporal lobe regions in PD may be a biomarker of an aMCI subgroup and should be further validated.\nOur results emphasize that the effect of APOE-\u03b54 on thickness of the precuneus is consistent across AD and PD groups. The precise role of APOE-\u03b54 in precuneal pathology is still not known, but it is clear that functional connectivity in APOE-\u03b54-positive patients is reduced and may emphasize the larger role of APOE-\u03b54 on memory-based networks, with convergence on the precuneus. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies emphasize that default mode network deactivation, during memory tasks, does not occur in APOE-\u03b54-positive patients with AD. Similarly, blood flow changes in aMCI patients with AD localize to this region, the posterior cingulate, and the default mode network. What predisposes APOE-\u03b54-positive individuals to AD-related pathology is not known, but our results emphasize that there are differences between individuals with low CSF-Ab 42 versus normal levels. Those with normal CSF-Ab 42 levels actually have greater cortical thickness, a finding that replicates previous studies of higher IQ and educational achievement in APOE-\u03b54-positive patients [54, 55] .\nOf course, despite our best attempts at comparing patients with similar pathologic process, that is, accounting for CSFAb 42 levels, it is clear that systematic changes to CSF amyloid differ between PD and AD. Although patients with PD may have amyloid plaques at autopsy, the frequency of these is low, and higher CSF amyloid levels reflect this difference.\nPrevious studies emphasize that using conventional cutoff criteria for amyloid positivity does not provide informative assessments of amyloid status in PD. It is likely that the neuropathological cascade that results in amyloid accumulation differs between PD and AD. Our study used the delayed recall scores from verbal learning tests to define aMCI individuals. This definition may not adequately capture the aMCI phenotype and is limited by the lack of common tests between the two databases and likely influenced by the varying degree of vascular pathology as well as medication history of the individuals. One approach to circumvent the differences in cognitive batteries would be to select similar tests and z-scoring them using the control individuals within each database. In summary, this work supports the hypothesis that converging changes to default mode network regions, especially the mesial temporal lobe and precuneus, are shared in patients with AD and PD. While the pathologic basis for changes to this network may differ, amnestic symptoms not only localize here but also are impacted by APOE-\u03b54 and CSF-amyloid levels in patients with AD. Patients with aMCI have greater rates of hippocampal atrophy. Future studies on mechanisms of network-level susceptibility despite diverse disease states may inform common pathways of degeneration.

Future directions: Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the common regions will determine common and unique connectivity patterns in amnestic AD and PD individuals.
