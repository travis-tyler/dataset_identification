[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Until recently, peanuts and tobacco were among a small group of U.S. commodities regulated by marketing quotas. Similar to the sugar and dairy programs still in effect, the peanut and tobacco marketing quota programs were established during the 1930s to support and stabilize growers' incomes. Although the programs provided dependable short-term expectations about prices and output, they tempered growers' ability to adapt to longer term market forces by hindering economies of scale, restricting production location, and distorting trade. The 2002 Farm Act and the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 ended the price support programs and brought about structural change in the peanut and tobacco leaf industries. The elimination of the marketing quotas is commonly referred to as \"buyouts\" because quota ownersthose with the right to sell the commodity at a regulated support price-were financially compensated for the loss of an asset (quota ownership). Peanut quota owners received buyout payments of around $1.3 billion over 5 years, funded by the Federal Government, whereas tobacco quota owners and active producers receive a total of $9.6 billion over 10 years from assessments on tobacco product manufacturers and importers. Peanut farmers became eligible for the same type of commodity support programs-marketing loans, direct payments, and countercyclical payments-available to producers of other grains and oilseeds, while tobacco producers did not. The buyouts were enacted in response to many economic factors that were primarily linked to global competition. For peanuts, lower priced imports had made inroads in the domestic market as a result of trade treaties, and producers potentially faced eventual reductions to their quota allocations or lower support prices. U.S. tobacco producers contended with global competition from lower cost foreign producers, which led to falling global demand for U.S. tobacco cigarettes and leaf and an increased share of foreign leaf in U.S. cigarette production. The reduced demand resulted in lower annual marketing quota levels. The threat of lower demand for domestically sourced peanuts and tobacco, along with high production costs, made longterm operation of the programs as \"no net cost\" (i.e., self-paying, without Government expenditures) less viable. In addition, acquiring quota rights raised costs and made it difficult for efficient operators to expand, and restrictions on the transfer of quota between regions prevented new operators from entering the market. In terminating the quota and price support programs, the buyouts also eliminated geographical restrictions on production."}, {"section_title": "Quota Buyout Provisions", "text": "The marketing quota programs for peanuts and tobacco operated under three main Principles -quotas that limited the quantity that could be marketed, government operated loan rates that provided a floor on per-unit revenue, and geographical restrictions on production. After evaluating demand conditions, USDA annually established a national quota level for each crop, and distributed the marketing rights to quota owners in different regions based of their historical share of quota ownership. The quota level was designed to ensure that the market-clearing price would exceed or match the established support price (loan rate). Quota allocations were originally based on acreage, but gradually turned into quantitative limits to keep yield variations from over-or under-supplying the market. However, restrictions remained on the sale or lease of quota rights to farmers across county or State lines. When competitive pressures led to the reduction of support prices for peanuts (figure 1), and to significant reductions to the quota levels for tobacco (figure 2), separate pieces of legislation were enacted in 2002 and 2004 to terminate the quota programs and provide compensation to quota owners for the loss of value to the quota-an asset which provided a rental income stream to those who leased out quota, and ensured higher than free market prices to those who owned and/or produced and marketed quota peanuts and tobacco .  Although the peanut and tobacco buyout programs were similar in intent, they contrasted notably in their structure, financial size, and Government support. These differences were most evident in the total size of payments, the method of dispersing payments to quota owners and/or farmers, and the source of funds for the buyout payments. The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 eliminated tobacco quotas and price supports effective in 2005, and provided $9.6 billion over 10 years for buyout and transition payments. The tobacco buyout payments were distributed between quota owners (receiving $7 per pound of quota owned) and producers ($3 per pound). The 2002 Farm Act included $1.3 billion in buyout payments to peanut quota owners, with quota owners receiving a total of $0.55 per pound of owned quota. Tobacco growers received no further government support, but peanut growers became eligible for direct and countercyclical payments on newly established peanut base acres, and for a marketing loan program that provides a price guarantee of about 60 percent of what was available under the quota program. 1 Peanut buyout payments (and the new forms of Government assistance) were funded by the Federal Government, while tobacco payments were funded from assessments on tobacco product manufacturers and importers."}, {"section_title": "Farm level impacts: Farm numbers shrank but remaining farms grew in scale", "text": "Before the buyouts, peanut and tobacco producers were not immune from market forces, but changes in demand were filtered by the Government and market adjustments were somewhat rigid, with the government readjusting quotas and/or support prices on an annual or even less frequent basis (peanut loan rates were set for the duration of the 1996 Farm Act). The marketing quota systems also kept prices artificially high, which undermined the competitiveness of U.S. producers relative to foreign competition and reduced incentives to lower costs and improve efficiency. One drag on productivity was the fragmented nature of quota ownership. In the years preceding the buyouts, the number of quota owners far exceeded the number of active peanut or tobacco producers, since retired farmers typically retained their quota and rented it out to others. In 2002, approximately 75,000 people owned some peanut quota, compared with 8,000 farms growing peanuts. There were more than 350,000 tobacco quota owners in 2004, but only 57,000 tobacco farms (some of which produced tobacco in States that did not participate in the Federal quota program, such as Maryland). Most peanut and tobacco farmers owned some quota, but about 60 percent of quota production for each crop was from rented quota. Consequently, producers wanting to maintain or expand the scale of their operations had to rent quota rights from quota owners, which added to their cash expenses and management time. The difficulty and expense of acquiring quota rights likely kept the scale of operations smaller than optimal, and may have discouraged investments in specialized equipment or management practices that were economically justified only if used over a larger area. Although the annual USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data does not link data from the same farms between years, and does not track the characteristics of farms that exited a particular farm enterprise (e.g., peanut or tobacco production), it does estimate farm numbers and allows comparison of the characteristics of average peanut and tobacco farms surveyed between years. Drawing upon surveys from the years the buyouts were enacted and ensuing years, the ARMS data does suggest that the buyouts contributed to accelerated growth in the scale of peanut and tobacco farms and that exits among the smaller scale producers, at least initially, was responsible for the increase in average peanut and tobacco acreage, and total operated acres, per farm. The ARMS data indicate that the number of farmers producing burley and flue-cured tobacco fell by nearly 60 percent between 2004 and 2005, followed by a continued, but slower reduction in the number of farms.  With peanut prices declining 30 percent and tobacco prices falling 20 percent immediately after the buyouts, the primary consideration for producer exit, entry, or size of operation decisions was whether the crop enterprise could be profitable in a new lower-priced and more volatile environment. The buyout payments provided some financial flexibility to quota owners who produced their own quota, but they had to weigh whether new or continuing investments would outweigh the risks. 3 Many quota owners may have had a cost structure that was not viable at prices below the quota loan rates available under the quota system, and decided to exit. 4 In contrast, producers who relied primarily on rented quota may have been sufficiently competitive to remain in operation, or even to expand, because they had been viable producers even with the additional expenses incurred from quota rental fees. The termination of quotas eliminated these costs. Based on changes in the location of production-discussed further in the next section-it appears that the entry of new farms was a more significant factor behind the change in size and other characteristics of peanut farms than for tobacco. In addition to the reduced number and increased scale of peanut and tobacco farms, the ARMS data reveal that remaining farms in 2007 were in as good, or better financial condition, were more diversified, and made greater use of contracts as a price hedge than the average farm during the year of the buyouts. Total farm and off-farm household income, total farm business net worth, and the percentage of farms falling into the higher sales class were all comparable or higher in 2007 than in 2002 for peanuts and in 2004 for tobacco (Table 1, see Appendix tables for more detailed data). Wh data are not conclusive and are highly variable from year to year, total household incomes increased for the sample of peanut and tobacco farms surveyed by ARMS, with increases coming mostly from farm activities rather than off-farm income. This is consistent with the observation that operators of larger farms tend to devote most of their time to farming activities and rely less on off-farm work to supplement incomes. While the debt-asset ratio declined significantly only for peanut farms, total far business net worth and the share of farms operating in the largest sales class of $500,000 annually rose substantially for both peanut and tobacco producers. ile m Tobacco and peanut producers approached their risk management strategies similarly following the d other Some tobacco and peanut producers used contracts prior to the buyouts. Tobacco contracts sometimes buyouts-by increasing their use of marketing contracts to lock in prices and by maintaining a diversified commodity mix to spread risk. The use of contracts to set terms on prices, output, an conditions has been a growing trend throughout agriculture, but contracts were not widely used for peanuts and tobacco until the 2000s because the marketing quota system and other institutions (e.g., tobacco auctions and farmer cooperatives) served a similar purpose. offered higher prices than auctions. Peanut producers growing nonquota peanuts for export or crushing-about one-quarter of production-relied mostly on marketing contracts. 5 Nevertheless, the percentage of farms using marketing contracts increased significantly following the buyouts. By 2007, 65 percent of peanut farms used marketing contracts, compared with 40 percent in 2002. Less than 10 percent of tobacco farms used tobacco marketing contracts in 2000, but this percentage rose in the years leading up to the tobacco buyout. By 2007, 83 percent of flue-cured tobacco farms and 49 percent of burley tobacco farms used tobacco marketing contracts. Data from the recent 2008 Tobacco ARMS indicates that 93 percent of tobacco farms used marketing contracts with tobacco companies to market their tobacco. The same survey indicates that marketing options have declined for tobacco producers since 2004, with the mean number of marketing options declining from 4.1 in 2004 to 2.6 in 2008. Since peanut and tobacco farms are larger following the buyouts, they also tend to be more diversified in their commodity mix and better able to spread risk."}, {"section_title": "Regional Shifts in Production", "text": "In addition to the declining number and changing characteristics of the average peanut and tobacco farm measured by the ARMS data, county-level and crop reporting district acreage data collected by USDA shows that changes in the regional location of production has been another significant departure from the pre-buyout period. With the elimination of marketing quotas, geographic restrictions ended, resulting in significant shifts in production area between counties and States as some traditional production regions declined and others expanded. Lower, post-buyout prices no longer supported profitable production in high cost areas. This trend was most notable for peanuts, where production migrated away from the Southwest and Mid-Atlantic but remained strong in the Southeast (figure 4). Many counties in the Southeast saw increased plantings, and production spread to some Southeastern counties with no significant production history. As a result, the Southeast's share of national peanut acreage grew from about half before the buyout to nearly three-quarters. Tobacco production did not increase substantially in any production location, but it did become more concentrated in parts of the two largest tobacco-producing States-North Carolina for flue-cured tobacco and Kentucky for burley tobacco ( Figure 5). Burley acreage remained strongest in central and western Kentucky, while flue-cured tobacco acreage became more concentrated in eastern North Carolina."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4:", "text": "5 Peanut producers were permitted to produce and market non-quota peanuts (so-called \"additionals\") if they were destined for non-food uses, such as crushing, or were exported. States such as New Mexico (64.5%), Texas (62.5%), and Florida (57.9%) produced a majority of their peanuts outside of the quota system in the 3 years preceding the peanut buyout."}, {"section_title": "Figure 5:", "text": "Drawing on the analysis of Brown, Rucker, and Thurman (2007), the intuition behind the observed shifts in production regions can be illustrated with a simple two-county model, one representing a high cost region and the other a low cost region. Although the first county has higher marginal costs of production, marginal costs do not equilibrate across counties because quota could not (or was difficult) to transfer between counties. In practice, quota rental rates may also have been lower in the high cost counties, reducing the difference in marginal costs. Under the marketing quota system, the price and quota allocated to each county is represented by P 0 and Q 0 , respectively. Each county produces its allocated quota and sells the crop at the quota support price. When the quotas are removed, the equilibrium price declines to a price of P 1 , based on aggregate demand and the combined marginal cost curves of each county (not depicted). As quota restriction were removed, production declines in the high cost county, and increases in the low cost county, resulting in overall gains to consumer surplus (assuming an unchanged demand curve), producer surplus losses County 1, producer surplus gains in County 2, and a more efficient reallocation of production across counties. 6 "}, {"section_title": "Quota", "text": "County 1 (High cost) The impacts of greater planting flexibility and market orientation, and the regional shifts in production, appear to have contributed to increased efficiency and improved yields, particularly for peanuts. Since the buyout, areas with a history of stronger yields have been gaining acreage at the expense of areas with poorer yields, and national peanut yields averaged 17 percent higher during 2003-08 than during 1996-2002. This could be the result of better growing conditions in the new areas, and perhaps different crop management practices employed by the larger operations, such as longer crop rotations and better use of inputs. Tobacco yields have shown little if any discernible upward trend since the tobacco buyout, but ARMS data indicate that areas that have retained the most acreage historically have higher and less variable yields than those that have lost acreage."}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Market Developments", "text": "The peanut and tobacco buyouts marked the beginning of a major transition for producers and other stakeholders in the marketing quota system. Producers faced lower prices, more risk, and pressures to contain costs and improve productivity. Prices initially declined-30 percent for peanuts and 20 percent for tobacco-and production immediately fell. At the same time, the buyouts forced restructuring in both sectors that left producers better poised to respond to and take advantage of market opportunities. Several years after the buyouts, total acreage and prices remain below prebuyout levels, but more efficient production and competitive prices have established some of the conditions for demand growth, particularly in export markets. Peanut acreage has been somewhat volatile, but higher yields have boosted production-including a record crop in 2008-and domestic demand is stronger than before the buyout (Figure 7). U.S. peanuts have also become more competitive both in the domestic market and abroad. Before the buyout, U.S. peanut imports had been on a steady upward path due to market access agreements that were part of the 1994 NAFTA and WTO treaties. However, lower post-buyout prices caused imports to taper off. Lower prices reinforced by a generally weaker dollar since 2002 reversed the decline in peanut exports that preceded the buyout, and exports reached a 13-year high in 2008. Tobacco export demand also has gained momentum with a weakened dollar and a narrowing of the traditionally large gap between U.S. and foreign tobacco leaf prices. However, domestic demand for U.S. tobacco leaf continues to drop, but more slowly than prior to the tobacco buyout ( Figure 8). The continued drop reflects the ongoing decline in domestic per capita smoking rates, relatively steady tobacco leaf imports, and reduced exports of U.S. cigarettes. Even with lower U.S. tobacco leaf prices, domestic demand has been constrained by high retail cigarette prices that largely reflect costs other than tobacco leaf (e.g., manufacturing, promotion, and taxes). Only in some specialized categoriessuch as dark tobacco used in snuff and smokeless tobacco-has increased demand led to higher acreage.  "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Although not all recent changes in the peanut and tobacco sectors can be attributed to the buyouts, they clearly represented landmark events that influenced many of the structural changes that followed. Decisions on whether to increase, continue, reduce, or drop out of production-or even to begin production for the first time-are now based more on market-determined net returns from alternative crop choices, and are no longer affected by geographic restrictions on production. Regional production shifts, farm consolidation, and increased exports suggest that the buyouts and planting flexibility have enhanced overall economic efficiency and responsiveness to market developments. The production specialty refers to the commodity that accounted for 50 percent or more of the farm's value of production. General crop farms did not have a single commodity that met this criterion. 2 The Mid-Atlantic region consists of Virginia and northeastern counties in North Carolina. The Southeast region includes the southeastern counties in North Carolina and all of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. The Southwest region includes Texas and Oklahoma.
