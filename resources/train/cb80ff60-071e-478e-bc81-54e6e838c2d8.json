[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Although a silent ischemic electrocardiographic response to treadmill exercise in clinically healthy populations is associated with an increased likelihood of future coronary events (i.e., angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death), such a response has a low predictive value for future events because of the low prevalence of disease in asymptomatic populations. To examine whether detection of reduced regional perfusion by thallium scintigraphy improved the predictive value of exercise-induced ST segment depression, we performed maximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and thallium scintigraphy (20`T1) in 407 asymptomatic volunteers 40-96 years of age (mean=60) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. The prevalence of exercise-induced silent ischemia, defined by concordant ST segment depression and a thallium perfusion defect, increased more than sevenfold from 2% in the fifth and sixth decades to 15% in the ninth decade. Over a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, cardiac events developed in 9.8% of subjects and consisted of 20 cases of new angina pectoris, 13 myocardial infarctions, and seven deaths. Events occurred in 7% of individuals with both negative 20MT1 and ECG, 8% of those with either test positive, and 48% of those in whom both tests were positive (p<0.001). By proportional hazards analysis, age, hypertension, exercise duration, and a concordant positive ECG and 201TT result were independent predictors of coronary events. Furthermore, those with positive ECG and 201T1 had a 3.6-fold relative risk for subsequent coronary events, independent of conventional risk factors. Thus, in an asymptomatic population, the presence of exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia increases progressively with age and identifies a small group of subjects with a strikingly high incidence of subsequent coronary events.

However, the predictive value of such an ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) response has been low for populations with a low prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) because of the high rate of false-positive responses. See p 691 This observation has given rise to heated controversy concerning the value of using exercise tests for \"screening\" asymptomatic individuals.\nExercise thallium scintigraphy (201T1), performed in conjunction with maximal treadmill testing, has superior sensitivity and predictive value for CAD in symptomatic patients compared with standard exercise ECG.12,13 Furthermore, isotopes such as 201T1 and 82Rb have been used to detect episodes of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in patients with variant angina as well as individuals with stable effort-related angina pectoris.14 201T1 has also accurately detected those individuals with coronary disease among apparently healthy male military personnel with abnormal exercise ECGs. 15 In addition to its diagnostic use, thallium scanning is valuable in assessing the prognosis of individuals with documented CAD.16 Other investigations17-'9 have shown that individuals with chest pain and normal thallium scans had very low cardiac event rates over the subsequent 2-3 years. The current report examines the ability of exercise ECG and 20M1l scintigraphy to predict future coronary events in communitydwelling volunteers in whom clinical signs, symptoms, and resting ECG indicators of CAD were absent. We hypothesized that the combination of exercise ECG and 201T1 would prove a more powerful predictor of coronary events than the exercise ECG alone or in combination with conventional risk factors."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) are a community-dwelling, nonhealth care-seeking group of volunteers 21-96 years of age who have agreed to return to the Gerontology Research Center (GRC) every 2 years for 21/2 days of physical, physiological, and psychological examinations. 20 The sample has been recruited continuously since 1958, and the majority (96%) are white; work in, or are retired from, scientific, professional, or managerial positions (80%); graduated from high school (93%) and college (71%); and are married (88%). Because studies of women were not introduced until 1978, fewer women were participants when the data for the present study were collected.\nBeginning in 1977, asymptomatic BLSA subjects aged 40 37% of the sample; only 14% were current smokers. Serum cholesterol averaged 214.7+36.4 mg/dl with 10% exceeding 260 mg/dl, mean fasting plasma glucose was 101.2\u00b1+18.5 mg/dl, and only 3% had a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus; obesity was uncommon, as only 8% had a body mass index >30 kg/M2. These values are consistent with those expected in an asymptomatic, health-conscious population 40 years of age or older.\nExercise duration for the entire sample averaged 10.7\u00b14.1 minutes, and the percent of age-adjusted maximal heart rate attained was 97+8%. Only nine subjects (2%) with normal ECG and 201T1 results failed to achieve 85% of their age-predicted maximal heart rate. Overall, positive ECG results were found in 66 subjects (16%) and positive 201T1 scans in 55 subjects (14%). Concordant positive results on both tests were present in 23 subjects (6%), and concordant negative findings in 309 subjects (76%). Concordant abnormal ECG and 201T1 results increased monotonically with age from 2% in the fifth and sixth decades to 15% in the ninth decade ( Figure 1) ; conversely, concordant negative ECG and 201T1 decreased with age from 85% in the fifth and sixth decades to 58% in the ninth decade. Thus, subjects with concordant positive results were 10.6 years older on average than those with concordant negative findings (68.7 + 8.2 vs. 58.1 + 10.9, p < 0.001)."}, {"section_title": "Coronary Event Rates", "text": "Over a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 years for the entire sample, cardiac events developed in 40 of 407 subjects (9.8%); events occurred in 34 of 288 men versus six of 119 women, p=0.07; five men experienced more than one event. The mean time to the first event was 4.5 years (range, 0.7-8.1). Initial coronary events consisted of angina pectoris (n=20), nonfatal myocardial infarction (n=13), and cardiac death (n =7, of which four were sudden). Three men whose initial event was angina pectoris subsequently experienced a \"hard\" coronary event (myocardial infarction in one and cardiac death in two). Two men who presented initially with nonfatal myocardial infarction later developed an additional event: angina pectoris in one and cardiac death in the other. Thus, according to the \"hardest\" end point reached (cardiac death> myocardial infarction> angina pectoris), there were 17 cases of angina pectoris, 13 1-1 1 Table 2 shows the cardiac event rates for the four subsets defined by ECG and 201T1 results. The most striking finding is the disproportionately high incidence of coronary events (48%) for the subset in whom both tests were positive. In contrast to the high cardiac event rate in the concordant positive group, the event rate was generally low (3-12%) for the remaining three groups. No differences were found among the four groups in time to cardiac event or in the distribution of type of event. Of the four subjects whose initial event was sudden death, one belonged to the concordant positive group and three to the concordant negative group. The risk for an event in the concordant positive group was 6.3 times that of the remainder of the sample. Similarly, when only hard events were considered, an identical 6.3-fold risk was found. As shown in the survival curve in Figure 2 , life table analysis confirmed the increased risk for a coronary event among those subjects in thallium scan, the thallium score did not separate those experiencing an event from those who did not (0.83+0.90 vs. 0.63\u00b10.80). Similarly, the regional distribution of thallium defects as well as the number of subjects with defects in more than one region were nearly identical in these two groups (Table 4) . Furthermore, the risk of a coronary event was virtually identical among the 27 subjects whose scan demonstrated redistribution (22%) compared with the 28 subjects in whom 3 hour images were not obtained or a fixed defect was present (21%)."}, {"section_title": "Model Testing", "text": "The relative risks from applying three proportional hazards models to the prediction of first coronary events are shown in Table 5 . Among the seven conventional risk factors analyzed in the first model, only two, age and hypertension, were significant predictors. As shown in Table 5 , older and hypertensive subjects were at greater risk for coronary events than the remainder of the sample. In model two, in addition to the two significant conventional risk factors, age and hypertension, only the ECG result was a significant predictor of coronary events. Subjects with positive exercise ECG results were 2.4 times more likely to have a coronary event. The third model, which substituted concordant positive ECG and 201T1 tests for the separate influences of each, showed that in addition to the two significant conventional risk factors, only exercise duration and the concordant positive result were significant predictors of coronary events. A concordant positive result was associated with a 3.6-fold risk for a coronary event, even in these asymptomatic volunteers who have relatively low coronary risk profiles. In the third model, when age was dichotomized at the mean value, the relative risk for an event was 3.0 for subjects older than 60 years (p<0.001), 2.5 for hypertensives (p=0.01), and 3.8 for a concordant positive ECG and 201T1 result (p<0.001), while exercise duration was no longer significant. To eliminate the possibility that the results of the proportional hazards modeling were dependent on the inclusion of individuals whose thallium defects may not have represented reversible exerciseinduced ischemia, we repeated the analysis excluding the 20 subjects without redistribution scans and the eight subjects with fixed thallium defects. The results were virtually identical to those in Table 5 except that in model 2, a positive ECG was no longer significant. In particular, model 3 again demonstrated that age (p=0.002), hypertension (p=0.01, relative risk=2.8), and a concordant positive ECG and 201T1 result (p=0.03, relative risk=3.1) were independent predictors of a coronary event."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the present study, a concordant positive ECG and 20'Tl result was a potent predictor of coronary events independent of conventional risk factors. Subjects with positive findings on both tests had a 3.6-fold greater risk for a subsequent event compared with the remaining subjects; this relative risk was greater than that of the most powerful conventional risk factors, hypertension, sex, and age.\nThe concept of exercise screening for the prediction of future coronary events in asymptomatic subjects has been employed for over two decades.'-\" In previous studies, the ECG response to treadmill, bicycle, or Master 2-step exercise was employed to stratify subjects. In the majority of these studies, the positive predictive value of such testing for the development of a future coronary event has been low, averaging 21% in eight series comprising nearly 7,000 individuals.26 Such modest predictive value in asymptomatic subjects is not surprising, given the many factors in addition to ischemia that may affect the ST segment response including posture, hyperventilalar hypertrophy. Furthermore, in low-risk populations, a low positive predictive value of exercise ECG is predicted from Bayes' theorem. 27 We believe that our study is the first to employ exercise 20'Tl scintigraphy as a screening tool for predicting coronary events in an asymptomatic, community-dwelling population.`01T1, a potassium analogue, distributes throughout the heart in proportion to myocardial blood flow. By directly assessing relative myocardial perfusion rather than monitoring ST-segment shift, thallium scintigraphy might be expected to yield a lower false-positive rate than ECG in a low-risk population. Applying Bayes' theorem sequentially in such a general population, it would be predicted that individuals demonstrating an abnormal response to both tests would have a greater likelihood of CAD than the larger group with a positive ECG alone. Supporting this approach, Melin et a128 found that a concordant abnormal ST segment and thallium scintigraphy response to maximal exercise predicted CAD, even within a group of 62 patients with a low (18%) CAD prevalence. Similarly, among 191 asymptomatic military aircrewmen with abnormal exercise ECGs,`01TI identified 97% of subjects correctly regarding the presence or absence of CAD. 15 Much recent attention has focused on assessing the prevalence and prognosis of silent myocardial ischemia in patients with known CAD, including those with unstable angina pectoris, stable CAD, or after a recent myocardial infarction. In these varied settings, the presence of silent ischemia, whether detected by exercise ECG or by Holter monitoring, increases the risk of subsequent coronary death, nonfatal infarction, and coronary revascularization for refractory symptoms. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Because of the high false-positive rate of exercise ECG alone in asymptomatic subjects, however, the prevalence and prognosis of silent ischemia in totally asymptomatic populations has been difficult to determine. The best estimate to date of prevalence comes from an extensive study of 2,014 Norwegian men aged 40-59 years.34 Using a combination of positive ECG and angiographically documented CAD, these investigators detected silent ischemia in 2.5% of these middle-aged men.\nIn the present study, if we consider only a concordant positive result on both ECG and 201T1 as indicative of silent myocardial ischemia, the overall prevalence was 6.2% in men and 2.2% in women. The increase in the prevalence of silent exercise-induced ischemia with age in our sample is noteworthy: from 2% in the 40s and 50s to 15% above the age of 80 years. Other studies have employed exercise thallium scintigraphy to predict the clinical course of patients with known or suspected CAD.17-19 The number of myocardial segments with transient thallium defects was the only significant predictor of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in 100 medically treated CAD patients without prior infarction over a mean follow-up of 3.7 years.17 In a group of 1,689 similar patients without prior infarction, Ladenheim et al16 developed a model in which a combination of severe and extensive thallium defects developing at a low heart rate predicted cardiac death, nonfatal infarction, or referral for coronary artery bypass grafting in 78% of subjects within 1 year compared with a rate of 0.4% in patients without these findings. Similarly, in three series of more than 1,100 patients with chest pain and normal exercise thallium scintigrams, the rate of cardiac death or nonfatal infarction was only 1%/yr. [17] [18] [19] Certain limitations in the current study should be addressed. Because of the obvious ethical difficulty of performing cardiac catheterization on asymptomatic volunteers, we assessed future coronary events rather than coronary anatomy. The former end point is more clinically relevant, particularly given the imprecision of coronary angiography as well as the variability of functional collaterals in humans. A In the group with concordant positive exercise results, it might be argued that the development of angina pectoris as the presenting manifestation in half of those with clinical CAD end points would constitute a sufficient trigger for definitive evaluation and treatment. On the other hand, the recent findings that lowering serum cholesterol reduces both the plaints, angina is often considered a \"soft\" end point incidence41,42 and progression43,44 of symptomatic CAD, coupled with the recent advancements in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty45 make detection of truly asymptomatic CAD an important clinical goal, particularly for older individuals commencing a program of strenuous aerobic training or those in positions of high public responsibility such as airline pilots or mass transit drivers.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that in an asymptomatic volunteer population with a low coronary risk profile, a concordant positive response to both the standard exercise ECG and 20`T1 scintigraphy identifies a small group of predominantly older subjects (-10% of those over 65 years of age) with a strikingly high risk for coronary events over the subsequent 5 years. Such exercise-induced silent ischemia appears to be a potent predictor of subsequent coronary events independent of conventional risk factors. These results, although not supportive of generalized screening for CAD in low-risk populations, support the concept that such combination testing should be further investigated as a potentially useful diagnostic strategy in subjects with additional coronary risk factors."}]
