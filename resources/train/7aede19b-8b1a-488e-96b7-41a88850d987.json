[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Number processing interacts with space encoding in a wide variety of experimental paradigms. Most intriguingly, the passive viewing of uninformative number symbols can shift visuo-spatial attention to different target locations according to the number magnitude, i.e., small/large numbers facilitate processing of left/right targets, respectively. The brain architecture dedicated to these attention shifts associated with numbers remains unknown. Evoked potential recordings indicate that both early and late stages are involved in this spatio-numerical interaction, but the neuro-functional anatomy needs to be specified. Here we use, for the first time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate attentional orienting following uninformative Arabic digits. We show that BOLD response in occipital visual regions is modulated by the congruency between digit magnitude (small/large) and target side (left/right). Additionally, we report higher BOLD responses following large (8, 9) compared to small (1, 2) digits in two bilateral parietal regions, yielding a significant effect of digit magnitude. We propose and discuss the view that encoding of semantic representations related to number symbols in parietal cortex leads to shifts in visuo-spatial attention and enhances visual processing in the occipital cortex according to number-space congruency rules."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "An ever-growing amount of behavioral studies indicates that numerical representations and visuo-spatial processes are tightly linked (for reviews see Walsh, 2003; Fias & Fischer, 2005; Hubbard, Piazza, Pinel & Dehaene, 2005; . The most classical demonstration of this connection between numbers and space is the Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect first described by Dehaene, Bossini, and Giraux (1993) who observed that participants respond faster with their left hand to small numbers and with their right hand to large numbers. According to the mental number line view (Dehaene, 1997) , this behavioral pattern indicates that (in western cultures) numerical values of increasing magnitudes are mentally organized as a continuum oriented from left to right (Hubbard et al., 2005 Hubbard, Piazza, Pinel, & Dehaene, 2009 ).\nAnother striking demonstration of the link between numerical and spatial domains was provided by Fischer, Castel, Dodd and Pratt (2003) , who reported that participants detect a target more rapidly in the left hemifield, if it is preceded by a small number (e.g., 1 or 2) and more rapidly in the right hemifield if preceded by a large number (e.g., 8 or 9). This is evidence that centrally presented uninformative digits shift visuo-spatial attention to different hemifields (i.e., left and right hemifield) according to their magnitude (i.e., small and large; see also Galfano, Rusconi, & Umilt a, 2006; Ristic, Wright, & Kingstone, 2006) . Related research using a temporal onset judgement paradigm (Casarotti, Michielin, Zorzi, & Umilt a, 2007) demonstrated that these attentional effects are specifically linked to numerical information rather than ordinal stimuli in general, as no attentional allocation was found when letters instead of numbers were used as cues (see also Dodd, Van der Stigchel, Adil Leghari, Fung, & Kingstone, 2008) .\nNext to these two seminal approaches an impressive amount of studies support the link between numbers and space in healthy subjects using other paradigms such as number line bisection (Fischer, 2001; Calabria & Rossetti, 2005; de Hevia, Girelli, & Vallar, 2005; Longo & Lourenco, 2007; Loetscher, Bockisch & Brugger, 2008; Ashkenazi & Henik, 2010) , reproduction of interval length (de Hevia, Girelli, Bricolo, & Vallar, 2008) random number generation (Loetscher, Bockisch, Nicholls, & Brugger, 2010) , luminosity discrimination (Nicholls, Loftus, & Gevers, 2008) , manual grasping (Andres, Seron, & Olivier, 2005; Lindemann, Abolafia, Girardi & Bekkering, 2007) and priming (backward priming: Stoianov, Kramer, Umilt a, & Zorzi, 2008; forward priming: Herrera & Macizo, 2011) .\nThe functional significance of the mental number line concept is supported by studies on patients suffering from spatial neglect. These patients not only misplaced the midpoint of physical lines when required to bisect them, but also made similar misplacement errors when requested to bisect numerical intervals (Zorzi, Priftis, & Umilta, 2002; Zorzi, Priftis, Meneghello, Marenzi, & Umilt a, 2006; Priftis, Zorzi, Meneghello, Marenzi, & Umilta, 2006 ; Umilt a, Priftis, & Zorzi, 2009 ; but see also Doricchi, Guariglia, Gasparini, & Tomaiuolo, 2005) . When asked what number is halfway between 1 and 9, left neglect patients consistently reported a number larger than the expected response, such as 7, shifting the response towards the right end of the mental number line.\nFurthermore, TMS studies using SNARC (Rusconi, Turatto, & Umilt a, 2007; Rusconi, Bueti, Walsh, & Butterworth, 2011) and bisection paradigms (G\u00f6bel, Calabria, Farn e, & Rossetti, 2006; ) demonstrated that parietal and frontal regions play a critical role in numberspace associations. ERP studies also showed that the visual system might play a significant role in number-space interactions. Two independent studies using the target detection task, initially developed by Fischer et al. (2003) indicated that passively viewing uninformative digits before performing lateral target detections induced both early and late modulations of event-related potentials located at anterior and central electrode sites (Salillas, El Yagoubi, & Semenza, 2008; Ranzini, Dehaene, Piazza, & Hubbard, 2009 ; see also Schuller, Hoffmann, & Schiltz, 2011) . Recently it has also been reported that cortical excitability in early visual cortex is modulated by number magnitude such that small/large magnitudes (associated with the left/right visual space) facilitated the perception of phosphenes after TMS was applied on the right/left visual cortex ).\nThere are also a few fMRI experiments that investigated the interaction between visuo-spatial and arithmetic processing (Zago & Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2002; Zago et al., 2008; Knops, Thirion, Hubbard, Michel, & Dehaene, 2009; Rotzer et al., 2009) . Using an ingenious multivariate classifier approach, Knops et al. 2009 showed that BOLD signal in parietal regions controlling visuo-spatial orienting also play an important role in mental arithmetic. Moreover, Koten, Lonnemann, Willmes, and Knops, (2011) used multivariate pattern analysis to explore the neuronal correlates of a landmark task on numerical and physical intervals. They showed that congruent and incongruent number-space interactions produce distinguishable patterns of voxel activation in the intraparietal sulcus, more precisely in intraparietal regions involved in arithmetics. Since both space and numbers are thought to be represented in this region, Koten et al., 2011 took this finding to suggest an early integration of number and space. In addition number-space interactions were also observed in regions involved in motor response selection/preparation and consequently Koten argued that number and space interact both at early and late processing stages. Nonetheless, whether parietal regions also contribute to visuo-spatial attention shifts induced by the passive viewing of single digits remains an open question. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no fMRI studies investigating attentional orienting following numerical symbols, without arithmetical and/or working memory requirements.\nOn a more general level, the neuronal correlates of visuospatial attention have successfully been highlighted by intense fMRI work. It is now well-established that early visual BOLD response to peripheral stimuli is enhanced when visuo-spatial attention is oriented towards their location (for reviews see Kanwisher & Wojciulik, 2000; Corbetta & Shulman, 2002) . Moreover, it has very recently been shown that activity in visual areas is not only modulated when the attentional shifts concern external perceptual stimulations, but also when they refer to internal memory representations (Munneke, Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2012) . Indeed, BOLD signal in early visual regions was altered by words cueing different object positions in working memory (for similar behavioral evidence see Salverda & Altmann, 2011) . The attentional cues that have been investigated range from central predictive (e.g., Huddlestone & DeYoe, 2008) to peripheral non-predictive (e.g., M\u00fcller & Kleinschmidt, 2007) , with a few studies also using central non-predictive cues such as eye gaze or arrows (Hietanen, Leppanen, Nummenmaa, & Astikainen, 2008; Engell, Nummenmaa, Oosterhof, Henson, Haxby, & Calder, 2010) . However, as mentioned above, no fMRI study on visuo-spatial orienting used Arabic digits as nonpredictive central cues yet.\nIn the present fMRI study, we addressed whether number-related attentional shifts would be reflected by an amplified visual response to right and left visual field stimulation depending on the digit magnitude being presented at the centre of the screen. Participants were scanned while performing a lateral color discrimination task that was preceded by a brief, uninformative and centrally presented digit (i.e., 1, 2, 8 and 9). Our study addressed two main questions.\nFirst, based on previous evidence that attention amplifies the neural responses of the visual neuronal populations selectively coding the attended location, we expected that occipital regions representing left and right targets would have their responses to the target selectively amplified when preceded by small and large digits, respectively. To reveal such attentional modulations, the occipital regions responding to the lateral portions of the visual field containing the target were localized in each participant individually using subject-level visual localizer. In line with the initial behavioural observations by Fischer et al. (2003) and the neuro-imaging data on visuo-spatial attention (e.g., Huddleston and DeYoe, 2008; Somers, Dale, Seiffert, & Tootell, 1999) , we hypothesized that the attentional shifts induced by the centrally presented numbers should lead to an amplification of the BOLD response in visual areas, when left/right targets are preceded by small/large digits, respectively. Especially the observation that semantic cues with spatial meaning can bias early visual activity (Munneke et al., 2012 , see also Soto, Rotshtein, Hodsoll,Mevorach, & Humphreys, 2012 suggests that Arabic digit cues could induce semantic processing and spatio-numerical interactions at central semantic stages, which in turn modulate the visual response to lateral targets. The subject-level visual localizer was specifically designed to optimally capture these attentional effects associated with early number-space interactions.\nOur second question pertained to the functional role of parietal and frontal regions in the attentional shifts driven by numbers. Based on a group-level task localizer, we highlighted the parietal cortex and the other regions that were involved in the sensori-motor aspects of the lateral target discrimination task. The effects of number-space interactions as well as digit magnitude were then investigated in these regions. Because parietofrontal regions play a critical role both in numerical processing (for reviews see Cohen Kadosh, Lammertyn, & Izard, 2008; Ansari, 2008; Nieder & Dehaene, 2009 ) and spatial attention orienting (for reviews see Kastner & Pinsk, 2004; Corbetta, Patel, & Shulman, 2008) , we expected that visuo-spatial orienting associated with numerical stimuli might affect activity in regions of this sensori-motor network. Besides early representational associations in parietal and occipital cortex, particularly the late number-space interactions occurring at response-related stages should become visible with this second approach (Salillas et al., 2008; Ranzini et al., 2009 ; see also Koten et al., 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Twenty-one right-handed adults (13 males mean age 23 7 3) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological disease participated in our experimental project in exchange of course credits."}, {"section_title": "Procedure", "text": "Subjects performed three experiments during one fMRI scanning session. The data of one subject had to be discarded due to excessive head motion during scanning.\nImaging was performed using a 3T head scanner at the University of Maastricht (Allegra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) provided with standard head coil. T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) used BOLD contrast as an indirect marker of local neuronal activity (Ogawa, Lee, Kay, & Tank, 1990) . Twenty-five 5 mm oblique transverse slices were acquired (no gap, TR\u00bc 1500 milliseconds, TE \u00bc 28 milliseconds, flip angle \u00bc67 degrees, matrix size\u00bc 64 \u00c2 64, FOV \u00bc224 mm, in-plane resolution 3.5 \u00c2 3.5 mm). Each subject performed one block localizer run (subject-level visual localizer) of 432 TRs (approximately 648 s), two slow event-related (SER) localizer runs (group-level task localizer) of 315 TRs each (approximately 472.5 s), and two SER runs of the main experiment of 640 TRs each (approximately, 960 s).\nA high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical data set encompassing the whole head was acquired in each session by means of ADNI sequence (TR\u00bc2250 ms, TE\u00bc 26 ms, flip angle\u00bc 9 degrees, matrix size\u00bc 256 \u00c2 256, FOV\u00bc 256 mm 2 , 192 slices, slice thickness\u00bc 1 mm, no gap, total run time\u00bc 8 min 26 s)."}, {"section_title": "Stimuli and experimental paradigm", "text": "Visual stimuli were presented using Eprime 1.1 against a uniformly gray background (see Fig. 1 ). They were projected onto a translucent screen at the head of the scanner bore by means of a LCD projector and viewed by the subjects through a mirror placed within the RF coil at a viewing distance of 57 cm. Behavioural responses were collected via a button box. In all 3 experiments subjects were asked to fixate the central fixation cross all along the run (plus sign, Arial, bold, 28 pt). The central cross subtended a visual angle of 1.3 \u00c2 1.3 degrees. All other centrally presented stimuli (digits in the main experiment runs and brackets in the group-level task localizer runs) had the same font characteristics as the central cross. The cross was flanked by 2 lateral rectangles presented at an eccentricity of 5 degrees. The rectangles were defined by a 2-pixel black border on the grey background and their size was 74 by 56 pixels. At a screen resolution of 640 \u00c2 480 pixels, one lateral rectangle subtended a visual angle of 4.4 \u00c2 3.5 degrees. The two lateral rectangles delimited the regions of the visual field where the target could appear (Fig. 1) .\nThe main experiment was a within-subject factorial design consisting of the factors (a) numerical magnitude (small/large) and (b) target side (left/right). Each trial started by a light grey central cross flanked by lateral rectangles (1000 ms), which acted as a warning cue, then a digit appeared for 600 ms, which was replaced by a black cross of variable duration (7900-11,400 ms). 400 ms after digit onset the lateral rectangles were filled with white noise (arrays of 16 \u00c2 12 squares of 4.5 \u00c2 4.5 average size in pixel; luminance: 0.52 and contrast: 0.1) until target offset (variable noise duration: 600/850/1100 ms). White noise was used to invoke a response in occipital visual regions coding for the lateral rectangles. Targets (asterisks in Arial font, bold, 20 pt) appeared for 100 ms centrally in one of the lateral rectangles filled with white noise. There were twelve trials with a 900 ms digit-target SOA in each target side condition because number-space interactions were observed with SOAs of this range in previous studies (Fischer et al., 2003; Galfano et al., 2006) . Rare longer digit-target SOA (1150 and 1400 ms) trials (4 per target side condition) were included to introduce some temporal variation in the stimulus presentation and attenuate subjects' expectations. They were discarded from subsequent analyses. After target offset, the black fixation cross and empty lateral rectangles stayed on the screen for a variable interval (7500, 9000, 10,500 ms). Subjects responded with the right index and middle fingers whether target color was green or red. We explicitly told the subjects that the digits were task-irrelevant. Participant's responses were not speeded and the main experiment was specifically designed to optimize BOLD response to the lateral target regions.\nTargets subtended a visual angle of 0.7 \u00c2 0.7 degrees. Target side (left, right), target color (red, green) and digit value (1, 2, 8 and 9) varied randomly within a run. On average, digits subtended 1.8 \u00c2 1.05 degrees of visual angle. In order to prevent the Simon effect (related to the spatial compatibility between the side of the target and the side of the key to press) from contaminating the results, response keys were counterbalanced across runs. Each run consisted of 12 trials per experimental condition yielding a total of 24 trials per experimental condition for each participant. In addition, each run comprised 16 catch trials (in which no lateral target appeared) as well as 20 long-SOA trials.\nThe group-level task localizer was identical to the main experiment, except that central digits were replaced by neutral bracket symbols, which were chosen because their visual angle (2.2 \u00c2 1.2 degrees) approximately matched the average visual angle of the digits presented in the digit runs. Technical issues prevented the first three subjects to perform the group-level task localizer experiment. Response keys were also counterbalanced across the two runs of the group-level Fig. 1 . Sequence of example trials in the main experiment (left) and the group-level task localizer (right). In both tasks participants had to discriminate the color of a lateral target. During the main experiment, targets were preceded by digits whereas they were preceded by neutral bracket symbols in the group-level task localizer. Note: Stimuli are not drawn to scale. task localizer. We designed this localizer in order to map the cortical regions activated by the main experiment.\nIn order to define the visual regions responding to the lateral targets at the single-subject level, participants further performed a subject-level visual localizer consisting of 24 blocks of 13,200 ms. Participants viewed a similar display with central fixation cross and lateral rectangles as in the main experiment and the group-level task localizer. However, we used a blocked design to obtain a high signal to noise ratio and reach the statistical power necessary to localize occipital ROI at the individual level. Single-level approach was preferred because the localization of functional activations is known to vary across individuals (Saxe, Brett, & Kanwisher, 2006; Nieto-Casta\u00f1 \u00f3 n & Fedorenko, 2012) . Depending on the block condition (unilateral-left, unilateral-right, bilateral or blank), one, both or no rectangle(s) were filled with white noise of variable duration (200, 300, 400 ms). As in the other experiments, a white noise array comprised 16 \u00c2 12 squares of 4.5 \u00c2 4.5 average size in pixel. Within a block, there were 12 trials of 1100 ms on average. A fixation pause (i.e., central cross flanked by empty rectangles) separated trials (variable duration: 700, 800, 900 ms) within a block. In one third of the trials, a blue asterisk (0.7 \u00c2 0.7 degrees of visual angle) appeared at the centre of each rectangle 100 ms prior to rectangle stimulation offset. Participants had to detect the asterisk by pressing the response button with their right index finger. There were 6 blocks per condition and blocks were interleaved with twelve seconds of fixation pauses (i.e., central cross flanked by empty rectangles).\nThe order of experiments was the same for all subjects but runs within experiments were counterbalanced across subjects. The session began with one run of the main experiment, followed by one group-level task localizer run, and then came the anatomical run. After the anatomical run, subjects performed the second main experiment run, followed by the second run of group-level task localizer. Response keys were counterbalanced after the anatomical run. The scanning session ended with the subject-level visual localizer."}, {"section_title": "fMRI data analyses", "text": "Functional and anatomical images were analyzed using BrainVoyager QX (version 1.10, Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The first four volumes were skipped to avoid T1 saturation effect. Functional runs then underwent several preprocessing steps: correction of inter-slice scan time differences, linear trend removal, temporal high-pass filtering (to remove frequencies lower than three cycles per time course), smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum, and correction for interscan head motion (translation and rotation of functional volumes to align them to a reference volume). Anatomical and functional data were spatially normalized to Talairach coordinate system (Talairach & Tournoux, 1988 ) with a resolution of 3 \u00c2 3 \u00c2 3 mm using trilinear interpolation. The data of one subject was discarded due to excessive movement during scanning.\nThe predictor time courses for stimulation events/blocks were constructed as boxcar functions filtered through a general linear model (GLM) indirectly relating neural activity and BOLD response (Boynton, Engel, Glover, & Heeger, 1996) . Predictor time courses were obtained by the convolution of a box-car time course with two-gamma hemodynamic response function. In the main experiment, eight predictors were entered in the GLM: left versus right target sides by small versus large digit magnitudes, plus two predictors encompassing the small versus large magnitude catch trials and two predictors to cover the longer digit-target SOA trials (separately for 1150 and 1400 ms digit-target SOAs). In the group-level task localizer, we used five predictors: left versus right target sides, plus one predictor encompassing all catch trials and two predictors for the longer digit-target SOA trials (separately for 1150 and 1400 ms digit-target SOAs). Finally, in the subject-level visual localizer, we used four predictors (unilateral-left, unilateral-right, bilateral, and blank conditions) . In all experiments, the box car function covered the whole trial (in the main experiment and the group-level task localizer) or block (in the subject-level visual localizer). In the main experiment and the group-level task localizer, predictors encompassed the interval running from the onset of the warning cue to the offset of the target. In the subject-level visual localizer, predictors ran from the onset of the warning cue to the offset of rectangle stimulation.\nFor anatomical reference, the statistical maps were overlaid on Talairachnormalized individual anatomical volumes."}, {"section_title": "Subject-level visual localizer", "text": "The present study explored whether the attentional shifts induced by the central presentation of digits would modulate neural activation to targets presented laterally in the occipital regions. Following the tradition of spatial attention studies (e.g., Murray, 2008; Ress, Backus, & Heeger, 2000; Silver, Ress, & Heeger, 2007; Huddleston & DeYoe, 2008) , occipital regions were mapped at the single-subject-level based on the localizer block experiment. To map the visual regions responding to the stimulation of the left and right rectangular portions of visual hemifields, the occipital areas responding preferentially to white noise in the left vs. the right lateral rectangles were defined independently for each participant. A fixed effect (FFX) GLM was first computed for each individual. The positive and negative voxel clusters (q(FDR) o.05; cluster size threshold: 4 voxels), which were significantly activated by the [Unilateral-Left minus Unilateral-Right] contrast, were then selected in each subject as ROIs for further analysis. The data of one out of the twenty-one subjects were discarded for the group ANOVA, because of excessive noise in this region. We also had to discard one run of the main experiment in one subject because of excessive motion.\nWe extracted the activity time course in each individual ROI for each condition of the main experiment. We averaged the signal time course across trials in each condition and converted these time courses to percent signal change (PSC) relative to fixation baseline activity (baseline interval: 2 TR of fixation prior to warning cue onset). PSC time course was then averaged over time for each participant in each condition (from 0 to 12 TR post warning cue onset). These intervals were selected to monitor the BOLD response to experimental trials. The so-obtained PSC values were subjected to a repeated-measure ANOVA with Hemisphere (Left versus Right), Magnitude (Small versus Large) and Target side (Left versus Right) as within-subject factors. Paired-sample t-tests were used to perform planned comparisons between conditions (significance levels were Bonferroni-corrected (a/n) to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons). When the effect of Hemisphere was not significant, data from the two hemispheres were collapsed.\nTo further assess how digit magnitude affects lateral target discrimination, we computed the difference in neural activity induced by left and right targets (dPSC, i.e., PSC for left target minus PSC for right target) for each digit magnitude separately. Hence, a positive value denotes a stronger BOLD response to left targets whereas a negative value denotes stronger responses to right targets. Subsequently, the computed dPSC were entered in a regression analysis with magnitude as predictor per subject. This method allows capturing in a regression equation and slope value how digit magnitude influenced the BOLD response to lateralized visual targets. Based on the mental number line hypothesis, we expected a significant negative slope between dPSC values and digit magnitude (Lorch & Myers, 1990; see Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens, & d'Ydewalle, 1996; van Galen & Reitsma, 2008) , resulting in a negative slope. Slope values were compared to zero using a paired-sample one-tailed t test. In addition, we also report our results in terms of cue-target compatibility effects and contrast the BOLD response of compatible (small magnitude -left targets and large magnitude -right targets) and incompatible (large magnitude -left targets and small magnitude -right targets) trials.

Digit-target compatibility had no significant influence on IPL activation (t(16)\u00bc.95, p\u00bc.36).\nSignificant main effects of magnitude were observed in the medial superior frontal gyrus (F(1,16) \u00bc7, po.018) and right precuneus (F(1,16)\u00bc 7.3, p o.016) that were found to be activated by lateral targets in the group-level task localizer experiment Table 1 Talairach coordinates (in x, y, z) of the cortical regions that were activated by the target discrimination task of the SER localiser experiment. ( Fig. 3c-d) . Large magnitudes elicited stronger responses than small magnitudes in these regions. There was no significant linear relationship between dPSC and digit magnitude in these regions (ps 4.14) and no global effect of digit-target side compatibility (t(16) o1.16, ps4.26).\nBilateral thalamus also responded strongly to lateral targets in the group-level task localizer. The ANOVA revealed significant main effects of hemisphere and of magnitude in these regions (Hemisphere: F(1,16)\u00bc7, po.018; magnitude: F(1,16)\u00bc4.6, po.05; Fig. 3e ). Thalamic activation was indeed stronger in the right than the left hemisphere, and for large than small magnitudes. There was no significant linear relationship between dPSC and digit magnitude (regression equation: y\u00bc0.0407\u00c0 0.0099 \u00c2 (digit magnitude); t(16)\u00bc \u00c01.4, p\u00bc .17) and no overall effect of digit-target compatibility (t(16)\u00bc.95, p\u00bc .36)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present fMRI findings reveal, for the first time, the neuronal correlates of visuo-spatial attention shifts associated with non-predictive central number cues. Participants had to discriminate the color of a lateral target. Before target appearance, a task-irrelevant digit of small or large magnitude (1, 2, or 8, 9, respectively) was briefly presented at fixation. We report that target-related BOLD response in occipital visual regions was modulated by the compatibility of digit magnitude (small/large) and target side (left/right). Targets appearing in the hemifield congruent with respect to digit magnitude (i.e., ''8''-right target) induced larger neuronal responses in extrastriate visual areas than those presented on the incongruent side (i.e. ''8''-left target). The occipital effects of number-space interactions were robust as they were observed irrespective of whether ROIs were defined based on individual data in a visual localizer or on group data in a task localizer. Observing selective attentional enhancements in visual cortex following the presentation of a nonpredictive digit cue provides evidence that numerical and spatial information are integrated at early stages of semantic processing.\nSo far the cerebral substrates of attentional shifts induced by non-predictive number cues had only been investigated using ERP studies (Salillas et al., 2008; Salillas, Gran\u00e1 , El-Yagoubi, & Semenza, 2009; Ranzini et al., 2009) . They provided evidence that number cues evoke cue-locked ERP modulations reflecting the spatial orienting likely operated by parietal and frontal regions, as well as early and late target-locked modulations. It was proposed that early (P1) target-locked effects reflect excitability changes in visual areas and provide neural evidence that number cues can affect visuo-spatial attention to external locations. The late (P3) effects were interpreted as revealing different cognitive requirements as a function of number-space compatibility. But event-related potential evidence has very limited spatial resolution. The present data, for the first time, provide unequivocal evidence that number-induced attentional shifts modulate the response of visual areas, as observed in more conventional attention paradigms on voluntary visuospatial orienting (e.g., Brefczynski & DeYoe, 1999) . This is all the more remarkable since, contrary to other central symbolic cues like eye gaze or arrows (Thiel, Zilles, & Fink, 2004; Hietanen, Nummenmaa, Nyman, Parkkola, & H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, 2006; Engell et al., 2010) , Arabic digit stimuli provide no spatial information whatsoever. Consequently, the number-space association must arise at a purely semantic level related to long-term memory traces ) and/or working memory rehearsal Fias, van Dijck, & Gevers, 2011) of the central uninformative number cues. Together with the ERP data), these findings clearly support the existence of an early locus of number-space integration (for convergent fMRI evidence from a numerical landmark task see also Koten et al., 2011) .\nVisuo-spatial attention orienting has long been known to enhance neural processing in visual cortex (Moran & Desimone, 1985; McAdams & Maunsell, 1999) . The attentional enhancement of information within a circumscribed region of visual space is evoked by the theoretical concept termed spotlight of attention. Brefczynski and DeYoe (1999) for instance showed that when attention was voluntarily directed to a specific target location in the visual field it produced multiple foci of cortical enhancement in occipital visual cortex. The position of these foci within the cortex corresponded precisely with the cortical representation of the attended target. Compatible with the results of the present experiment, Brefczynski and DeYoe (1999) found the largest attentional effects in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. In the present study we observed increased BOLD signal during spationumerical compatible trials in occipital regions encoding the lateral target areas in visual cortex. This indicates that nonpredictive, centrally presented digit cues induce visuo-spatial attention shifts, which result in amplified visual response to right and left visual field stimulation depending on the numerical value of the digit cue.\nThe attentional spotlight is thought to be regulated by top-down attentional control signals in the parietal cortex, which has direct neural connections to occipital cortex (Brefczynski & DeYoe, 1999 ; see also Silver et al., 2007; Lauritzen, D'Esposito, Heeger, & Silver 2009 ). Because of its well-known role in magnitude processing, the parietal cortex is also one of the favorite candidate regions from which the attentional shifts associated with numerical symbols might originate in the present paradigm. Indeed bilateral parietal regions, and especially the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), play a pivotal role in numerical processing in non-human (for a review see Nieder, 2004) and human primates (for a review see Cohen Kadosh et al., 2008) . Neuropsychological studies have shown that lesions in parietal areas often impair number processing (Cipolotti, Butterworth, & Denes, 1991; Delazer & Benke, 1997; Delazer, Karner, Zamarian, Donnemiller, & Benke, 2006) . Cipolotti et al. (1991) for instance described a patient with Gerstmann's syndrome due to parietal lesions who lost the access to numbers above 4, whereas her semantic abilities with other categories and her reasoning skills were intact. Over and above its contribution to complex quantity processing such as comparison or calculation, the parietal cortex thus also plays a core role in automatic processing of number semantics. Basic tasks on numbers that do not require access to their magnitude (e.g., the detection of visual numerals or number words) indeed activate the IPS significantly more than when the same basic tasks are performed with non-numerical stimuli (e.g., detection of letters or colors Eger, Sterzer, Russ, Giraud, & Kleinschmidt, 2003 ; but see Chochon, Cohen, Moortele, & Dehaene, 1999) . These results indicate that numerical magnitude representations are automatically accessed in IPS whenever numerals are detected. Accordingly, the parietal cortex might host the attentional top-down control of the occipital BOLD signal enhancements we observed in response to targets presented after uninformative digits.\nTo date few studies systematically explored the differential neuronal response to small and large number symbols. Here, we observed a significant effect of digit magnitude bilaterally in the parietal cortex. The two bilateral parietal regions (IPS and IPL) identified using an independent localizer yielded a higher BOLD response following large (8, 9) compared to small (1, 2) digits. The posterior right IPS activation is close to a region activated conjointly in symbolic and non-symbolic number magnitude comparison (Holloway, Price, & Ansari, 2010 ; for symbolic comparison only see also Pesenti, Thioux, Seron, & Volder, 2000; Pinel, Dehaene, Rivi ere, & LeBihan, 2001; Ansari, Garcia, Lucas, Hamon, & Dhital, 2005) . Ranzini et al., (2009) also recently reported larger ERP amplitudes over parietal electrode sites for large compared to small digit magnitude (see their Fig. 3) . The high spatial resolution of the present data allows confirming that activity modulations related to magnitude arise in parietal cortex. As digit magnitude was non-informative in the present study, magnitude effect on parietal activity is likely to result from differences in the automatic semantic processing of large vs. small numbers.\nIt is important to note that bilateral activations in the IPS and IPL were identified using the group-level task localizer, which was designed to highlight sensori-motor regions activated by the lateral target discrimination task and did not contain any numerical stimulus material or processing requirement. Consequently, magnitude-related activity changes in these regions provide indirect evidence for interactions between visuo-spatial and numerical processing in parietal cortex. However, neither the ANOVA nor the regression analyses testing for a direct interaction between digit magnitude and target side yielded significant interactions in IPS and IPL. This observation is in line with the findings of Koten et al. (2011) , who also failed to observe number-space interactions in the parietal cortex when participants performed a numerical landmark task and the BOLD response was analyzed using univariate statistics as done here. Only using a more fine-grained multi-voxel pattern analysis could this interaction be demonstrated. Future studies using an appropriate fMRI design should address whether this methodological approach would provide similar results with the present attentional cueing paradigm (Fischer et al., 2003; Posner, 1980; Posner, Cohen, & Rafal, 1982) .\nConsidering that (Koten et al. (2011) ) report late responserelated, as well early semantic number-space interactions, one could have expected further attentional effects in the other regions highlighted by the group-level task localizer. Given its role in response selection (Kurata, Tsuji, Naraki, Seino, & Abe, 2000; Dux, Ivanoff, Asplund, & Marois, 2006) especially the medial superior frontal gyrus would seem an ideal candidate for response-related number-space interactions. However, the main effect of digit magnitude we observed in this region only provides indirect evidence in this direction. The discrepancy with the results of Koten et al. (2011) might be due to the use of different behavioral paradigms and/or analysis methods.\nIn the present study numerals were task-irrelevant and passively viewed. Consequently the visuo-spatial attention effects we observed in occipital regions are in line with the mental number line view proposing that numbers ''automatically elicit task-, modality-and effector-independent spatial representations, even when these spatial representations are not strictly relevant to the task'' ). According to this approach, spatialnumerical interactions arise at a central level of semantic representation of numbers in long term memory and are an example of ''neuronal recycling'' (Dehaene, 2005) . It is proposed that the same spatial attention mechanisms are being used to shift attention between positions in physical space and the mental number line .\nOn the other hand, and despite the fact that number cues were task-irrelevant and passively viewed, it cannot be excluded that the lateral target discrimination task itself created a spatial context for the semantic processing of the central digit cues, entailing the observed attentional modulations. If this reasoning is correct, attentional effects should not be observed when participants are passively viewing the same attentional cueing paradigm, i.e., without performing a task on the lateral targets. According to this view, spatio-numerical interactions would not be intrinsic properties of semantic representations triggered automatically by numbers, but arise as a function of task context. This proposal is in line with the observation that number-related attentional effects are highly sensitive to task instructions and context (Galfano et al., 2006; Ristic et al., 2006) . More generally, it also fits with the recent observation that even basic numberrelated effects such as the distance effect are task-related and only arise if number semantics need to be accessed for successful task performance (Goldfarb, Henik, Rubinsten, Bloch-David, & Gertner, 2011) .\nIn summary the present study demonstrates that numberrelated attentional shifts are associated with modulations of visual responses to subsequently presented lateral targets in occipital cortex. The digit magnitude effect observed in the bilateral parietal cortex supports the hypothesis that the attentional effect originates in this cortical region known to play a critical role in number representation (Cohen Kadosh et al., 2008; Ansari, 2008; Nieder & Dehaene, 2009 )."}]
