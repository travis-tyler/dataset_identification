[{"section_title": "General Considerations", "text": "One important use of assessment is to find out where education has been weak. As an example, consider the results in geometry in the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessment of knowledge of advanced students in the last year of high school [Mullis et al. 1997] . 1 The average score for the 17 countries was 500. The scores ranged from 424 to 548. The four countries with lowest scores on advanced mathematics and percentage of students in advanced mathematics courses are as follows: As can be seen, the percentage of students taking advanced mathematics in the last year of secondary school could vary widely between countries. In general, the better students take advanced mathematics in their final year of school, so a higher percent of students taking advanced math would tend to lower the average score. Thus the gap between 424 and 462, large as it is, underestimates how much U.S. students are below the students in other countries which did not do very well. This gap is unacceptably large. Neal Lane, then director of the National Science Foundation, pointed this out in his comments in Pursuing Excellence [NCES 1998 ]. Unfortunately, this gap, which I consider strong evidence of a very poor geometry program in the United States, was not mentioned in Principles and Standards for School Mathematics [NCTM 2000] ."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS countries with lowest advanced mathematics scores", "text": "To illustrate some of the problems in the knowledge of geometry, consider a classic simple problem from synthetic geometry [TIMSS 1995, problem K18] .\nIn the ABC the altitudes BN and CM intersect at point S. The measure of \u2020MSB is 40 \u0131 and the measure of \u2020SBC is 20 \u0131 . Write a PROOF of the following statement:\n\"ABC is isosceles.\"\nGive geometric reasons for statements in your proof. All that is needed to solve this problem is to know that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees; and write that angle BSC is 140 degrees, so angle SCB is 20 degrees. Angle CSN is 40 degrees, so angles MBS and NCS are each 50 degrees. Thus the base angles are equal, so the triangle is isosceles. This is an easy example of a type of problem which is given in grade 8 in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. See, for example, [Chan et al. 2005, problem 38, p. 9.51; Kodaira 1992, problem 3, p. 121; Teh and Looi 2001, problems 1 and 3, p. 323] The first two are eighth grade books, the third is seventh grade. None of these East Asian countries participated in the 1995 TIMSS assessment of advanced students.\nThe international average of correct responses on this problem was not high, only 35%. The range was from 10% to 65% with the U.S. score the lowest at 10% correct. When partially correct answers were also considered, the U.S. percentage went up to 19% and the international average to 50%.\nIn the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [Mullis et al. 2004] , it is interesting to compare the U.S. and Singapore scores: Overall average 518 584\nThe absolute difference has been mentioned by many people, but I want to point out a relative difference. In grade 4 there are five categories. The results for both of these countries were similar in four of these categories, but in both cases there was an outlier; for the U.S. in Data and for Singapore in Number. The Singapore program has a strong focus on arithmetic and multi-step word problems.\nIn Beyond Arithmetic the following claim is made [Mokros et al. 1995, p.74 ]:\nIn the Investigations curriculum, standard algorithms are not taught because they interfere with a child's growing number sense and fluency with the number system.\nThe standard algorithms are taught in Singapore, and this is supplemented by other methods which work in specific instances. The standard algorithms do not get in the way of students learning mathematics. When taught well, they help develop knowledge of place value, the use of the distributive law when doing multiplication, and estimation when doing division. A focus on work with numbers and good word problems provides an excellent foundation for algebra. In grade 8 2003 TIMSS [Mullis et al. 2004 ], Singapore's average score went up to 605 while the U.S. average score went down to 504. The data in the preceding table and grade 8 TIMSS data, showing a large drop in the U.S. geometry score, suggest to me that we should rethink our priorities."}, {"section_title": "Examinations for Teachers", "text": "In his 1986 American Education Research Association Presidential Address, Lee Shulman [1986] started with some comments on content which he called \"the forgotten part of education.\" To illustrate the importance of content long ago, he mentioned a test given to prospective grammar school teachers in California in the 1870s [California 1875]. (Grammar school was grades 1 to 8.) The exam covered a wide range of skills and knowledge teachers need. It had 20 sections worth a total of 1,000 points. Three parts were on mathematics, written arithmetic (100 points), mental arithmetic (50 points), and algebra (50 points). Here are some questions from each of the mathematics parts. These questions are among the more complicated ones, but are representative of a substantial fraction of the questions on these exams."}, {"section_title": "Written arithmetic", "text": "Prove that in dividing by a fraction we invert the divisor and then proceed as in multiplication.\nIf 18 men consume 34 barrels of potatoes in 135 days, how long will it take 45 men to consume 102 barrels?

The hat cost $6; the hat and coat cost 9 times as much as the vest. What was the cost of each?\nDivide 88 into two such parts that shall be to each other as 2 =3 is to 4 =5."}, {"section_title": "Algebra", "text": "Three stone masons, A, B, C, are to build a wall. A and B, jointly, can build the wall in 12 days; B and C can build it in 20 days, and A and C in 15 days. How many days would each require to build the wall, and in what time will they finish it if all three work together? [There is an implied assumption that A will work at the same rate whether working alone or with others, and the same for B and C.] Divide the number 27 into two such parts, that their product shall be to the sum of their squares as 20 to 41.\nA May-pole is 56 feet high. At what distance above the ground must it be broken in order that the upper part, clinging to the stump, may touch the ground 12 feet from the foot?\nThere were 10 questions in each of these parts. The time allowed was not stated, but at least two hours should be allotted to written arithmetic and to written grammar, two of three topics which were worth 100 points. \"Applicants who fail to reach fifty credits [points] in written arithmetic, or in grammar, or in spelling\" fail. \"Applicants reaching less than sixty credits in any one of these must receive only a third grade certificate, no matter what average percentage they may make.\"\nOne comment on the written arithmetic part is worth quoting completely.\nHeretofore applicants have very seldom paid any attention to the special requirements of a paper. For instance, in written arithmetic, applicants are instructed that \"no credits are to be allowed unless the answer is correct and the work is given in full, and, when possible, such explanations as would be required of a teacher in instructing a class; a rule is not an explanation.\" This instruction has generally been disregarded. In future this will be a ground for the rejection of the paper. [California 1875, p. 214] Contrast these questions and remarks with some exams given now for teachers. The Praxis tests seem to be the tests most commonly used by states as part of certification requirements. Here are two Praxis sample questions [ETS 2005] for candidates who want to teach middle school mathematics. (Middle school students are generally between ages 11 and 15.) These questions are representative of the posted questions. For experienced teachers, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) has developed a certification program, which is used to encourage teacher growth and reward those who show adequate knowledge on an examination and an adequate portfolio presentation of their teaching. Here are two questions on algebra for teachers teaching early adolescents, taken from the samples available at the NBPTS web site, www.nbpts.org, in 2005. (They and the NBPTS sample high school question on the next page have since been replaced by other sample questions.) NBPTS defines \"early adolescents\" as 11-to 15-year-olds, so these are students at the upper end of the ages of those taught by candidates taking California exams in the 1870s.\nUse the table of coordinates below to respond to the following prompts. Not only are these much easier questions, the second one does not model the cost of a taxi ride, since the cost goes up in discrete increments for certain fractions of a mile, so the graph should be a step function.\nHere is a sample of the NBPTS test for high school mathematics teachers, again from www.nbpts.org.\nUse the following problem to respond to the prompt below.\nSolve jx 3j C jx 2j D 15.\nA student submits the following response:\na) Give a detailed explanation of the mathematical understandings and misunderstandings reflected in the student's response.\nb) Identify the mathematical knowledge and skills the student needs in order to understand why the response is incorrect. Be specific about what mathematics the student needs to learn to enable her to avoid the same error when solving problems requiring similar conceptual and procedural knowledge. Nothing like this degree of knowledge seems to be asked on either the Praxis tests or the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards tests. Although only 50 points out of 1,000 in the California exams were in the section on the theory and practice of teaching, some of the questions in this section dealt with very important parts of teaching. Here are two, the second of which was mentioned in [Shulman 1986 ]. I had to learn how to improve my oral reading when starting to read to our children. Either the skill mentioned in the question below had disappeared by 1940 or I was a poor student in this area.\nWhat is your method to teach children to discontinue the sing-song, or monotonous tones which many acquire in reading? Is the method original with yourself?"}, {"section_title": "How do you interest lazy and careless pupils? [Answer in full]", "text": "Multiple-choice questions were not used 100 years ago. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards does not use multiple choice items, but the Praxis mathematics content tests used by most states do. A method of asking questions so they can be machine graded yet cannot be solved by eliminating all but one of the answers will be described in the next section. Shulman [1986] mentioned examining tests from Colorado, Massachusetts, and Nebraska in addition to tests from California and Michigan. Comparing such tests with current tests would be an important service that educators could do. State tests for teachers from the last part of the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century can be found in reports by State Superintendents of Education. State historical societies or major university libraries are places to look for these reports. I thank William Reese for mentioning this to me. (See also the Acknowledgements section on page 134.)"}, {"section_title": "Examinations for Students", "text": "A recent report [Ginsburg et al. 2005] compares and contrasts some aspects of mathematics education in Singapore with education in the United States. The comments on the level of questions asked of grade 6 students in Singapore and what is asked of grade 8 U.S. students in some state tests and of prospective teachers on the Praxis tests should be read by anyone who cares about mathematics education. The conclusions of this report, like the evidence from the test items cited above, make clear that U.S. expectations are set far too low.\nHere is a problem for eighth-grade students mentioned in a March 20, 1998 guest column in the Wisconsin State Journal by M. Wilsman, then a member of the Board of the Wisconsin Mathematics Council. Twenty-six other members of the WMC helped in writing the column, which was meant as a response to an article that claimed mathematics education was not effective. Wilsman asserted that this problem was on the state test:\nEric hopes to sell 1 =3 of a dozen paintings that he has finished for the art fair. Which equation should you solve to find the number of paintings that he wants to sell?\nFew people would solve an equation to find how many paintings Eric hoped to sell. Just divide 12 by 3 to find the answer. I tried to find out what was on this test. The test developers told me this question was not on the test. It had been submitted, but was not thought to be good enough for their tests. Instead, it was used as a sample problem in a test preparation guide [CTB/McGraw Hill 1997, p. 62] . I do not understand why the problem was not discarded rather than used as an illustrative example.\nI wrote a response and mentioned a grade 6 Japanese problem that was available on the Web [Pacific Software 1995] . Contrast this problem for grade 6 students in Japan with the one which was suggested as a good problem for grade 8 students in Wisconsin. (Again, an assumption is made about a uniform working rate of people even in different size groups.)\nA job takes 30 days to complete by eight people. How long will the job take when it is done by 20 people? Another source of Japanese problems is a collection of translations of Japanese university entrance exam questions [Wu 1993 ]. All of the problems are interesting, but I want to just describe how the response format used allows machine grading without being multiple choice. Consider a problem from an 1875 California exam.\nBought 4 lemons and 7 peaches for 13 cents; 5 oranges and 8 lemons for 44 cents; and 10 peaches and 3 oranges for 20 cents; what was the price of one of each kind?\nAs a multiple-choice problem, if the price of any one of the three is given the problem becomes trivial. Yes, one could ask what would be the cost of 13 lemons, 10 oranges and 16 peaches as a multiple-choice problem, but here is a much better way to ask for answers. The cost of a peach is A=B where next to A on the answer sheet is C 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and test-takers are told that fractions should be recorded in lowest form. In this case, A D 1 and B D 2.\nThe Japanese use this format on their analogue of the SAT, and ask multistep questions with individual parts having answers which are recorded. This way they can learn at what step in a multi-step problem many students have trouble. We in the United States need multi-step problems on our exams. We have turned too much of our assessing over to measurement people, and the level of mathematics being assessed shows this. Even the National Research Council, when it did a study of tests for prospective teachers, did not have content people looking at the tests [NRC 2001, p. 416] .\nThe picture one gets of education from old exams is consistent with the picture I had formed on the basis of looking at many old textbooks. The common view is that long ago all that students were asked to do is learn a procedure. This is not borne out in the exams given to prospective teachers. Recall that candidates were expected to give reasons for what was being done, both in these tests and in their teaching. In addition, the level of problems which teacher candidates were expected to solve was higher than we now ask of prospective teachers. This higher level of questions also shows up in many old textbooks. We have a lot to learn from the past, including past assessments.\nFurther information on tests for teachers is given in [Burlbaw 2002 ].\npeople for helping to bring to light some very interesting documents on education in the United States in the 19th century."}]
