[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Dietary supplements (DSs) contain one or more dietary compounds as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect. The use of DSs has been steadily increasing all over the world for the last decades, and approximately 50-75% of populations have taken them routinely, and almost half of them-regularly [1] [2] [3] [4] . Consumers use DSs for a broad range of reasons, which depends on their age, sex, physical activity, or health status, but mainly the overall health and wellness, illness prevention, and correction of the dietary deficiencies are indicated [3, 5, 6] . Disturbing is that DSs are consumed by people without any clinical signs or symptoms of deficiency, and their effectiveness in such conditions is questioned. However, it should be remembered that dietary supplements should not replace a healthy and balanced diet, but correct the deficiency or maintain an adequate intake of a certain nutrient [7] .\nRecently, due to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, a new reason for DSs use has emerged.

In GT, it is possible to analyze a \"search term\" (literal typed term) or a \"topic\" (all phrases related to popular queries), which allows to analyze all related queries in all available languages. Additionally, GT allows to compare up to five terms at the same time [20] .\nFor the purpose of this study, we collected GT data since 1 January 2020 up to 31 October 2020, both worldwide and separately in Poland.

Interestingly, for onion, we noted a peak in August 2020 related to a Salmonella outbreak linked to onions in North America [29] . However, we observed that although four out of five top queries for onions were related to Salmonella, one was related to the coronavirus.\nOur population-based PLifeCOVID-19 Studies provided consistent results with GT analysis. We observed that DSs were used by 48% (Study 1) and 79% (Study 2), and DSs users were more often younger, better educated women living in more urbanized areas, which is in line with previous studies [1, 3, 5, 30] . Interestingly, vitamins D and C were most often supplemented compounds, as also followed by zinc were most often started supplemented since the beginning of the pandemic in both editions of PLifeCOVID-19 Studies. We observed that omega-3 fatty acids were among the three most popular DSs, but were not introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. As previous studies report, vitamin C [1, 3, 5] , vitamin D [5] , and omega-3 fatty acids [3, 5] are one of the most popular nutrients taken with DSs. A recent study from Saudi Arabia found that vitamin C was used during the COVID-19 pandemic by almost all DSs users [31] . Another study from the USA reported that medication changed in barely 3% of respondents, mostly regarding introducing new vitamins or DSs, including zinc and vitamin C, since COVID-19 spread [32] .\nIn the second edition of our study, we also reported that between 16 to 33% of respondents during the autumn period increased their intake of turmeric, garlic, raspberry syrup, fermented vegetables and fruits, lemon, honey, and ginger. Alyami et al. [31] also reported that around 15% of respondents used herbal products or DSs, and even twice more believed that consumption of turmeric, ginger, garlic, or onion may help to increase immunity and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19. In our study, immunity improvement and improving the overall health and wellness were the main reasons for DSs use, declared by nearly 60% of respondents. In addition, other studies report that use of some DSs is often justified by the desire to improve immunity, overall health, to prevent illness, or to treat viral infections, even before the COVID-19 outbreak [3, [5] [6] [7] 13, 31, 33, 34] .\nIndeed, there is some scientific evidence on immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral properties of several bioactive compounds and foods, including vitamins D and C, zinc, selenium, garlic, ginger, turmeric, lactoferrin, elderberry, or Nigella sativa, however they cannot be freely extrapolated to the effects on the SARS-CoV-2 virus [9, 11, 14, 22, 23, 34] . Recently, the compounds like vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, probiotics, curcumin, quercetin have been extensively studied in the context of coronavirus [34] [35] [36] . Initial surveys have found them to possess an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, and suggest they might provide both prophylactic and adjuvant therapy against COVID-19 effects, therefore, they are being fast-tracked into clinical trials [34, 35] . Recent studies have linked deficiency of zinc [35] , selenium [37] , or vitamin C [36, 38] to poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Existing studies have shown that adequate serum levels of vitamin D and C may reduce the incidence of a COVID-19-related \"cytokine storm\" [36, 39] , which is further correlated to lung injury and unfavorable prognosis of COVID-19 [40] . However, low vitamin D concentrations might not only cause inflammation but might result from inflammation in the organism, showing the possible reverse causality between vitamin D and inflammatory processes [41] . Several studies investigated the role of high doses of vitamin D [42, 43] or vitamin C [36] in COVID-19 patients with promising evidences on their ability to reduce not only the severity of COVID-19 but also mortality. Currently, mass administration of vitamin D supplements to populations at risk for COVID-19 is commonly recommended [11, 39, 42, 44] . Above mentioned pieces of evidence suggest that the use of DSs may be necessary to obtain and/or maintain the optimal levels of those nutrients, specifically in individuals with higher risk of their deficiencies, including the elderly, obese, or with co-morbidities, like diabetes [45] . On the other hand, results concerning the role of supplementation in the prevention of COVID-19 in healthy and well-nourished individuals are still not fully investigated [34] . Analysis of 13 guidelines regarding nutrition during the pandemic revealed that in eleven documents, the use of DSs in COVID-19 prevention was not mentioned at all, while in the remaining two, the authors remarked that DSs use was acceptable but to meet the nutrients' recommendations [10] . Due to the fact that in developed countries, including Europe, the intake of most of the vitamins and minerals, except vitamin D, iron, and iodine in certain populations, generally meets their recommendations [46] , DSs use is not entirely justified [10] and should be monitored to prevent excessive intake of nutrients [47] .\nInterestingly, we observed moderate and very strong positive correlations between interest in compounds and foods with immune-boosting properties (as elderberry; turmeric; onion; Nigella sativa; vitamin C; ginger; garlic) and coronavirus RSV, but adverse correlations with worldwide cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths (for elderberry, turmeric). Our results are inconsistent with those presented by Mayasari et al. [17] , but once again, the possible explanation might be the different time frames of GT analysis in both surveys. Our study indicated that the interest in the above mentioned terms was the highest at the beginning of the pandemic (when also a peak in coronavirus RSV was observed), but the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths were the lowest, and this interest has not increased proportionally to the development of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed similar results in the second PLifeCOVID-19 Study, in which higher percentage of respondents declared the introduction of supplementation with immune-related nutrients and compounds during the first wave of the pandemic (and lockdown), when COVID-19 cases and deaths in Poland were incomparably lower than in the second wave during autumn. Previous GT analysis and population-based studies revealed that the interests [48] [49] [50] and practices [51] of protective behaviors, such as hand washing or use of hand sanitizers increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, undertaken of those health-protective behaviors was related to a variety of factors, including sociodemographic [51] [52] [53] , psychological characteristic (e.g., emotion regulation [54] ), perception of being at risk to get COVID-19 [54] , media or social-media exposure and trust in information from media and other people (friends and bloggers) [53, 55, 56] , and knowledge or beliefs about COVID-19 [53] , however there is a limited number of studies comparing both waves of the pandemic [54] .\nAlthough COVID-19 vaccines have already been invented, but have not been available for a broad use yet [57] , it is still necessary to use effective preventive actions against COVID-19 spread, including social isolation, physical distance, washing hands, wearing masks, but DSs usage is not mentioned [9, 10, 58] . Regarding dietary interventions, a healthy diet abundant in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, and concurrently restricted in salt, fat, and sugar is recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic [10] . Nevertheless, previous results showed that during the pandemic, many people worsened their diet or/and gained weight [24, 25, [59] [60] [61] . Unfortunately, knowledge about COVID-19 prevention is not fully satisfactory [31, 52, 62] and often derives from social-media or media [52, 62] . As it was previously described, Internet information about methods of COVID-19 prevention and treatment, or immune system boosting, including the use of DSs, varies significantly depending on the type of website (e.g., governmental or commercial) and sometimes has an inadequate quality or even presents potentially harmful information quite often [14, 15, 50, 63] . Interestingly, during lockdown, less respondents from Poland declared to have a contact with DSs advertisements, but more believed that DSs quality was well controlled compared to the pre-pandemic period [64] . However, the COVID-19 pandemic created an increased requisition for immune-boosting products, which may be used by quackery of vendors, as FDA (Food and Drug Administration) reported that above 3% of their warning letters regarded COVID-19-related drugs, DSs, or devices [65] . Future studies should examine the impact of the intake of the specific nutrients or bioactive compounds with DSs on the incidence of COVID-19 and its course in relation to nutritional status, general health, and age, and particularly, to comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, chronic lung diseases including asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is necessary to more deeply investigate the role, as well as the mechanisms of action, for vitamins D and C, zinc, and selenium in patients with deficiencies of those nutrients. In addition, it should be examined whether and which DSs ingredients (vitamins, minerals, bioactive substances, herbs) show a positive effect in relation to COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, in healthy, well-nourished individuals."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "This study has some strengths and limitations that should be acknowledged.

In addition, it is the first study that also included population-based results regarding DSs use during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. An important strength of this survey is the typology of the study we appropriately selected during this period and its ease of access for the participants. In fact, due to the quarantine and limitations in contacts, the online survey was an ideal research instrument, as it allowed us to recruit a large sample. Among the strengths of the online survey, we highlight the possibility of reaching the population belonging to different geographical areas and, moreover, the speed of data collection. In addition, we conducted the study in two key periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland-in the first wave of the pandemic (and national lockdown) in spring and in the second wave of the pandemic in autumn, when an extensive increase in the number of infections and deaths was experienced.\nNevertheless, a weakness which needs to be highlighted was that the GT tool is not representative for all Internet searches, because it varies among countries and is most popular from several research engines [66] . Moreover, we narrowed our GT analysis to the \"health\" category to distinguish the searches related to the immune system from those related to e.g., culinary purposes or chemical properties. Secondly, our samples from both studies, despite differences, were characterized by relatively high proportion of younger respondents, possibly due to the dissemination manner (via social media) and familiarity with digital technologies among young people. Moreover, due to the lockdown in the first edition of the study (April-May 2020) and numerous limitations of contacts in the second edition of the study (November 2020), it was not possible to conduct face-to-face research. Another limitation was the skewness in gender and education distribution of responders, which resulted in oversampling of women, and of those with a higher (university) education level. In particular, this may be a limitation to generalize the results of our research to the entire population in Poland."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our study showed the effect of COVID-19 on DSs-related behaviors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Interest and use of immune-related nutrients and foods, such as vitamins C and D, zinc, garlic, ginger, or turmeric increased. As there are no clear and convincing studies that support the role of dietary supplementation in COVID-19 prevention and the existing risk of elevated intake of some nutrients due to the popularity of DSs, effective education of consumers in rationale use of DSs and health-protecting behaviors against COVID-19 should be developed and introduced at local and/or national levels.
