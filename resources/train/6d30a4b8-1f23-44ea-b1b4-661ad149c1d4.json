State officials now must determine per acre values in use by capitalizing estimates of annual net returns to land. This approach conforms to accepted theories of land valuation (Barkley and Boisvert) but leads to two principal administrative problems. First, a variety of crops are produced in New York and net income for land varies by soil quality and crop rotation. Second, capitalized values (and thus the size of tax exemptions) can fluctuate from year to year reflecting short-term movements in commodity and input prices and the capitalization rate.\nThis report deals with the year-to-year variability in farmland use values. Specific objectives are to: (a) compare alternative farmland use values for 21 New York counties and assess their variability over the 10-year period, 1973 through 1983, and (b) devise statistical methods to partition the variation in the values among the major components of the capitalization formula.\nThe first section of the report places the analysis in an historical perspective by describing state policies for taxing farmland and the factors which precipitated recent administrative changes in New York's program. The second section describes the data and procedures used in the analysis and a third section describes the empirical results. A concluding section is devoted to the study's implications for state property tax policy, taxpayer equity and the ability of local governments to finance public services."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The New York State Legislature passed the Agricultural Districts Law in 1971 \"to conserve and protect and to encourage the development and improvement of agricultural lands . . .\" (New York Agricultural and Markets Law, $ 300). The law provides for the formation of agricultural districts and facilitates the retention of agricultural land by: (a) restricting many of the usual options open to local governments whose boundaries overlap those of the agricultural districts; (b) requiring some state agencies to alter their administrative regulations that otherwise might adversely affect agriculture and (c) limiting the ability of governmental units to impose benefit assessments or special ad valorem levies on farmland within a district.\nThe law also allow owners to pay taxes on land's value in an agricultural use. Generally, owners of 10 or more acres which generated average gross sales of at least $10,000 in the preceding two years may make annual application for use-value assessment of their farm land. 1 If land receiving an exemption is converted to a non-agricultural use, a rollback tax is applicable to converted land for each of the 1This provision is commonly referred to as use-vatue assessment but it is actually a tax exemption, equal to that portion of the tax liability due to the difference between the assessed value of the property and the use value, multiplied by an equalization rate. This approach, as one might expect, was criticized for reasons which trace to difficulties in apportioning value between land and improvements, accommodating high prices for small parcels in close proximity to buyers' existing land holdings, and accounting for any speculative motives reflected in a parcel's sale price.\nE&A argued that these difficulties were minimized by ignoring sales and appraisals involving add-ens and transactions with nonfarm buyers (McCord) but was unsympathetic to repeated suggestions that the Legislature's intent would be better served by a methodology based on capitalized yearly net returns to land. They stressed that this method posed problems with selecting an appropriate capitalization rate; deficiencies in data were also expected because of wide variations in soil quality, topography and crop and livestock enterprises on the state's commercial farms. Such difficulties often plague exercises in asset valuation but in addition, cash rental rates for New York farmland are often casual, and reflect in-kind remuneration and non-economic considerations (Knoblauch; Locken et al.) .\nThe (Boisvert and Bills, 1984b) .\nSome of this variability is due to marginal changes in the procedures for estimating these values and in the way that orchard and vineyard values are incorporated. However, from a long-term perspective, it is important to know the extent of the inherent variability in the capitalization procedure and how it compares to movements in use values based on annual updates of market sales. It is also important to identify the contribution of each component of the capitalization procedure to overall variabilityy in capitalized net returns."}, {"section_title": "Data and Procedures", "text": "This analysis compares the market sales based method (MSM) for valuing mineral soils originally developed by E&A with the capitalized net return (C,NR) method implemented in 1981. The results are for 21 New York counties for which cropland soil information could be obtained (Figure 1 To begin, cropland in each county is distributed among soil mapping units and aggregated into soil productivity groups identified under new administrative procedures. Second, the land in these soil groups is redistributed among the land classes used for the period 1978-80 by making the correspondence between the total digestible nutrient (TDN) production implied by the new classes and the yields on which the old classes were based. The procedures for calculating the capitalized returns for each soil group are described below, whereas the market sales based values are those actually used by E&A for use-value assessment for 1973-80. These values differed by county."}, {"section_title": "Cropland by Soil Group", "text": "While modern published soil surveys are available for all the counties studied, estimates of acreage by soil mapping unit pertain to the total land rather than cropland in the county. Unpublished point sample data collected for the 1967 Conservation Needs Inventory are used to distribute crop production by soil mapping unit. The 1967 percentage distribution of cropland by soil mapping unit for each county is applied to the corresponding aggregate \"total cropland\" on commercial farms as reported in the 1978 Census of Agriculture. By necessity, this procedure assumes that the distribution of cropland soils has remained constant over the 1967-78 period (Boisvert and Bills, 1984a) .\nCropland is then assigned to one often mineral soil groups in a land classification system developed for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. Each soil mapping unit is given an index value which reflects judgments about a soil's capacity to produce TDN. Soils falling into the first eight soil groups are judged to be usable for crop production. The TDN index values are based on yield estimates for corn silage and hay, in appropriate rotations (Table 1) .\nIn 1978 there were nearly 2,4 million acres of cropland in the 21 study counties. Only 2.2 percent of the cropland is in the highly rated group 1, Similarly, only 2.5 percent is in the least productive group. By making the correspondence between the yields and rotations for corn and hay used to group soils in 1981 and the yields which were used to define land classes, A, B, C and P in Table 1 , one can effectively compare the impact of the MSM and CNR administrative alternatives on the use value of cropland in the 21 counties."}, {"section_title": "Capitalized Net Returns by Soil Group", "text": "The new procedures require that the capitalized net returns to land be established by E&A, Thus,"}, {"section_title": "('1)", "text": "where VtU is use value per acre in year t for soil group i and lime class j; Ntij is net residual returns to land per acre in year t for land in soil group i and lime class j and t-tis the capitalization rate for year t, Residual returns to land for each of the soil groups are based on enterprise budgets for corn silage and hay, weighted according to appropriate rotations. 3 As required by law, the capitalization rate is the effective interest rate on new Federal Land Bank loans made in the Springfield District. To reduce year-to-year fluctuations both the net returns and the capitalization rate in year t are calculated as a simple five-year moving average using the most currently available cost and returns data. This necessitates a two-year lag (e.g., for t = 1981 values are based on 1975-79 average).\nBecause the new system for calculating agricultural use values has been in operation only since 1981, it was necessary to construct capitalized returns for the years 1973 through 1980 (see Boisvert and Bills, 1984b) . The input requirements and yields were assumed to remain constant, isolating the variation due to changes in input and output prices and capitalization rates.4 3 Accordingto Knoblauch and Milligan: In total, 14 economic profiles (residual returns to land) were constructed for eight soil groups. Soil Groups I through VI have an economic profile for high-lime and another for lowlime soil mapping units. Soil Groups VU and VIII have an economic profile for low lime only . For all except Soil Group VIII, the economic profile consists of an enterprise budget for com and an enterprise budget for hay with the net income for the total economic profile being weighted on the specified rotation (pp, i-2). 4 The procedures used to calculate residual returns from corn and hay budgets are similar to those used by the state in 1981-83 but the agricultural value estimates differ in two respects. First, in the values used for tax purposes during 1981-83, net returns to land in orchards and vineyards were given a small weight to reflect the fact that these crops occupy a smell fraction of the mineral-soil cropland. These returns are ignored here because in 1984 a decision has been made to treat orchards and vineyards separately. and hay yields associated with each class. To facilitate comparisons, these yields were converted to TDN, and tier assigning a rotation, a correspondence between the two systems was obtained: class A = groups 1 and 2; class B = groups 3 and 4; class C = groups 5 and 6, plus % group 7; class P = IA group 7, plus group 8.\nDespite attempts to reduce year-to-year fluctuations in the capitalized returns by using five-year averages, it is still important to understand the contribution of the several components of the formula to the remaining overall variabilityy. This decomposition begins by rewriting equation (1) Because Xl and X2 are products of random variables, the decomposition of crv2 proceeds according to Bohrnstedt and Goldberger. Boisvert and Bills ( 1984b) develop the exact expressions for the variance and covariances for products of random variables in this application. Using the Kendall-Stuart asymptotic approximation (where E is the expectation operator, U2 is variance and m is covariance) Seeond, agricultural values for the pwm soils have been set at nominal values when estimated net returns were negative. Unless stated otherwise, these negative vatues were set to zero here.\n(4)~q z = E'yR)m1,r2+ 2E(R)E(1h)~R.1/r + E2(l/r)UR2 + RMX1\n(5) ux~2 = E2(C)ml/r2 + 2E(C)E(l/r)uC,ll, + E2(l/r)mc2 + RMXZ (6) UX1,X2 = E(R) E(c)~m2 + E(R)E(l/r)~llr,c + E(l/r)E(C)~R,llr + E2(l/r)mR,c + RMx1,x2. The RM's are the remainders of higher order terms.5 Substituting equations (4), (5) and (6) into equation (3),\nThe first three terms of equation (7) are the direct contributions of R, C and l/r to the variance of V. The next three terms are the first-order interaction effects, while the remainders represent higher order interactions. Each of these interactions reflects an iniluence on the variance of V that cannot be decom-S For this decomposition to be useful, the higher order terms in the remainder must be smrdl (Burt and Finley).\nposed and attributed to one of the specific components. Burt and Finley, in a related application, normalize each of the first six terms by dividing each by the sum of the first 3 terms. Thus, the terms (where S is the expression in { } from equation (7) can be interpreted as the net effects directly attributable to the three components, respectively. These interaction effects can be measured relative to the direct effects were important but the correspondence between the two systems was made rather easily. The major difficulty is that agricultural values based on the market sales method (MSM) involve separate values by county for each land class, while a single set of capitalized net returns to land (CNR) is applied to all upstate mineral soils. An efficient means of comparison is a weighted average per acre use value for the 2 l-county aggregate (Table 2) Figure 1 for the counties included. b They are the land classes used for agricultural value purposes during these years. See Table I and McCord for more details.\n' Capitalizednet returns to land (CNR) developedusing procedures described in the text. These are weighted averages, weighted by the acreage8 by land class,\nThe correspondence between the 1973-80 land classes and soil classes used since then is outlined in Table 1 . d Calculated using the agricultural values promulgated by E&A in these tax years. They are based on market sales information and differ by county. These are weighted averages, weighted by tbe acreages by land class. (Boisvert and Bilk, 1984b) . Since MSM-values are not available after 1980, it is impossible to know the exact nature of the differences, However, in 1979, E&A recommended a 50 percent increase in the MSM-values over the previous year. This recommendation was based on data from a 1974-78 sample of farmer-to-farmer land sales and would have raised the 1980 and 1981 MSM-values above the CNR-values (Boisvert and Bills, 1984a) . This suggests that E&A's eight percent yearly adjustments throughout the 1970's, and the 1981 projections used in this paper, were on the low side.\nFor the 2 l-county aggregate, the absolute difference in the per acre use values between land classes is generally larger for the CNRmethod than for the MSM-method (Table 2) . In percentage terms, the situation is less clear. For example, the CNR-value for \"A\" cropland averages $536 per acre. This is $178 per acre or 50 percent higher than the value of \"B\" land. Using MSM-estimates, the value of \"A\" land is 59 percent higher than 6'B\" land. The situation between \"B\" and \"C\" land is just the reverse, For the MSM-estimates, the average value for\" B\" land is about 83 percent higher than for' 'C\" land. The difference when use values are estimated by CNR is $217; the value of\" B\" land is estimated to be 153 percent higher than for \"C\" land.\nThe CNR-method consistently places relatively higher differential values on the most productive cropland. The explanation is probably inherent in the nature of the two procedures. As productivity rises, gross revenues in most budgeting procedures increase proportionately more than production costs. In contrast, the differences in MSM-estimates across land classes are determined on a more subjective basis. Allocations of a parcel's sales value by land class lead to smaller differentials, particularly between cropland of low to moderate quality.\nThe variation in the CNR use values over the 1973-81 period as measured by either the standard deviation or the coefficient of variation is substantially larger for the MSM-values (Table 2) . For the average per acre values, as well as for land classes \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C, \" the CNR'S coefficients of variation are about double those for the MSM. This is not unexpected, given the sensitivity of capitalized net returns to short-run fluctuations in agricultural input and output prices. The relatively small variation in the MSMvalues is explained in large part by the fact that E&A elected to increase the initial set of values by approximately eight percent a year (McCord). Nothing more can be done to analyze the variation in these values. However, it is possible to determine which of the components are responsible for the variation in CNR-values. For this analysis, data for 1982 and 1983 were added; the results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . Capitalized net returns were deflated to abstract from variability due strictly to trend in the nominal revenue (R) and cost (C). As Rurt and Finley suggest, if the components of the decomposition contain a strong trend, the higher order terms will remain large and the approximation will be imprecise. The result in this case was to reduce the trend in R and C but because many of the data points were divided by a number less than 1, the overall variance of R*-C*, and thus V* (an * denotes deflated values) was increased. In all but one case, the variance relative to the mean, as measured by the coefficient of variation, declined.\nIn this case, the approximation performs well; the largest relative error is for soil group 7 and is only six percent (Table 4 ). The direct contributions of the three components R*, C*, and l/r are summarized in the first three COL umns. In all soil groups, less than two percent of the direct contribution to variance in the deflated value of V(V*) is due to the capitalization rate. The direct contribution of R* and C* do not exhibit this consistency. For soil group 1, R* is responsible for 80 percent of the direct contribution to the variance in V*. The importance of R* falls as one moves to higher soil groups. For groups 7 and 8, R* is responsible for less than one-quarter of the direct contribution. Just over three-quarters of the direct variance in V* is attributable to C*, The contribution of C* falls as one moves to the higher productivity soils and is only 18 percent for group 1,\nThe covariance effects are also important, Figure I for the counties included. These are capitalized net returns developed using procedures described in the text. They are weightedaverages, weighted by tbe county acreages in each soil productivity and lime class. Negative values for soil groups 6, 7 and 8 are retained here. See Boisvert and Bills ( 19S4b) for the yearly fisures by soil productivity group. b Soil productivity classes are those used by E&A since 1981. See Table 1 for details. \" For purposes of these calculations, V was deflated (1977 = 100) by dividing it and R and C by a five-year average index of the value of New York Farm Real Estate (USDA, t975, 1979 (USDA, t975, , 1981 (USDA, t975, , 1983 Clifton and Crowley, 1973) . It might be argued that these components should have been deflated by an index of prices paid or received. However, this was not possible because many of the components of such indexes were used to construct R and C.\nparticularly for the first five soil groups; the total covariance effect is negative and averages 27 percent, the size of the total direct contribution, Without this negative relationship, the variation in V* would be even greater. Furthermore, the covariances between R* and l/r nearly offset those of C* and l/r, Thus, the covariance effect is almost totally attributable to R* and C* and the role of l/r is minimal."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Implications", "text": "The New York Legislature provided for usevalue exemptions more than a decade ago. To date, the policy debate has focused almost exclusively on procedures used to value New York's farmland in its current use, In 1981, use values based on farm sales and appraisals were replaced by values based upon a soil productivity index and the capitalization of net Because numerous other factors affect participation in the agricultural assessment program, it is not possible to determine how these two methods of use valuation would affect participation over time. However, it is clear that when the average CNR-values are highest, they are highest across individual soil groups as well. Thus, other things equal, neither of the methods would have led to consistently larger tax exemptions over the program's 10-to 12-year history.\nThe results also have policy significance for farmland retention stemming from the relative valuation of cropland of different quality. In the case of the CNR-method, the most productive \"A\" land is valued on average at 3.8 times the value of relatively low quality \"C\" land. For the MSM-values, \"A\" land is valued at only 2.9 times the value of' 'C\" land. Given that local assessed values are unlikely to be differentiated as effectively by cropland quality, the CNR-values may provide a relatively greater tax exemption to the less productive soils.\nThe variability of the CNR-estimates, when compared to the MSM approach, has several implications for policy. First, the added uncertainty about the exemption value from year to year may decrease the attractiveness of committing land to an agricultural use for an extended period. Second, because of the twoyear lag in data, and the fact that the CNRvalues reflect in large part the capitalized net value of dairy feed, the fluctuations can also be out-of-phase with the general trends in state farm income. Finally, there is increased concern about the potential effects of the program on the stability of the property tax base from local governments in rural areas, where agricultural property constitutes a significant proportion of the tax base. This problem is yet to be documented, but as the size of the exemptions change, tax rates on property which remains taxable could change dramatically. This would shift some of the tax burden to non-agricultural land. Since tax rates would change, the percentage of property values exempt may not accurately reflect the tax benefits afforded farmland owners. On the other hand, any state reimbursement for lost local revenues would accommodate such inequities, but would shift the cost of the program to taxpayers across the state.\nClearly each method for estimating use values is not without its difficulties. Administratively, the MSM-values are more stable over time and are derived from procedures most consistent with local assessment practices. They provide flexibility in distributing economic value to broadly defined land classes. The subjective judgment involved is always subject to criticism.\nConsiderable judgment and flexibility are also required in the design of CNR-procedures. But, once implemented, the change in values from year to year becomes a function of annual movements in farm prices, costs and interest rates. This leads to serious problems for the less productive soils because the values can be negative, Most of the variation in the CNR-values for the highly productive soils is due to variation in gross revenue. One must be concerned about a procedure whose results are affected substantially by market prices for agricultural commodities that are inherently unstable from year to year. The concern is particularly acute if the commodities are ones such as corn silage and hay for which market information is difficult to obtain.\nThe options for resolving these difficulties with the CNR-calculations are as much political as they are grounded in economic logic. One could obviously increase the length of the moving average, but, at least in the short term, difficult decisions regarding the technology, prices and cost data for historical years would be necessary. Another alternative would be to continue yearly budget calculations but restrict the change from year to year to an arbitrary upper or lower limit (e.g. plus or minus 5 or 10 percent). This strategy would have the distinct advantage of limiting short-term fluc-tuations while accommodating longer-term trends if the limits in either the positive or negative direction are triggered over a period of years."}]
