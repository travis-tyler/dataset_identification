[{"section_title": "", "text": "The ACG program is intended to encourage students to take challenging courses in high school and thus increase their likelihood of success in college. The National SMART Grant program is intended to encourage students to pursue college majors considered in high demand in the global economy (mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and languages deemed critical to the national interest). To be eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant, a student had to qualify for a Federal Pell Grant, enroll full-time in a degree program at a two-or four-year institution of higher education, and be a U.S. citizen. First-year students who met these conditions, graduated from high school after Jan. 1, 2006, and completed a rigorous high school program (as defined by the U.S. Department of Education) could receive an ACG up to $750 (depending on their financial need). Second-year students could receive up to $1,300 if they graduated from high school after Jan. 1, 2005, met all the other conditions for an ACG, and had a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 1 at the end of their first year of college. National SMART Grants worth up to $4,000 are available to third-and fourth-year students who are majoring in mathematics, science (physical, life, or computer), engineering, technology, or certain foreign languages considered critical to the national interest 2 and who maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. With the passage of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (H.R. 5715), eligibility for the programs has been expanded. Specifically, part-time students and noncitizen permanent residents will be able to receive ACGs and National SMART Grants starting in Jan. 2009, and students in certificate programs lasting a year or more at a degree-granting institution will be able to receive ACGs. However, the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (H.R. 4137), enacted in August 2008, delayed implementation of these changes and gave states increased control over defining rigorous secondary school programs of study. This report describes implementation and participation patterns under the original eligibility conditions. -xvi -If the new grant programs are successful, more low-income students will complete rigorous high school programs, enroll in college full-time, and earn degrees, and more students will major in mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and critical languages. The U.S. Department of Education has encouraged states, school districts, and schools to take steps to promote rigorous course-taking and to establish efficient mechanisms for verifying students' eligibility for the grants. 3 Congress provided $790 million for ACGs and National SMART Grants for 2006-07 and $4.5 billion over five years. The programs will end after the 2010-11 academic year unless reauthorized. Approximately 300,000 ACGs and 60,000 National SMART Grants were awarded in the 2006-07 academic year, compared with the Department's initial estimates of 425,000 ACGs and 80,000 National SMART Grants. 4 Whether the shortfall was due to an overestimate of the number of eligible students, difficulties associated with the rapid implementation of a complex program, or both is difficult to assess. The Department's goal is to double participation by 2010-11. MPR Associates and JBL Associates are assisting the Department of Education in evaluating the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. Because the programs were announced in May 2006 and the first awards made for the 2006-07 academic year, it is too soon to answer the most important questions that the Department has posed for this multiyear study: \u2022 Will the financial incentives provided by the ACG program induce more economically disadvantaged high school students to complete a rigorous high school program and enroll and succeed in postsecondary education? \u2022 Will the availability of National SMART Grants motivate more students to major and receive degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and critical languages? Students currently in their final years of high school simply may not have enough time left to take all the required courses, and students about to enter their third and fourth years of college may be well-established in other majors and not have the foundation needed to switch to one of the qualifying majors even if they wanted to. First-year activities therefore focused on the following: \u2022 Identifying and describing implementation issues from the perspective of major stakeholders by conducting interviews, reviewing documents, and monitoring stakeholder Web sites. -xvii - \u2022 Comparing information on the state-specific rigorous high school programs approved by the secretary of education and on state high school graduation requirements. \u2022 Examining 2006-07 participation in the programs overall, across states, by student characteristics, and (for National SMART Grants) by field of study using the COD-CPS Interface Grant Recipient File maintained by the Office of Federal Student Aid. \u2022 Analyzing historical data to determine national trends in high school coursetaking and to develop estimates of eligibility for ACGs and National SMART Grants. This baseline information-obtained from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), Beginning Postsecondary Student Aid Studies (BPS), National Postsecondary Student Aid Studies (NPSAS), and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)-will provide a benchmark against which to examine current and future participation in the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. \u2022 Summarizing Department of Education and stakeholder recommendations for improving the programs. This report summarizes the findings of these activities and presents recommendations developed by the Department of Education and stakeholders to increase participation. Updates to this report will be provided after years two and three, and a final report on outcomes and impact prepared after the fourth year of the programs .

Some difficulties were eased during the first implementation year as the Department clarified language in the regulations, such as how to compute grade point averages (GPAs), how academic year is defined, and methods for establishing a student's academic major. Nevertheless, some concerns remain, including the need to base ACG awards on students' four-year high school transcripts (which colleges do not always have) and difficulties associated with verifying the completion of a rigorous high school program. -xviii - \u2022 Successful implementation of the programs (especially ensuring that students are well-informed) will require cooperation and coordination across high school and postsecondary education. High school counselors, college academic advisors, and financial aid administrators interviewed for this report all commented on the lack of awareness and the need for better coordination among these groups of professionals."}, {"section_title": "State Definitions of Rigorous High School Programs", "text": "\u2022 For the first year of the ACG program, the U.S. secretary of education approved as rigorous at least one advanced, honors, or other program in 40 states and approved more than one program in 22 states. The content of these programs varied widely. Some appeared to be more demanding than the Department of Education (ED) course-based curriculum, some appeared to be less demanding, and some were difficult to compare."}, {"section_title": "First-Year Participation", "text": "\u2022 First-year participation was lower than expected for both ACGs and National SMART Grants (about 300,000 ACGs and 60,000 National SMART Grants, compared with the 425,000 and 80,000 initially estimated). It is difficult to know whether this is due to inaccurate estimates of the number eligible, implementation issues, lack of knowledge about the programs, or all of the above. \u2022 At four-year institutions, the percentage of first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients that received an ACG ranged from a high of 32 percent (for Massachusetts residents) to a low of 4 percent (for Alaska residents). At two-year institutions, the rate varied from 6 percent (for Oklahoma and Florida residents) to less than 1 percent in six states. \u2022 About one-quarter of all first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients received an ACG at public and private nonprofit four-year institutions, but only 3 percent did so at public two-year institutions, at which students are more likely to enroll parttime and are less likely to be well-prepared academically. \u2022 About three-quarters of ACG recipients were first-year students, suggesting that second-year students had difficulty meeting the 3.0 GPA requirement (the only difference in the requirements for first-and second-year awards). \u2022 Five percent of Pell Grant recipients in both the third and fourth years received a National SMART Grant. \u2022 Participation rates for the National SMART Grant program also varied (from 2 percent in the District of Columbia to 14 percent in Utah). There did not appear to be any systematic relationship between the National SMART Grant participation -xix -rate at institutions in a state and the percentage of bachelor's degrees awarded in National SMART Grant-eligible fields in that state. In other words, a state's rate cannot be explained simply by the proportion of students majoring in eligible fields in that state. \u2022 Although all recipients were from lower-income families, ACG recipients tended to come from families with higher incomes than those who received only Pell Grants. Students with Expected Family Contributions (EFCs) of 0 received 46 percent of all Pell Grant dollars awarded, but only 32 percent of ACG dollars. The family income of dependent students with National SMART Grants was also somewhat higher than that of those who received only Pell Grants. \u2022 About half of all participating institutions awarded fewer than 50 ACG Grants, and about one-third awarded fewer than 10 National SMART Grants. \u2022 Students with a major in the life sciences had the largest share of National SMART Grants (38 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Historical Information: Trends in High School Course-taking", "text": "\u2022 States have been raising high school graduation standards and are continuing to do so, with numerous changes planned for the next few years. These efforts encourage more rigorous course-taking and may promote increased eligibility for ACGs regardless of any other initiatives, but they confound efforts to isolate the impact of the ACG program on course-taking. \u2022 The percentage of high school graduates completing a rigorous high school program has increased over time. About half of all high school graduates now complete the ED course-based rigorous curriculum, but low-income students are less likely than others to do so. The same is true even when the comparison is limited to those who enroll in college full-time right after high school, although the gap is less pronounced for this group."}, {"section_title": "Historical Information: Estimates of Eligibility", "text": "\u2022 Based on analysis of historical data, 13 percent of first-time, first-year students would have been eligible for an ACG in 2003-04, which is almost double the percentage that would have been eligible in 1995-96 (7 percent) had the program existed in those years. In contrast, the percentage of undergraduates in the third year or above that would have been eligible for a National SMART Grant remained stable at 2 percent. \u2022 The academic requirement for the ACG appears difficult to meet. Most undergraduates are U.S. citizens and most recent high school graduates enrolled full-time in college, but barely half of those meeting these eligibility criteria also -xx -took the required courses.

The ACG program is intended to encourage students to take challenging courses in high school and thus increase their likelihood of success in college. The National SMART Grant program is intended to encourage students to pursue certain college majors considered in high demand in the global economy (mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and certain languages deemed critical to the national interest). Congress provided $790 million for the 2006-07 academic year for these new programs, and $4.5 billion over five years. The programs will end after the 2010-11 academic year unless reauthorized so it is important to know soon whether the programs are having the desired effect and if there are any unintended consequences that should be addressed. To be eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant, a student had to qualify for a Federal Pell Grant, enroll full-time in a degree program at a two-or four-year institution of higher education, and be a U.S. citizen. First-year students who met these conditions, graduated from high school after Jan. 1, 2006, and completed a rigorous high school program (as defined by the U.S. Department of Education) 5 could receive an ACG up to $750 (depending on their financial need).

The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (H.R. 4137) (HEOA) delayed enactment of the expanded eligibility until July 2009."}, {"section_title": "Implementation", "text": "To facilitate a quick and smooth implementation of the ACG program, the secretary of education provided four ways for students to satisfy the \"rigorous high school program\" requirement for the first two years of the program (2006-07 and 2007-08). The secretary also stated that she intended to raise the standard in the future and define a set of requirements later that more accurately reflects what is required for success in college. 8 Beginning July 1, 2006, Pell Grant recipients who met the nonacademic requirements (based on their financial aid application) were notified by mail or e-mail that they might be eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant if they met the academic requirements. Students were required to self-identify their potential eligibility, which their institutions then verified before the awards were made. Students applying for financial aid after July 1, 2006, were able to self-identify when they filled out their financial aid application by answering a series of questions about their high school course-taking. The first ACGs and National SMART Grants were awarded for the 2006-07 academic year. The Department of Education issued Interim Regulations for the new grant programs in July 2006, engaged in negotiations for establishing rules during the summer of 2007, and issued Final Regulations in October 2007. Because of the rapid implementation of the programs-the procedures for implementing the programs were announced in May 2006 and the first grants awarded for fall 2006-and the complexities surrounding the details of the eligibility criteria, it was inevitable that implementation would present some administrative difficulties (discussed in Chapter 2). Approximately 300,000 ACGs and 60,000 National SMART Grants were awarded in the 2006-07 academic year, compared with the Department's initial estimates of 425,000 ACGs and 80,000 National SMART Grants. 9 Whether the shortfall was due to an overestimate of the number of eligible students, difficulties associated with the rapid implementation of a complex program, or both is difficult to assess. The Department of Education has set a goal to double participation by 2010-11, urging states, colleges, and high schools to promote ACGs and National SMART Grants because completing a rigorous high school program is the best way to increase college readiness, reduce remediation, and increase college completion rates for low--3 -income students, and increased postsecondary attainment will help the United States compete in the 21st century. 10"}, {"section_title": "Expected Program Outcomes", "text": "If the new grant programs are successful over time, they will bring about an increase in the percentage of low-income students who earn college degrees and encourage more students to major in mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and critical languages. More specifically, over time, increasing numbers of low-income high school students will \u2022 complete a rigorous high school program; \u2022 learn about the ACG and National SMART Grant programs; \u2022 respond to that knowledge and enroll full-time in a degree program; \u2022 receive an ACG for their first year; \u2022 earn a 3.0 GPA in their first year of college; \u2022 continue to enroll full-time in their second year and have their grants renewed; \u2022 select a major in a National SMART Grant-eligible field; \u2022 enroll full-time and receive a National SMART Grant; \u2022 earn a 3.0 GPA in their third year; and \u2022 continue to enroll full-time in their fourth year and have their grants renewed. Assuming this type of success, the gaps in the college enrollment, persistence, and completion rates of low-income and other students should narrow over time. In terms of the proportion of Pell Grant recipients receiving an ACG, one would expect to see the highest rates in states with high standards for high school diplomas and in which the honors programs have rigorous course requirements that match or exceed the minimum requirements for admission to a four-year college. One would also expect to find high rates in states with effective college awareness programs and in states and colleges with administrative procedures that make it easy to identify and verify eligible students. It will take some time for the full effect of the new grant programs to be realized because students currently in their final years of high school simply may not have enough time left to take all the required courses. 11 In addition, students about to enter their third and fourth years of 10 U.S. Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov/programs/smart/performance.html (accessed Aug. 25, 2008). 11 A recent analysis of high school transcripts in California indicates that students who do not start preparing for college in ninth grade have a difficult time catching up (Finkelstein and Fong 2008). -4 -college may be well-established in other majors and not have the foundation needed to switch to one of the qualifying majors even if they wanted to do so. To illustrate the length of time it will take to see the impact of the new grant programs, Figure 1 details the progression of three hypothetical cohorts. The first cohort consists of students entering high school the same year the grants were announced  and therefore in a position to pursue a rigorous curriculum from the start. Even if students in this cohort were aware of the ACGs and motivated by them to start a rigorous high school program, the effect on ACG participation rates would not be noticed until at least 2010-11, when these students are college freshmen. The second cohort consists of students who entered college in 2006-07 and might have been motivated by the prospect of getting a National SMART Grant to enroll in a National SMART Grant-eligible major. These students would not receive their first National SMART Grant until 2008-09, three years into the program. Finally, the third cohort consists of high school students who might have been motivated by the National SMART Grant program to enroll in rigorous science courses in 11th grade. These students would not be eligible for their first National SMART Grant until 2010-11.

Through this study, the Department seeks answers to the following questions: \u2022 What lessons can be learned from the early implementation of the program that will lead to program improvement? Are there identifiable unintended consequences? \u2022 How do states differ in their definitions of \"rigorous secondary school program of study,\" and do states differ in the rate at which Pell Grant recipients complete the course work required under these definitions to qualify for an ACG or major in the specified fields to qualify for a National SMART Grant? \u2022 Do financial incentives induce more economically disadvantaged high school students to complete a rigorous program of study and to enroll and succeed in postsecondary education? What is the gap between students in lower-and higherincome families in meeting the standards of the ACGs and National SMART Grants? Will this gap be narrowed? \u2022 Is the availability of National SMART Grants associated with an increase in the proportion of Pell Grant recipients who major in and receive degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, technology, and critical languages? If so, will this affect the overall number of majors in these fields nationally? How do Pell Grant recipients with National SMART Grants differ from those without them? This report synthesizes information gathered during the first year of the study, which covers the first year that grants were awarded . It is too early to measure the impact of the program on student behavior or outcomes such as high school course-taking, enrollment, and completion, or to examine whether the National SMART Grants provide students with an incentive to major in mathematics and science. Therefore, first-year activities focused on the following: \u2022 Identifying and describing implementation issues from the perspective of major stakeholders by conducting interviews, reviewing documents, and monitoring stakeholder Web sites (Chapter 2). \u2022 Comparing information on the state-specific rigorous high school programs approved by the secretary of education and on state high school graduation requirements (Chapter 3). -6 - \u2022 Examining 2006-07 participation in the programs overall, across states, by student characteristics, and (for National SMART Grants) by field of study using the COD-CPS Interface Grant Recipient File maintained by the Office of Federal Student Aid (Chapter 4). \u2022 Analyzing historical data to determine national trends in high school coursetaking and develop estimates of eligibility for ACGs and National SMART Grants (Chapter 5).

Congress allocated funding to be used to support incoming and continuing students for the 2006-07 academic year. As processing of financial aid applications typically begins in January, the timing of this legislation posed significant challenges for the U.S. Department of Education, colleges and universities, students and their families, and other stakeholders. Within a very short time period, the Department notified the public of this new source of potential financial aid; provided guidance and Interim Regulations to schools; set up processes to disburse funds to schools; worked with stakeholders to develop Final Regulations for 2006-07; and began the process of establishing regulations for subsequent years. The Department of Education engaged in extensive outreach efforts. Postsecondary institutions worked to identify eligible students and award these new grants, despite concerns about the administrative burdens created by new requirements. Amidst all the changes, funding allocated by Congress for the 2006-07 school year was awarded. This chapter addresses the following topics: \u2022 Intent and history of the legislation, from passage through the 2006-07 school year (which is the focal point of the empirical work presented in this report), and subsequent changes in the legislation that will affect program operations in future years; \u2022 Sources of information used to identify program modifications in the passage, implementation, and revision of the legislation; \u2022 Changes in the implementation of the legislation-including notifying institutions and students about these new funding sources, developing Interim and Final Regulations, working with stakeholders, and disbursing the funds to institutions to award to eligible students; and \u2022 Salient concerns that arose that affected the initial awards in the 2006-07 school year, and how they were resolved. -8 -Information on the history and implementation of the ACG/National SMART Grant legislation and regulations during this initial period was collected in fall 2006 from experts representing key stakeholder organizations. During that same time, relevant documents were reviewed (including legislation, regulations, comments elicited in the negotiated-rulemaking sessions held in early 2007, and stakeholder Web sites) to gain a better understanding of the following: \u2022 How implementation had progressed, primarily at the postsecondary level; \u2022 How effective were marketing efforts targeted at postsecondary institutions, stakeholder organizations, students, and parents; and \u2022 Whether and how stakeholder concerns were resolved, and in what ways."}, {"section_title": "Intent, Goals, and History of the ACG and National SMART Grant Legislation", "text": "The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171) (the act) established the Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) and created the Academic Competitiveness and National SMART Grants. The legislation was drafted quickly, in a matter of days, without public hearings. Section 401A, Academic Competitiveness Grants, as drafted and enacted by Congress, was intended to \u2022 Encourage and support states as they make high school a more rigorous, challenging, and relevant experience for all students; \u2022 Provide merit-based financial aid to low-income students; \u2022 Encourage students to take more challenging courses in high school, making success in college more likely, according to research; and \u2022 Encourage students to pursue college majors in high demand in the global economy, such as science, mathematics, technology, engineering, and critical foreign languages. After the ACG and National SMART Grant programs were enacted, the Department of Education quickly undertook a series of actions to notify the public and institutions of the new legislation, to issue Interim Regulations, and to set up the mechanisms to disburse funds. There was very little time between the enactment of the programs in February and the fall academic terms when students were to receive financial aid. This compressed timeframe required the interim rules to be developed outside the normal \"negotiated-rulemaking\" process for drafting federal regulations. The interim rules were to be in effect for only the first two years. The Department issued these interim final rules, on which public comment was invited, for the new grant programs in July 2006. The Department also issued a series of \"Dear Colleague\" letters to -9 -address specific concerns. It issued Final Regulations for 2006-07 in November 2006, after the term had started and schools had already made awards to students based on the previous guidance available to them. The program continued to evolve as the Department responded to additional questions from stakeholders and as Congress revised the legislation twice. Table 1 presents a summary of critical steps in the development of the legislation, regulations, and the Department of Education's guidance in interpreting the regulations, beginning with the key legislative provisions. Appendix B offers a longer and more detailed summary of the history of the legislation, guidance, and regulations. "}, {"section_title": "Complex Requirements and Rapid Implementation", "text": "The complex requirements and rapid implementation of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs in the compressed first year created difficulties for all parties. Within this short time period, the Department of Education had to notify the public of this new potential source of financial aid; provide guidance and interim regulations to inform schools about how to award the 2006-07 funding and how to assess students' ongoing eligibility; set up processes to disburse funds to schools; work with stakeholders to develop final regulations for 2006-07; and begin the process of establishing regulations for subsequent years. In addition to the regulations and guidance provided (as detailed in Appendix B), the Department tracked its own marketing efforts and reported that in this initial period it offered: \u2022 Webinars on ACG and National SMART Grants, reaching 4,505 online attendees; \u2022 In-person training on ACG and National SMART Grants at locations around the country, with 2,913 attendees; \u2022 Presentations at conferences of campus financial aid and campus fiscal officersapproximately 30 were given, with a total of more than 5,000 attendees; \u2022 Two Federal Student Aid Conferences with a total of more than 5,000 attendees; and \u2022 Ongoing Web training sessions during which financial aid administrators could access the training on the Department's Web site at anytime. Because the legislation arrived just as postsecondary schools were reviewing applications for college admission and financial aid, schools had little time to add or adapt processes to permit them to review student college applications; create financial aid packages that included ACGs and National SMART Grants for potentially eligible students; verify initial student eligibility for -11 -the ACG and National SMART Grant programs; disburse grants to students; and consider how to track student progress and ongoing eligibility for further funding. States (and in some cases, school districts) had to consider whether they wanted to submit potential \"rigorous programs of study\" for consideration in 2007-08, high schools had to provide documentation (usually transcripts), and postsecondary institutions had to verify that students had taken the courses (or tests) to meet the criteria for a rigorous program of study-as defined by the secretary or by the state. Students, their families, and their advisors had to get information about the new ACG and National SMART Grant programs; assess their own eligibility, given their financial need and differing possible ways to qualify for the \"rigorous program of study\" requirement; and initially apply for Federal Pell and ACG or National SMART Grant funding in conjunction with their college applications. With different perspectives, needs, and tasks, stakeholders disagreed on many key issues. The timing of the new law, and the need to quickly process complex information, created additional stress. As financial aid awards are critical in determining where students choose to enroll, some institutions were placed in the position of creating financial aid packages without knowing whether a student actually would end up qualifying for an ACG program. And if the award process, confirmation of eligibility, and disbursement of funds were complex, then any subsequent auditing could be expected to be as complex, if not more so."}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders' Perspectives", "text": "Interviews were conducted in fall 2006 with experts from key stakeholder organizations. Documentation and feedback from the negotiated-rulemaking sessions held in early 2007 13 and from stakeholder Web sites were collected and examined. Stakeholders were selected based on their role in implementing the ACG and National SMART Grant programs during the first award year. These stakeholders include a mix of representatives from high school and postsecondary organizations and offer a range of perspectives and insights into the regulatory and implementation problems posed by these two grant programs (Table 2). 13 \"Negotiated rulemaking\" (Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 561-570) is a process in which different interest groups come together to negotiate the terms of an administrative rule and propose changes. It is entirely voluntary and the agency does not have to adopt the changes suggested by the advisory committee.

College-level representatives were vocal about their concerns because the policy changes and implementation requirements of these grant programs directly affected the timing and organization of their work. Those indirectly affected by the legislation include high school representatives, academic advisors, and others who guide students' academic development. High school-level organizations published little or no response to the regulations on their Web sites. High school and postsecondary administrators expressed significant concern about effectively implementing the ACG and National SMART Grant programs because of the short lead time between the legislation and the start of the school year, the limiting language of the law, inadequate staffing in key areas to address the additional administrative burden of transcript verification, and the need for increased communication and exchange of information among key stakeholders. -14 -At the college level, administrators faced the challenge of verifying that students met the eligibility requirements, which in some cases may have required additional staffing or communication between departments with previously little or no communication. Although Title IV-eligible higher education institutions are required to have the administrative capacity to link financial aid to academic requirements, stakeholders reported that much of this process has been automated-at least at larger universities and colleges. To determine student eligibility for the ACGs and National SMART Grants, administrators and staff in several key departments had to provide very specific information and could not simply rely on computer programming to ascertain student eligibility."}, {"section_title": "Development and Resolution of Salient Concerns", "text": "Salient concerns affecting the implementation of the ACG and National SMART legislation, the number of grants, and their distribution are listed in Table 3.

Although need-based aid programs represent the bulk of aid dollars, spending on merit-based grants by institutions and states has increased more than spending on need-based programs since the 1990s (Heller 2006). Research on state merit-aid programs indicates that higher-income and racial majority students receive a disproportionate share of this aid (Heller 2004;Heller and Rasmussen 2002). High school and postsecondary stakeholders raised the issue of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs' merit component during the interviews. Even though all recipients of these awards must be eligible for a Pell Grant, some stakeholders were still concerned that the -16 -distribution of aid would shift from the low end to the high end of the Pell eligibility range, with concomitant demographic shifts. For example, in a joint letter to the Department, the Registrars and Admissions Officers and the Academic Advising Association voiced concern about Pelleligible students for whom \"the receipt of an ACG or National SMART Grant would be of critical importance. The very students, therefore, that would most benefit from these programs are arbitrarily denied an award.\" 15 Laurie Wolf, executive dean of students at Des Moines Area Community College, reported that only about 260, or less than 1 percent, of her school's 28,000 students qualified for the ACG. 16 Other school officials reported similar initial results, noting that many of their students attended school part-time, were not U.S. citizens, or were not taking the eligible majors. Because the ACG and National SMART Grant programs represented a shift away from the purely need-based aid standards used in other Title IV programs, implementation problems arose. Verifying student achievement in a prescribed way, at both the high school and postsecondary levels, required greater coordination among admissions officers, financial aid officers, and registrars, and in some instances imposed additional administrative burdens because existing systems were ill-equipped to meet the new demands for documentation. Traditionally, financial aid offices have not needed to evaluate transcripts in detail, so the ACG and the National SMART Grant programs required a new level of involvement and coordination between the registrar, the admissions office, and the aid officers. In response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the director of financial aid at Hope College wrote \"[the Admissions Office staff] members have to leave their offices, walk across campus to the Office of the Registrar, and manually review high school transcripts on a weekly basis to ensure student eligibility for the ACG.\" 17 The counter argument is that these programs were designed to encourage academic and enrollment behaviors that contribute to successful and timely degree completion (Adelman 2006). These statutory requirements (direct entry into college from high school, full-time enrollment, and enrollment in degree programs) are aligned with previous research that identifies characteristics associated with degree attainment. Findings from Adelman's 1999  -17 -High School Through College, indicate that high school preparation and academic performance, continuous enrollment, and the number of credits attempted during a student's first year in college, all contribute to timely degree completion. Getting higher grades, enrolling full-time in a degree program, and having completed a rigorous high school curriculum are all correlated with greater success in and after completing college. According to Heller (1997), because lower-income students are sensitive to small changes in college tuition, the promise of additional federal funds may prove to be key in improving students' high school attainment and future college enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Requirements Common to ACGs and National SMART Grants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Federal Pell Grant Recipients", "text": "The requirement that students be Federal Pell Grant recipients in order to receive ACGs or National SMART Grants makes sense on its face in terms of income limits and other factors. However, it excluded some students enrolled in year-round institutions, or during summer terms, who had exhausted their eligibility for Pell awards."}, {"section_title": "Full-time Student Status", "text": "The regulations also limited the award to full-time students by using a very specific definition of \"full-time\": 12 credit hours per semester, quarter, or term, or 24 clock hours per week. Although starting college part-time is also a predictor of dropping out (Tinto 1998), stakeholders were concerned that this restriction would reduce access to college among low-income students, because they are more likely to attend college part-time than are higher-income students (Chen 2007;Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002;O'Toole, Stratton, and Wetzel 2003). Low-income students jeopardize their probability of success in college by working too many hours while attending and may also have family obligations that result in part-time enrollment (Choy 2000;Goldrick-Rab 2006). Some stakeholders felt that providing ACGs and National SMART Grants to part-time students could reduce the need for these students to work too much while attending college and, thus, increase their likelihood of staying in school and completing their degrees. Although the statute did not initially allow for part-time students, H.R. 5715 has expanded eligibility to include all Pell-eligible students enrolled at least half time."}, {"section_title": "Degree Program", "text": "The original statutory language excludes ACG-eligible Pell Grant recipients who are enrolled in certificate programs but plan to enter baccalaureate programs; many respondents wanted to see this language changed to include certificate-seeking students. The exclusion of students enrolled in certificate programs is of particular concern to both community colleges and for-profit institutions because they enroll and graduate the bulk of these students. -18 - The American Association of Community Colleges thought the Department would expand eligibility to include certificate-seeking students after the negotiated-rulemaking sessions and was disappointed that the Department did not believe it had the authority to include these students. The association was committed to gaining eligibility for students enrolled in certificate programs and \"found [the Department's] rationale unconvincing in all respects,\" which is why their representative at the negotiated-rulemaking sessions withheld her consent. They were \"extremely upset\" over this issue, which was one of two concerns that prevented negotiators from reaching a unanimous decision during the negotiated-rulemaking sessions that took place in spring 2007. In a letter commenting on the Interim Final regulations, George Boggs, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, noted that community colleges \"confer more than 250,000 certificates each year in fields such as biotechnology, aerospace manufacturing technology, electronics engineering, and renewable energies.

Although the Pell Grant program does not exclude students who are noncitizen permanent residents, the ACG and National SMART Grant programs are limited to students who are U.S. citizens. Stakeholders expressed frustration that this restriction was written into the original legislation as it further limited the reach of the grants, added to the problem of determining student eligibility, and excluded those Pell-eligible students who were noncitizen permanent residents (even if they otherwise met the requirements). The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 has since fixed this by expanding eligibility to noncitizen permanent residents."}, {"section_title": "Additional ACG and National SMART Grant Requirements", "text": "As initially enacted, the ACG program required completion of a rigorous high school program of study after Jan. 1, 2006, for first-year students, and after Jan. 1, 2005, for second-year students.

Students needed to have at least a 3.0 GPA."}, {"section_title": "Rigorous Program of Study", "text": "Although the statute requires a \"rigorous program of study,\" it did not define what this might be. So, in a very short period of time, these requirements needed to be defined, so that schools and students could be notified. The secretary designated four ways for students to qualify. Of these, three required checking the students' transcripts, and the fourth required knowing students' scores on Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. The initial avenues for eligibility for the ACG programs are described in detail in Chapter 3. Respondents voiced concern about the potential administrative burden of verifying rigorous program completion, and the way in which a \"rigorous\" curriculum was initially defined in the statute. Community colleges found it particularly burdensome to verify high school courses taken by their students because many did not require a high school transcript for enrollment. All colleges and universities shared the burden of evaluating and processing a high volume of transcripts. Private institutions and large public research universities often enroll a large number of out-of-state students, so requiring staff to verify courses according to the state in which the curriculum was completed requires additional work. The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs identified this administrative burden as one of the main barriers to proper implementation of the ACG program. Institutions must be versed in each state's definition of a \"rigorous secondary school curriculum,\" which makes the process more time-consuming and complex. In addition, the course names listed on a student's transcript may not match what the state defines as its \"rigorous curriculum,\" which would require the institution to contact the high school and verify the course description. Some respondents questioned whether all students had access to rigorous programs of study. Currently, there is no federal source of information on course offerings that can be used to answer that question. Several studies have been published in the last two years that provide anecdotal data on the availability of rigorous curricula. A 2007 study by the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California All Campus Consortium on Research -20 -for Diversity confirms that in California, many schools (especially those serving minorities) do not offer enough courses of the \"a-g\" course sequence needed to enter the University of California or the California State Universities. 19 The a-g course sequence is an approved rigorous program of study that allows UC and CSU systems to offer assurance that Pell-eligible students met the course work requirement outlined in the statute. In February 2008, The College Board released its fourth annual AP Report to the Nation that talks about one potential way to measure access to rigorous curricula (and one of the approved Department ACG options)-the percentage of students taking an Advanced Placement (AP) exam. 20 The data show that the percentage of students who took an AP exam, and the percentage that received a \"3\" or higher on an AP exam, increased between 2002 and 2007, which may indicate an increase in access. These results are consistent with a 2007 report released by the California Council on Science and Technology and the Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, which suggests there is a shortage of teachers with appropriate qualifications to teach mathematics and science courses. 21 At the national level, a 2007 interim report on teacher quality under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) found that high poverty and high minority schools had a higher percentage of teachers who were not \"highly qualified\" (as defined by NCLB). 22 Teachers in these schools also had less teaching experience and were less likely to have a degree in the subject that they taught."}, {"section_title": "Academic Year", "text": "The term \"academic year,\" specifically defined in Section 481(a) of the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005, was used to determine the specific academic year in which a student was enrolled or had completed, thus determining the student's initial and continuing eligibility for ACGs and National SMART Grants. The definition was also used to ensure that students did not receive more terms of funding than permitted under the statute. Institutions were required to develop a Title IV academic year definition for each academic program that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of that statutory definition. Initial confusion over the rules for the program led to errors in awarding aid. For example, Inside Higher Ed reported that 450 students were offered National SMART Grants at Utah State -21 -University in August 2006; one week later, 150 of these students were informed that in fact they were not eligible for the $4,000 grants. 23 These students had taken too many academic credits to qualify under the definition of an academic year, which tied a student's year in college precisely to the number of academic credits he or she had accumulated. Under the Interim Final Regulations, academic year progress was defined both in terms of the minimum number of weeks of instructional time and in credit or clock hours. In a \"Dear Colleague\" letter (GEN-06-18), the Department acknowledged that it would be difficult for many institutions using a traditional term-based academic calendar to determine the actual number of weeks of instruction that a student would need to complete the number of credit hours in an academic year and allowed institutions to decide this on a student-by-student basis, using either of the following approaches: \u2022 Assume that there were 30 weeks of instructional time for each increment of credit hours that makes up the institution's Title IV academic year definition (e.g., 24 credit hours equals 30 weeks of instruction, or 30 credit hours equals 30 weeks of instruction)-with the proviso that an institution must also determine the actual number of weeks of instruction for a student who requests that such a determination be made or who questions whether he or she has completed an academic year; or \u2022 Determine the actual number of weeks of instruction that were included for the student to complete the number of credit hours in the institution's Title IV academic year definition by reviewing the student's academic record to see how many weeks it took the student to complete the credit hours earned-with the proviso that an institution may not assign any weeks of instruction to credits earned by the student from AP course work, IB course work, by testing out of a program or course, or from life experience, because those credits were not earned during attendance at a postsecondary educational institution, even though they apply toward completion of the student's program, and thus are included in the credit hour component of a Title IV academic year. The Department offered the following illustrative example: A student begins enrollment at an institution that defines its academic year as 24 semester credits. The institution applies 24 credits that the student earned through AP toward completion of the student's eligible program. The institution chooses to review the student's academic record to determine the actual number of weeks of instruction (or the student requests that the institution do so). Since all the credits earned were from AP and there are no weeks of -22 -postsecondary instruction associated with AP credits, the student is still in her first academic year and is eligible for a first-year ACG award. Both administrators and leading college advocacy groups expressed concern about this part of the law. These stakeholders called the statutory definition of \"academic year\" unworkable and considered it to be the largest impediment to smooth operation of the programs. The definition of academic year progression outlined in the law also prevented negotiators from reaching a consensus about the regulations during the negotiated-rulemaking sessions. Stakeholders preferred that academic year be determined only by the student's grade level or credits earned and his or her standing as defined by the institution, which is consistent with the definition of \"year\" used in other Title IV programs. The compliance and systems implementation manager at the University of South Carolina, Columbia campus, stated in his response to the Aug. 7, 2007, NPRM, \". . . [A]n inordinate amount of time and energy has been expended in trying to understand and work out the specifics . . .\" of the academic year definition. 24 He argued that flexibility was needed, as it was not possible to reliably project a student's eligibility. Eligibility could change from the initial point of determination due to a wide range of factors, including the timing of receipt of high school transcripts and AP or IB scores from the College Board; changes to the student's major; late posting of transfer credits; grade changes (deferred, late, incomplete); and add or drop decisions and retroactive entrance or withdrawal. Such changes could affect the number of credit hours a student had accumulated, as well as the student's GPA. His concerns were echoed by the senior vice president of advocacy and general counsel for the Career College Association: \"Having to monitor and track grade level progression for the ACG and National SMART Grant programs in a manner that is different from all other HEA Title IV programs is confusing and burdensome to institutions, and can lead to unintentional errors by the institutions.\" 25 The Department of Education responded that the definition of \"academic year\" as described in "}, {"section_title": "5715)", "text": "Congress revisited many of these contentious issues in H.R. 5715 and revised the eligibility requirements for the ACGs and National SMART Grants. The grants can now be awarded to students enrolled less than full-time, to those in certificate programs, or to permanent residents. The legislation also deleted the \"academic year,\" allowing schools more flexibility in determining student standing. It also allowed students enrolled in demanding degree programs requiring more than four years of course credits to receive a fifth-year grant. In addition, Congress made clear that the states were to identify the programs of study to be considered as rigorous and to be used to determine student eligibility for ACG Grants. These revisions were slated to come into effect as of Jan. 1, 2009.

Stakeholders were generally frustrated with the administrative burden they felt the programs put on institutions and staff. In addition to general concerns about the difficulty of discerning which students were eligible based on the statutory limitations, stakeholders' key concerns included (1) the mandated participation of postsecondary institutions; (2) using the four-year high school transcript versus only three years; (3) determining eligible majors for the National SMART Grant; and (4) calculating postsecondary GPAs for students."}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Participation", "text": "In a letter to the Department, the student financial aid administrators expressed \"serious concerns about requiring an institution to participate in the ACG and National SMART Grant programs if it wishes to continue its participation in the Federal Pell Grant Program . . . this requirement is an -24 -infringement of institutional autonomy.\" 26 Stakeholders also cited the short amount of time institutions were given to implement these programs as a reason to provide institutions with an option to participate. Some institutions were hesitant about making awards that might be called into question later because they were unsure about the appropriate procedures. And if the process of making the initial awards initially was difficult, any verification efforts and eventual audits were also difficult. In many cases, schools had to make financial aid awards-particularly for incoming students-and then verify later whether the students were in fact eligible. In its response to the negotiated-rulemaking sessions, the Department said it was not going to change the Interim Regulations in order to ensure that students with financial need could receive all the federal grants to which they were entitled. If the program was voluntary and some schools chose not to participate, it could have created a \"separate but unequal\" situation where otherwise eligible students would be missing out on the chance to receive additional grant funds based on the school they decided to attend. This situation may also have had a significant effect on students' choice of schools."}, {"section_title": "Four-year Transcript", "text": "Postsecondary institutions were required to base ACG awards on students' four-year high school transcripts instead of three or three and a half years of high school work, which is what most institutions receive from their applicants during admissions. In a joint letter to the Department, the American Council on Education (ACE) and seven other stakeholder organizations called this requirement a \"breathtaking new administrative burden,\" 27 and the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC)-in a separate letter-said this would be especially difficult for community colleges, because \"many if not most of them do not collect high school transcripts\" and because they \"tend to provide an 'open door' admissions policy, and instead use front-end testing instruments to determine student readiness for particular programs.\" 28 According to the president of Glendale Community College, \"This has added additional manual evaluation time to our processes. Also, because of the many variables, we have not found a way to automate this program other than to select those who have received this grant in the prior year. All eligibility review and tracking is a manual process. The Department has no plans to modify this part of the regulation, as the statutory language specifies that a student must have graduated from high school having completed a rigorous program of study in order to qualify for the ACG award. The November 2006 Final Regulations stated that a four-year high school transcript must be reviewed in order to ascertain whether the student has met the curricular eligibility requirements. 31"}, {"section_title": "Eligibility for National SMART Grants Based on Academic Major and Course Work", "text": "The initial list of eligible academic majors for the National SMART Grant was published in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter (GEN-06-06) published May 2, 2006, and was initially intended to apply to both the 2006-07 and the 2007-08 school years. Stakeholders expressed several concerns about the list of eligible majors, questioning perceived omissions and noting the need for a mechanism to add additional majors to the approved list. Stakeholders objected to the omission of certain majors, such as food science. Stakeholders also questioned whether students attending institutions that lacked particular eligible \"majors\" could receive National SMART Grants if they were taking the relevant coursework. In another \"Dear Colleague\" letter (GEN-07-06), extending the list of majors for the 2007-08 school year, the Department stated, \"We apologize for the timing of this notification, as we know that the academic year is beginning and you may have already completed many of your financial aid packages. However, institutions must provide National SMART Grants to all potentially eligible students, including those in the additional majors, for the 2007-08 award year.\" The additional eligible majors included food science, food technology and processing, and other fields. (See Appendix B.) Initially, under Section 691.15(c)(2)(ii) of the program regulations, a student was eligible to receive a National SMART Grant if the student enrolled in the courses necessary both to complete the degree program and to fulfill the requirements of the intended eligible major. Departmental guidance on implementing this provision initially stated that eligibility for a National SMART Grant for a payment period was based on the student being enrolled during that period in coursework that may include the courses in the National SMART Grant-eligible major or other courses that make up the student's National SMART -26 - In October 2007, the Department subsequently revised its guidance in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter (GEN-07-07) by stating that an otherwise eligible student could receive a National SMART Grant for a payment period only if the student were enrolled in at least one course that meets the specific requirements of the student's National SMART Grant-eligible major. If the student were enrolled only in courses that satisfied the general education requirements of the National SMART Grant-eligible program, but not in any courses that were specific to the major, he or she would not be eligible for a National SMART Grant payment for the semester. The final regulations for the National SMART Grant Program, published on Oct. 29, 2007 (72 FR 61248), provided a mechanism for institutions of higher education to request that additional majors be designated as eligible, so that otherwise eligible students in those majors could receive National SMART Grants. The \"Dear Colleague\" letter GEN-08-02, published on Feb. 6, 2008, detailed the process to be used to propose additional eligible academic majors and invited institutions of higher education to submit requests for additional majors to be designated as eligible for the National SMART Grant Program for the 2008-09 award year. In response to DCL GEN-08-02, institutions submitted 33 requests for additional eligible majors, proposing that 26 new majors be included. Of these, two were already on the revised list (computer and information sciences and nutrition science). The remaining 24 proposed new majors were rejected as inconsistent with the statutory requirement that majors must be in the physical, life, or computer sciences, mathematics, technology, or engineering, or a critical foreign language in order to be eligible for a National SMART Grant.

To receive a second-year ACG, a student had to have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 from the first academic year.

Stakeholders representing college financial aid administrators and registrars were concerned with how postsecondary GPAs should be calculated, particularly for transfer students and students entering an institution with AP or IB diplomas. They questioned the need to calculate GPA by academic term for National SMART Grant eligibility and also expressed confusion about whether the statute is referencing cumulative GPA in all courses taken during the term or just those in a student's major for the National SMART Grant. (As indicated above, it is not just courses in the major.) The final regulations released in October 2007 clarified some additional concerns about institutions that use numeric scales other than 4.0, and how to calculate the GPA for transfer students-including grades awarded in courses accepted for credit by the receiving school. The -27 -Department added language to the final regulations that instructed institutions that use other numeric scales to ensure that \"its minimum GPA requirement meets the same numeric standard as a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale.\""}, {"section_title": "Ongoing Concerns", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "High School Counseling-Course-taking, Rigorous Program of Study, and Applications to Colleges and for Financial Aid", "text": "The ACG and National SMART Grant programs added another component to an already complex array of state, institutional, private, and federal aid programs. Previous research found a general lack of understanding of student aid by potential recipients (Berkner and Chavez 1997;Choy 2001;Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000). Despite the Department's concern, as expressed in the Academic Competitiveness Council's report (May 2007), that student access to postsecondary schooling is \"limited because of inadequate information and a confusing financial aid system,\" the ACG and National SMART Grant programs are as complex, if not more so, than other federal aid programs due to the level of coordination needed between and within high schools and postsecondary institutions-issues particularly mentioned by stakeholders. The ACG and National SMART Grant programs use multiple criteria for defining a \"rigorous program of study\"-including State Scholar's initiative for 24 states, other recognized state programs, use of complete four-year high school transcripts, tracking \"academic year\" for students' initial and continued eligibility, and the need to recalculate GPA each term for National SMART Grant recipients. Initially, during the first implementation year, the Department notified students who completed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form and were eligible for a Pell Grant that they might also be eligible for an ACG or National SMART Grant award. Students were asked to confirm their eligibility status online. Colleges were forwarded a list of self-identified eligible students and were asked to verify that these students were indeed eligible (e.g., met the rigorous curriculum requirement for an ACG, met GPA and major field requirements for a National SMART Grant). Administrators and counselors had little chance to notify students and families about these programs. Financial aid officials who had already started-or in some cases finished-their financial aid packaging for the 2006-07 academic year had to incorporate the new awards into their financial aid budget. For the 2008-09 academic year, students will be able to indicate potential eligibility on their FAFSA form, which should simplify the student selfidentification process, although institutions will still be required to verify eligibility. Several stakeholders who were interviewed suggested that states find a way to link ACG eligibility to college admissions requirements and define requirements corresponding to the state college and university admissions requirements. A small number of states already do this. The University of California system, for example, has a set curriculum that is required for admission -28 -and also meets ACG requirements, while the state of Florida has identified its Bright Futures Scholars program as a recognized ACG course of study and notified institutions about which students are eligible. At the institutional level, Brigham Young University contacted all students who self-identified on their FAFSA as ACG-eligible and also contacted all other students who appeared eligible but did not self-identify."}, {"section_title": "State Graduation Requirements and Postsecondary Requirements", "text": "All the stakeholders interviewed felt that offering a rigorous high school curriculum to students would result in better academic preparation and future college success. They expressed concern, however, that not all states have college-prep curricula available at all high schools, especially in low-income areas, which means many Pell-eligible high school students might be excluded. Some states do not mandate all high school districts to offer the courses required to meet the rigorous curriculum course work requirements. Schools in states without a defined curriculum may not have the necessary courses available. The Department has noted that, since the ACG and National SMART Grant programs were enacted, at least 14 states have chosen to add graduation requirements that would increase the number of program-eligible students who graduate from public high schools. However, these changes are most likely not attributable to the ACG program, because changes in state curricula are typically years in the making."}, {"section_title": "High School Advising-College Preparatory Courses, Financial Aid, and College Applications", "text": "High school guidance and college admissions offices are often understaffed and overcommitted. Unless students start taking a required sequence of classes early in their high school career, they will be ineligible for the ACG because they have inadequate time to complete their prerequisites if they have not done so by the time they are juniors or seniors. High school counselors also may play a crucial role in disseminating information about these grants to eligible students. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that improving counseling by increasing the number of counselors, providing professional development, and improving both the quantity and quality of time spent with each student are all significantly related to college access, especially for low-income students (McDonough 2005). The American School Counselor Association reported that only half of the states currently mandate school counselors. Having an inadequate counseling staff weakens the connection necessary to inform high school students and their families about the ACG program. Institutions, postsecondary administrators, and high school counselors all voiced concern about communication and exchange of information between those professionals responsible for student -29 -aid and the members of the counseling and advising community, who for the most part have only general knowledge of student aid programs and no knowledge of whether an individual student is, or will be, eligible for a Pell Grant. High school counselors know about the rigorous curriculum requirements of the ACG, but they can only identify potential Pell-eligible students through their participation in the National School Lunch Program or financial planning workshops. Even though most counselors have access to copies of the FAFSA forms, they may not have detailed knowledge about how students and their families apply for financial aid. School counselors do not necessarily have any structured preparation in college counseling, so they may be working with limited information. Most degree programs for counselors do not include information about financial aid. An Academic Advising Association member identified that communicating the ACG requirements to academic advisors and high schools is a key challenge. Another challenge, according to this member, was involving high school counselors in reviewing the program eligibility requirements before students enroll at a postsecondary institution. A comprehensive college awareness campaign cited online by the Department is the Indiana Commission on Higher Education's Learn More Indiana initiative, which includes a Web site and magazine that targets students beginning in the eighth grade. California passed legislation in July 2006 authorizing $200 million to be spent on hiring more counselors at the elementary and high school levels in order to improve postsecondary enrollment. In March 2007, the American School Counselors Association and the National Association for College Admission Counseling together petitioned Congress for increased funds for existing counseling programs. These efforts, along with providing the counseling community with current information on the academic requirements for the ACG and National SMART Grant programs, will be very important to their success."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The complex requirements and rapid implementation of the ACG and National SMART Grant programs in the very compressed first year were difficult for all parties. The ACG and National SMART Grant programs were signed into law in February 2006, with funding to be awarded for the 2006-07 academic year. Within this short time period, the Department of Education notified the public of this new source of potential financial aid; provided guidance and interim regulations to inform schools about to how to award the 2006-07 funding and assess students' ongoing eligibility; set up processes to disburse funds to schools; worked with stakeholders to develop final regulations for 2006-07; and began the process of establishing regulations for subsequent years. The Department of Education engaged in extensive outreach efforts, primarily to the postsecondary institutions and associations most directly concerned with these programs, but also, through the Department Web site, directly to students and families. Amidst all the -30 -changes, funding allocated by Congress for the 2006-07 school year was awarded. Chapter 4 describes how that aid was distributed by schools and to students. Chapter 5 offers a baseline comparison, showing what might have been expected in awards, given the initial eligibility requirements for ACGs and National SMART Grants. As noted, stakeholders interviewed for this report expressed concerns about the ACG and National SMART Grant requirements and their experiences enacting these programs during the first implementation year. Many identified compliance with the eligibility requirements as specified initially by Congress and as defined in regulations issued by the Department as being most problematic. Stakeholders recounted the administrative burdens they encountered in attempting to admit students, devise financial packages, and determine (and redetermine) eligibility and award funds. Congress subsequently revised the eligibility requirements as part of the changes in H.R. 5715, and again in the passage of H.R. 4137. -31 -\nConsiderable variation exists across states in the rigor of the approved state programs and in high school graduation requirements. Differences in ACG eligibility and participation rates can therefore be expected now and over time. Additional states may request approval for new programs, and states may add new options for qualifying or change requirements for already approved programs. In addition, many states are increasing their high school graduation standards, requiring students to complete more courses or more difficult courses. It will be important to monitor these changes because they may help to explain state differences in ACG participation rates. It is possible that high school graduation requirements in some states could eventually increase to a point when all graduates would meet the course requirements for an ACG, in which case high ACG participation rates would be expected.\nBased on analysis of data collected before the ACG and National SMART Grant programs existed, approximately 280,000 first-year students (and an unknown number of second-year students) would have been eligible for an ACG, and 80,000 would have been eligible for a National SMART Grant had these programs existed a few years earlier. As the participation data described in the previous chapter showed, actual participation was lower. For both ACGs and National SMART Grants, each eligibility requirement reduces the number of Pell Grant recipients eligible for the grants, but the academic requirements appear to pose the greatest barrier. The ACG estimates also showed that the percentage of students meeting the eligibility criteria differed between 1995-96 and 2003-04. This pattern of change is consistent with the analysis of course-taking data that showed an increase between 1990 and 2005 in the percentage of students completing a rigorous high school program. Whether the percentages will increase further is unknown, but high school graduation standards continue to rise, suggesting that they may. The proportion of students earning degrees in National SMART Grant-eligible fields has remained stable, despite extensive efforts to attract students into these fields. At the federal level alone, a recent inventory identified almost 100 programs with a mathematics or science education focus (U.S. Department of Education 2007)."}, {"section_title": "C H A P T E R 3", "text": "Rigorous High School Programs A key requirement of the Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG) program is that students complete a rigorous high school program as defined by the secretary of education. The secretary provided three options (described below) for the first two years of the program (2006-07 and 2007-08) and accepted all existing state-established advanced and honors diploma programs as \"rigorous.\" In addition, the secretary gave states until June 1, 2006, to request recognition of other programs. For the first year of the ACG program, the secretary approved at least one advanced, honors, or other program in 40 states, and more than one program in 22 states. 32 In addition to recognizing students who have completed rigorous high school programs, states are increasing high school graduation requirements. As of summer 2006, 26 states and the District of Columbia had scheduled changes to take effect over the next few years, all of which will make it more difficult to graduate from high school. Some changes involve increasing the number of courses to be completed in certain subjects or overall, and others address course level or content. Of particular interest is whether there is variation by state in the percentage of Pell Grant recipients who receive ACGs and, if so, what might explain the variation. One possibility is variation in the rigor of the approved rigorous high school programs. If rigor varies, participation rates might be higher in states in which it is easier to qualify. Another possibility is variation in states' high school graduation requirements. Pell Grant recipients in states with more demanding standards might receive ACGs at higher rates, for example. The rest of this chapter presents a comparison of the approved state programs and state high school graduation requirements across states to provide a context for comparing participation rates across states and, later, over time. . It is designed to motivate high school students to complete a rigorous course of study that prepares them for success in postsecondary education or training and in their future careers. 33 To achieve recognition, students in participating states must -32 -complete all state-mandated high school graduation requirements and also the following course work: four years of English; three years of mathematics (including algebra I, algebra II, and geometry); three years of laboratory science (biology, chemistry, and physics); three and a half years of social studies (chosen from U.S. and world history, world geography, economics, and government); and two years of a language other than English."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Department of Education Definitions of a Rigorous High School Program", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Completing a curriculum similar to the State Scholars Initiative (SSI)", "text": ". This option, referred to hereafter in this report as the ED course-based curriculum, is available to high school students in all states and within each state to students attending high schools that offer the courses. The requirements are slightly less demanding than those of the SSI, with more flexibility in meeting the mathematics, science, and social science requirements and a reduced language requirement. To qualify under this option, students must earn passing grades in the following: four years of English; three years of mathematics (including algebra I and a higher level course such as algebra II, geometry, or data analysis and statistics); three years of science (including at least two courses chosen from biology, chemistry, or physics); three years of social studies; and one year of a language other than English."}, {"section_title": "Completing at least two Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB)", "text": "courses.

In 2002-03, 67 percent of public high schools offered AP courses, and 2 percent offered IB courses (Waits, Setzer, Lewis, and Greene 2005). However, students can take AP courses through independent study (or online in some states). 34"}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "Completing an existing advanced, honors, or other approved program. In most cases, the approved programs were unique to a state, but seven states were approved to use the High Schools That Work (HSTW) Award of Educational Achievement. 35 Some of the state programs were based solely on completing specific courses, while others had additional or different requirements. 36 In every state, students potentially had at least two ways to meet the rigorous high school curriculum: the ED course-based curriculum and passing AP or IB courses with sufficiently high scores (assuming their schools offered all the required courses and that they had access to AP or IB courses). Students in states participating in the SSI had a third option, and those in states with approved state programs had at least one more option and sometimes several. Figure 2 shows how many states provided their students with various numbers of options. 34 Available at: http://www.collegeboard.com. 35 The requirements for this award are described in Appendix C. 36 These included, for example, passing a state or local assessment test, achieving a minimum GPA or score on a PSAT, SAT, or ACT test, completing AP or IB courses or exams or dual-enrollment courses, or completing a senior project. -33 -  Table 4 lists all the approved state programs and, for those that were course-based, compares the requirements with those of the ED course-based curriculum. 37 It also presents a comparison of the mathematics and science course content requirements. Types of other requirements, if any, are also indicated. In the 35 states with course-based approved programs, every approved program required four years of English. In all but two states, the approved programs required at least three years of mathematics, including algebra I and a higher-level course. Most approved 37 The ED course-based curriculum is used as the standard for comparison rather than the SSI curriculum because it is less demanding and is available to students in all states. The table indicates which states are using the HSTW Award of Educational Achievement to qualify students, but the HSTW-recommended curriculum is not compared with the ED course-based curriculum. The way the requirements are structured-with alternative ways of qualifying and no required courses-makes it difficult to compare the program required for this award with other curriculumbased programs."}, {"section_title": "Approved State Programs", "text": "-34 -    * \"\u221a\" indicates that the state program required the same number of courses, \">\" that it required more, \"<\" that it required fewer, and \"-\" that there was no requirement in that subject.

Of the programs requiring three years of science, a majority required that at least two courses be chosen from biology, chemistry, or physics (the same as required in the ED coursebased curriculum). Approved state programs differed from the ED course-based curriculum most notably in the language requirement, tending to have either no language requirement at all or to require more than one year of language. Many state program requirements gave students a choice of subjects, such as a language other than English, art, or performing arts. Because students could avoid taking another language, the program was not considered here to require a language other than English. Some approved state programs appeared to be more demanding than the ED course-based curriculum, and some appeared to be less demanding but meaningful comparisons are difficult. Table 5 compares the requirements for course-based approved state programs with those of the ED course-based curriculum, considering only the core subjects mentioned in the latter. State programs that required more courses in one or more of the subjects and at least the same number in all of the rest were considered more rigorous. State programs that required fewer courses in one or more subjects and the same in the others were considered less rigorous. State programs that had higher requirements in some subjects but had lower ones in others were categorized as difficult to compare. The comparisons are summarized in Figure 3, which shows that of the 35 states with course-based approved programs, just 13 states had approved programs that were at least as rigorous as the ED course-based curriculum. Another 16 states had at least one approved program that was less rigorous, most often because it did not require students to take a language other than English (Table 4). However, it is not certain whether course work standards for students were less rigorous in those states, making easier to qualify for an ACG there. Some state programs had credit requirements in other subjects or requirements in addition to credits, such as minimum GPAs or state exams that could make qualifying more difficult. Also, nothing is documented about the content of the courses in any state.     A few states leave graduation requirements entirely up to local districts, but most specify the number of credits needed in total and in certain subjects. Table 6 provides the number of courses required in each state in each of the five subject areas named in the ACG eligibility requirements, along with the total number of credits required for a standard high school diploma. 38 In no state are high school graduation requirements currently as rigorous as the ED course-based curriculum. In other words, merely meeting the minimum requirements for graduating from high school would not be sufficient to make a student eligible for an ACG -43 -   in any state. The language requirement for the ACG is a major reason, because only a few states require any credits in a language other than English. Many states require the same number of credits in English, mathematics, science, and social studies as does the ED course-based program (Figure 4), and six states require the same number of courses in all these subjects (Table 6). However, states often do not specify the level of the courses in which those credits must be earned. The implications of state differences in high school graduations requirements for ACG participation are difficult to ascertain. One might expect higher ACG participation in the states with the most rigorous high school graduation requirements but comparing states on these grounds is difficult. Some states simply specify a number of credits needed for a diploma, while others specify a particular level that must be reached in some or all subjects or describe content that must be included. Another factor that complicates comparisons is that these requirements are sometimes minimums, with local districts adding their own requirements. Consequently, the state minimum may not be a true reflection of what some or even most high school graduates in that state are actually required to complete. Yet another complicating factor is that some states have exit exams in addition to course requirements, and the content of these exams varies (Center on Education Policy 2007). Because of the difficulty in comparing states, it is not feasible to categorize states definitively according to the rigor of their requirements or to compare planned changes. -45 - "}, {"section_title": "THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK", "text": "-47 - All of the students who received these grants also received Pell Grants, which are only awarded to low-and moderate-income students. 39 The analysis sometimes compares ACG and National SMART Grant recipients with other Pell Grant recipients who did not receive ACGs or National SMART Grants, and at other times it shows the percentage of all Pell Grant recipients who also received an ACG or National SMART Grant.

The U.S. Department of Education identified about 3,600 postsecondary institutions that awarded associate or bachelor's degrees, were eligible to participate in the Federal Pell Grant program, and were therefore also eligible to participate in the ACG program in 2006-07. About 2,800 of these institutions (78 percent) participated-that is, they awarded at least one ACG. Institutions participating in the Pell Grant program were required to participate in the ACG -48 -program, but not all institutions that awarded Pell Grants would necessarily have students who qualified for an ACG, especially those offering primarily certificate programs (as do many private institutions). Public four-year institutions and public two-year institutions had the highest participation rates (94 and 87 percent, respectively), and for-profit two-year institutions had the lowest rates (28 percent) ( Figure 5). Participating institutions enrolled about 4.5 million Pell Grant students, representing over 90 percent of the total 4.9 million Pell Grants awarded at all ACG-eligible institutions. Additional details about institutional participation are provided in Appendix Table E-1. Of the 300,000 ACG recipients, 174,000 (more than half) were enrolled in public four-year colleges, 76,000 in private nonprofit four-year colleges, and 36,000 in public two-year colleges. Most of the rest were at four-year for-profit colleges (11,000), and the remainder were at private for-profit or not-for-profit two-year institutions. At the public and private nonprofit four-year colleges participating in the ACG program, about one-quarter of all first-and second-year students with Pell Grants also received an ACG; at the public two-year institutions, only 3 percent of the first-and second-year Pell Grant students did so ( Figure 6). Students at two-year institutions are less likely to enroll full-time (Horn and Nevill 2006) and, even when enrolled full-time, are less likely to have completed a rigorous program (Appendix Table F-2). Additional details about the number of recipients are presented in Appendix Table E-2. ACG, National SMART, and Pell Grants are disbursed to students on a term-by-term basis. Students in colleges with typical semester calendars receive one-half of the award for each semester enrolled, or one-third of an award for each trimester. Among the first-year ACG students, 83 percent were enrolled for the entire academic year and received the maximum $750; 1 percent were enrolled for two trimesters and received $500 (two-thirds); 14 percent were enrolled for one semester and received $375 (one-half of the maximum); 1 percent were enrolled for one trimester and received $250; and the remaining 1 percent received some other amount ( Figure 7). The average ACG amount for first-year students was $685. Among second-year ACG students, 72 percent were enrolled for the entire academic year and received the maximum $1,300; 2 percent were enrolled for two trimesters and received $867 (two-thirds); 20 percent were enrolled for one semester and received $650 (one-half of the maximum); and the remaining 6 percent received some other amount. The average ACG for second-year students was $1,125. There are a number of reasons why students may have received one-half or two-thirds of a total award. Some of the students dropped out after one semester, and some were first enrolled in the second semester. About 2 percent of ACG students (4,600 students) changed class level during the year and received $375 for the first term and $650 for the second term ($1,025 total). Among second-year students, some were only eligible for one semester because they became third-year students in the second semester. For example, about 1,700 students received a one-half ACG ($650) in the first term as second-year students, and then a one-half National SMART Grant ($2,000) in the second term as third-year students. The amounts other than full-year, one-half of a year, or two-thirds of a year either reflect other calendar systems (such as nontraditional calendars, for which the appropriate partial term amounts cannot be determined) or awards that were reduced because the full amount would have exceeded the students' need. The low proportion of students in this category (1 percent) indicates that very few (if any) ACG recipients had their grant restricted because their need was exceeded. -51 -"}, {"section_title": "There was a wide range in the number of grants awarded at institutions, but about half of all participating institutions awarded fewer than 50 grants.", "text": "Participating institutions awarded an overall average of 107 ACGs, with an average of 335 at public four-year colleges, 93 at private nonprofit four-year colleges, and 41 at public two-year colleges (Appendix Table E-3). Overall, about half of all participating institutions awarded fewer than 50 ACGs (Figure 8 and Appendix Table E-4). Public four-year institutions handled higher volumes than other types of institutions, with about half awarding 200 or more ACGs. See Appendix Table E-5 for additional details on the distribution of ACGs. Overall, 76 percent of ACGs awarded in 2006-07 went to first-year students (Figure 9). Secondyear recipients had to meet the same requirements as first-year recipients and also had to have a GPA of at least 3.0 at the end of their first year. The fact that many fewer second-year students than first-year ones received ACGs in 2006-07 suggests that many second-year students were unable to meet the GPA requirement. Other contributing factors might be less awareness of the program among second-year students or institutional difficulties in verifying the high school course-taking of second-year students, but there is no particular evidence to support either. -52 -Because the ACG program was not in effect when 2006-07 second-year students were in their first year, they would not have been aware at that time (2005-06) that an ACG would be available to them in 2006-07 if they earned a 3.0 GPA. In contrast, first-year ACG recipients in 2006-07 may have been motivated by their grant to earn a 3.0 GPA and maintain full-time enrollment in order to keep it. If this was the case, the proportion of grants awarded to secondyear students should increase in 2007-08. Over 60 percent of the ACG recipients were women, and over half were age 18 or younger. In the ACG program and the Pell Grant program in general, the majority of the students were women. Among the first-and second-year students with ACGs, 63 percent were women, and among those who received only Pell Grants (no ACG), 67 percent were women ( Figure 10). Appendix Table E-8 presents more details. Because the ACG program requires students to be recent high school graduates and to be in their first two years of college, it is not surprising that 54 percent of ACG students were age 18 or younger, and nearly all of the rest were between age 19 and 23. In contrast, among the first-and second-year Pell Grant students who did not receive an ACG, nearly one-half were age 24 or older. Reflecting their age, 96 percent of the ACG recipients were dependent students, in contrast -53 -to 41 percent of first-and second-year students who only received Pell Grants and no ACGs (Appendix Table E-9). Although all ACG recipients were from lower-income families, they tended to come from families with higher incomes than students who received only Pell Grants. Seventeen percent of the dependent ACG recipients came from families with incomes over $40,000, compared with 10 percent of the first-and second-year students who received only Pell Grants. In addition, 19 percent of the dependent ACG recipients came from families with incomes under $10,000, compared with 28 percent of the Pell Grant students who did not receive an ACG (Figure 11 and Appendix Table E-9).  The federal Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is a measure 40 of a family's financial strength and indicates how much of a student's and family's financial resources (for dependent students) should be available to help pay for their education. The EFC is used to determine the Pell Grant amount. Students with a zero EFC are the neediest, and are therefore eligible for the maximum Pell Grant award. Among dependent first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients, the percentage of students who received an ACG was directly related to the EFC level. Among students with a zero EFC, 15 percent received an ACG; among students with an EFC of 3,000 or more, 29 percent received an ACG ( Figure 12 and Appendix Table E-10). -55 -  Dependent students with a zero EFC received a somewhat lower average ACG than students with higher EFCs, but they received a larger average combined Pell Grant and ACG amount and about one-third of the total ACG dollars. Dependent ACG students with a zero EFC received an average ACG Grant of $760, while students with a higher EFC received a little more than $800 on average ( Figure 13 and Appendix Table E-10). However, students with a zero EFC received the largest average amount of combined ACGs and Pell Grants ($4,600). The combined average amount decreased as the EFC increased because the Pell Grant amount (which is based on the EFC) decreased. Students with an EFC 41 of 3,000 or higher received somewhat more from their ACGs ($810) than their Pell Grants ($630). -56 -    About 2 percent each qualified through the State Scholars Initiative in a participating state or the way they qualified was unclear. 42 It should also be noted that many students would have qualified on more than one basis, and the one that was reported was decided by the college attended (presumably, the easiest one to identify). "}, {"section_title": "State program 35%", "text": "AP or IB 5%"}, {"section_title": "State Scholars 2%", "text": "Unknown 2% ED course-defined curriculum 57% Participation rates varied widely by state. Table 7 shows how the states rank by the percentage of first-and second-year Pell Grant recipients at four-year institutions who also received an ACG and were residents of that state (irrespective of whether they attended a college in the same state). The percentage ranged from a high of 32 percent (Massachusetts residents) to a low of 4 percent (Alaska residents). Table 7 also displays which states had an approved rigorous high school program that was aligned with the standards for admission to a public four-year college in that state. As discussed later in Chapter 6, the Department of Education has encouraged states to submit admission standards for approval as rigorous as a way to increase ACG participation. Of the states with the five highest ACG award rates, three (Massachusetts, California, and Pennsylvania) had their four-year college admission standards approved as rigorous for the purpose of determining ACG eligibility. However, of the 17 states that had their standards accepted as rigorous, 11 had lower than average ACG award rates. Thus, having admission standards approved does not appear, in itself, to be sufficient to promote high ACG participation.  Appendix Table G-1 displays participation data by state arranged alphabetically (including students in both two-and four-year institutions) and Appendix Table G-2 shows data by state for students in two-year institutions, ranked by ACG participation rate at the two-year level. With such a wide range of types of ACG qualification within different states, it will be an analytic challenge to demonstrate a relationship between ACG participation and state high school standards. Table 8 shows the states ranked by percentage of resident first-and second-year Pell Grant students who received an ACG-including students at both two-and four-year institutions-and shows the number and percentage distribution of ACG recipients by type of ACG qualification. There are major variations by the students' state of residence, but there is no clear relationship between ACG participation rates and the type of qualification. For example, Tennessee and Mississippi student residents have the highest rates of qualification through the State Scholars Initiative, but they rank below average in ACG participation. The data in this table also highlight a problem in assuming that the student's state of residence is the same as the state where the student attended high school. About 2,000 ACG recipients qualified on the basis of statedesignated programs that were not the same as their state of residence. 43 -61 -  The requirements for participation in the National SMART Grant program less stringent than for the ACG program. The institution must be eligible for participation in the Pell Grant program and offer bachelor's degrees in one of the designated science, mathematics, engineering, technology, or critical language fields. The U.S. Department of Education identified about 2,100 institutions that were potentially eligible, and 1,425 participated in the first year of the program by awarding at least one National SMART Grant. The institutional rates of participation were 88 percent at public four-year, 65 percent at private nonprofit four-year, and 41 percent at for-profit four-year institutions (Figure 16). The participating institutions enrolled about 2.5 million Pell Grant students, or nearly 90 percent of the total 2.8 million Pell Grant students at all National SMART Grant-eligible institutions. Additional details about institutional participation are provided in Appendix Table E-1. Of the 62,000 students who received a National SMART Grant, 42,000 were enrolled in public four-year institutions, 16,000 in private nonprofit four-year institutions, and 4,000 in for-profit -65 -four-year institutions. Because eligibility was restricted to a small number of fields of study, only a little more than 5 percent of third-and fourth-year Pell Grant students at participating institutions received a National SMART Grant (Figure 17). Additional details about the number of recipients are presented in Appendix Table E-2.

BPS does not provide precise descriptions of students' course-taking, because high school transcripts were not collected for either cohort.

These definitions are less restrictive than the actual ED course-based and SSI rigorous curricula because they do not take into account the specific courses or levels required in various subjects. As a result, estimates of ACG-eligible students derived from BPS criteria will be an overestimate of the actual number. 53 However, the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) transcript data (which do show course-taking levels) suggest that the BPS-generated estimate may not be too far off. As reported earlier, 54 percent of low-income 2004 high school graduates who enrolled in college full-time within a year had completed the ED course-based curriculum requirement ( Figure 31). Using this same population, but considering only the number of courses in each subject (not the level) increases this estimate just 6 percentage points-to 60 percent. 54 In other words, if lowincome students who enrolled in college full-time immediately after high school had completed the requisite number of courses in the required subjects, they would have been very likely to achieve the levels needed to meet the ED course-based program."}, {"section_title": "Based on BPS, approximately 282,300 first-time, first-year students would have been eligible for an ACG in 2003-04 had the program existed, more than double the number who would have been eligible in 1995-96.", "text": "About 2.1 million beginning postsecondary students graduated from high school after January 2003 and enrolled in a degree program in 2003-04 (Table 10).

For example, Texas and Florida are able to annotate students' transcripts if they have met the ACG high school eligibility requirements. The Association of State Student Grant Programs suggested that high schools or states could partner with the National Student Clearinghouse to collect high school transcript data. The clearinghouse is already a repository of degree, diploma, and enrollment data for postsecondary and high schools and districts and meets the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) confidentiality and security requirements."}, {"section_title": "Increased Communication Between High School and College Counselors", "text": "According to the stakeholders interviewed, more work needs to be done on bridging the gaps between high school and college counseling, although it is unclear what role the federal -103 -government may play in this work.

It could include audience-specific worksheets and handouts that could be easily copied and distributed."}, {"section_title": "Regular Stakeholder Feedback", "text": "The Department should continue to give stakeholders a forum in which to share their experiences in implementing the ACG and National SMART Grant programs. Given that much of the success of these programs relies on the accurate and timely dissemination of information at the middle and high school levels, future feedback sessions should be broadened to include other elementary and high school stakeholders, such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), National Middle School Association (NMSA), American Association of School Administrators (AASA), and National Education Association (NEA). These sessions could take the form of national surveys and could even be broadened to capture feedback from students, parents, and teachers.

There were approximately 5 million students in the file who had received a Pell Grant at one of the institutions eligible to participate in the ACG or the National SMART Grant programs. The Pell Grant records (with the FAFSA data) were then merged with the records for ACG and National SMART Grant recipients. The final analysis file identified those who received an ACG, a National SMART Grant, or only a Pell Grant. Only those records that indicated that the award had been disbursed to the student (as of the September 2007 date of the file) were included. Subsequent updates to the file (either adding disbursements or subtracting cancellations) may have changed the totals compared with those reported elsewhere. Although all ACGs and National SMART Grants are only awarded to students with Pell Grants, about 400 ACG or National SMART Grant records could not be matched to a Pell Grant record in this file. In addition, some of the student-reported fields from the FAFSA were missing, so the student totals may vary slightly for some variables reported on different tables. There were about 2,000 ACG or National SMART Grant recipients who transferred during the academic year and received these grants at two different colleges; the tables that show the number of students by type or state of institution include these as duplicates, and will therefore have slightly higher totals than the tables based on unduplicated, unique student records.
