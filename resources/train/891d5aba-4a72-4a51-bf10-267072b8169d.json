[{"section_title": "What Did the Study Find?", "text": "\u2022 Emission of reactive nitrogen to the environment can be reduced by matching nitrogen applications more closely with the needs of growing crops. This can be achieved by adopting three \"best management practices\" (BMPs): \u2022 Rate: Applying an amount of nitrogen at a rate that accounts for all other sources of nitrogen, carryover from previous crops, irrigation water, and atmospheric deposits. \u2022 Timing: Applying nitrogen as close to the time that the crop needs it as is practical (as opposed to the season before the crop is planted). \u2022 Method: Injecting or incorporating the nutrients into the soil to reduce runoff and losses to the atmosphere. \u2022 Among all U.S. fi eld crops planted in 2006 that received nitrogen fertilizers, 35 percent are estimated to have met all three of the nutrient BMPs. For the remaining cropland, improvements in management are needed to increase nitrogen use effi ciency (i.e., reduce the amount of nitrogen available for loss to the environment). \u2022 Corn is the most intensive user of nitrogen fertilizer, on a per acre basis and in total use. Fertilizer applied to corn is least likely to be applied in accordance with all three BMPs. \u2022 Incentives for improving nitrogen use effi ciency by adopting the rate, timing, and method BMPs can come from policy or market forces: \u2022 Government programs that provide fi nancial assistance for adopting BMPs can be effective if they encourage the participation of farmers with land most in need of improvement and if the farmers choose the most cost-effective practices. Data suggest that the amount of cropland needing improvement would require a substantial increase in the current Federal budget devoted to nutrient management practices. \u2022 Including nitrogen management in compliance provisions for receiving Federal farm payments could encourage farmers to adopt more effective management practices. In 2005, producers of U.S. corn received Government payments that were much higher than the cost of improving nitrogen management. The strength of this incentive, however, has declined in recent years because of increases in crop prices and a decline in direct commodity payments. \u2022 Emissions markets, such as water quality trading and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade, could provide fi nancial incentives to farmers to adopt improved nitrogen management and produce nitrogen credits that can be sold in these markets. The effectiveness of such markets would depend on market design, including rules defi ning who can participate and what needs to be done to produce credits. \u2022 Onfi eld improvements to nitrogen use effi ciency could be supplemented with off-fi eld practices, such as wetlands restoration and vegetative fi lter strips that can fi lter and trap reactive nitrogen that leaves the fi eld through surface runoff and groundwater fl ow. Of the two practices, restored wetlands can be more cost effective at removing nitrogen and provide additional environmental benefi ts, but they are limited to areas with suitable soils and hydrology. Vegetative fi lters can be employed more widely across the landscape but are not effective when existing tile drains bypass the fi lters. \u2022 Policies for increasing nitrogen use effi ciency should recognize the potential environmental tradeoffs when addressing particular issues related to reactive nitrogen. Focusing strictly on one issue, such as nitrate leaching, could lead to increased emissions of other nitrogen compounds, such as nitrous oxide, even when total reactive nitrogen emissions are reduced."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "ERS researchers used an extensive literature review, modeling, and data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of major fi eld crops. ARMS data provided information on nitrogen use, defi ned by the rate, method, and timing application criteria. This, in turn, helped researchers determine the types of management improvements needed the most. The following market forces and policy instruments were evaluated to measure their infl uence on nitrogen management: nitrogen fertilizer taxes, Federal fi nancial assistance offered to farmers to adopt practices that improve nitrogen use effi ciency or fi lter and trap nitrogen runoff, emissions markets such as water quality trading and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade, compliance with nitrogen BMPs as a condition for receiving farm program benefi ts, and regulation. Because reactive nitrogen is mobile and able to transform into different compounds, researchers used a fi eld-level nitrogen loss simulator developed by USDA's Agricultural Research Service to track how improving nitrogen use effi ciency by meeting all three BMPs affects emissions of different reactive nitrogen compounds. These interactions were taken into account when evaluating alternative policy options."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Most of the cropping systems in the world are naturally defi cient in nitrogen, making nitrogen inputs necessary to produce the crop yields needed to support human populations. Gaseous nitrogen (N 2 ) is abundant in the atmosphere, but it cannot be used by living organisms unless it is fi rst converted into useable forms. Leguminous plants and soil microorganisms contribute signifi cant amounts of nitrogen used by crops, but yields necessary to support growing populations need more nitrogen than can be provided by natural means. The Haber-Bosch process converts \"unreactive\" gaseous nitrogen from the atmosphere into a biologically useable \"reactive\" form. The development of the process in the early 1900s led to the massive production of relatively inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer that boosted crop yields (Follett et al., 2010). The increasing use of reactive nitrogen in agriculture also increased the potential for nitrogen to be lost to the environment as ammonia (NH 3 ), ammonium (NH 4 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and nitrate (NO 3 ); these compounds are all reactive forms of nitrogen (Galloway et al., 2003). Excessive amounts of reactive nitrogen inputs can lead to imbalances in the natural movement of nitrogen among atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic nitrogen pools, leading to disruptions in ecosystem function and the supply of valuable ecosystem services. Reactive nitrogen directly affects species composition, diversity, dynamics, and the functioning of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems (Matson et al., 1997;Vitousek et al., 1997). Human-induced increases in reactive nitrogen emissions to the environment may contribute to the following harmful changes to ecosystems: \u2022 Ozone-induced injury to crop, forest, and natural ecosystems \u2022 Acidifi cation and eutrophication (nutrient enrichment) effects on forests, soils, and freshwater aquatic ecosystems A variety of steps can be taken to reduce the relatively large share of nitrogen that is lost from agricultural systems. Improved management of nitrogen fertilizers, animal manure, and other agricultural inputs can improve overall nitrogen use effi ciency (NUE) and reduce the loss of reactive nitrogen to the environment while maintaining crop yields. Incentives for encouraging farmers to adopt improved nitrogen management can take many forms, from purely voluntary to regulatory. Designing a cost-effective policy requires that factors infl uencing fertilizer use be fully understood. Also, an understanding of how farmers are likely to respond to different incentives may help policymakers assess potential environmental tradeoffs driven by nitrogen's ability to change forms and cycle through different environmental media. This report takes a broad view of several questions related to nitrogen management: (1) Why is nitrogen management so important? (2) How many acres of cropland are not using nitrogen best management practices (BMP)? and (3) What are the strengths and weaknesses of alternative policy approaches for improving nitrogen management on those acres? Ideally, alternative policies would be assessed on the basis of the cost of achieving a particular level of NUE across U.S. crop production. However, physio-economic models that would allow for this type of assessment are not available on a national scale. Instead, this analysis uses survey data to help identify the number of acres of cropland that would benefi t from improved management and to assess the characteristics of each alternative policy approach. Policy approaches are assessed in terms of factors consistent with cost effectiveness, including fl exibility, ability to target, crop acres covered, and implementation costs. These factors are assessed through original research and an extensive review of the literature."}, {"section_title": "Pathways for Nitrogen Losses", "text": "Soil erosion -Nitrogen can be lost from the soil surface when attached to soil particles that are carried off the fi eld by wind or water. Although wind and water erosion can be observed across all regions, wind erosion is more prevalent in dry regions and water erosion in humid regions. Overall, little nitrogen is lost through erosion when basic conservation practices are in place (Iowa Soybean Association, 2008b). Runoff -Surface runoff of dissolved nitrogen (generally in the form of nitrate) is only a concern when fertilizer and or manure are applied on the surface and rain moves the nitrogen before it enters the soil (Legg and Meisinger, 1982;Iowa Soybean Association, 2008b). Ammonia volatilization -Signifi cant amounts of nitrogen can be lost to the atmosphere as ammonia (NH 3 ) if animal manure or urea is surface applied and not immediately incorporated into the soil (Hutchinson et al., 1982;Fox et al., 1996;Freney et al., 1981;Sharpe and Harper, 1995;Peoples et al., 1995). Additionally, warm weather conditions can accelerate the conversion of manure and other susceptible inorganic nitrogen fertilizers to ammonia gas. Denitrifi cation and nitrifi cation -When oxygen levels in the soil are low, some microorganisms known as denitrifi ers will convert NO 3 to nitrogen (N 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), both of which are gases lost to the atmosphere (Mosier and Klemedtsson, 1994). Nitrogen gas is not an environmental issue, but N 2 O is a powerful greenhouse gas. Denitrifi cation usually occurs when nitrate is present in the soil, soil moisture is high or there is standing water, and soils are warm. NO x and N 2 O gases can also be produced through a process called nitrifi cation. Leaching -Leaching occurs when there is suffi cient rain and/or irrigation to move easily dissolvable nitrate through the soil profi le (Randall et al., 2008). The nitrate eventually ends up in underground aquifers or in surface water via tile drains and groundwater fl ow. Tile drains may be a chief passageway by which nitrogen moves from crop soils to surface water (Turner and Rabalais, 2003;Randall et al., 2008;Randall et al., 2010). al. (1995) estimate that consumers in four U.S. rural areas would be willing to pay between $73 million and $780 million per year (in 1995 dollars) for reduced chemical concentrations (including nitrate) in groundwater tapped by private wells. Dodds et al. (2009) estimate that consumers spend over $800 million each year on bottled water due to nutrient-related taste and odor problems. Using data from water treatment plants, ERS estimates the cost of removing nitrate from U.S. drinking water supplies is over $4.8 billion per year (see app. 1). Based on the contribution of nitrate loadings from agriculture (Smith et al., 1997), agriculture's share of these costs is estimated at about $1.7 billion per year. Most costs are borne by the large utilities, due to the volume of water treated. ERS fi ndings indicate that reducing nitrate concentrations in source waters by 1 percent would reduce water treatment costs in the United States by over $120 million per year."}, {"section_title": "Managing Nitrogen for Agriculture and the Environment", "text": "USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) defi nes nutrient management as managing the amount, source, placement, form, and timing of the application of plant nutrients to the soil (USDA, NRCS, 2006). Optimizing nitrogen management both economically and environmentally requires farmers to perform a juggling act: Applying too much nitrogen cuts into fi nancial returns and increases the likelihood of nitrogen escaping into the environment; applying too little increases the risk of reduced yields and lost income. Crop production is characterized by uncertain and stochastic, or random, weather and soil conditions that affect crop yields and nitrogen loss. To maintain viable operations, farmers may manage temporal variability in weather and soil nitrogen by overapplying nitrogen to protect against downside risk (i.e., use an \"insurance\" nitrogen application rate) (Sheriff, 2005;Babcock, 1992;Babcock and Blackmer, 1992). Additionally, farmers may take a \"safety net\" approach to maximize economic returns by setting an optimistic yield goal for a given fi eld based on an optimum weather year to ensure that the needed amount of nitrogen for maximum yields is available (Schepers et al., 1986;Bock and Hergert, 1991). Thus, during the years in which weather is not optimal for maximizing yields, nitrogen will be overapplied from an agronomic standpoint. Almost by defi nition, optimal conditions are infrequent, so farmers overfertilize crops in most years. The following hypothetical example helps illustrate the reasoning behind a farmer's decision to apply a certain amount of fertilizer. Assume that a farmer applies 179 pounds of nitrogen (N) per acre to his or her cornfi eld. Under ideal conditions, the farmer might produce 170 bushels of corn per acre. In most years, however, conditions are not ideal and production averages 148 bushels per acre. This yield requires only 165 pounds of N per acre, but at this level, the farmer will miss out on an extra 22 bushels in the event of ideal weather conditions. Assuming a fertilizer price of $0.50 per pound of N, the extra N applied in an average year costs $7 per acre. Assuming a corn price of $4.50 per bushel, the benefi t from having enough nitrogen available to take advantage of optimal conditions would be $99 per acre. In most years, however, the extra fertilizer is not used by the crop and is available to leave the fi eld and affect environmental quality."}, {"section_title": "Defi nitions of Nitrogen Use Effi ciency", "text": "Researchers calculate nitrogen use effi ciency to assess the effectiveness of nitrogen management. The NUE of a cropping system is the proportion of all nitrogen inputs that are removed in harvested crop biomass, contained in recycled crop residues, and incorporated in soil organic and inorganic nitrogen pools (Cassman et al., 2002) (fi g. 2.1). Nitrogen not recovered in these nitrogen sinks is lost to the environment. Increases in NUE reduce the share of nitrogen left in the soil and available for loss to water or the atmosphere. Increased NUE is treated as a goal of environmental policy throughout this report."}, {"section_title": "Recommended Input Rate and Nitrogen Credits", "text": "The nitrogen application rate has a major effect on NUE (Bock and Hergert, 1991;Meisinger et al., 2008;Freney et al., 1995;Power et al., 2001). Nitrogen losses have been shown to increase rapidly when N inputs exceed assimilation capacity (Vanotti and Bundy, 1994;Schlegel et al., 1996;Dobermann et al., 2006;Bock and Hergert, 1991). Reducing application rates reduces the losses of all forms of reactive nitrogen. Nitrogen use efficiency is the proportion of all N inputs (N F and N MISC ) that are removed in harvested crop biomass (NCH), contained in recycled crop residues (N CR ), and incorporated into soil organic matter (N SON ) and inorganic N (N SIN ) pools. The remainder is what is lost to the atmosphere through gaseous emissions (N G ), leaching (N L ), and erosion (N E ). The goal of nitrogen management is to reduce these losses through reductions in fertilizer inputs and through soil, water, fertilizer, and crop management that affects the cycling of nitrogen in the soil. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from Meisinger et al., 2008. The effectiveness of nitrogen management may be raised by accounting for all nitrogen sources when determining a nitrogen fertilizer application rate. Depending on the region, such sources may include inorganic nitrogen levels in the root zone, soil organic content, previous crop (e.g., leguminous crop), manure applications, irrigation water, and atmospheric deposition (Cassman et al., 2002;Meisinger et al., 2008;Iowa Soybean Association, 2008a)."}, {"section_title": "Method/Placement", "text": "The goal of appropriate method and placement of fertilizer is to provide nutrients to plants for rapid uptake and to reduce the potential for losses to the environment. Studies have shown that NUE can be doubled under some conditions by placing fertilizers in the soil rather than \"broadcasting\" them on the surface (Malhi and Nyborg, 1991;Power et al., 2001). Liquid or gaseous forms of nitrogen can be injected directly into the soil with specialized equipment that is consistent with low-till systems. Solid forms can be broadcast on the surface and immediately incorporated into the soil with tillage equipment. Such placement reduces the risks of losses to the atmosphere and through surface runoff. The method of application can also reduce losses of nitrogen stemming from ammonia volatization (Meisinger and Randall, 1991;Peoples et al., 1995;Fox et al., 1996;Freney et al., 1981). The impact of fertilizer placement on nitrous oxide emissions is less certain. Liu et al. (2006) found that injection of liquid urea ammonium nitrate at deeper levels resulted in 40-70 percent lower N 2 O emissions than the rate associated with shallow injection or surface application. Some studies, however, have reported that incorporation into the soil increases N 2 O emissions (Flessa and Beese, 2000;Wulf et al., 2002;Drury, 2006). Injection or incorporation could also increase nitrate leaching, especially where soils are coarse textured (Abt Associates, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Timing", "text": "The research on improving NUE in crop production emphasizes the need for greater synchronization between crop nitrogen demand and the supply of nitrogen from all sources throughout the growing season (Doerge et al., 1991;Cassman et al., 2002;Meisinger and Delgado, 2002). Balancing supply and demand implies maintaining low levels of inorganic nitrogen in the soil when there is little plant growth and providing suffi cient inorganic nitrogen fertilizer during periods of rapid plant growth (Doerge et al., 1991;Alva et al., 2005). For example, the corn plant's need for nitrogen is not very high until about 4 weeks after it emerges from the ground, which typically falls in June through July in the major corn-producing States (Baker, 2001). Ideally, to ensure that growing crops have adequate N and to minimize losses from the soil, a farmer could split nitrogen applications or \"spoon feed\" nitrogen when using center-pivot sprinkler irrigation systems from June through July-August, using information from soil tests and/or advanced remote sensing techniques (Bausch and Delgado, 2003). Though splitting nitrogen applications is seen as an effective way to increase NUE and reduce nitrogen losses to the environment, several factors must fi rst be considered: workload, seasonal fertilizer price differences, the risk associated with not being able to apply at the right time, application costs, the possibility of compacting the soil, and possible damage to growing crops (Doerge et al. 1991;Westermann and Kleinkopf, 1985;Westermann et al., 1988;Alva et al., 2005;."}, {"section_title": "Form", "text": "NUE is also infl uenced by the form of nitrogen fertilizer (Raun and Schepers, 2008;Freney et al., 1995). Some of the more widely used nitrogen fertilizer forms include anhydrous ammonia (gas), urea (solid), UAN (liquid), and manure (solid). These forms vary in how quickly they can be transformed into nitrate, which is what crops actually use. The closer in time the fertilizer is applied to when the crop needs it, the faster it needs to be transformed into nitrate. A mismatch of fertilizer form with appropriate timing can lead to large environmental losses and poor yields."}, {"section_title": "Manure Effects", "text": "Manure is an important source of N, but it poses challenging management problems (Eghball et al., 2002;Kirchmann and Bergstrom, 2001;Davis et al., 2002). The nitrogen content of manure depends on the animal type and the method of manure storage (Davis et al., 2002;Eghball et al., 2002), and nitrogen content may be inconsistent from batch to batch (Davis et al., 2002). Manure is more diffi cult to handle than inorganic nitrogen fertilizers, and, if in solid form, is diffi cult to apply uniformly. Most of the nitrogen content of manure is in the organic form and has to be mineralized before crops can use it. Since the transformation process depends on manure type, soil, and weather conditions, it is more diffi cult to control soil nitrate levels relative to crop needs when manure is applied than when other forms are applied (Eghball et al., 2002;Power et al., 2001). Consequently, controlling environmental losses from manured fi elds is more diffi cult than from fi elds using commercial fertilizer."}, {"section_title": "Off-Site Practices That Capture Nitrogen", "text": "Off-fi eld conservation measures can be used in conjunction with onfi eld nitrogen management to either capture reactive nitrogen in biomass or convert it to inert N 2 through denitrifi cation. Examples of off-site practices include vegetative buffers or fi lters and restored and constructed wetlands (Hefting et al., 2003;Jacobs and Gilliam, 1985;Lowrance et al., 1984). Buffers and wetlands reduce nitrogen loads to water through plant uptake, microbial immobilization and denitrifi cation, soil storage, and groundwater mixing (Pionke and Lowrance, 1991;Lowrance et al., 1997;Hey et al., 2005;Mayer et al., 2005). Buffers can remove nitrogen from both surface fl ow and groundwater (Mayer et al., 2005;Angier et al., 2001;Randall et al., 2008;Mitsch and Day, 2006). The effectiveness of vegetative buffers depends on the size of the buffer, the density of vegetation, and hydrologic conditions within the buffer zone (Dosskey et al., 2005;2007). Based on a wide range of studies, Mayer et al. (2005) estimate that buffers can remove about 74 percent of the nitrogen passing through the buffer root zone. However, in many areas of the country where tile drains are used to control the water table, especially in the Corn Belt, subsurface fl ows pass below the root zone and are not fi ltered by vegetative buffers. Restored wetlands have been shown to be effective at reducing the transfer of nitrogen from agricultural land to water bodies (Jansson et al., 1994) and have been proposed as a technique to remove reactive nitrogen from the environment (Hey et al., 2005;Mitsch and Day, 2006). Wetland vegetation uptakes nitrogen, and wet soils enhance denitrifi cation. The effectiveness of wetlands as a fi lter of reactive nitrogen depends on their size, seasonal weather conditions, and hydrologic characteristics. Wetlands also provide a host of other ecosystem services that are valued by society, such as wildlife habitat and carbon sequestration. \u2022 Rate. Applying no more nitrogen (commercial and manure) than 40 percent more than that removed with the crop at harvest, based on the stated yield goal, including any carryover from the previous crop. This approach is consistent with a more traditional approach for estimating N rate recommendations (Millar et al., 2010) and is also the criterion used by NRCS in its assessment of conservation practices in the Upper Mississippi Basin (USDA, NRCS, 2010). Crop uptake coeffi cients are from NRCS (Lander et al., 1998, table 3.1). This agronomic rate accounts for unavoidable environmental losses that prevent some of the nitrogen that is applied from actually reaching crops.  Lander et al. (1998). The coeffi cients for soft (1.02 lbs/bushel) and hard (1.23 lbs/bushel) winter wheat were averaged because the type of winter wheat produced was not available.

Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (2003-06) and Lander et al. (1998). \u2022 Timing. Not applying nitrogen in the fall for a crop planted in the spring. \u2022 Method. Injecting (placing fertilizer directly into the soil) or incorporating (applying to the surface and then discing the fertilizer into the soil) nitrogen rather than broadcasting on the surface without incorporation. Form also plays a role in nitrogen management for improving NUE. However, available data do not allow for an assessment of the form of nitrogen fertilizer applied. In this report, we evaluate nitrogen management only during the survey year covered by ARMS data. The loss of nitrogen to the environment in a particular year is mostly a function of current and not past management decisions. However, current management decisions have to account for past management, such as planting of a legume. The amount of commercial nitrogen applied is readily available from the ARMS responses; however, the amount of manure nitrogen must be estimated. We base these estimates on the quantity of raw manure applied, the form of the manure (liquid or solid), and the animal source of the manure. We also note whether the previous crop was a legume so as to account for the potential carryover of nitrogen. A farm can fall into one of eight nitrogen management categories, defi ned by the three management decisions in a particular year: 1. All of the criteria are followed. 2. The rate and timing criteria are followed. 3. The rate and method criteria are followed. 4. The timing and method criteria are followed. 5. Only the rate criterion is followed. 6. Only the timing criterion is followed. 7. Only the method criterion is followed. 8. None of the criteria are followed."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural Resource Management Survey", "text": "USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is an annual survey of farm and ranch operators administered by ERS and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). ARMS gathers data on fi eld-level production practices, farm business accounts, and farm households. ARMS is a multiple-phase survey. In the fall, NASS interviews producers of major commodities, such as feed grains, food grains, or cotton, to collect information about production practices and land use on select fi elds. In the spring, NASS re-interviews farmers who successfully completed the fall survey. Spring data collection focuses on the structural and economic characteristics of the farm business and farm operator household. This approach helps link commodity production activities and conservation practices with the farm business and operator household. Each phase of ARMS contains multiple versions of the survey questionnaire. The commonality of questions across versions provides one facet of data integration. In the fall data collection, the target commodity distinguishes questionnaires. Because the crops covered in the analysis were surveyed in different years, we specify a reference year, 2006, to examine the extent to which best nitrogen management practices are being followed. Weights are calibrated so that the weighted sums of acres planted by the surveyed crop producers match USDA's published estimates of planted acres for 2006 (USDA, NASS, 2008). This provides reasonable baseline estimates under the assumption that the percentages of planted and treated acres and application rates by management category were stable between the survey reference years (see table 3.1) and 2006. We maintain this assumption throughout the analysis. Sixty-nine percent of the 242 million acres planted to barley, corn, cotton, oats, peanuts, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat in 2006 were estimated to be treated with commercial and/or manure nitrogen (table 3.2). Corn accounted for an estimated 45 percent of the 167 million crop acres treated with nitrogen and 65 percent of the 8.7 million tons of nitrogen applied to these crops during 2006. The application rate criterion was not met on over 53 million acres treated with nitrogen (32 percent). Cotton had the highest percentage of treated acres not meeting the rate criterion (47 percent), followed by corn (35 percent). However, corn accounted for 50 percent of all treated crop acres not meeting the rate criterion. The timing criterion was not met on over 40 million treated acres (24 percent). About 34 percent of treated corn acres received commercial and/or manure nitrogen in the fall. These corn acres account for over 64 percent of all treated crop acres not meeting the timing criterion. Notes: N = nitrogen. These estimates are based on weighted sums, where the weights were calibrated so that the sums of planted acres for each crop based on the survey data match published estimates of planted acres for 2006 (USDA, 2008 Nitrogen was not incorporated/injected on over 61 million treated crop acres (37 percent). These acres received 24 percent of all applied nitrogen. Soybeans (45 percent) had the highest percentage of acres not meeting the method criterion. However, corn accounted for about 46 percent of all treated acres not meeting the method criterion. Corn acres make up nearly half of all acres that are in need of some type of improvement in nitrogen management, in that at least one of the three criteria is not met (fi g. 3.1). Any policy aimed at improving nitrogen use effi ciency would have to consider the factors driving management decisions in corn production. From a regional standpoint, the Corn Belt and Northern Plains dominate in terms of cropland not meeting the management criteria (fi gs. 3.2, 3.3). Not coincidentally, these are the primary corn-growing areas in the United States. However, in terms of nitrogen application in excess of the criterion rate, the Corn Belt and Lake States receive the greatest amounts of excess nitrogen (fi g. 3.4). As described in the previous chapter, NUE is highest when all three management criteria are met. Table 3.3 shows the percentage of treated acres in each nitrogen management category, as well as the degree to which excess nitrogen is applied in relation to the rate criterion. About 35 percent (58 million acres) of the treated acreage meet all three criteria. Corn has the smallest percentage of treated acres meeting all three criteria (30.4 percent). Because of the large amount of cropland planted to corn, this represents about half of all crop acres needing improvement in nitrogen management (rate, timing, or method). Only 4.2 percent of all treated acres do not meet any of the three criteria. About 47 percent of all treated crop acres meet the method and timing criteria. Most of the acres exceeding the rate criterion do so by less than 50 Acres treated with commercial and/or manure nitrogen not using nitrogen best management practices, 2006  It should be noted that our fi ndings differ somewhat from those reported by USDA's Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) assessment of the Upper Mississippi River Basin (USDA, 2010). The CEAP study reports smaller percentages of cropland meeting the nitrogen management criteria. The ERS study, however, examines nitrogen management for only the survey year. The CEAP analysis looks at nutrient management practices over an entire crop rotation, which may run from 2 to 5 years (see box, \"CEAP Analysis of Nitrogen Management in the Upper Mississippi River Basin\"). All three criteria had to be met in each year of the rotation for CEAP to consider the cropping system as having met the nitrogen management goal. The CEAP approach is stricter than that used by ERS."}, {"section_title": "Manure Use", "text": "Previous research has indicated that farms with animals tend to overapply nutrients to crops, primarily because of the large amount of manure produced on the farm needing disposal (Ribaudo et al., 2003;Gollehon et al., 2001).

Tile drainage plays a role in nitrogen losses from fi elds (David et al., 2010). Tile drainage lowers the water table, enabling fi elds that would otherwise be wet part of the year to be intensively cropped. These drained soils tend to be highly productive. Tiles, however, provide a rapid conduit for soluble nitrate, effectively bypassing any attenuation that may occur in the soil. ARMS data indicate that nearly 26 percent of treated cropland is tiled, most of this in corn production (table 3.5). Of particular interest is the degree to which nitrogen management on this vulnerable cropland is not using nitrogen BMP. ARMS data indicate that about 71 percent of tiled acres do not meet all three nitrogen management criteria. Most of these acres are in corn production. Much of the tile-drained cropland is located in the Mississippi River Basin, which has implications for hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Land management practices can mitigate nitrogen losses from fi elds. The use of fi lter strips or riparian buffers can reduce the amount of nitrogen lost to surface water bodies. Less than 10 percent of treated crop acres not meeting the rate, timing, or method criteria have fi lter strips that could reduce losses in runoff and subsurface fl ows (table 3.6). For corn, about 11 percent of acres not using nitrogen BMPs have fi lter strips that could mitigate losses to water, but signifi cant improvements could still be made. Filter strips, however, do not address atmospheric losses and may not be effective if not sited or managed appropriately.

CEAP was initiated by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, Agricultural Research Service, and Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (recently renamed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture). The goal of CEAP is to estimate conservation benefi ts from conservation investments and to provide research and an assessment on how to best use conservation practices in managing agricultural landscapes to protect and enhance environmental quality. The assessment of cultivated cropland in the UMRB is the fi rst of a series of studies that will cover major crop-producing areas of the United States. Findings from the UMRB study are available at www.nrcs.usda. gov/technical/nri/ceap/umrb/index.html. Both analyses assess baseline nitrogen management on cropland according to three criteria: rate, timing, and method. The defi nitions we used for each are based on those used in the CEAP analysis. Both studies used a survey to collect data on nutrient management practices. The major difference between our analysis using ARMS data and the CEAP analysis is how the criteria were applied. ARMS collects information about cropping practices during a single crop year. Our analysis, therefore, based the assessment of nitrogen management on practices used to produce the crop sampled by the survey. The CEAP analysis focused on cropping systems, which could be up to 5 years in length and contain several different crops. Data were collected on production practices used each year of the crop rotation. CEAP used these data to evaluate the entire rotation, not just the crop grown during the year the survey was conducted. If the rate, timing, or method criteria were not met during any year of the rotation, then that sample point was identifi ed as not meeting the nitrogen management criteria. This approach is more stringent than the one used in our analysis. For example, assume corn and soybeans were on a 2-year rotation and that corn was grown during the year the ARMS and CEAP surveys were conducted. In our analysis, if the nitrogen application rate on corn met the rate criterion, then that corn sample was identifi ed as such. In the CEAP study, the nitrogen application rate on both the corn and the previous year's soybean crops were assessed. If the application rate on corn met the rate criterion but excess nitrogen was applied to soybeans, then the rotation was identifi ed as not meeting the criterion. This leads to the CEAP assessment reporting a smaller percentage of crop acres meeting the rate criterion than we would report. Overall, the CEAP analysis reports fewer crop acres meeting the rate, timing, and method criteria than does the ERS report. in the future, along with the intensity of corn production. Together, these factors could increase reactive nitrogen emissions to the environment unless nitrogen use effi ciency is improved. An examination of an additional year of survey data collected during the 2001 growing season and disaggregated regionally helps determine if management has undergone recent changes and if such changes vary by region. The share of corn acres not meeting the rate criterion declined from 41 to 35 percent between 2001 and 2005 (table 3.7). This fi nding is in  agreement with those of other reports on improving nitrogen use effi ciency based on steady application rates and increased corn yields (Turner et al., 2007). Improvements in rate were seen in all regions except Appalachia and the Southeast. Notable improvements were seen in the Corn Belt, Lake States, and Northeast. Timing and method, however, did not show similar improvements in the more recent data. For most regions, the percentage of corn acres not meeting these two criteria increased."}, {"section_title": "Changing Management May Result in Environmental Tradeoffs", "text": "Changing management practices may improve nitrogen use effi ciency, but the environmental outcomes may not always be desirable. We use the new Nitrogen Loss and Environmental Assessment Package with GIS (Geographic Information System) capabilities (NLEAP-GIS) model to assess how changes in nitrogen management practices on corn affect the losses of nitrate (to water), nitrous oxide (to air), and ammonia (to air) (Shaffer et al., 2010;Delgado et al., 2010a). Of particular interest is the extent to which tradeoffs in environmental outcomes might occur as overall nitrogen use effi ciency is improved. See appendix 2 for more details on NLEAP. Because NLEAP is a fi eld-level model, we selected eight different soils in four States (Arkansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) to assess changes in nitrogen emissions to the environment from management changes in nonirrigated corn production. 1 Four of the soils are type A or B soils (well drained), and four are type D soils (relatively poorly drained). For each soil, we examined two rotations (corn-corn and corn-soybeans), two tillage practices (conventional and no-till), and two sources of nitrogen (inorganic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer + animal manure). The slopes for these soils were 0 to 6 percent, with low erosion potential. For each soil/rotation/tillage/nitrogen-source combination, eight different scenarios were modeled with NLEAP, each representing one of the combi-1 These four States were selected because they present a wide variation in growing conditions and because the data necessary for running NLEAP were already developed. nations of nitrogen management criteria outlined in table 3.4. Therefore, 64 different scenarios were modeled for each soil. A recommended application rate was specifi ed for each soil/cropping system combination, based on local agronomic recommendations, as described by Espinoza and Ross (2008) for Arkansas, Alley et al. (2009) for Virginia, Beegle and Durst (2003) for Pennsylvania, and Vitosh et al. (1995) for Ohio. For the purposes of this analysis, overapplication was set at 75 percent more than the recommended rate (at the upper end of overapplication found in the ARMS data and reported in table 3.3). For example, if the recommended rate was 132 pounds of N per acre, the overapplication scenario used 231 pounds (see app. 2). The modeled policy goal is that all three nitrogen management criteria be met. For demonstration purposes, we used the NLEAP results to assess the potential emissions tradeoffs when method, timing, timing and method, or rate BMPs are adopted by corn farmers. For example, to evaluate the tradeoff when timing is improved (rate and method criteria are already met), we compare the NLEAP results for the rate and method BMPs with the results for the rate, timing, and method BMPs. Each cropping system is evaluated separately. Because of the volume of results for the eight soils modeled, we present only those from the two soils in Ohio (tables 3.8a-d). Results for the other States are similar, in terms of the direction of changes. All the scenarios show the expected changes in total nitrogen losses, with reductions indicating improvements in NUE. The NLEAP results were consistent with the expectation that nitrogen emissions are minimized when all three criteria are met. Since nitrogen cycles through different forms and ecosystems, the long-term environmental benefi ts of reducing total nitrogen Notes: In both years, corn producers were surveyed in Colorado (Mountain); Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota (Northern Plains); Texas (Southern Plains); Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin (Lake States); Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio (Corn Belt); New York and Pennsylvania (Northeast); Kentucky and North Carolina (Appalachia); and Georgia (Southeast). These estimates are based on weighted sums, with the weights recalibrated so that the weighted sums of planted acres for each crop based on the survey data match estimates for (USDA, 2008 are clear. However, some of the tradeoffs between different forms of nitrogen could pose environmental problems. Adopting injection/incorporation always increases nitrate leaching, sometimes substantially (more than doubling leaching in some cases). Similarly, shifting applications from fall to spring (without changing application rate) reduces nitrate losses and total nitrogen losses but increases N 2 O emissions as applications are shifted to generally warmer, wetter conditions, which is consistent with the fi ndings of Delgado et al. (1996), Rochette et al. (2004), andHernandez-Ramirez et al. (2009). Because of concerns over greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this outcome would have to be carefully considered when making recommendations to improve nitrogen use effi ciency. Adopting both method and timing again produces mixed results. NH 3 emissions are always reduced. Leaching is generally reduced, but in some cases where manure is used, it may increase. N 2 O emissions almost always increase, from 5 to 50 percent, depending on the situation. In agreement with basic principles of nitrogen management, only reducing the application rate guarantees that losses of all three forms of reactive nitrogen are reduced (Mosier et al., 2002;Meisinger and Delgado, 2002). Based on these fi ndings, a recommendation could be that in areas where leaching to drinking water sources is a concern, improvements in nitrogen use effi ciency could focus on application rate reductions or improvements in timing. "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The survey data indicate that in 2006, all of the nitrogen management criteria were met on an estimated 35 percent of the crop acres treated with commercial and/or manure nitrogen. 2 In addition, a high percentage of treated acres met at least some of the nitrogen management criteria. Among all crops, corn met the criteria the least, and corn accounts for 50 percent of the treated acres upon which one or more improvements to management could be made to improve nitrogen use effi ciency. Improvements in rate, timing, and/or method might be needed on 67 percent of corn acres. NLEAP-GIS simulation results reported in the literature show that changing timing or method of application could potentially increase the loss of one type of nitrogen compound, even if total nitrogen emissions decline and NUE increases. NLEAP modeling indicates that only reducing application rates ensures that all nitrogen emissions decrease, in agreement with established principles of nitrogen management. 2 Recall that this adoption rate is higher than that reported by the USDA-NRCS CEAP analysis, which considers adoption over multiyear rotations (see box on page 17).   "}, {"section_title": "Policy Instruments for Nitrogen Reduction", "text": "Based on ARMS data, 65 percent of surveyed cropland, or 109 million acres, is in need of improved nitrogen management. Given nitrogen's effects on the environment, improving nitrogen management on vulnerable lands is a policy goal, both nationally and regionally. Farmers adjust the management of their crops for a variety of reasons. Economic factors, such as input or output price changes, may lead to more (or less) careful use of nitrogen inputs. Farmers may also have to consider various policy-based incentives for adopting practices that improve nitrogen management. Over the years, policy instruments have been employed to improve the management of agricultural inputs and resources. USDA conservation programs rely primarily on subsidies for management practices and education. USDA also employs compliance mechanisms to protect wetlands and highly erodible soils. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is using regulations to address nutrient management on certain confi ned animal feeding operations. A few States have used nitrogen fertilizer taxes to raise revenue for nutrient management programs. Such policy approaches may have a role to play in increasing the number of crop acres that meet the three nitrogen management criteria described earlier."}, {"section_title": "Provide Information (Education)", "text": "A lack of knowledge about their performance may be preventing farmers from using the most effi cient nutrient management practices. Education is used to provide producers with information on how to farm more effi ciently. Its success depends on alternative practices being more profi table to farmers than current practices (Ribaudo and Horan, 1999). Two practices that can lead to more effi cient fertilizer use are soil testing and tissue testing. These tests provide information that reduces some of the uncertainty surrounding nutrient availability and enables producers to apply fertilizer at rates more consistent with plant needs and high nitrogen use effi ciency. ERS research supports previous fi ndings that nitrogen testing is having the desired effect on nitrogen application rates for certain nitrogen users. Data from the 2001 and 2005 ARMS indicate that about 21 percent of corn farmers used a soil or tissue test as a basis for their level of nitrogen application (table 4.1). Farmers who used commercial nitrogen followed the recommendations closely. In our sample, their mean application rate of nitrogen was 136 lbs per acre, and the mean recommended rate based on a nitrogen soil test was 137 lbs per acre (table 4.2). Compliance with the soil test, however, was much worse for farmers who used both manure and commercial fertilizer. In their case, the recommended nitrogen application rate was 123 pounds per acre. And while farmers applied only 85 pounds per acre of commercial fertilizer, total nitrogen application rates were 175 pounds per acre when manure was added. We compared nitrogen application rates of those farmers who use soil N and tissue tests with those who do not using regression analysis that accounts for a number of production, land, and operator characteristics (see app. 3). Findings show that soil nitrogen testing has a statistically signifi cant impact on nitrogen application rates. In the case of farmers who use commercial nitrogen exclusively, those who tested the soil applied 73.9 pounds per acre less than those who did not, all else equal. Other studies have found soil tests to be of similar effectiveness (Wu and Babcock, 1998;Musser et al., 1995). An information-based approach can meet nitrogen effi ciency goals only if the information provided leads to increased profi ts for farmers (Ribaudo and Horan, 1999). As long as there are expectations that more effi cient nitrogen management leads to increased risk or higher costs, then nitrogen management goals are unlikely to be met with information alone. However, information has proven valuable in support of other policy goals. Education can reduce the cost of adopting nitrogen BMPs required by regulation or funded through fi nancial incentives. For example, Bosch et al. (1995) found that education affected the outcomes associated with a regulation requiring nitrogen testing in Nebraska. Producers did not use the information provided by testing unless they received education assistance."}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives", "text": "Financial assistance is an important tool used in many USDA conservation programs to promote the adoption of BMPs. Program effectiveness depends on how farmers respond to the incentive being offered. When a farmer accepts a payment in return for adopting a management practice, he or she is signaling that the payment at least represents the economic cost of implementing the practice, sometimes referred to as the willingness-to-accept. Generally, only the producer knows the true cost. This makes it diffi cult for program managers to fi nd the minimum payment rate that entices enough producers into the program to achieve the particular environmental goal at least cost. USDA's NRCS supports management practices that specifi cally address fertilizer application rate, timing, or method in their standards. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is the largest USDA program that provides producers with technical and fi nancial assistance for implementing and managing BMPs on working farmland. Management practices supported by EQIP that can infl uence nitrogen use effi ciency include nutrient management and waste utilization (for manure). Implementing a nutrient management plan directly affects measures of stewardship. Nutrient management planning addresses the amount, source, placement, form, and timing of the application of plant nutrients and soil amendments (USDA, NRCS, 2006). Further, the practice requires the application rate be based on an assessment of plant-available nitrogen developed through Land Grant University soil and tissue tests or recognized industry practices. Waste utilization guidelines specify that rates of application must be compatible with the soil's ability to absorb and hold the waste, and methods of incorporation are prescribed for liquid manure forms to prevent nutrients from rising to the surface. Data from EQIP contracts in force for year 2008 show that participating farmers accepted an average payment of $8.88 per acre for adopting nutrient management (table 4.3). A higher per acre payment induced farmers to adopt a waste utilization practice ($14.75). Relatively few corn farm operations have livestock or a direct source of manure (organic) fertilizer, and, as reported later, the practice can be more costly to farmers than using commercial (inorganic) fertilizer. A focus on the Corn Belt reveals variation in the accepted payments for the two practices (table 4.3). The variation may stem from cost differences within the region that are driven by local conditions, which, in turn, infl uence the State-level payment rate for the practice. To examine how management practices can affect a farm's cost of operations, we estimate a cost function using a generalized linear regression model estimated with 2001 ARMS data (see app. 4). 3 Model results show that several conservation practices have  little effect, on average, on the cost of operation relative to other methods of management. For example, the difference in operation costs for farms using nutrient management and for farms not using these practices is not statistically signifi cant. Based on results from our cost analysis, we also fi nd that using manure as a nitrogen source costs roughly $26.84 more per acre than using only commercial fertilizer. However, we observe a national average per acre EQIP payment for the waste utilization of $14.75, and only two States in the Corn Belt (Illinois and Indiana) have payment levels that approach the estimated cost fi gure. The results suggest that the EQIP rate is insuffi cient to entice farmers who are not using manure to begin doing so in an environmentally sensitive manner. However, farms with livestock or poultry need to dispose of the waste. Therefore, rather than be a practice by choice, waste utilization may be a practice that complements the necessary disposal of manure, and a payment that covers increased production costs may not be a necessary condition for the willingness to adopt the practice. Not all farmers require a cost share to adopt conservation practices. Cooper and Keim (1996) use farmer surveys to conclude that 12 to 20 percent of farmers may be willing to adopt practices such as split fertilizer applications and nutrient testing without fi nancial assistance but do not do so because they lack information or are uncertain about the practices' economic performance. However, they also fi nd that the adoption rate would not increase beyond 30 percent unless subsidy rates were substantially increased. A farmer's perception of the effectiveness of a practice can also infl uence the decision to adopt. Evidence from Lichtenberg and Lessley (1992) suggests that farmers may need more than a cost share to overcome perceptions of conservation practices and the state of environmental quality off-site. In some cases, farmers are willing to adopt conservation practices that reduce profi ts if they believe that others will benefi t from the subsequent change in environmental quality (Bishop et al., 2010;Chouinard et al., 2008). For example, based on survey responses from the State of Washington, Chouinard et al. (2008) conclude that farmers would be willing to forgo up to $4.52 (median value estimate) in per acre annual profi ts to implement soilconserving stewardship practices. The scope of a program's coverage is an important consideration for policymakers and program managers evaluating the adequacy of the fi nancial incentives offered to program participants. In 2008, the fi nancial incentives from EQIP encouraged farmers to enroll 4 million acres in the program's nutrient management practice. However, because participation in the program is voluntary, it is not known if the cropland most in need of treatment was enrolled. We can use the data from EQIP and table 3.3 to estimate the cost to improve nitrogen use effi ciency on those acres needing additional treatment. About 35 percent of all crop acres meet all three criteria, which means that over 108 million acres of cropland are not using nitrogen BMPs. Applying the average payment rate for nutrient management ($8.88 per acre) to all acres needing improved management implies annual EQIP payments of $959 million. However, the fi ndings from Cooper and Keim (1996) suggest that higher rates would be needed to entice a sizable percentage of farmers to voluntarily enroll in a program. Assuming a payment rate 50 percent higher results in program expenditures of $1.4 billion. This is roughly the current annual budget for EQIP. Given the potential cost of treating the entire 108 million acres of cropland not using nitrogen BMPs, which groups might be most important to address fi rst? We previously reported that manure users generally apply much more total nitrogen to the fi eld than farmers who exclusively apply commercial nitrogen. Providing fi nancial assistance for nutrient management on the 7.7 million acres that received manure and failed to meet the rate criterion would cost between $68.4 and $103 million per year."}, {"section_title": "Off-Site Filtering for Reducing Nitrogen Losses From Fields", "text": "Similar to its efforts aimed at improving nitrogen use effi ciency on working lands, the Government can provide fi nancial incentives for installing management practices that capture nitrogen after it leaves a fi eld, primarily nitrogen in water. This analysis estimates and evaluates the cost effectiveness of two such measures, wetlands restoration and vegetative fi lter strips (VFS), assuming that funding is targeted to areas where nitrogen removal is likely to be most effective."}, {"section_title": "The Costs of Nitrogen Capture by Restoring Wetlands", "text": "Our analysis of wetlands restoration focuses on the Glaciated Interior Plains (GIP), where models of wetlands nitrogen removal have been developed. The GIP includes major parts or all of Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana-major corn-producing States. This area is also an important source of nitrogen that reaches the Gulf of Mexico and contributes to the hypoxic zone (Goolsby et al., 2001;Robertson et al., 2009). Wetlands in other parts of the United States can also reduce nitrogen loadings. But, because of regional differences in ecosystems, we do not extrapolate our fi ndings to other areas. Wetlands once made up a large portion of land on the GIP (fi g. 4.1). Water tables were lowered to facilitate crop production by installing underground tile and surface drainage systems. Such drainage systems become conduits for the rapid movement of nitrate from fi elds to water resources. The costs of creating wetlands vary widely as do nitrogen removal rates on wetlands. Costs are driven by the cost of the land and the cost of restoring wetland ecosystems. Nitrogen removal depends on the rate of nitrogen infl ow, nitrogen concentration, seasonal variations in fl ow, wetland size, and other factors. We use the USDA Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) contract data for the GIP to estimate multinomial land and restoration cost functions (see app. 5). With these functions, we generate county-level cost estimates throughout the GIP. The objectives of the WRP are to enhance, restore, and preserve wetlands. As of October 1, 2009, the WRP enrolled 2.18 million acres, with wetlands in every State. Along with the land and restoration cost variables, the WRP contract data contain information on the size and the county location of each contract. The land (wetland easement) cost variable represents the difference between the agricultural value of the land and the value of the land with a wetland easement. The easement requires that the landowner maintain the health of the ecosystem. Data for other variables in our analysis come from the NASS agricultural census. Across the counties within the GIP, wetland easement costs range from $1,490 to $3,030 per acre, as generated by our estimated land cost function. Expected wetland restoration costs range from $506 to $602 per acre. Annualizing over perpetuity with a discount rate of 5 percent, we estimate that the median annual expected cost of restoring and preserving wetlands is $153 per acre per year (table 4.4). Because marginal costs are less than average costs, one can expect average per acre Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from the 1997 National Resources Inventory. costs to be lower for larger wetlands and potentially more cost effective as a nitrogen fi lter, all other things being equal. Wetlands remove most nitrogen through denitrifi cation (Crumpton et al., 2008), which converts nitrate to nitrous oxide (N 2 O). However, there is a general belief, supported by a limited number of studies, that N 2 O releases are a very small portion of nitrogen removal, even in wetlands with elevated nitrogen loadings (EPA, 2010b). Researchers estimate that N 2 O accounts for between 0.13 and 0.30 percent of total annual wetland nitrogen loss (Hernandez and Crumpton et al., 2008). The reported rates of N 2 O releases by wetlands are similar to estimated releases on cropland in the Midwest, so restoring wetlands is likely to have no net effect on N 2 O emissions (Crumpton et al., 2008). Crumpton et al. estimate that nitrogen loads to surface water could be reduced by 30 percent (~500 million pounds) in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins with the addition of 0.5 to 1.1 million acres of strategically placed wetlands, for an average per acre reduction of 450 to 1,000 pounds per year. These removal rates assume an optimal placement of the restored wetlands-areas with a high water fl ow with high nitrogen concentrations. Mitch et al. (1999) estimate that wetlands in the Midwest remove 142 to 214 pounds per acre of nitrogen per year. The researchers assume that the wetlands are well constructed and placed, but their estimates are based on a wide range of nitrogen concentrations and hydrologic fl ows. Each study includes multiple wetlands and a variety of fl ow conditions and nitrogen concentrations. The unit cost of nitrogen removal by wetlands, based on nitrogen removal rates of 450 to 1,000 pounds per acre per year reported by Crumpton et al. (2008), is $0.08 to $0.34 per pound (table 4.4). Based on the removal rates of 142 to 214 pounds per acre per year reported by Mitch et al. (1999), unit cost ranges from $0.71 to $1.08 per pound."}, {"section_title": "The Costs of Nitrogen Capture Using Vegetative Filter Strips", "text": "Vegetative fi lter strips present another off-fi eld option for capturing and removing nitrogen from runoff and subsurface waters. The cost of a VFS tends to be lower than the cost of wetlands restoration. The VFS cost has two components: the opportunity cost of holding the land out of production and the cost of establishing cover (e.g., grasses, trees, or both). Cropland rental rates are an economic measure of the opportunity cost of taking cropland out of production. We assume that average cropland rental rates are equal to the economic return to land converted to a VFS. Based on the distribution of corn acreage reported in the 2005 ARMS and county-level rental data provided by NASS, the annual opportunity cost of converting corn cropland into a VFS is estimated at $94 per acre. We assume that the cost of establishing vegetative cover is about the same as establishing cover on land retired in USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). CRP data do not specify cost by cover type, but data do provide insights on the range of costs. Across the 25 th , 50 th , and 75 th percentiles, cover costs are $16, $35, and $60 per acre. Because establishing forest cover is more costly, the lower percentile costs likely refl ect the cost of establishing grasses. The cover cost is a one-time investment. We annualized this cost by assuming that it is to last for the foreseeable future and a 5-percent discount rate. Together, the land and cover cost would total approximately $95 to $97 per acre per year, with the higher estimate more likely representative of the use of forest cover. Mitch et al. (1999) tabulate several plot studies with a focus on the quantity of nitrogen removed across varying sizes of fi lter strips and levels of nitrogen infl ow. They apply their fi ndings to nitrogen runoff rates typical of those in corn-producing areas and estimate that properly designed forested riparian VFS will remove approximately 17.8 to 53.0 pounds of nitrogen per acre with strips ranging in width from 10 to 50 feet (Mitch et al., 1999, pg. 47). At an annual nitrogen runoff removal rate of 17.8 to 53.0 lbs per acre and a forested VFS cost of $97 per acre, VFS nitrogen removal costs are estimated to range from $1.83 to $5.45 per pound of nitrogen. The cost estimate is a weighted average across the corn-producing areas of the GIP. Results suggest that, within the GIP, wetlands can be much more cost effective at removing nitrogen than VFS, primarily because of their substantial nitrogen removal rates. Within corn-producing regions, especially in areas where fi elds are tile drained, water moves quickly through and passes under root zones, rendering VFS ineffective. On the other hand, VFS can be established in many landscape settings where wetlands cannot. The wide range in nitrogen removal rates by wetlands refl ects, at least in part, the advantage of targeting wetlands to areas where they are likely to be more effective-areas where wetlands capture large quantities of water with high nitrogen concentration rates. But even the low nitrogen removal rates of 142 to 214 pounds per acre reported by Mitch et al. are three or more times the removal rates of VFS. Additionally, the rich wetland ecosystems have the potential of providing a greater array of environmental services than those delivered by VFS."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Emissions Trading Programs", "text": "An alternative to publicly provided fi nancial incentives for adoption of conservation practices is for private markets to pay farmers to adopt management practices that produce ecosystem services valued by consumers (the public). Emissions trading uses markets to effi ciently achieve pollution targets. The development of markets for ecosystem services is characterized by uncertainties about whether viable markets for public goods can exist, but the EPA and USDA are promoting emissions trading markets for water quality and greenhouse gases as a way of reducing the costs of meeting environmental goals. Agriculture has a potential role to play in both markets."}, {"section_title": "Water Quality Trading Program", "text": "The promise of emissions trading, along with the real-world success of air emissions trading, has led to the creation of water quality trading markets in a number of impaired watersheds. Under the Clean Water Act, point sources (e.g., factories, sewage treatment plants) were initially regulated through a nontradable permit system. A permit specifi es how much of a particular pollutant the permit holder can discharge. Traditionally, permit holders were required to meet their permit obligations through their own effl uent reductions. EPA policy guidelines on water quality trading now allow point sources to meet their Water Quality Based Effl uent Limitation requirements through discharge reductions from other sources under certain conditions, including agricultural nonpoint sources (EPA, 2004). The guidelines encourage States to consider agriculture as a source of offsets in water quality trading programs, and a number of States are either implementing or considering water quality trading programs that allow point/nonpoint source trading. There appears to be many opportunities for point/nonpoint trading programs to be established. Almost 7,000 water bodies impaired by nutrients (pollutants produced by both point and nonpoint sources) have been listed under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (EPA, 2009). To date, over 4,000 Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) have been developed to address 5,000 of these impaired waters. The presence of a TMDL is a basic requirement for a trading program, as it creates the demand for credits (Ribaudo et al., 2008). Agriculture is a major source of nutrients in most of the watersheds containing impaired waters (Ribaudo and Nickerson, 2009). The marginal cost of reducing nitrogen loss from cropland is generally less than the marginal cost of reducing nitrogen discharges from point sources (primarily sewage treatment plants) (Camacho, 1992;Shortle, 1990). Forty water quality trading programs have been created in the United States since 1990 (Breetz et al., 2004). Fifteen include production agriculture as a potential source of credits for regulated point sources, most often for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). However, point/nonpoint trading has not been very successful, at least in terms of the participation of potential traders and the number of trades between regulated sources and farms (Breetz et al., 2004). Regulators designing point/nonpoint trading markets must contend with uncertainty about sources and levels of emissions, the effectiveness of best management practices, the water quality impacts of emissions from different sources, and farmer willingness to participate in a market driven by regulation (on point sources) (Hoag and Hughes-Popp, 1997;King, 2005;King and Kuch, 2003;Woodward and Kaiser, 2002;Ribaudo and Gottlieb, 2011;Horan and Shortle, 2011). The failure of current programs to perform as advertised can largely be attributed to failures of market design and program rules to adequately address these issues, or the high transactions from incorporating uncertainties into market design. One issue that has particular relevance for addressing nitrogen pollution is the baseline used for calculating credits. The EPA defi nes a baseline participation requirement as the pollutant control requirements that apply to a seller in the absence of trading (EPA, 2007). EPA suggests that practices generally accepted as good management defi ne a baseline for agriculture, under an assumption that all farms would eventually adopt these practices voluntarily. Some practices that States have used in trading programs to defi ne a baseline include the use of fi lter strips or a nutrient management plan (Wisconsin DNR, 2002;Pennsylvania DEP, 2008). However, the issue is that our survey data indicate that very few crop acres would meet these baseline requirements as the percentages of cropland with fi lter strips or nutrient management plans are only 6.8 and 5.0, respectively, meaning that most crop acres would not be able to participate in a trading program until the baseline requirements were met. If the incentives from a credit market are insuffi cient to induce farms that have not already voluntarily adopted the minimum set of practices to incur the cost of meeting the baseline requirement, then these farms will continue unabated discharge. This entry cost would therefore potentially limit participation and adversely affect the efficiency of the market (Ribaudo and Gottlieb, 2011;Ghosh et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Greenhouse Gas Mitigation", "text": "Another emissions market that might infl uence nitrogen management decisions in agriculture is an offset market for mitigating emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas (310 times the global warming potential of CO 2 over 100 years) and can be emitted from fi elds receiving nitrogen fertilizer (see chapter 2). A trading program for nitrous oxide emissions would have many of the same design and implementation issues of point/nonpoint trading for water quality. One would expect that the use of models for predicting reductions, based on fi eld and management characteristics, would fi gure heavily in any trading program. We use NLEAP results and ARMS cost data to determine changes farmers might make given the opportunity to participate in an offset market for N 2 O reductions by producing credits and likely environmental tradeoffs. These analyses were conducted across different management scenarios and general hydrologic soils (e.g., well-drained soils with a large leaching potential versus poorly drained soils with a low leaching potential) from selected counties in Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas. For each soil, we identifi ed the changes a farmer might make in nitrogen management practices to produce N 2 O reductions (offset credits) at the lowest cost while meeting a requirement that total nitrogen emissions (the sum of NO 3 , N 2 O, and NH 3 losses) not increase. In other words, trading rules do not permit a management change that reduces N 2 O but increases total nitrogen emissions. Changes in cost are defi ned as the difference in average variable costs (chemicals, fuel, and electricity) and value of lost production (changes in yields). We assumed farmers would maintain the same basic cropping system and alter timing, method, or application rate only. A description of NLEAP and the cost model and assumptions are presented in appendices 2 and 3. Table 4.5 summarizes the nitrogen management systems that farmers evaluated in the model would adopt to produce credits at the lowest cost, given baseline practices. For example, of the 64 farm types not meeting any of the criteria prior to a market (\"None\" in the baseline criteria column), 17 would reduce the application rate to the criterion rate, 10 would reduce the rate and inject/incorporate nitrogen, 1 would reduce the rate and apply nitrogen in the spring, and 36 would adopt all three management choices. The choice depends on the soil type, climate, rotation, tillage practice, and nitrogen source. The results highlight the importance of meeting the application rate criterion for reducing both N 2 O and total reactive nitrogen. For all farms not meeting the rate criterion, reducing application rate either alone or in combination with another practices was selected to reduce N 2 O. Method or timing was never the sole practice adopted by farms to reduce N 2 O emissions. Model results also indicate that 148 of the 512 farming systems will not be able to reduce N 2 O emissions by meeting the rate, timing, or method criteria. For example, none of the 64 farm types meeting the rate and method criteria at the start of a market can reduce N 2 O emissions by also meeting the timing criterion. Table 4.6 provides more detail for one soil in Ohio. It shows the reduction in N 2 O that would be generated for each decision a farmer in a particular baseline situation could make and credit revenue earned assuming a carbon price of $15 per ton of CO 2 equivalent. 4 The range of N 2 O reductions presented here is similar to that found for the other soils modeled with NLEAP. 4 Based on EPA analysis of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, H.R. 2454.   Note: N = nitrogen. CC = continuous corn, CS = corn-soybeans, CON = conventional till, NT = no-till, MF = manure+inorganic N, OF = inorganic N, M = N incorporate d/injected, R = N rate is less than 40% more than N removed at harvest, T = spring application. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service. Even though our sample of cropping conditions is very small, we believe we can still make some inferences from the results. We found that if the baseline system is not meeting the application rate criterion, application rate will be reduced to produce credits, either alone or in combination with timing or method; reducing the application rate is generally the most cost-effective means of reducing N 2 O emissions. Adopting method and/ or timing BMPs alone cannot reduce N 2 O emissions or can do so only by reducing overall nitrogen use effi ciency, which is not permitted under our simulated market rules. Farms already meeting both the rate and method criteria will only be able to reduce N 2 O emissions by reducing their application rate below recommended rates. The NLEAP modeling indicates only small reductions in N 2 O when the application rate is reduced to a level below the criterion rate. This is consistent with fi eld studies that indicate a nonlinear relationship between excessive N application rates and N 2 O emissions (Jarecki et al., 2009;McSwiney and Robertson, 2005). Excessive nitrogen inputs accelerate the rate of N 2 O emissions. For example, reducing the application rate from the criterion rate to 25 percent below the recommended rate only reduces N 2 O by between .2 and 1.3 pounds per acre for the Class A (well-drained) soil in Ohio, depending on the cropping system. Assuming a credit rate of $15 per ton of CO 2 equivalent, this translates into a payment of between $0.46 and $3.02 per acre. These rates are insuffi cient to cover the 10-percent reduction in corn yields that we assume would occur for such a reduction in N (Bock and Hergert, 1991). Even for smaller N reductions, it is unlikely that revenue from GHG credits would be suffi cient to cover the increased risk from cutting N application rates to something close to plant uptake. However, higher offset prices could increase the incentive to cut application rates to reduce N 2 O emissions, even when yields might be affected. When we apply these results to the survey results summarized in table 3.3, we conclude that farmers with treated corn acres meeting the rate, timing, and method criteria or the rate and method criteria (about 42 percent of all corn acres) will not likely participate in a GHG cap-and-trade program that would allow farmers to sell offsets from N 2 O reductions. These farms cannot make any management changes to reduce N 2 O without reducing overall nitrogen use effi ciency, which would violate a market rule. The treatment of such \"good stewards\" in an emissions trading program is an important policy issue. The potential revenue from GHG credits produced by reducing N 2 O appears to be quite small. In the Ohio example, only a few situations are capable of producing credit revenue of over $5 per acre, assuming a credit price of $15 per ton of CO 2 equivalent (and the results are similar for the other States studied). These rates are less than the rates farmers could receive for nutrient management from EQIP, which is a measure of farmers' willingness to accept payment for the practice (table 4.3). In general, farms overapplying nitrogen and broadcasting fertilizer can produce the largest reductions in N 2 O. However, only 8.3 percent of corn acres fall in this category (see table 3.3). While we found that changes in operating costs after changing management are near 0 or even negative in most cases, we did not consider short-term adjustment costs, changes in risk, or the administrative costs of participating in an offset program. In the case of farms that also have animals, we did not consider the cost of moving manure produced on the farm to more acres (to reduce application rates), or of moving excess manure off the farm entirely (Ribaudo et al., 2003)-all of which would reduce farmer participation below the rates estimated here. One issue of concern is the possibility that reducing N 2 O could increase nitrate losses to water. As described in chapters 2 and 3, changes in management could change conditions in the soil so that gaseous forms, such as N 2 O, are converted to highly soluble nitrate (NO 3 ). It might seem that allowing only management changes that do not increase total losses of nitrogen would prevent this, but we found otherwise. In 25 percent of the cases where management changes were made to reduce N 2 O, NO 3 losses to water increased, even though total nitrogen emissions fell. This occurred almost exclusively when the rate criterion was already being met and injection/incorporation was adopted as an additional practice. While overall N 2 O and total nitrogen losses decreased, water quality worsened. Such an outcome would be a concern in regions trying to address water quality problems, such as the Corn Belt, where corn production is the major source of nitrogen contributing to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Including these factors in the analysis would likely further reduce the net value to society of producing GHG offsets through N 2 O emissions reductions."}, {"section_title": "Response to Price Changes, and What It Means for an Input Tax", "text": "Input prices can infl uence a farmer's planning. For example, low fertilizer prices can lead to \"insurance\" applications of fertilizer that reduce overall nitrogen use effi ciency. Increases in fertilizer prices relative to other input and output prices through the use of an input tax would likely decrease fertilizer use and reduce the number of acres receiving excessive rates. Several States have levied fertilizer taxes in the past but only at low levels that had little impact on use. The effectiveness of an input tax in reducing excessive application rates would depend largely on the responsiveness of farmers to changes in nitrogen prices. Data from studies spanning several decades reveal that responses to a price change (known as the price elasticity) can vary widely, depending on the data source and time period covered, the type of econometric methods used to analyze the data, the number of crops covered, and the type of crop to which the nitrogen fertilizer is applied. While no true consensus exists, study fi ndings generally show that nitrogen demand was relatively insensitive to price. Burrell (1989) provides a convenient summary of 14 empirical demand studies through the 1980s. Of those 14 studies, only 4 report elasticities greater than unity. Estimates were generally in the range of -0.20 to -0.70, implying that a 10-percent increase in the price of fertilizer reduced demand by 2 to 7 percent (see, for example, Griliches (1958); Carman (1979); Ray (1982); and Shumway (1983)). Denbaly and Vroomen (1993) use cointegrated and error-corrected models with time series data from 1964 to 1989 to estimate short-and longrun Marshallian elasticities. They report a shortrun Marshallian elasticity of -0.21 and a longrun elasticity of -0.41. Hansen (2004) estimates nitrogen fertilizer demand of farmers in Denmark using an unbalanced panel spanning 1982-91. He concludes that nitrogen demand is similarly insensitive to own-price, with an elasticity of -0.45. Not all studies found the price elasticity of demand for nitrogen fertilizer to be inelastic. Carman (1979) examines the nitrogen demand in 11 Western States and fi nds signifi cant State-level variation in elasticities. Statistically signifi cant elasticity estimates in Carman's study range from -0.55 to as large as -1.84. His study shows that demand can vary signifi cantly even within a region. Roberts and Heady (1982) also use annual time-series data from the United States, but spanning 1952-76, and fi nd price elastic demand for nitrogen applied to corn (-1.148). In a study of aggregate fertilizer, Weaver (1983) investigates the demand in just two States, North Dakota and South Dakota, and fi nds fertilizer demand to be highly elastic, ranging from -1.377 to -2.156. Some evidence suggests that farmers may be becoming more sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices. Using 2001 and 2005 fi eld-level data from ARMS, we estimate a demand elasticity of nitrogen fertilizer of -1.38 for farmers who applied commercial nitrogen fertilizer to corn (app. 3). Stated another way, if the price of nitrogen fertilizer was to rise by 10 percent, farmers would reduce the amount applied by 13.8 percent. At the mean amount of commercial nitrogen, such a change in price would result in a decrease of 18.2 lbs of fertilizer per acre. 5 Manure can also be used as a source of nitrogen nutrients, usually in conjunction with commercial nitrogen fertilizer. In the ARMS sample, slightly less than a quarter of corn farmers applied manure to the fi eld, and all of them did so in conjunction with commercial nitrogen. When the analysis is expanded to include these farmers, we fi nd a demand elasticity of -0.67; that is, for every 10-percent increase in the price of commercial nitrogen fertilizer, farmers reduce their use of nitrogen (organic and inorganic) by about 7 percent. The results are driven by farmers who use both manure and commercial nitrogen; we fi nd they are relatively less sensitive to the price of commercial nitrogen fertilizer than farmers who apply commercial nitrogen exclusively, which is consistent with the idea that manure and inorganic forms of nutrients are imperfect substitutes. Also, manure management decisions on farms with animals might be driven less by nitrogen prices than by the need to dispose of manure (Ribaudo et al., 2003). The estimates of price elasticity can be used to provide a rough estimate of the tax that would be needed to reduce application rates so that more acres meet the rate criterion. Figure 4.2 displays the distribution of the nitrogen application rates that represent the criterion rate described in chapter 3. In the case of farmers who used commercial nitrogen exclusively, we have estimated an average criterion application rate at 170.8 lbs per acre for production year 2005. Thirty-fi ve percent of the 76 million corn acres treated with nitrogen exceeded their criterion rate (26.7 million acres), and farmers who exceeded their criterion rate had a mean rate of 185.5 pounds per acre. From the distribution depicted in fi gure 4.3, the concentration of farmers near zero indicates that most of the farmers who applied nitrogen at rates above the criterion rate are situated near the threshold (also seen in   fact, 50 percent of farmers who exceeded the criterion rate exceeded it by 19 pounds per acre or less. Table 4.7 provides a summary of the input tax needed to reduce the excess use of nitrogen by farmers who exceed their criterion rate, evaluated for differing levels of demand elasticity. From the table it is evident that the more elastic the demand, the less the price must change to reduce excessive application rates. A highly inelastic demand for nitrogen, for example -0.20, would require more than a 50-percent increase in the price to achieve a 50-percent reduction in excess application. To achieve a reduction of 75 percent, the price would have to more than double. Based on our estimated elasticity of -1.38, if an input tax increased the price of nitrogen by 7.4 percent, 50 percent (about 13.4 million acres) of the 26.7 million overtreated acres would then meet the rate criterion. Seventy-fi ve percent of heavy nitrogen users exceed the criterion rate by 43.4 pounds per acre or less; thus, raising the price of nitrogen by 17 percent would reduce cropland exceeding the criterion rate by 20 million acres. For context, consider the mean price of nitrogen fertilizer in 2005 was 33 cents per pound; therefore, a 7.4-percent change in the price equates to slightly more than 2.4 cents per pound, and a 17-percent change equates to less than 6 cents per lb. As a policy instrument, a tax on inputs has some desirable characteristics as well as some well-known drawbacks. First, a tax gives farmers fl exibility in how they reduce emissions. Farmers face heterogeneous costs, and a tax enables farmers to tailor their input responses (nitrogen abatement) accordingly (Ribaudo et al., 1999). In the case of nitrogen, an input tax directly affects the farmer's decision that has the largest impact on nitrogen losses to the environment. It would also encourage a farmer to manage nitrogen more carefully, which could lead to appropriate timing and method of application. A tax does not require monitoring or enforcement, unlike a regulation. It can also be easily adjusted if policy goals are not met or exceeded. Another advantage of an input tax is that it raises revenue while reducing application rates. The revenue could be used to reduce the tax burden of crop producers through a system of lump-sum rebates to those producers who improve nitrogen use effi ciency. Revenue can also be used to remedy damages caused by nitrogen losses. A tax on an input also has drawbacks. An input tax makes no distinction between whether fertilizer is in excess or not. A tax on nitrogen may also encourage increased use of untaxed manure, resulting in no discernable change in nitrogen applications where manure is readily available. The question of who bears the burden of the tax, also known as the incidence, can have notable distributional consequences. Statutorily, the incidence of the tax could fall on the wholesaler or retailer of nitrogen fertilizer; however, the true, or economic, incidence is likely to be shared with the farmer. How much so is an empirical question that relies on the relative sensitivity of farmers to the price change, as well as the elasticity of the supply of nitrogen: the more sensitive a farmer's demand for nitrogen is, the less of a burden he or she will bear, all else equal. The supply of nitrogen fertilizer is projected to more than meet the demand over the near term; therefore, the standard assumption is that the burden of the excise tax would be considerably shifted to the consumer of the good, in this case the farmer (Fullerton and Metcalf, 2002;FAO, 2008). While corn production in the United States accounts for 39 percent of the world's total corn production, the ability of U.S. farmers to pass along the cost of the tax will depend on the relative elasticities of supply and demand for corn (USDA, FSA, 2011). While a factor tax on nitrogen may improve welfare from society's point of view, ultimately, the tax will change the functional distribution of income. The distributional impact may be mitigated if revenues raised by the tax are returned to the farmer in some manner, for example, by supporting other conservation activities."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Compliance", "text": "Compliance provisions require farmers to meet some minimum standard of environmental protection on environmentally sensitive land as a condition for eligibility for many Federal farm program benefi ts, including conservation and commodity program payments. Under current compliance requirements, farm program eligibility could be denied to producers who: \u2022 Fail to implement and maintain an NRCS-approved soil conservation system on highly erodible land (HEL) (Conservation compliance) \u2022 Convert HEL grasslands to crop production without applying an approved soil conservation system (Sodbuster) \u2022 Convert a wetland to crop production (Swampbuster) Evidence suggests that the current compliance provisions have contributed to a reduction in soil erosion and discouraged the conversions of noncropped HEL land and wetlands to cropland (Claassen et al., 2004). A possible extension of the provisions could include nutrient management. Crop producers are a major source of nitrogen. Assessments of the potential effi cacy of compliance must consider two key questions: \u2022 To what extent do crop producers who have the greatest potential for reducing nitrogen emissions also participate in farm programs? \u2022 Are Government payments to these producers large enough to encourage broad adoption of practices that improve nitrogen use effi ciency and reduce nitrogen emissions? Claassen et al. (2004) estimate that 75 percent or more of cropland acres with medium, high, or very high potential for nitrogen leaching or runoff are located on farms that receive Government payments. We used data from the 2005 ARMS corn survey to estimate Government payments received by corn producers. 6 We looked at all treated corn acres, as compliance provides an incentive both for farmers already practicing good nitrogen management and willing to continue and for farmers not using nitrogen BMPs and willing to adopt them. Over 97 percent of corn acres receive Government payments, averaging $51.39 per acre. This average is higher than our estimated costs of improving NUE or of adopting NRCS practices. Eighty-eight percent of treated corn acres receive Government payments in excess of $27 per acre per year, which is more than the average EQIP payments for nutrient management or waste use. (Note that for corn acres that are highly erodible and subject to conservation compliance, it is the sum of erosion control and nitrogen management costs that would be considered by the farmer.) A drawback of compliance is that the strength of the incentive is dependent on the level of Government payments. Current events present a good example. Direct Government payments have been reduced by about 50 percent between 2005 and 2009 due to a number of factors, including higher crop prices and smaller disaster payments (USDA, ERS, 2010). Assuming that average per acre payments to corn producers were reduced by the same percentage, the average estimated cost of the more expensive nitrogen management practices, such as waste utilization, would be greater than the program benefi t. Compliance would not be an effective tool in this case. The point is that program payments can vary greatly, making compliance an unpredictable policy instrument."}, {"section_title": "Regulation", "text": "Another policy approach for improving NUE is to legally require farms to adopt and implement particular management practices. Such an approach would be a major change in the way most of agriculture is treated under current environmental laws. With few exceptions, agricultural operations are exempt from regulation under the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. A number of arguments have been used as justifi cation. First, agriculture is so diverse across the United States that the conventional regulatory approach of applying uniform standards is impractical (Nanda, 2006). Second, due to the nonpoint nature of agricultural pollution, individual polluters cannot be identifi ed except at great cost. Regulation can conceptually be placed on a continuum between performance standards and design standards (Ribaudo et al., 1999). Performance standards directly regulate emissions. Design standards dictate how producers manage their operations, including practices that should not be used and/or BMPs that should be adopted. Because of the nonpoint nature of agricultural pollution, design standards are the only practical approach for addressing nitrogen losses. One approach would be to require that farmers adopt specifi c BMPs to improve their nitrogen use effi ciency. Generally, a practice-based regulation is ineffi cient because it requires producers to adopt the same practice, whether it is appropriate for their particular farm or not. It may be more effective to defi ne BMPs locally so as to allow fl exibility and to account for agriculture's heterogeneous nature. For example, a nitrogen management plan is a fl exible practice that is based on a farmer's resources and cropping system. However, farmers may fail to implement the plan properly. The effectiveness of a regulation therefore requires effective inspection and enforcement by a resource management agency. Implementation costs would likely be high. Several States, such as Nebraska and Maryland, have required farmers in particularly vulnerable areas to adopt specifi c nutrient management practices to protect ground or surface water (Ribaudo, 2009). One of the few segments of the agricultural sector that has been subjected to regulatory environmental measures at the national level is animal feeding operations, refl ecting heightened concern over pollution from animal waste from the largest operations (USDA-EPA, 1999). Manure is estimated to be a source of about 17 percent of nitrogen entering U.S. waters (Smith et al., 1997). Clean Water Act regulations now require that animal feeding operations designated as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs, and needing a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (those CAFOs that discharge or propose to discharge to surface waters), develop and implement a nutrient management plan to cover fi elds that receive manure. Such a plan, which would meet NRCS standards, sets a limit on the amount of nutrients that can be applied per acre of land and specifi es erosion control measures to prevent the loss of sediment and nutrients. Also under the new regulations, CAFOs that are not required to have an NPDES permit but that wish to claim the storm water exemption (the provision in the Clean Water Act that exempts fi eld practices from requiring a discharge permit) for runoff from fi elds must develop and implement a nutrient management plan to demonstrate that due care is being taken to minimize polluted runoff from fi elds receiving manure. If a waterway becomes polluted with animal waste from fi eld runoff and a CAFO does not have an approved nutrient management plan, this would be a violation of the Clean Water Act. This approach sets a level of expected stewardship, namely the implementation of a nutrient management plan. Requiring not just CAFOs but all animal feeding operations to adopt nutrient management plans would be costly. ERS estimates that reductions in net returns in the livestock and poultry sector would be about $1.4 billion per year, and national economic welfare for producers and consumers would decline almost $2 billion per year (Ribaudo et al., 2003). The benefi t would be improved air and water quality. Targeting the regulatory approach only to those operations most susceptible to pollution problems would lower the overall costs. Chapter 5"}, {"section_title": "Implications for Nitrogen Management Policies", "text": "Nitrogen is critical for producing abundant food and generating high net returns to producers, yet it has wide-ranging environmental impacts across land, water, and the atmosphere. More careful management that reduces environmental losses would address a number of environmental issues, such as hypoxia in coastal estuaries and bays, the potential for global warming, and nutrient enrichment of terrestrial ecosystems. Policymakers have a number of tools at their disposal, each with its own strengths and weaknesses (table 5.1). No one policy approach can be considered \"best,\" and a concerted effort to address the Nation's nitrogen problems will likely require a solution comprising a mix of policies. Our analysis provides some guidance on determining which sectors of agriculture are most in need of improved management, what are the potential pitfalls, and how might the different policies be orchestrated in an overall policy framework."}, {"section_title": "Reducing Application Rates as a Priority Policy Goal", "text": "Reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers appears to be the most effective BMP for reducing the emission of nitrogen into the environment. Based on the literature, and confi rmed by our NLEAP modeling, reducing application rates is the one BMP that reduces all forms of reactive nitrogen, even when the timing and method of application are not ideal. Improving timing or method of application alone could increase one type of reactive nitrogen (transmitted to the atmosphere, groundwater, or surface water) while still reducing total nitrogen emissions. Reducing the application rate is therefore conducive to an ecosystem approach to management that provides protection to all ecosystem services and functions. Improving rate, timing, and method of nitrogen application would produce the greatest environmental benefi ts. Reducing application rates that are agronomically excessive may increase the perceived risk of reduced yields. Farmers often use nitrogen fertilizer to manage the downside risk due to uncertain weather and soil nitrogen. Research on how farmers view risk and how they might respond to an incentive payment for reducing application rates, coupled with the use of a risk management instrument, could result in the development of a more effective approach for reducing nitrogen in the environment. Revenue or yield insurance policies could be offered to protect the income of farmers who adopt conservation measures that improve nitrogen use effi ciency but may decrease yields because of nitrogen insuffi ciency stemming from unfavorable weather conditions. Findings from other studies suggest that insurance will likely lead to reductions in nitrogen fertilizer applications, but by how much is uncertain (see Babcock and Hennessy, 1996;Mishra et al., 2005;Smith and Goodwin, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Corn Is the Most Important Crop for Addressing Nitrogen-Related Environmental Issues", "text": "Corn is the most widely planted crop in the United States and the most intensive user of nitrogen. In 2006, corn accounted for an estimated 65 percent of the total quantity of nitrogen applied to major U.S. fi eld crops. Corn also accounted for half of all nitrogen-treated crop acres that were not meeting the rate, timing, or method of application criteria used in this analysis to defi ne acceptable nitrogen management. Land used to grow corn accounted for the largest share of treated acres that had tile drainage in 2006. Although tile drains improve yields, they also increase the amount of nitrogen that is lost to surface water. Tiled corn cropland not meeting all three nitrogen management criteria would be a prime target for policies for improving nitrogen use effi ciency. In addition, recent demand pressures due to the biofuels mandate, as well as increasing international demand for feed grains, suggests that corn acreage and the intensity of corn production are likely to increase. Together, these factors increase the importance of raising the NUE in corn production in the United States, especially on farms that raise livestock and apply manure to their fi elds."}, {"section_title": "Which Policy Is Best?", "text": "This analysis provides some guidance on how different policies might be orchestrated in an overall policy framework. The current approach to improving nutrient management on cropland has relied primarily on fi nancial incentives and information. While years of fi nancial and technical assistance have resulted in some progress, operators of over 65 percent of U.S. cropland are still not implementing nitrogen BMPs. Higher payment rates would encourage more producers to adopt practices that improve nitrogen use efficiency, but the cost to taxpayers may be substantial. The level of fi nancial assistance that would be required to entice all farmers with cropland acres needing improved management to enroll in a program would likely consume most of the budget for EQIP. While nitrogen management is an important conservation goal, EQIP and other USDA conservation programs address a host of other issues. Any elevation of nitrogen management as a priority for EQIP may result in fewer resources for other conservation issues. Emissions markets, such as those for water quality or greenhouse gases, could be a source of fi nancial support for improving nitrogen use efficiency. Markets for agricultural offsets shift the fi nancial burden away from taxpayers to regulated sectors of the economy. While emissions markets are receiving much interest in efforts to improve water quality and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, their role in improving nutrient management on all acres needing improvement is probably limited. Emissions markets generally target particular geographic areas or particular practices, potentially limiting the number of acres that might be affected. Market rules designed to ensure the \"additionality\" of offsets by setting baselines consistent with a high level of management may limit participation by farmers not using BMPs, even though a market would benefi t by their participation. In addition, the nonpoint source nature of nitrogen emissions from agriculture greatly complicates the design of markets and raises transactions costs. If voluntary fi nancial assistance programs or emissions markets are limited in their ability to improve nitrogen management across all crop acres, what other approaches might achieve improved nitrogen use effi ciency at least cost? The alternative approaches all result in increased costs for farmers. In theory, cost-effective policy instruments target the problem, are fl exible, are easy to implement (low transactions costs), and limit costs to both farmers and Government. A tax on nitrogen fertilizer would provide an incentive to all users to manage commercial nitrogen more carefully. If farmers are responsive to price, then this instrument may be an effective means of reducing nitrogen losses. Our assessment of farmer price responsiveness indicates that a relatively low tax may pay high environmental dividends. However, if farmers are as unresponsive to nitrogen prices as generally reported in the literature, a substantially higher tax would be necessary to obtain the same environmental benefi ts. The burden on farmers would be substantial. Another drawback of an input tax is that a tax would also be paid on applications that are not excessive. A tax only on emissions would be far more effi cient, but such a tax is not practical since emissions cannot be observed or easily measured. Finally, some means of addressing the application of animal waste would have to be found, as a fertilizer tax would likely encourage the substitution of manure for commercial nitrogen. A nutrient management plan is an inherently fl exible management practice that is strongly encouraged by USDA but only required for animal feeding operations that are designated as CAFOs. Requiring that all users of nitrogen inputs (commercial and manure) develop and implement a nutrient management plan would be a major change in the way the environmental performance of agriculture is managed. The costs to crop farmers of implementing a nutrient management plan may not be high, except for those managing large amounts of manure produced on the farm. However, many aspects of a nutrient management plan, such as application rate, are diffi cult to observe, making enforcement diffi cult and costly. Enforcement costs could also be high for a compliance approach to getting farmers to adopt nutrient management plans. The effectiveness of compliance would depend on the level of program payments received by farmers and a coincidence of the incentive with those crop acres most in need of improved management. A large share of crop acres in need of treatment receives high levels of Government program payments. While the incentive level in 2005 was quite high, program payments have declined in recent years as crop prices have risen. Continued high prices and general concerns about Federal budget outlays may limit the strength of a compliance-type policy instrument unless it is linked to a broader suite of payments than current compliance requirements. Improving nitrogen use effi ciency reduces the amount of emissions from cropland but does not eliminate them. In areas where even small levels of emissions could cause environmental problems, offsite fi ltering could supplement onfi eld management. The Government currently provides fi nancial incentives for creating and preserving wetlands and vegetative fi lter strips. Though funds are not allocated solely for nitrogen capture and removal, there may be reasons to do so. An economic comparison of the two types of fi lters suggests that wetlands can be much more cost effective at removing nitrogen than fi lter strips. While our analysis found that the cost of establishing a wetland is greater than the cost of establishing fi lter strips, annual nitrogen removal rates are several times greater for wetlands. Filter strips may also be rendered ineffective where tile drains are present, while wetlands can be strategically positioned in the landscape to fi lter drainage coming from tiled fi elds. Wetlands also produce a number of other desirable ecosystem services, such as wildlife habitat. Filter strips, however, can be established in landscape settings where wetlands cannot. The choice will depend on geography, soil, and hydrologic conditions. While one single policy instrument does not emerge as a clearly superior approach to improving NUE across all cropland, a role can be seen for each. Financial assistance could be made available to those producers wanting to voluntarily improve nutrient management and to install vegetative fi lters or resore wetlands. Since commodity programs are important to farmers, compliance can provide some incentive for those receiving program payments. The level of incentive may vary from year to year, but it may be effective for some farmers. Finally, in regions where nitrogen-related pollution is of particular concern, such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed and the watersheds contributing nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico, a regulatory backstop could be a measure of last resort for those unwilling to voluntarily adopt nitrogen BMPs."}, {"section_title": "Information Supports All Policies", "text": "Information about the environmental and economic performance of improved nitrogen management practices supports all policies aimed at improving NUE. Reliable, timely information on soil and plant nitrogen reduces one source of uncertainty that tends to encourage overapplication of nitrogen.

Information from testing can be incorporated into an adaptive management framework, where a farmer evaluates his practices from the previous year (or even at the start of the current growing season) to assess what options may be available to improve nutrient management while sustaining yields and reducing nutrient losses to the environment. So, whether farmers are considering best nitrogen management practices due to regulation, taxes, or fi nancial incentives, information on how to conduct and interpret nitrogen tests and how to successfully implement new practices can reduce the overall costs and increase adoption rates."}, {"section_title": "Potential Tradeoffs Are an Important Consideration", "text": "Reactive nitrogen is easily converted to forms that are readily transported by hydrologic and atmospheric processes.

Even when total nitrogen emissions are reduced by a policy, emissions of one or more nitrogen compounds might increase and degrade environmental quality. This effect was predicted in the case of the market for nitrous oxide offsets-farmers reduced total emissions but increased nitrogen losses to water. These tradeoffs often depend on soils and cropping practices, so it is diffi cult to develop general \"rules of thumb,\" other than recommending that a holistic approach to management that considers potential environmental tradeoffs be adopted.

The only case in which the desirable theoretical properties of inputs are not met is in the case of capital, which, in variable cost function setting, should be negative. The explanation resides in overcapitalization of water utilities-a phenomenon widely observed for regulated utility fi rms of all kinds. Homogeneity in the cost function is imposed by dividing both input prices and variable costs by price of chemicals. Consistent with the literature on undesirable outputs, the presence of an undesirable byproduct in a production process, in this case nitrogen, implies a higher cost to the utility which it then abates either to meet regulation 6 or more generally to reduce risk to customers. As to the exogenous effects, network density has a negative effect on variable costs as expected. Also, larger systems have higher variable costs. Public utilities have higher variable costs than investor-owned utilities. This makes sense from the perspective that public fi rms may have agency and control problems relative to investor-owned enterprises. Operations that have only a distribution function have lower variable costs than those that have both waste water and distribution. All locations have higher variable costs relative to New England. "}, {"section_title": "Derivation of shadow cost of nitrogen abatement and discussion", "text": "(3) The shadow marginal cost of nitrogen abatement is derived in equation 3by taking the derivative of (2), estimated variable cost, which in turn was derived by taking the exponential of (1). From equation 3, various additional derivations can be made: shadow marginal cost by millions gallons, , and SVC per millions of gallons of water produced ( The results from the above derivations were used to estimate nitrogen removal costs by system size (app. table 1.2). effi ciency of commercial systems is a valid approach, as reported by Shaffer and Delgado (2001), Delgado (2001), and Delgado et al. (2000;. Since the USDA Census of Agriculture does not report yields by soil type, we assumed that yields for the soil types tested were similar. However, corn yield can vary among soil type, with lower yields in the sandier, less fertile soils that have higher nitrate leaching potential than those fi ner soils with lower leaching potential (Khosla et al., 2002;Bausch and Delgado, 2003;. Nonetheless, we still believe that assuming average yields for a 24-year period being evaluated is a valid approach to assessing the trends and effects of management practices on these different soil types and produces results that are in agreement with average measured values (Delgado et al., 2001;2010a). If additional site-specifi c fi eld information for a given farm is needed, spatial soil maps for the given farm can be downloaded from USDA NRCS websites, and evaluations using farmers' inputs can be conducted. Nitrogen Inputs and Uptake: For nitrogen rates, we used the recommended best management practices for site-specifi c State and/or soil as described by Espinoza and Ross (2008) for Arkansas; Alley et al. (2009) for Virginia; Beegle and Durst (2003) for Pennsylvania;and Vitosh et al. (1995) for Ohio. We calculated the recommended nitrogen (N) rate per bushel of corn derived from each State's recommended BMPs (Espinoza and Ross, 2008;Alley et al., 2009;Beegle and Durst, 2003;Vitosh et al., 1995). A summary of the nitrogen inputs simulated is presented in appendix table 2.1. Since nitrogen fertilizer inputs were calculated based on yield, the no-till systems received lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs than the conventional systems. However, since a similar rate of uptake per unit of bushel was used for both systems, the removal of nitrogen in harvested grain from the no-till system was also lower than the removal of nitrogen in the grain from the higher yield conventional system. Total nitrogen uptake by the plant was calculated. Initial surface residue cover was simulated at 100, 90, 40, and 30 percent for no-till corn-corn, no-till corn-soybeans, conventional corn-corn, and conventional corn-soybeans, respectively. For the manure system, manure was applied every 2 years. For the corncorn rotation, manure was applied in the fi rst year, and only fertilizer was applied in the second year. The manure rate was calculated for each system to match the fertilizer rate. However, since manures will have a large fraction of organic nitrogen that is not immediately available (Davis et al., 2002;Eghball et al., 2002), an additional 50 percent of the recommended rate was added as inorganic nitrogen fertilizer. In other words, the total nitrogen input during the fi rst year of corn-corn rotation was 150 percent of the total application rate of the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer scenario (app. table 2.1). The corn-corn rotation did not receive any manure application in the second year, and the corn received the same rate of nitrogen fertilizer as in the nitrogenfertilizer-only scenario. Thus, over the 2-year period, the manure scenario for corn-corn received an average of 25 percent more nitrogen input per year. The same relationships apply to the excessive and defi cit nitrogen scenarios (app. table 2.1). For the corn-soybean rotation, there was no application of nitrogen fertilizer or manure for any of the scenarios during the soybean year (app. table 2.1). Additionally, for this rotation, the nitrogen cycling from the leguminous soybean crop was credited, as is recommended for each State, so the calculated nitrogen inputs for the corn in the corn-soybean rotation was lower than in the corn-corn system. The excessive nitrogen fertilizer scenarios received 75 percent higher nitrogen inputs than the State-recommended rate. For the defi cit nitrogen application scenarios, nitrogen inputs were applied at a 25-percent lower nitrogen rate than the best management practice scenario (app. table 2.1)."}, {"section_title": "Soil Type Physical and Chemical Information:", "text": "For each State, the county's soil chemical and physical information averages for the selected soils were downloaded. To evaluate all of the management scenarios described above, we selected a soil with a higher leaching potential (Hydrology A or B) and a soil with a lower leaching potential (Hydrology C or D). Long-Term Weather: Long-term USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service weather databases for each county were used to conduct the 24-year assessment as described by Delgado et al. (2008bDelgado et al. ( , 2010a nitrogen trading tool evaluations. Other Best Management Practices Tested: For all the scenarios described above, we evaluated the method of application. The best management practice for method of application was incorporation of nitrogen fertilizer and/ or manure. Surface application without incorporation was found to be a poor management practice. We also evaluated time of application. The best management practice for time of application was application of manure and/ or nitrogen fertilizer before planting, closer to the time of higher demand by the crop. The poor management scenario was application of manure and/or fertilizer the previous fall, when the nitrogen is more susceptible to losses. Long-Term Evaluations: All these scenarios were evaluated over the long term. To conduct the long-term evaluations, we used a 24-year period using long-term weather data for the given county. Similar to what was done with the nitrogen trading tool, the fi rst 12 years were used to run the model, and years 13 to 24 were used to evaluate the effect of management practices on nitrogen use effi ciency and on reactive losses to the environment (Delgado et al., 2008b(Delgado et al., , 2010a."}, {"section_title": "Estimating Changes in Nitrogen Fertilizer Application Rate", "text": "This appendix describes the econometric model used to estimate changes in nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rate. We estimate nitrogen application rates using an instrumental variables (IV) approach to overcome identifi cation issues presented by farmer heterogeneity and endogenous soil N-testing. Price plays an important role in the nitrogen management decision, and the recent price growth of nitrogen has implications for nitrogen management behavior and by extension, nitrogen use effi ciency (NUE). Notably, we instrument for nitrogen price using a cross-section of data by exploiting exogenous spatial variation between domestic ammonia production plants and cornfi eld locations. Research using observational data presents econometric challenges, and this is particularly true for research examining the effect of potentially endogenous variables on a study population. For example, when estimating the effect of N-soil tests on application rate, researchers do not know why two observationally identical farmers make different choices about testing the soil. The underlying problem is the concern that unobserved farmer characteristics are responsible for determining whether the farmer conducts a test. For example, a farmer who tests the soil regularly may also have unobserved preferences for land stewardship. If differences beyond observed fi eld, farm operation, and operator characteristics play a role in determining who conducts the test and how the test is used, then the test may be endogenous to the amount applied. Nitrogen price also presents a challenge in a sample of microdata. Prices are likely to embody an error-in-variables problem because in the case of ARMS, they were created as a share variable that represents the nitrogen fertilizer's relative size of the total expenditures for all fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). To see how this effects the estimation of nitrogen demand, consider that we observe nitrogen price as a function of the true, unobserved price plus a disturbance term, v. (1) Price Observed Price True* v = + . Because the observed price on the left-hand side of equation 1is a function of true price and v, an ordinary least squares (OLS) model of nitrogen demand estimated with the observed price will include v and will cause the estimate to be biased and inconsistent. Specifi cally, in the classic errors-invariables example, the coeffi cient in an OLS model will be biased toward zero. 7 Prices farmers pay may also change with their level of demand. For example, if farmers receive quantity discounts when purchasing nitrogen fertilizer and their application rate is correlated with total nitrogen demand, then failing to account for this also results in bias. To overcome the problem of mismeasured nitrogen prices and endogenous soil testing, we employ an IV approach, which allows for the development of consistent and unbiased estimates. In the case of endogenous N-soil testing, we fi nd a set of instruments that are correlated with N-soil testing but uncorrelated with disturbance process: average annual soil percolation and average annual precipitation. Because percolation facilitates nutrient leaching (Williams and Kissell, 1991), we expect the greater soil percolation to increase uncertainty about available nutrients, and, therefore, encourage soil testing. Higher precipitation generally reduces the ability to conduct soil test, therefore we expect annual average precipitation to be negatively related to N-soil test. We identify the nitrogen own-price effect on demand using three sources of exogenous variation: distance between the fi eld and domestic ammonia fertilizer production; production capacity of nearby ammonia plants; and distance from the fi eld to New Orleans, LA, site of the majority of international ammonia importation. 8 Ammonia is increasingly being imported by the United States, and a majority of shipments enter from the Gulf of Mexico, and specifi cally, New Orleans; therefore, we also include a distance-to-New Orleans measure. These variables are useful instruments because the distance between the fi eld and production capacity are arguably uncorrelated with the behavior of the farmer or the placement of the fi eld; 9 therefore, the instruments allow one to capture the exogenous variation in price and use it to estimate application rates."}, {"section_title": "Instrumental variables model", "text": "We use an IV model specifi ed with two endogenous variables to estimate a partial-equilibrium static demand model derived from profi t maximization theory. The model assumes producers make immediate adjustments to quantity demanded in response to changes in price, and that prices are known at the time of production planning. These assumptions are reasonable given the ability of farmers to enter into contracts that establish price for delivered corn and inputs to production, such as forward or marketing contracts, and other hedging instruments. Further, production technology is assumed known and fi xed. Since only two time periods separated by 4 years are used, technology is unlikely to change. The most likely technological change is that of seed technology-the use of biotech (Bt) corn; however, the model specifi cation controls for this. In 2001, 20 percent of corn acres were planted with Bt corn; in 2005, the amount was slightly greater than 30 percent. We characterize the problem posed to the farmer as one of profi t maximization with uncertainty, as evidenced by the nitrogen overtreatment, but the decision of the farmer could also be conceptualized as a utility maximization problem. In this case, the farmer chooses a level of output that maximizes the farmer's initial wealth plus expected profi t from the operation. Under utility maximization, a farmer considers not only expected profi t but moments of the profi t distribution as well, and deviations from the recommended level of nitrogen then depend on the farmer's level of risk aversion. Evidence from fi eld trial suggests that risk-neutral farmers would be willing to overapply nitrogen to increase profi ts during a year of \"good\" growing conditions (Rajsic et al., 2009). On the other hand, risk-averse farmers will reduce their nitrogen rate to reduce profi t variance. In practice, our empirical results are not dependent on the conceptual framework; in both cases, nitrogen prices enter the profi t function, and the identifi cation strategy would not change. Rather, the level of risk aversion primarily drives the differences. Some 8 Ammonia production data come from the North American Fertilizer Capacity Annual Reports issued by the International Fertilizer Development Center. We calculate the distances from the fi eld to ammonia production using the location of the plant and geocoded corn fi eld samples from USDA's 2001 and 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey. It should be noted that these are sample points, and they do not represent all corn production in the United States; however, when we estimate a model of nitrogen demand, the sample points are weighted to refl ect total U.S. corn production. 9 To test that the instruments are uncorrelated with the residual component in the second stage of the IV model, or exogenous to the rate of fertilizer application, we test overidentifi cation restrictions using a Sargan test. The test statistic is computed as n\u00d7R 2 and has a \u03c7 2 (k-r) distribution, where k is the number of instruments and r is the number of endogenous variables. The results of the test are presented in the results table. research, however, suggests that risk-averse farmers are more responsive to price because of profi t risk (Just, 1975;Roosen and Hennessy 2003;Rajsic et al., 2009), and, if farmers are on average risk averse, our elasticity estimates will represent an upper bound. Equation 2is the outcome equation where Y represents the log transformed per acre rate of nitrogen applied to the fi eld of farm i in USDA production region r at time t. Endogenous variables, T and P , are estimated N-soil testing probability and nitrogen price from equations (3) and (4). The set of excluded instruments for N-soil test are represented by Z T , and the excluded instruments used to estimate nitrogen price are represented by Z P . The vector X is a set of independent variables that includes characteristics of the operator, farm operation, and the fi eld; the disturbance term is represented by \u03b5. A case can be made that countrywide trends over time affect the use of nitrogen. Perhaps in response to outreach efforts to reduce fertilizer runoff due to overuse, for example, environmental awareness campaigns that communicate the benefi ts of reduced nitrogen in the environment, attitudes about nitrogen rates have changed. We control for trends in nitrogen use that change over time with a time effect term, \u03c5 t . As well, use of nitrogen across production USDA-defi ned regions may also affect application rates, therefore we control for region-specifi c factors with a fi xed-effect term, \u03c6 r ."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data are cross-sectional and come from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). ARMS comprises responses to a series of interviews with farm operators designed to solicit information about production practices, costs of production, business fi nances, and operator and household characteristics. Commodity specifi c surveys are fi elded on a rotating basis, usually every 5 to 8 years. We focus on corn production because of its intense use of nitrogen, for which ARMS last fi elded surveys in 2001 and 2005. We use data from two components of ARMS. The fi rst component is the Corn Production Practices and Costs Report, which surveys the farm enterprise's costs of production and a host of production practices at the fi eld level. The second component is the Corn Costs and Returns Report, which collects indepth fi nancial information concerning the farm business and the household of the operator. The two components can be linked together to provide a complete view of the farm operation from the farm's representative fi eld to its fi nancial statement, and we restrict the sample to farmers who completed both surveys. As covariates, we include the farmer's age, education, and income earned from work off the farm. We account for land quality and tenancy issues by including the per acre annual value of production, the per acre value of the land, and acres owned by the operator. We also control for environmental characteristics of the fi eld, for example, whether any part of the fi eld is a classifi ed as a wetland. The presence of livestock and a nutrient management plan on the farm may indicate a greater reliance on manure, driven often by the need to dispose of manure. We account for these with dummy variables as well. The nutrient requirements of a current corn crop are also based, in part, on the plant-available nutrients existing in the soil, and past cropping practice can infl uence these nutrients. Therefore, we use a dummy variable to control for crop rotation pattern of 3-year straight corn rotation. The timing and method of application may also be important determinants of application rate. A spring application is better timed to meet the plant's need for nutrients and reduces the risk of loss due to environmental factors relative to a fall or winter application. On the other hand, farmers may opt to apply nitrogen in the fall, when there are fewer time demands and prices are often lower. In such a case, a nitrogen inhibitor is often used to further slow the nitrifi cation process, though average annual nitrate losses can still be 50 percent higher under fall application than under spring application (Randall and Mulla, 2001). To counter this, in many cases, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the soil because low temperatures at this time of year slow the conversion of ammonia to ammonium and nitrate, reducing the loss of nitrogen. We control for the method of application with a dummy variable indicating whether the nutrient was incorporated or injected into the soil. Technology and other management practices thought to affect nitrogen rate are captured by explanatory variables indicating the use of fi eld irrigation and biotech (Bt) corn seed. Irrigation is an important component in nitrogen management. Irrigation may be a necessary practice due to the climate, or it may be another way of more precisely controlling growing conditions. If water and nitrogen are complementary inputs, the presence of irrigation should increase the rate of nitrogen application. The use of biotech seed is driven by the associated cost reductions from the technology's herbicide, pest, or fungus resistance. We also include a dummy variable representing whether the corn crop was grown for silage or corn. A full list of covariates and summary statistics is presented in appendix table 3.1."}, {"section_title": "Outcome Measures", "text": "We estimate the application rate for four different permutations of nitrogen fertilizer use. First, we estimate commercial nitrogen use by farmers who exclusively apply commercial nitrogen-a group that accounts for a 78 percent of the farmers in our sample. We also examine the rate of total commercial nitrogen use by all farmers, regardless of whether they used commercial nitrogen exclusively or in conjunction with manure. The third measure examines the sensitivity of commercial nitrogen use by farmers who use manure in conjunction with commercial nitrogen-a group that employs an imperfect substitute for commercial nitrogen. These farmers make up a minority of the sample, 22 percent. Finally, we examine the effect of our explanatory variables on total nitrogen application rate, which includes commercial nitrogen and manure. It should be noted that all of the farmers in the sample reported at least some use of commercial nitrogen fertilizer.

Differences in application rates between the spring/inject and the other management combinations were positive (as expected) and signifi cant at the 1-percent level for farms using only commercial fertilizer (app. table 4.2). The difference in nitrogen fertilizer costs was subtracted from the cost difference derived from the cost model, using a nitrogen fertilizer price of $0.30/lb. The cost of adopting appropriate method (assuming no change in fertilizer application rate) was estimated to be $7.35/acre, appropriate timing was $3.01 per acre, and both appropriate method and timing were $1.86/acre. For farms using manure, we assumed no differences in costs. procedure to estimate the restoration cost function. The Tobit procedure simultaneously estimates the probability that the dependent variable is nonzero and its expected size. Variables of the estimated model are statistically signifi cant and have the expected sign. The estimated model is used to generate expected restoration costs. By dividing our model's county-level expected cost estimates by contract size, we generate estimates of expected average restoration costs. Costs range from $506 to $602 per acre across counties. Differentiating the estimated Tobit model with respect to the contract acres generates the expected marginal restoration cost function (MC R ): MC R = (Z)*(0.888*Rent -2.12* AgrValue*Rent + 167) where (Z) is the cumulative probability function and Z is the estimated Tobit equation. For average-sized contracts, estimates of MC R across counties of the GIP range from $101 to $210 per acre."}]
