[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Income and wealth distributions are common topics within agricultural policy debates regarding the economic well-being of agricultural producers. The central themes of these discussions include how income or wealth inequality is distributed across regions as well as the factors that affect these variations. Inequality of these distributions is traditionally estimated using the Gini coefficient (Pyatt, 1980;Ahearn, Johnson, Strickland, 1985;Katchova, 2008;Morehart, 2007' Mishra, El-Osta, Gillespie, 2009). The Gini coefficient allows us to evaluate the relationship between the cumulative percent of the total income of one producer to the cumulative percent of the population when individuals are ranked in ascending order of income. Much of the earlier work estimated the Gini coefficients across all farms. Production practices within an agricultural industry vary substantially, therefore it is beneficial to complete this analysis on one industry. Specifically, we estimate the Gini coefficient for the dairy industry. The dairy industry was chosen for a few reasons. First, dairy is one of the few agricultural production systems that have a continuous cash flow over the calendar year unlike other livestock operations that have \"lumpy\" cash flows (e.g. cow-calf operations, grains, etc.). Second, production characteristics vary substantially across the U.S. This provides a unique variability within the data that is not present within other sectors. Finally, the dairy industry has a strong presence in the organic sector. This study seeks to understand if there are differences in dairy farm income and wealth across regions and over time. This study also considers factors that affect dairy income inequality."}, {"section_title": "Gini Coefficient Estimation", "text": "The standard Gini coefficient does not account for negative incomes (or wealth), which occurs with some regularity on farm households. The adjusted Gini coefficient developed by Chen, Tsaur, and Rhai (1982) normalizes the standard Gini coefficient to consider negative income levels while normalizing the upper bound to unit one. Following Chen, Tsaur, and Rhai (1982) the adjusted Gini coefficient was calculated as:  The number of dairy farms in the sample is represented by n while y j is the weighted income share of the jth farm. Y j is the household's total income where Y 1 \u2264 \u2026..\u2264Y n with some Y j less than zero, m is determined where the sum of incomes over the first m farms is negative and the first m +1 household is positive. Adjusted-Gini coefficient estimates are bounded by 0 and 1. The adjusted Gini coefficient has two major limitations: (1) it does not allow for the decomposition of income and (2) the marginal effects must be estimated via simulation. Since, neither of these items are needed for this analysis, we will proceed using the adjusted Gini coefficient as presented in equation 1 Table 1. As the Gini-coefficient approaches 1, the income inequality is the greatest. Based on the sample-level results estimated, there is a large income inequality across regions for net farm income. Net worth inequality is present as well with values ranging from 0.28 to 0.62, with the least amount of income inequality present in the Corn Belt. The results from this analysis validate our hypothesis that income and wealth inequality is present across the U.S. The next stage of this analysis is to determine the factors that affect income and wealth accumulation on dairy farms across the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Quantile Regression", "text": "Quantile regression analysis and data from the Agricultural Resource Management Surveys (ARMS) have been used to examine several topics in agricultural economics including the effects of change in somatic cell count standards (Dong, and Hennessy, 2012), farmland values (Uematsu, Khanal, and Mishra, 2013), and marketing strategies (Uematsu, and Mishra, 2011;Hennings, and Katchova, 2005). Previous work has also focused on assets for farm and nonfarm households (Katchova, 2007), self-employed incomes (Willis et al., 2012), and operator household income (El-Osta, H., 2011). Quantile regressions are used in this research to test how different characteristics affect income and wealth distributions of dairy farms in several U.S. regions. Quantile regressions were designed to determine what happens to the \u03c4 th quantile of a distribution when a conditional variable (x) changes. A linear quantile regression is similar to an OLS regression in that both models minimize weighted sums of residuals, but differ in their specification of weighting schemes. Quantile regression minimizes the sum of absolute residuals rather than the sum of squared residuals as in OLS regression. Koenker and Bassett (1978) show that the th regression quantile can be written as: where is a vector of regressors and ( ) is a vector of coefficients. The first quantile is obtained by setting = 0.05 and so on. As one increases from 0 to 1, one traces the entire distribution of y, conditional on x. Standard errors or confidence intervals can be obtainable by bootstrap methods."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Model", "text": "Consider the following empirical specification for factors affecting income and wealth performance: where is a measure of income or wealth accumulation for the ith operation; the intercept is represented as 0 ; FARM is the jth farm characteristic for the ith operation; AGE is the kth age category for the ith operation; REGIONAL is the lth regional indicator for the ith operation; EDUCATION is the mth higher education level achieved indicator for the ith operation; , , , and are parameters to be estimated; and is a white noise error term. Using this empirical model allows us to test if there are farm-level, regional and educational differences in income and wealth levels reported on dairy farms in the U.S. Secondly, equation 3 Regional differences were included in the analysis with seven dummy variables: Northeast, Lake States, Corn Belt, Southeast, Southern Plains, Mountain, and Pacific. The Lake States will be used as the base category for these regional differences due to the fact that all three states in the region are traditional, top milk producing states. Principal farm operator education level has been found to affect net farm income and net worth. Two dummy variables were included to capture two levels of educational achievement: high school education and some college or greater. The educational categories varied between the two sample years (2005 and 2010), but these two groups were the most consistent in both study years. The net farm income and net worth were both standardized by hundredweight (cwt) of milk sold to adjust for size dynamics. Summary statistics of dependent and independent variables are presented in Table 2. These statistics were further expanded to evaluate how income and wealth accumulation changes across years, as presented in Table 3."}, {"section_title": "Quantile Results", "text": "A simultaneous quantile regression was completed as specified in equation 3 Table 4."}, {"section_title": "Net Farm Income per cwt milk sold (NFI)", "text": "Net farm income measures the wealth flow on a farm. In 2005, organic producers had an increased NFI per cwt milk sold compared to conventional (non-organic) dairy producers across all quantiles, expect for the lowest quantile (10%). The number of operators on the farm was a significant and negative predictor of NFI for those operations in the 60 th and greater decile in 2005. Herd size was found to be a significant and positive predictor of NFI for those operations in the 10 th and 30 th deciles; however estimated impacts were small. Surprisingly, an education level of college or greater was a negative predictor of NFI per cwt milk sold for the 30 th and 70 th percentiles. Using the Lake States as the base region, the results demonstrate all regions had a significant and lower NFI per cwt milk sold than the Lake States. In 2010, being an organic producer was a significant predictor of increased NFI per cwt milk sold across all quantiles. The number of operators significantly decreased NFI per cwt milk sold, but only at the 60% decile. Herd size was a significant and positive predictor for the 10 th , 30 th , and 50 th deciles, again with a small impact. Education was found (high school and college graduates) to have a negative impact on NFI for several deciles. Nearly all region effects were negative predictors of NFI, with the exception of dairy farms in the Corn Belt. Dairy farms in the Corn Belt had increased NFI per cwt milk sold for those producers in the 40 th , 50 th , and 80 th deciles. In 2005 and 2010, life cycle effects were not found when measuring income flows via NFI per cwt milk sold. Additionally, ownership and farm tenure were not found to be significant predictors of changes in NFI per cwt milk sold across the U.S. in 2005 or 2010."}, {"section_title": "Net worth per cwt milk sold", "text": "Net worth measures wealth stock of a dairy farm. Ten decile simultaneous OLS regressions were estimated with results presented in Table 5. In 2005, farm tenure had a negative impact on net worth per cwt sold for the 90 th percentile. Over all percentiles, organic producers realized a higher net worth compared to conventional (non-organic) producers. Being organized as a sole proprietorship had a positive effect on net worth per milk sold across most percentiles. As the number of operators increases net worth decreases for dairy producers in the 50 th , 70 th , and 90 th percentiles. Life cycle effects were not present for the top 30% of dairy producers. As the number of milk cows increases in a herd net worth decreases for all percentiles. Again, education (high school and some college) had a negative impact on net worth for several percentiles. Producers in the Lake States region had a higher net worth compared to producers in other U.S. regions. In 2010, farm tenure had a negative impact on net worth per cwt milk sold while being an organic producer has a positive impact. Being organized as a sole proprietorship also had a positive impact. Again, life cycle effects were not present in the top 30% of dairy producers across the U.S. Producers in most percentiles experience a lower net worth as herd size increases. If significant, education (high school and some college) had a negative impact, except producers in the 90 th percentile experienced an increase in net worth. Across all quantiles, producers in the Corn Belt had a higher net worth per cwt milk sold compared to producers in the Lake States. Producers in all other regions had a lower net worth compared to producers in the Lake States."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "As the policy debate regarding income and wealth inequality continues to grow, this type of analysis is important to determine if inequality exists and if it does, to identify the main determinants that affect inequality. This preliminary study determined the adjusted Gini coefficients for dairy farms in 2005 and 2010 at the Dairy Costs and Returns ARMS survey sample level. A quantile regression was then estimated to determine the factors that affect income and wealth differences across the same time-frame at a sample level rather than population. Results of this preliminary analysis demonstrated that organic dairy farmers across all quantiles have a larger NFI and net worth per cwt sold compared to conventional producers. Dairy producers in the Corn Belt tended to have higher NFI per cwt sold than producers in the Lake States; however that did not hold for net worth per cwt sold. Life cycle effects were not found in NFI, but were highly significant and present for net worth. The next step of this analysis is to expand the adjusted-Gini coefficients and quantile regression to the population level using the pre-defined ARMS weights to determine how or if population estimates differ from the sample. Estimating these differences at the sample and population level will help guide further discussion regarding income and wealth inequality as it pertains to regional and life cycle effects.   Table 4.
