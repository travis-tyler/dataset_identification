[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Texas ports are rapidly expanding their operations because of increased tonnage and security requirements. As a result, they are also expanding their real-time data acquisition and display capabilities for navigational operations and homeland security. Ports such as Port Freeport are collaborating with Texas A&M UniversityCorpus Christi to develop, install and operate real-time data systems to deliver needed information to the Pilots and operations personnel. The ports need to significantly expand the scale of real-time programs, in terms of both types of observations (i.e., to include chemical and biological sensors in support of environmental and homeland security requirements) and area covered (i.e., both inshore and offshore). They also need, through cyber-infrastructure, to deliver a visualization of the converged data product to its Pilots and other stakeholders, all in a cost effective program. In collaboration with Port Freeport, we are developing the technology required for such an Integrated Port Navigation and Environmental Data System (IPNEDS). It will deliver not only a greatly expanded suite of physical parameters but also new state-ofthe-art capabilities to measure precisely, in situ and in real-time, standard environmental, chemical and biological parameters. Single-point measurements of currents will be augmented by HF-Radar-measured large spatial grids of coastal surface currents and ADCP-measured, vertical profiles of horizontal current velocity and directional wave parameters (height, period, direction)."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Conrad Blucher Institute for Surveying and Science (CBI) at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and the Texas Engineering Experiment Station-Corpus Christi (TEES-CC) have a variety of research projects, both ongoing and recently concluded, that are converging to an Integrated Port Navigation and Environmental Data System (IPNEDS) concept. These projects provide the essential building blocks for IPNEDS, leading to the opportunity to significantly expand the scale of real-time programs, in terms of port operations, environmental assessment and homeland security requirements. In order to increase the efficacy and cost effectiveness for IPNEDS, we are converging these monitoring and analysis systems. It is probably cost prohibitive to operate separate environmental assessment, homeland security and coastal navigation monitoring systems. A cost effective approach combines these systems to take advantage of redundant sensor arrays, specialized research infrastructure, and common cyber-infrastructure. The development of stakeholder awareness and appreciation of cost savings and increased efficiency of this concept is an important task. We are currently expanding our sensor array to include chemical and biological sensors in support of environmental assessment and homeland security requirements. Our research will increase the area covered both inshore and offshore, and through improved cyber-infrastructure, deliver enhanced visualization of the converged data products to pilots, stakeholders, and the general public, all in a cost effective product that can be transferred to other port facilities and coastal inlets around the country.\nPort Freeport, one of the fastest growing ports on the entire Gulf Coast, ranked as the 16th largest port in the United States in terms of tonnage, is an excellent example of a smaller port that needs to rapidly expand its real-time data acquisition and display capabilities for navigational operations and homeland security. Port Freeport began collaborating in 2000 with CBI to develop, install and operate a realtime data system titled \"FlowInfo.\" It delivers to the Pilots by telephone a set of automated voice observations of current set and drift, wind speed, wind direction and gust, water level, temperature, and salinity for the inshore portion of the Freeport shipping channel. The data are updated every twelve minutes. The Port wants to add similar observations in the offshore approach region, and is interested in the new chemical and biological sensors being integrated into real-time observing systems by CBI for its Environmental Field Facility (EFF) in Corpus Christi Bay."}, {"section_title": "The IPNEDS Concept and Components", "text": "The IPNEDS concept converges a host of real-time physical and environment measuring systems, which CBI is developing under various projects, into a visualization product that would be available on hand-held computers to specific users and the public through various delivery mechanisms. The projects are of specific interest to Port Freeport, which is a collaborator and \"beta tester\" in an operational mode for the components of IPNEDS being developed at CBI's EFF.\nCurrent velocity information for the region just offshore is one of Port Freeport's immediate interests. HF Radar is now used, mainly by researchers, to measure ocean surface currents and waves over thousands of square miles (Kelly et al. 2002 . Results are sometimes provided publicly on the WEB, but not in an industrial format. CBI is developing the dissemination HF-Radar data in real-time in combination with other sensors, i.e., the IPNEDS concept. Figure 1 shows the current and planned HF-Radar coverage in the offshore Galveston/Freeport region. Note the excellent coverage of the shipping channels in the region. Also, CBI has just completed installation of a similar pair of HF Radars that cover the coastal shipping lanes offshore Corpus Christi. Unlike Port Freeport, most Texas ports are located well inside bays. These bays are typically quite shallow, and tides are not the primary factor that determines currents and water level (Cox et al. 2002) . To extend the IPNEDS concept to such ports, CBI has pioneered the use of HF-Radar in shallow bays to measure the primarily wind-driven surface current fields. A current State-sponsored project, \"Extension of HF Radar for Water Currents and Direct Observation of Transport Model Coefficients,\" and a current NSF Major Research Instrumentation project, \"Development of Enhanced Radar Instrumentation for Improved Characterization of Coastal Hydrodynamics\", are increasing the effectiveness of HF-Radar through improved hardware and data processing to yield more complete and accurate observations of surface currents and wave conditions to determining the coefficients for transport and water quality models directly from the radar data (Ojo et al. 2002b ). Port Freeport is also interested in a cost-effective method to obtain vertical profiles of horizontal currents in the region offshore of the jetties of its shipping channel. The instrument of choice for such measurements is the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), which can be mounted a buoy looking down, or bottommounted looking up. The challenge is to get the data to shore in real-time. Traditional approaches are to run a cable to shore or mount the ADCP on a privately operated buoy. Both are costly to install and prone to damage by public and commercial shipping, fishing and trawling. A new approach is to utilize U.S. Coast Guard Navigation buoys. Codiga et al. (in press) have used bottom-mounted ADCPs and acoustic modems to transmit data to USCG buoys, which have radio transmitters to send the data ashore. A second and possibly more cost-effective approach is to mount the ADCP on the side of the USCG buoy in a down-looking configuration. The NOAA PORTS program (Permenter 2003) is investigating this approach (Bosley et al. 2003) . Because of the buoy's large ferrous mass, the heading accuracy of the ADCP is marginal even after extensive compensation of its internal compass. CBI is working with equipment manufacturers to test sensitive external heading sensors that can be mounted on the top of the USCG buoy, with the heading data cabled to the ADCP.\nCorpus Christi Bay serves as an excellent EFF for development of the IPNEDS concept because it is environmentally very active. A Landsat image (Figure  4) , processed in false color to emphasize suspended sediment concentrations in the surface waters, illustrates an example of strong spatial gradients. This image was taken in mid-November 2002 during a significant flood event. The suspended sediment gradients also serve somewhat as a surrogate for gradients of other parameters such as salinity, temperature, eutrophication nutrients and particularly contaminants, which have a strong affinity for particles. To study the dynamics of chemical and biological parameters, CBI is utilizing state-of-the-art sensor suites, reporting in real-time, at fixed sites , and in a geo-referenced, rapid-response survey boat (Ojo et al., 2002a; Ojo et al. 2003) . The locations of the active real-time sites and those under construction are indicated in Figure 4 . Instruments deployed in-situ at the fixed sites and those utilized on the survey vessel include ADCPs, water-quality sensors, oxygen sensors, fluorometers and optical backscatter instruments.\nBoth a chemical nutrient analyser and an in-situ flowcytometer are scheduled to be deployed soon. The latter instrument measures optical properties of individual cells, or particles in general, in a flow stream. Since plankton are naturally in suspension, flow cytometry is a good way of studying natural populations of plankton. All these instruments are targeted at more completely characterizing in real-time, episodic events associated with storms, floods, algal blooms, oil and chemical spills, etc. All have potential applications in the IPNEDS concept. The Corpus Christi Bay EFF serves as a developmental test bed for these instruments before integration into the operational needs of a port such as Port Freeport.\nOther programs that are contributing to the IPNEDS concept include:\n\u2022 A Texas Sea Grant Technology Program project, in collaboration with Falmouth Scientific, Inc. has tested various configurations of a new salinity sensor that addresses the need for long-term, stable, accurate salinity measurements in the coastal ocean, where bio-fouling is a major concern (Fougere et al. 2003) .\n\u2022 Projects for the National Weather Service and Texas Coastal Management Program instrumented existing oil/gas platforms at two sites offshore (5 and 17 miles from the Aransas Pass jetties) with real-time meteorological sensors, current velocity profilers, and directional wave sensors.\n\u2022 Long-term projects operated by CBI and the Division of Nearshore Research (DNR) at TAMU-CC for the Port of Corpus Christi and Port Freeport to provide Real-Time Navigation Systems (RTNS) for navigation and port operations, including current velocity measurements at selected locations in the shipping channels, wind, water level, and salinity measurements, and through computer synthesized voice messages, supply the observations to pilots via dial-up telephone service.\n\u2022 Operation of the Texas Coastal Ocean Observation Network (TCOON), by DNR to provide real-time water level (to same standards as the NOAA National Water Level Observation Network) and meteorological data at more that forty locations along the Texas coast, including bays, estuaries and ocean facing locations (Michaud et al. 1994) . To make its ongoing, real-time, environmental data systems easy to modify and upgrade by all its researchers, CBI has elected to utilize commercially available operating systems and software. Even CBI's low-power, remote, real-time data collector/loggers use the MS Windows 2000 OS, which is particularly useful since manufacturers of most new \"smart\" sensors write their sensor interface programs for the Microsoft OS. The IPNEDS project is proceeding through several stages: 1) development of IPNEDS components in the Corpus Christi EFF; 2) development of web-based, converged data visualizations for existing sensor suites, and optimization for Pocket PC or Palm browsers; 3) testing of IPNEDS at Port Freeport; and 4) intensive user feedback for optimization of a useful product."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The IPNEDS project is focused on bringing our latest technological advances to operational status.
