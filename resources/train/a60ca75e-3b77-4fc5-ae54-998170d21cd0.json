Another important issue in this study is that MSCs are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 due to a lack of ACE2 receptors (Leng et al., 2020) . Similarly, antiinflammatory effects are suggested for MSCs by Saldanha-Araujo et al. Now, several cell therapies are under investigation (Saldanha-Araujo et al., 2020) . However, there several questions about various doses, MSCs sources, and short-term therapy that need to be answered.\nAbout the role of NK cells against COVID-19, one hypothesis is that NK cells have dual effects against SARS-CoV-2: (a) Healthy NK in low-risk individuals could clear virus infection and prevent lung damage. (b) Abnormality of NK cells in high-risk individuals, inhibits viral clearance, induces inflammatory responses, and consequence severe lung injury will happen (i.e., cytokine storm) (Market et al., 2020; Saldanha-Araujo et al., 2020) . It seems that overexpression of the inhibitory NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptors in the exhausted phenotype of NK cells is responsible to suppress T-cell and NK cytotoxic function and result in the progression of proinflammatory events and virus spreading (Masselli et al., 2020) . This hypothesis for the first time has been described by Zheng et al. They observed the NKG2A receptor was upregulated compared with healthy controls, while the ability to produce CD107a, IFN\u03b3, IL-2, granzyme B, and TNF-\u0251 was low in COVID-19 patients, and the percentage of NKG2A + cytotoxic lymphocytes was decreased in recovered patients .\nThere are two ongoing registered clinical trials NCT04280224 and NCT04324996 with NK cells for the treatment of COVID-19 patients ( Table 1 ). The results of these clinical trials will demonstrate the importance of this hypothesis.\nF I G U R E 3 (a) Total studies that have been registered, (b) Classification of drugs that will be used in clinical trials, (c) Hydroxychloroquine regimen A randomized controlled trial NCT04338347 is evaluating CAP-1002 versus placebo for the treatment of severe COVID-19 (Table 1) .\nAllogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CAP-1002) is another strategy in cell therapy. Administration of CAP-1002 to six patients with severe COVID-19 as compassionate therapy indicates that it was safe and effective and improved clinical symptoms. It also reduced inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, IL-6, and Ferritin) in most patients. All patients received conventional therapy against COVID-19 (Singh, Chakravarty, et al., 2020) . Taken together, further studies need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cell therapy in COVID-19 patients."}, {"section_title": "| Plasma therapy", "text": "Convalescent plasma therapy from recovered patients is under investigation. Up to now, some studies have reported that convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody could potentially improve clinical outcomes (Ahn et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zhang, Liu, et al., 2020) . Convalescent plasma has been administered as a last resort to increase the survival rate of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome infection in China . Direct neutralization of virus and decrement of viral load are suggested as possible mechanisms to improve COVID-19 patients' symptoms in all of these published papers. However, other possibilities such as the control of overactivity of the immune system (i.e., cytokine storm) and immunomodulation of hypercoagulable state (i.e., thrombosis) have been discussed by Rojas et al., with two ongoing clinical trials NCT04332835, and NCT04332380 on the convalescent plasma in COVID-19 (Details in supplementary data) (Rojas et al., 2020) .\nHowever, patient and donor conditions such as level of plasma antibodies in the donor, administration time of convalescent plasma (early or late stage of disease), and cotherapy with other treatments such as antivirals, steroids, and so forth should be considered as confounding variables in the studies.

Various studies have been designed inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine which stimulated neutralizing antibodies production, proliferated lymph node T-cell, and produced cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 (Takasuka et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2004) . A protein subunit vaccine has been developed against coronavirus that it contains the synthetic or isolated or recombinant or derived highly antigenic protein-based subunits (Vartak & Sucheck, 2016) . The receptor-binding domain is the most widely used protein segment in the coronavirus vaccine (Badgujar et al., 2020) . Several studies have reported that protein subunit coronavirus vaccine induces the generation of neutralizing antibodies, IgA, IgG, Th-1, and Th-2 type of immunogenic responses (du et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2015) . Another type of vaccine is the vector-based vaccine. Various viral vectors such as adenovirus and lentivirus are used as a delivery tool to produce vector-based vaccines (Bouard et al., 2009 ). In addition, an adenovirus vector-based vaccine is designed against SARS-CoV which induces a specific humoral immunogenic response. S gene/spike proteins are often encoded in the adenovirus vector (Ababneh et al., 2019; Folegatti et al., 2020) . and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 . On the other hand, it seems that some researchers have focused on the nucleic acid vaccine against coronaviruses, and various genes are used to design vaccines including N gene, S gene, S1 gene, and S2 gene. The immune response induced by these vaccines includes the production of IL-2, \u03b3-interferon, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+, neutralizing antibodies, and Th-1/Th-2 responses (Badgujar et al., 2020) .\nTwo registries studies (NCT04336410 and NCT04283461) in our review investigate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of DNA and mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 respectively ( Anti-inflammatory and immune regulation effects infections (Arvin et al., 2020; Wan, Shang, Sun, et al., 2020) .

The IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors in COVID-19 patients in post-tocilizumab therapy. It is suggested that IL-6 levels can discriminate nonsurvivors from survivors in post tocilizumab treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia (Quartuccio et al., 2020) .\nHowever, it should pay attention to this issue that the initial treatment of tocilizumab is associated with elevation of IL-6 levels. This may be due to the block of the IL-6 receptors by tocilizumab.
