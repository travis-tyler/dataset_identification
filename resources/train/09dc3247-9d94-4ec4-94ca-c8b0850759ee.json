[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Linear registration is often the crucial first step for various types of image analysis. Although this is mathematically simple, failure is not uncommon. When investigating the brain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the brain is the target organ for registration but the existence of other tissues, in addition to a variety of fields of view, different brain locations, orientations and anatomical features, poses some serious fundamental challenges. Consequently, a number of different algorithms have been put forward to minimize potential errors. In the present study, we tested a knowledge-based approach that can be combined with any form of registration algorithm. This approach consisted of a library of intermediate images (mediators) with known transformation to the target image. Test images were first registered to all mediators and the best mediator was selected to ensure optimum registration to the target. In order to select the best mediator, we evaluated two similarity criteria: the sum of squared differences and mutual information. This approach was applied to 48 mediators and 96 test images. In order to reduce one of the main drawbacks of the approach, increased computation time, we reduced the size of the library by clustering. Our results indicated clear improvement in registration accuracy."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Image registration is a method used to align multiple images to ensure the spatial correspondence of anatomy across different images. There are two types of registration algorithm, which are based on transformation models: linear and non-linear registration. Linear registration is used widely and predominantly involves six-parametric rigid transformation (rotation and translation on x, y, and z coordinate axes) or 12-parametric affine transformation (rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing on x, y, and z coordinate axes). The linear registration is global in nature while non-linear registration has a higher degree of elasticity which can model local deformation.\nRegistration is an essential step for many types of medical image analysis including voxel-based analysis, change detection, cross-modality image fusion and image segmentation [for reviews see Gholipour et al. (2007) , Despotovic et al. (2015) ]. The success of studies involving image analysis depends heavily upon registration accuracy. In general, linear registration is an essential first step for registration-based analysis, followed by local nonlinear registration. Therefore, the quality of the initial linear registration is often crucial for subsequent steps.\nAlthough it is theoretically simple, in reality, initial linear registration can be one of the most difficult steps to perform. This is because a number of factors exert influence and could lead to the gross failure to align two images; such factors include different tissue locations and orientations, and the area of tissue covered by the images. The initial registration is, to some degree, ill-posed because the computer algorithms used do not have a priori information relating to the locations of the target organs. However, these algorithms are asked to align only the target organs, regardless of whether there are any additional or missing structures in one of the images. For example, if one of the images has a larger field of view and contains additional tissues (for example, data relating to the neck when carrying out brain MRI), then complications may arise when aligning the target organ, particularly when their initial locations and rotations are significantly different when compared between the two images.\nTo minimize this problem, various types of methods have been proposed for the cost functions and optimizers. For example, many intensity-based similarity metrics have been proposed in order to increase the accuracy of alignment, such as mutual information (MI) (Maes et al., 1997) , correlation coefficient (CC) (Kim and Fessler, 2004) , ratio image uniformity (RIU) (Woods et al., 1998a,b) , Kullback-Leibler divergence (Konukoglu et al., 2011) , and residual complexity (RC) (Myronenko and Song, 2010; Zhang et al., 2013) . Different optimization methods, including the gradient descent optimization method (Rueckert et al., 1999; Myronenko and Song, 2010; Qiao et al., 2016) and the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method (Fitzgibbon, 2003; Gaidhane et al., 2012) have become widely used. Iterative methods are also commonly used, in which the degree of freedom for image transformation, smoothing, and downsampling factors are systematically changed (Nestares and Heeger, 2000) . Nonetheless, it is common that alignment failures still occur occasionally. To reduce the chance of failure, certain recommendations have been published for widely used tools. For example, Automated Image Registration (AIR) recommends the manual removal of non-brain tissues (Woods et al., 1998a,b) .\nIn this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach to improve registration accuracy, which can be combined with any form of registration algorithms. A key component of this approach is a collection of MR images, referred to as \"mediator images, \" which serve as intermediates between a template and subject images. These mediator images were pre-processed to identify their transformations into template images (e.g., MNI space) using linear registration facilitated by manually placed landmarks. If the subject image could be accurately registered to one of these mediator images, then a combination of linear transformation from subject image to the mediator image, and pre-determined transformation from the mediator to the template in the MNI space, can be applied for the subject image. In this study, we used affine transformation based on the commonly used AIR package. We evaluated our proposed method against conventional direct registration between the subjects and the template. In addition, we tested a strategy to construct an effective collection of intermediate images."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Template Atlas in the MNI Space A T1-weighted (MPRAGE) image from the JHU-MNI-SS atlas was used as the template image, and was based on data from a single-subject, as described previously (Oishi et al., 2009 ).

"}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION The Role of Linear Registration and Potential Problems", "text": "Linear registration is often the first step for various forms of image analysis and, thus, the quality of subsequent processing steps are heavily influenced by the accuracy of the linear registration step. Although linear registration is a theoretically simple step, it can be associated with a range of practical challenges due to unpredictability in the morphological and spatial variability of test data relative to the template to which the data are registered.\nThere have been numerous algorithms proposed to minimize the risk of failure in this initial alignment process. Probably one of the most widely used approaches is to perform iterations with varying degrees of down-sampling, smoothing factors, and the degree of freedom for the transformation (3-12 modes).\nAs a publicly available resource, the Insight Tool Kit (ITK) has been extensively used in many image analysis tools (Johnson et al., 2018) . Currently, example codes from ITK libraries provide 12 different choices for linear registrations; as the algorithms become more advanced, the number of parameters to optimize also increases. The ITK guidebook reports that there are \"numerous parameters involved in tuning a registration method for a particular application\" and \"it is not uncommon for the registration process to run for several minutes and still produce a useless result\" (Johnson et al., 2018) . Figure 2 shows 96 test images; of these, only 18 test images achieved good alignment (Dice coefficient > 0.85) to the template. This high failure rate (81%) was somewhat exaggerated because of two factors. First, we employed a simple registration algorithm without iterative approaches. Second, there were large geometrical differences between the test data and the template (the MNI coordinate space); the test data were obtained from widely used sagittal protocols, which tend to have much larger fields-of-view than that of the MNI space template. Furthermore, brain positions and orientations were not acquired using consistent criteria in this heterogeneous dataset. Finding an appropriate alignment to the MNI space is a challenging task for automated algorithms. This baseline data is, however, suitable to examine the improvement of registration accuracy by employing multiple mediators."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge-Based Approach", "text": "In the approach described herein, improvement of the registration algorithm was not the prime target of the research. Rather, our goal was to use multiple mediators, which can be considered as a knowledge-based approach, because each mediator carries a pre-determined transformation matrix to register them to the MNI space. As the quality of the transformation matrices were confirmed by visual inspection, and corrected by manually placed landmarks as necessary, there was good infusion of human knowledge. One drawback of this knowledge-based approach is that it was specifically designed for sagittal scan protocols. Consequently, knowledge may need to be developed for other types of protocols that deviate significantly from typical sagittal protocols, such as coronal and axial MPRAGE scans or multi-slice spin-echo T1-weighted images. The improvements obtained by the use of mediators were obvious, even when only one mediator was utilized (Figure 4) ; the mean success rate using this approach improved to 55%. Using the entire mediator library (48 mediators), the success rate could potentially reach 100% (Figure 5 )."}, {"section_title": "The Use of Matrices to Select Mediators", "text": "The success rate, as defined by the paper, is 100% when the best mediator was correctly chosen (Figure 5) . However, in reality, there is no a priori knowledge relating to the best mediator. It is prudent to point out that in this study, accuracy values (Dice coefficients) could be calculated because the test images were provided from our pre-segmented atlas libraries. This enabled us to choose the best mediator using a posteriori DICE evaluation. Also important to note is that a high Dice coefficient cannot assure that tissues within the segmented mask are well aligned. These small misalignments between tissues can be further corrected by a following nonlinear transformation. In the implementation, we selected the specified brain mask (gray matter + white matter + ventricles) to calculate the Dice coefficient. Theoretically, the segmented mask with gray matter, white matter and ventricles has large segment size which is more suitable for the alignment evaluation (Taha and Hanbury, 2015) . By visual inspection, we found that the registered subject image with high Dice coefficient has a good overall alignment to the mediator and vice versa. Besides the Dice coefficient, the distancebased metrics such as mahalanobis distance and probabilistic distance can be considered as an alternative measurement to evaluate the registration (Taha and Hanbury, 2015) which is beyond the scope of the current study. In reality, the performance of the multi-mediator approach hinges upon a similarity metric in order to select the best mediator. In the present study, we tested SSD and MI, which are widely used as cost functions to estimate the goodness of the alignments. We found that SSD showed a higher performance (99 vs. 96% of success rate), although, neither SSD nor MI could achieve the best performance based on a posteriori mediator selection. The performance of intensity-based metrics could be influenced by the spatially varying intensity heterogeneity across varying mediators. Consequently, the methodology used to select the best similarity measure, still needs further improvement. The mediator selection can also considered as finding the nearest neighbor of the subject image with a defined distance function which is basically \"1-nearestneighbor classification\" (Kumar et al., 2008) . Along the line of this concept, more elaborated approach could be tested to improve the final registration performance. For example, we could borrow the idea of k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm (Belongie et al., 2002; Weinberger and Saul, 2009) in which k similar mediators with nearest neighbors to the subject image are selected and the corresponding k combined transformations with weighted averaging are used as the final transformation from the subject image to MNI space. In addition, the deep learning-based classification, such as convolutional neural network (Krizhevsky et al., 2017; Sultana et al., 2018) , could be adapted to predict the best mediator more accurately which generally needs vast amounts of data with classification labels.\nThe idea of selecting appropriate atlases from an atlas library based on similarity measures is widely used for multi-atlas segmentation techniques (Wang et al., 2013a,b) . Our approach should be considered as an extension of previous work within the context of initial linear alignment (i.e., mediator selection).\nRecently, similar strategies have been reported, which also utilize a mediator to improve the accuracy of image registration. For example, several learning-based registration methods have been proposed to predict the initial deformation field (Tang et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012 Kim et al., , 2015 ; in such methods, the estimated initial deformation is applied onto the template image to create a deformed template as an intermediate image which is close to the subject. Thus, the registration between the subject and template is reduced to the simple problem of registering the subject to the estimated intermediate template. The creation of a synthesized mediator such as this could represent an alternative way to our simpler mediator library approach."}, {"section_title": "Computation Time and the Number of Mediators", "text": "The proposed knowledge-based method requires the user to repeat linear registration for each mediator. Therefore, computation cost could represent one of the drawbacks of this approach. For example, we collected 48 subject images as mediators in which linear registration needed to be repeated 48 times for each test data. In our research, affine linear registration by the AIR package took 6 min for the 48 mediators using a Windows 10 computer equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 2.00 GHz (2 processors) and 16 GB RAM. Because the linear registration of each mediator to the test image is independent, parallel computing could significantly accelerate the linear registration process.\nIn general, increasing the number of mediators is expected to lead to a lower failure rate. However, the computing time is linearly correlated with the number of mediators. In our test data, the best mediator delivered Dice coefficients in the range of 0.90-0.96 (Figure 5) , which are typically close to maximum we can expect for cross-subject registration based on past publications (Aljabar et al., 2009; Chupin et al., 2009; Klein et al., 2009; Lotjonen et al., 2010; Wang and Yushkevich, 2013) . Thus, the library of 48 mediators were suffice and the technical focal point was to identify the best mediator using image-based metrics such as SSD and MI values. A question that naturally follows this observation was, then, \"can we achieve similar results with less mediators?\" To maximize the computational efficiency and minimize the loss of accuracy, we tested mediator clustering based on crossmediator similarity. The similarity criterion was based on the cross-mediator registration and the measurement of SSD values. In other words, if one mediator could be registered to the other with high accuracy (thus low SSD), we assumed that only one of them would be needed to represent the specific geometric features. In our research, we grouped 48 mediators into 25, 14, 9, and 6 clusters, respectively. Reduction in the number of mediators by clustering slightly reduced the registration accuracy from 48 to 25 mediators but significantly improved computing efficiency (Figure 7) . Practically, the performance of the mediator library should now be evaluated using larger scale studies. Building up a robust library may also require a feedback mechanism, through which failed cases are incorporated into the library."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this study, we tested the performance of a mediator-based linear registration approach. When there was a large amount of geometrical differences between the test subject and template images, a library of mediators was deployed, which have previously defined transformation matrices to the final target space. Compared to direct registration between test and target images, the mediator-based approach substantially improved registration accuracy and reduced failure rates. The performance of this approach, however, relies on mediator-selection methods, in which a mediator was selected because it had the most similar image features to the test image. In terms of similarity measure, we tested SSD and MI. Even though both of these measures performed well, there is still room for improvement. Reducing the number of mediators by SSD-based clustering showed potential with which to maximize efficiency with minimum loss of accuracy."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY", "text": "The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author."}, {"section_title": "ETHICS STATEMENT", "text": "This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Johns Hopkins University IRB with written informed consent from all subjects.
