[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Mathematics anxiety is defined as \"feelings of tension and anxiety that interfere with the manipulation of mathematical problems in a wide variety of ordinary life and academic situations\" (Richardson and Suinn, 1972:551) .

Many researchers believe that mathematics anxiety can lead to a decline in mathematics performance, avoidance of mathematics courses, and limitation regarding future careers (Richardson & Suinn, 1972; Betz, 1978; Brush, 1978; Hendel, 1980; Powers, 1984; Tobias, 1978; Ma, 2004) . In today's high-tech world, it is critical for mathematics educators of any nation to promote students' confidence in mathematics and reduce their mathematics anxiety in order to help them solve problems and understand mathematical concepts. Reducing students' anxiety towards mathematics is critical for their future success in today's high-tech competitive global world that relies heavily on mathematics, technology and science. Furthermore, reducing mathematics anxiety in the young generation of students of any nation might contribute to the nation's economy and overall success in the global world."}, {"section_title": "SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY", "text": "According to Valverde (2005) , large-scale cross-cultural studies of education have rarely included countries from the Middle East as their participants. This study is the first to compare and contrast the mathematics anxiety levels of high school students in Jordan and the United States. Furthermore, factors related to mathematics achievement, including students' attitudes and anxiety toward mathematics, have been ignored in the Arab societies including Jordan (Alkhateeb, 2001; Hammouri, 2004) . This study sheds light on this issue among Jordanian high school students. In the same vein, gender related differences in mathematics achievement and mathematics anxiety among students in Arab societies has also received little attention (Alkhateeb, 2001) . Therefore, this study investigates how the results for Jordanian students compared to those of the United States students.\nMost research findings conducted in the United States link anxiety towards mathematics to achievement in mathematics (Hembree, 1990; Ma, 1999b; Norwood, 1994; Vinson, 2001) . Besides, most findings show that females in the U.S. exhibit higher levels of mathematics anxiety than males (Benbow & Stanley, 1980; Bernstein, Reilly & Cote-Bonanno, 1992;  A CR OSS COMMUNITY STUD Y OF MATHEMATICS AN XIETY Betz, 1978; Brush, 1978; Cooper & Robinson, 1989; Hembree, 1990; Hunt, 1985; Richardson & Suinn 1972) . Social reasons, including stereotyping mathematics as a male domain, contribute to increasing female students' anxiety towards mathematics in the United States. This study examines gender differences in mathematics anxiety of high school students in both countries in light of the cultural and educational differences in Jordan and the United States. The differences between the United States and Arab cultures are obvious in terms of religion and tradition.\nThus this study investigates the differences in the school systems, education and cultural differences in the two countries. For example, in Jordan, public schools are single-sex schools and, therefore, girls are not consistently compared to boys by teachers as is the case in the United States (Sadker & Sadker, 1994) . Furthermore, girls in Arab societies have more indoor activities than boys, and hence might spend more time studying than the Arab boys. This study could help United States educators increase their understanding and knowledge of Jordan' s educational culture in general, and high school students' mathematics anxiety, in particular. In addition, it might highlight the effect of single-sex schools on students' mathematics anxiety towards mathematics. The issue of single-sex education is a controversial topic among the United States educators (Haag, 2000; Monaco & Gaier, 1992; Riordan, 1990; Sadker & Sadker, 1994; Streitmatter, 1998) . This study might provide some answers as to whether or not there are any benefits to single-sex classrooms on reducing students' mathematics anxiety level."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Research conducted in the United States has shown that mathematics anxiety is significantly related to several variables, such as gender, performance, age, race, and the quality of teaching (Newstead, 1998; Woodard, 2004) . In general, most research studies reveal that there are gender differences related to mathematics anxiety among high school and college students, with females exhibiting higher levels than males (Benbow & Stanley, 1980; Bernstein, Reilly & Cote-Bonanno, 1992; Betz, 1978; Brush, 1978; Cooper & Robinson, 1989; Hembree, 1990; Hunt, 1985; Richardson & Suinn 1972) . In contrast, in early grades most studies show that there are no significant gender differences in mathematics anxiety (Gierl & Bisanz, 3 SOCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESEARCH JOURNAL 1995; Woodard, 2004) . Around the seventh grade, females begin to doubt their ability to do mathematics and they exhibit more mathematics anxiety in secondary school and in college than males (Birenbaum & Kraemer, 1995; Hembree, 1990; Woodard, 2004; Zaslavasky, 1994) . Levine (1995) raises the question of whether it may be more socially acceptable in the United States for females to exhibit higher mathematics anxiety levels than males.\nMathematics anxiety has been used to explain low mathematics performance by many United States educators (Betz, 1978; Cooper & Robinson, 1991; Frankenstein, 1984; Hembree, 1990; Ma, 2004; Norwood, 1994) . Numerous studies conducted show a negative relationship between anxiety towards mathematics and mathematics performance (Green, 1990; Ma, 1999b; Norwood, 1994) . Furthermore, the quality of teaching plays an important role in reducing students' mathematics anxiety (Newstead, 1998) . For example, several studies show that teaching mathematics through rules and rote memorization increases students' mathematics anxiety levels (McClellan, 1984; Newstead, 1998; NCTM, 2000; Vinson, 2001) . Thus, it appears that reducing students' anxiety towards mathematics might contribute towards improving students' performance and understanding of mathematical concepts.\nUnfortunately, much of the research done on cross-cultural mathematical studies has not included Arab students among their participants (Valverde, 2005) . According to Alkhateeb (2001) , gender related to differences in mathematics achievement of students in Arab societies has received little attention. Nevertheless, Alkhateeb selected a random sample of2,000 high school students in the United Arab Emirates who participated in the National High School General Examination of United Arab Emirates and found that females scored higher in mathematics achievement than males in the last six years. A cross-cultural study conducted by Mittelberg and Lev-Ari (1999) reveals that Arab females reported a much higher level of self-confidence in their ability to do mathematics than Jewish females. Furthermore, data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) conducted in 2003 reveals that Jordanian females at the eighth grade had significantly higher mathematics achievement than their counterpart Jordanian male counterparts. On the other hand, in the United States, males had significantly higher mathematics achievement than females. In addition, Jordan reported a large percentage (81% of its students) at a high level of "}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH QUESTIONS", "text": "1.

The students' scores were then correlated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient in order to correlate students' responses to the English MARS-A and those of the Arabic version . This was done to verify that the English and Arabic version of MARS-A were approximately parallel. That is, if students were proficient in both languages and scored approximately the same in both versions, then this suggests that the two versions of MARS-A were approximately equivalent (see pilot study 2)."}, {"section_title": "Pilot Study 1", "text": "Fifty high school students in Al-Shamleh High School in Irbid/Jordan participated in the first pilot study.

Afterwards, the scores of each student on the Arabic version of MARS-A in both Weekl and Week 2 were correlated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.

"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "As indicated previously, the study showed that the Jordanian high school students exhibit a significantly higher mathematics anxiety than that of the United States. One possible explanation to this finding is that MARS-A was originally developed to be used with high school students in the United States. Although, MARS with all its different versions including MARS-A being translated into other languages such as Spanish, Japanese and Turkish, the researcher believes that students from different cultures may have different experiences relative to the same items mentioned in the instrument, and hence may respond to the items differently. For example, in the case of translating MARS-A to Arabic, the word \"tax\" appeared in several items. The high school students in the United States may have experienced paying taxes much more than high school students in Jordan. Although all high school students in Jordan understand the meaning of the word \"tax\", some may have never experienced paying one, unlike in the United States, for example, buying some items in grocery shops requires one to pay tax. In Jordan , the case is different in which only certain items require tax to be paid.\nThus the researchers believes that the lack of experiences of Jordanian high school students to such situations and others stated in MARS-A may have contributed to their reporting a higher mathematics anxiety than the United States students. In addition, generally, people may tend to be more anxious if they have not experienced something themselves compared to having had experienced it.\nAnother explanation is that there are some cultural differences between Jordan and the United States. Such differences may contribute to different ways in which students in Jordan express themselves differently from those in the United States. For example, in Jordan, the indication that one does not experience any anxiety or little anxiety when it comes to dealing with mathematics or any other subject, conveys the impression to others that one is not modest. In the Middle Eastern culture, people tend to avoid speaking about themselves for fear of appearing arrogant. On the other hand, they prefer that others talk about them; whereas, in the United States people have a larger tendency to recount their achievements more openly. Such cultural differences may have contributed to why the high school students in Jordan expressed a higher mathematics anxiety than the United States students."}, {"section_title": "SOCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESEAR CH JOURNAL", "text": "Another explanation is that the educational system in Jordan is totally different from that in the United States. One of these differences is that students in their last year of high school are required to sit for the National High School General Examination (AI-Twjehee) , which is a government exam prepared, administered and scored by the Ministry of Education. This exam causes a great deal of anxiety in students since it determines their future career. The score the student earns in that exam will determine their admission to major or any other university in Jordan. For example, being admitted to technical fields courses relies on their mathematics scores. Hence, students in Jordan may be more anxious about mathematics than those in the United States since they may feel that how they fare at mathematics will determine their choice of career.\nThe study also revealed that the female high school students in the United States had a higher mathematics anxiety than the males. This finding is consistent with many previous research (Benbow & Stanley, 1980; Bernstein, Reilly & Cote-Bonanno, 1992; Betz, 1978; Brush, 1985; Cooper & Robinson, 1989; Hembree, 1990; Hunt, 1985; Richardson & Suinn 1972; Tobias, 1976) . The explanation given by most American researchers and educators to this difference is that non-cognitive factors such as stereotyping mathematics as a male domain, contribute to females in the United States acquiring a higher level of mathematics anxiety than the United States males (Tobias, 1976) .\nAnother finding of this study was that there were no significant gender differences with regard to mathematics anxiety in Jordan. A possible explanation is that, in Jordan, public schools are unisex. Therefore, it could be that this aspect of education contributes to reducing females' feelings of mathematics anxiety. In such classrooms, females learn in a gender free atmosphere and could be beneficial to them. However, further research should be conducted before one can generalize to such a conclusion.\nAnother explanation to this finding is that in Jordan, female students do not feel that they cannot compete with the males at Mathematics, as is the case in the United States. The results of the TIMSS of 2003, in which the Jordanian females scored significantly higher than their males counterparts, support this explanation. As mentioned earlier, research shows that mathematics anxiety is negatively related to mathematics performance. That is, acquiring high levels of mathematics anxiety causes low mathematics performance, or vice versa. Therefore, it could be that the equal or the higher performance of the Jordanian females in comparison to the males contributes to the lack of significant differences in mathematics anxiety between the female and male students."}]
