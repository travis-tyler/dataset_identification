[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Wetland Systems and their Importance", "text": "There are many types of wetlands along the eastern coast of North America that provide habitat for numerous kinds of vegetation and wildlife. Examples of wetland types include tidal salt, brackish marsh, mangrove, freshwater marsh, wooded/shrub wetland, and many more, each occurring at varying elevations. Low and high marshes are found at different elevations so different inundation rates and vegetation species occur there. A low marsh has an elevation closer to sea-level, while the high marsh has a higher elevation, so the low marsh floods more frequently than the high marsh. Low marsh tends to be located along the coast, creeks, canals, and ditches, while the high marsh is more wide-ranging and is positioned between the low marsh and the upland edge. Vegetation in the low marsh can tolerate higher levels of inundation than the vegetation in the high marsh (NHDES, 2004). Wetlands are a vital habitat for countless species of terrestrial and aquatic vegetation and wildlife. Ecotones, which is the transitional zone between aquatic and terrestrial biomes, provide many ecosystem services; for example, they recharge aquifers, filter run-off and create a buffer protecting the coast from storm damage (Turpie et al., 2015). Other benefits to coastal habitats include nutrient coastal defense, shoreline protection, and reduction in nutrient intensification (Cadol et al., 2016). Wetlands are as important to humans as they are to the species that live in them, but they are very multifaceted. Between upland and mudflat areas are intertidal marshes, which generate zones of vegetation through biogeomorphic feedbacks. Wetland systems are very complex with many interrelated parts, so one change in the system can cause a major shift in another part of the system or could change the entire system all together. Patterns can be seen in different wetland components. A study by Moffett & Gorelick (2016), using differing marsh ages and types of marshes, found that marsh salinity and vegetation pattern complexity correlate significantly, but the elevation and age of the marsh were found to be independent. Channel complexity also correlated with vegetation age and pattern complexity. Even though marshes may share a physical environment, the ecosystem composition can be completely different; marsh age does not automatically equal a more or less complex system; salt marshes can maintain a stable system even with the correlation of two complex elements, channels and vegetation (Moffett & Gorelick, 2016). It is difficult to understand the structure of a wetland because of the complex feedbacks that occur in these environments causing a wetland's adaptability from natural and artificial alterations to be in question. Wetland ecosystems are one of the most threatened environments, and the majority of salt marshes in the USA have been damaged from human activity (Neckles et al., 2015). Coastal wetlands have experienced both artificial and natural modifications worldwide (i.e. dredging and filling, fragmentation, hydrological changes, impoundments, pollution, rising sea levels) causing stress to these systems (Turpie et al., 2015). Monitoring and adaptation planning should be conducted to protect and restore wetlands. Although, restoration efforts have become a challenge for coastal managers since coastal wetlands are a very complex and dynamic environmental system (Neckles et al., 2015). It is difficult to make predictions of their changes with the uncertainty of the future environment and biogeomorphic feedbacks. This is notably a problem with the changing of the climate and the accelerated increase in sea levels."}, {"section_title": "Wetlands and Sea-Level Rise (SLR)", "text": "Global warming has led to sea-level rise (SLR) from melting glaciers and thermal expansion of the oceans. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) continually reports on the rate of SLR and projects that the rate of SLR will increase throughout this century (NOAA et al., 2017). Coastal landscapes are predicted to submerge underwater at different levels and respond either statically (inundation) or dynamically (landform/landscape change) (Lentz et al., 2015). Wetlands will have to migrate at the same rate as the rising sea-level to survive, as well as have available area to migrate into, which can become a problem in developed spaces (Linhoss et al., 2015). Climate change has caused increasing SLR as well as an increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes and storm surges causing coastal areas to increase in inundation (Maloney & Preston, 2014). Marsh migration, SLR, and storm surges have shown to be contingent on elements such as local topography, storm intensity and the storm's path. There are over 150 coastal National Wildlife Refuges in the United States home to many different vegetation and wildlife species and with increasing SLR wetlands can be restructured, habitats types can shift and migrate inland, and inundation can occur (Liu & Delach, 2015). However, wetlands have many mechanisms that make them resilient, but it is uncertain depending on the rate of SLR. Wetlands are influenced greatly by vertical land movement (VLM). VLM rates vary worldwide due to the phenomenon called isostacy, which is the rising and falling of the Earth's crust. The eastern coast of the United States is experiencing a higher rate of SLR on average because of regional subsidence that is occurring there putting the east coast at a higher risk (Beckett et al., 2016). Tidal marshes are able to sustain their elevation in relation to the sea, though, from the dynamic feedback system of sediment accretion (Schile et al., 2014). Sediment and biomass accretion allow wetlands to gain vertical growth, which helps wetlands resist against SLR. Coastal wetlands vary in sediment dynamics and vegetation structure, productivity, and decomposition which may cause wetlands to respond differently to SLR (Beckett et al., 2016). Wetland resiliency is also based upon a biogeomorphic and hydrodynamic relationship. There are feedbacks between vegetation and flooding in a wetland that helps it stabilize against SLR, but stabilization may become an issue with accelerated SLR (Morris et al., 2013). Wetland vegetation species are highly impacted by flow attenuation, which modifies the wet-dry regime and inundation depth and is very particular for each species of vegetation. This causes vegetation species to become more susceptible to SLR (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2017). Another, important hydrological element to vegetation is the hydroperiod. A hydroperiod, or period of flooding, is established by marsh surface elevation and its relation to mean high water. A hydroperiod greatly influences the plant growth in a wetland, because vegetation exists only at certain elevations based upon its hydrological tolerance (Morris et al., 2013). Although wetlands are very resilient, these systems should be monitored, because there are uncertainties on how well coastal wetlands will respond to increased SLR, sediment reduction, vegetation productivity reduction from inundation increases, and restricted marsh migration habitat (Schile et al., 2014;Cadol et al., 2016). Each wetland type responds differently to SLR making them very difficult to monitor and protect (Linhoss et al., 2015;Tabak et al., 2016;Bigalbal et al., 2018). The changing of the climate, SLR, and landcover change have been shown to endanger biodiversity, and low-lying coastal areas are one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of SLR (Reece & Noss, 2014). SLR is predicted to cause habitat change and loss that impacts coastal species, and many studies have been conducted to preserve wetland habitats to protect the species in them, such as shorebird populations. Changes in habitat and habitat availability caused by SLR may cause the distribution and abundance of wetland bird species to become altered (Iwamura et al., 2013;Veloz et al., 2013). Impacts from SLR for the future is very uncertain for wetland environments, which causes restoration efforts to be very intricate, difficult challenges (Veloz et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Significance of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of coastal National Wildlife Refuges", "text": "While sediment, hydrology, and vegetation factors are all important, the spatial variability of elevation is one that can be easily examined while enhancing our understanding in how wetlands are evolving. Topography and elevation are key variables because marsh vegetation is found only within limited elevation gradients identified by specific physical and biological factors, so small alterations in the elevation can change the vegetation pattern within the marsh (e.g., Suchrow & Jensen, 2010;Hladik & Alber, 2012;Buffington et al., 2016;Rogers et al., 2018). For this reason, reliable digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for estimating marsh areas vulnerable to potential SLR and storm surges (e.g., Hladik & Alber, 2012;Clough et al., 2016;Rogers et al., 2018). A major objective of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is to conserve coastal resources by conducting SLR vulnerability assessments for all coastal refuges using the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) (USFWS, 2010). DEMs are essential baseline datasets used in SLAMM, so model predictions are prone to the vertical accuracy and errors of interpolated DEMs (Clough et al., 2012). Simulating wetland conversions due to long-term SLR requires low (better) vertical accuracy DEMs. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have become the standard for building DEMs in coastal environments due to their low vertical accuracy (e.g. <15 cm) and high horizontal resolution (e.g. <5 m). However, it is a challenge for LiDAR to obtain accurate three-dimensional measures in coastal National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) critical habitat areas such as wetlands due to the complexity of coastal marshes."}, {"section_title": "LiDAR errors and uncertainties in coastal marshes", "text": "The acquisition of accurate elevation measurements in wetlands stems from the instrumentation, software and the complexity of the marsh itself. Many elements, such as data collection, a LiDAR's sensor, the slope of the topography and different filtering techniques, can cause error to occur of the LiDAR data. LiDAR elevation data is shown through x and y (horizontal) and z (vertical) coordinates and the different positions can also contain error through the GNSS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and/or the laser beam's direction and range (Cooper et al., 2013). Hodgson et al. (2005) concluded that an error in the z coordinate can occur from the land cover type and density depending on the vegetation height and type. According to Hladik and Alber (2012), LiDAR is restricted in its ability to reach the \"true\" ground in coastal wetland environments from the thick vegetation, even with emerging technological advancements in GNSS, sensors, IMU, and filtering methods, which impacts the accuracy of the LiDAR measurements. Coastal marshes are typically inundated with turbid waters during tidal sequences, have areas of standing water, and often have dense and diverse plants and contain organic soils. All of these items individually make it difficult for the laser to capture the ground surface. LiDAR point clouds and DEMs often overestimate marsh ground elevations by as much as 0.65 m (Medeiros et al., 2015). This value can vary considerably and the error is often highest in denser and taller the vegetation (Hladik & Alber, 2012). LiDAR is considered to be more accurate the smaller the error of the measurement is, and LiDAR accuracy mainly focuses on the vertical error, which is an important component in SLR vulnerability mapping and assessment of coastal wetlands. Error is a measurement of the difference between an observed value and its actual value and is composed of random and systematic errors (Cooper et al., 2013). Random errors cause variations around the actual value caused from problems in acquiring measurements, and systematic errors are constant and predictable variations from the actual value from problems in equipment calibration (Johnson, 2018). Systematic errors can come from the sensor, aircraft, GNSS, LiDAR point processing, and geography (Hodgson et al., 2005). Bias, or systematic error approximation, can potentially be managed when the source is determined (Cooper et al., 2013) and can improve LiDAR DEMs. Without correcting the LiDAR data, elevation cannot truly reveal vegetation, hydrological patterns or the underlying topography, since the distribution of marsh vegetation is linked to the correlation of hydroperiods and elevation (Zhang et al., 2018). Several efforts have been made to address the inability to accurately capture marsh complexity with remote sensing techniques. One approach is to apply a minimum binning procedure where the minimum LiDAR ground elevation point is assigned to a grid cell when more than one LiDAR point falls within that grid cell (Schmid et al., 2011;Medeiros et al., 2015;Buffington et al., 2016). Minimum binning has also shown to reduce bias and vertical error of LiDAR data collected in heavily vegetated marshes (Schmid et al., 2011;Medeiros et al., 2015;Buffington et al., 2016;Cooper et al., 2019). A second approach is to use Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to calculate a species-specific bias used to correct the LiDAR DEM. While this simple bias-correction procedure has shown to successfully reduce the bias (Hladik & Alber, 2012;McClure et al., 2016;Cooper et al., 2019), it can be less successful at reducing the vertical error (Rogers et al., 2018;Cooper et al., 2019). This has led researchers to seek a third approach that reduces both bias and error using machine learning techniques (Rogers et al., 2018;Cooper et al., 2019). The application of machine learning techniques to identify complex and often nonlinear relationships between model predictor variables has proven valuable in correcting LiDAR DEMs of coastal marshes (Rogers et al., 2018;Cooper et al., 2019). While an advantage to machine learning techniques can be a significant reduction in both bias and error, these techniques are more complex and computationally intensive when compared to the minimum binning and biascorrection procedures. However, it is unlikely that an entire vegetation species needs a constant correction using the bias-correction technique (Rogers et al., 2018) because a species presents a range of elevation uncertainty opposed to a constant (Rogers et al., 2016). Therefore, a fourth approach was developed, which combines machine learning with Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques that addresses the bias-correction issue where spatial bias is assumed to be homogenous for an entire vegetation community (Cooper et al., 2019). OBIA analyzes and classifies basic segments from images so that segments can be validated, and errors can be removed (Veljanovski et al., 2011). The object-based machine learning (OBML) technique was tested on coastal marsh, swamp, and prairie in the Everglades, and the authors recommend its application in other regions to examine its robustness (Cooper et al., 2019). The application of the OBML approach for LiDAR DEM correction in North Carolina's coastal marshes has potential to enhance the results of SLAMM simulations."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)", "text": "SLAMM is an empirical and mathematical model that is used to show how long-term SLR may potentially impact wetlands and coastlines. SLAMM is attractive because it is open source, has quick computational time, and only a few publicly accessible inputs are required (Wu et al., 2015). Critical inputs that influence the ability of SLAMM to predict landscape alterations include vertical accretion, DEM, rates of sedimentation, and trends in SLR (Chu-Agor et al., 2011). The model uses a flexible decision tree that produces both tabular and graphical data (NOAA, 2018) and can conduct an uncertainty analysis producing confidence intervals and probability statistics (Clough et al., 2016). Many studies have examined the reliability of SLAMM to predict whether a wetland will survive by migrating inland with increasing SLR. For example, one study compared a bathtub model with SLAMM to find that SLAMM generated the best results for classifying potential habitat change (Zhu et al., 2015). In another study, the ability of LiDAR and RTK-GNSS elevation data to determine the risk of increased inundation using SLAMM was compared, and it was found that RTK-GNSS measurements provided the more reliable simulation results (Murdukhayeva et al., 2013). Incorporating RTK-GNSS measurements into the SLAMM model has potential to help improve our understanding of how North Carolina's coastal marshes may be impacted to future SLR."}, {"section_title": "SLAMM Limitations", "text": "Details provided from the SLAMM simulations are very helpful for understanding and predicting how coastal habitats will change over time from SLR, but there are uncertainties that should be acknowledged. Many landcover models, like SLAMM, are unable to reflect the natural, ecogeomorphic feedbacks that occur in wetland environments which aids in elevation change in response to SLR, and because of this shortcoming SLAMM simulations tend to predict major changes in land cover from increased SLR (Kirwan et al., 2016). Elevation, accretion, and erosion rates are dynamic, which is not taken into account in the SLAMM, so the amount of habitat change may be over/underestimated depending upon the ecogeomorphic feedbacks, like vegetation structure (Wang & Temmerman, 2013;Kirwan et al., 2016). SLAMM considers elements, like accretion and erosion, to be constant over time but the feedback loops cause that not to be the case. Using very coarse land cover data limit's the model's accuracy (Scarborough, 2009) and SLAMM implements the NWI by USFWS, which has a coarse resolution impacting the results. Elevation data accuracy has also shown to restrict SLAMM's capability to predict changes in wetland environments (Wu et al., 2015), making elevation an important baseline parameter to improve and will be focused on in this study. Another limitation is that SLAMM is not a hydrodynamic model, so it is unable to imitate the water flow rates, which is a major element impacting the dynamics in wetland environments. Hurricanes and storm surges also have the potential to change the topography and sediment dynamics on the coast (Turner et al., 2006;Woods Hole Group, Inc., 2016), which are difficult to capture in SLAMM. Future SLR projections are an additional uncertainty implemented into the model that varies by location but has one of the largest influences on the model. Although, SLAMM comes with limitations it has shown to be a useful tool for coastal managers to use in predicting coastal landcover from SLR."}, {"section_title": "Objectives", "text": "The main objective of this study is to extend the OBML LiDAR correction approach by Cooper et al. (2019) to a coastal marsh in North Carolina for assessing potential habitat change due to SLR.

SNWR is operated as part of the Mattamuskeet, Swanquarter and Cedar Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The refuge provides habitat and protection for migratory waterfowl and other birds, along with various other kinds of wildlife. Hunting, fishing and birdwatching are the main reasons people visit the refuge (USFWS, 2018). The study site at SNWR is located off Rose Bay that leads to the Pamlico River and Pamlico Sound. The refuge is a microtidal environment, which are generally more impacted from the effects of SLR. Ocean currents influence the weather, which impacts the type of vegetation and wildlife. On average, the largest amount of rainfall occurs in July and August and the least amount occurs in November and April (Hosier, 2018). SNWR is found in the coastal plain physiographic region and is home to various habitat types, such as irregularly flooded, brackish marsh and forested wetlands. This study focuses on the brackish marsh and the estuarine fringe loblolly pine forest. The brackish marsh in SNWR is found along the edge of the sound and is generally considered a high marsh since irregularly flooding occurs there mostly from wind tides. The marsh experiences low salinity because the freshwater inflow is greater. Mud flats may occur if the marsh experiences regular flooding combined with the low salinity, which could cause mineral deposition (USFWS, 2008). Overall, this habitat is found on organic peat soils (USFWS, 2018). Black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) is the most prominent vegetation type at SNWR in the brackish marsh but extensive patches of saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), and giant cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides) can also be found. Other vegetation can be found throughout the marsh but is not as extensive (USFWS, 2008). Black needlerush is generally found at lower elevations of the marsh (area between Mean Low Water (MLW) and Mean High Water (MHW)) (Lynn Haven River Now, n.d.). Eleuterius (1984) found black needlerush to occur at about 0.65 m above MLW. Saltmeadow cordgrass and giant cordgrass are typically found at higher elevations of the marsh (area above MHW) (Lynn Haven River Now, n.d.). The dominating vegetation for the estuarine fringe loblolly pine forest includes saltmeadow cordgrass, loblolly pine, wax myrtle, and inkberry and is situated on mineral or organic soils (USFWS, 2018). The estuarine fringe loblolly pine forest is found at slightly higher elevations, so it does not flood very often and the loblolly pine is able to grow at sea-level of a coastal plain (Schultz, 1997). Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) provides the overstory and the understory is composed of wax myrtle (Morella cerifera) and inkberry (Ilex glabra). Saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens) mostly covers the floor of the forest (USFWS, 2008). Wax myrtle, inkberry, and loblolly pine are all found at higher elevations than the surrounding wetland and are found in pocosin habitat, which is a wetland that has woody shrub vegetation (NOAA, 2020).

An overview of the workflow shows an OBML DEM that was created through image segmentation, LiDAR normalization, data matching, and random forest machine learning.

A SLAMM analysis was run on the NCFMP and OBML DEMs, which required DEMs with VDATUM transformations, slope creations, SLAMM categorized land cover data, and accretion and erosion rates. The initial conditions were calibrated and then simulations were run for the year 2050 for both the NCFMP and OBML DEMs.  "}, {"section_title": "OBML DEM creation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Image Segmentation", "text": "A multi-resolution image segmentation method was used to create objects of the different vegetation patches on the study site from aerial imagery in eCognition Developer (Benz et al., 2004;Trimble, 2017), which is known as OBIA. Image segmentation divides images into separate pixel segments, which are then merged with adjacent segments to generate a userdefined heterogeneous threshold (Benz et al., 2004). Color/shape, smoothness/compactness, and scale are important input parameters defined for the algorithm. An optimal scale parameter needs to be determined because a larger scale parameter allows for larger heterogeneous objects, while a smaller scale creates smaller homogeneous objects (Cooper et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2018) found a scale of 75 to be most optimal for the marsh classification in that study, but Cooper et al. (2019) found a smaller scale of 30 to work best for wetland elevation mapping. Therefore, different scales were tested in this study ranging from 10 to 75 by aligning the results with the RTK-GNSS points that were collected around different vegetation boundaries. The scale of 10 was found to align best with the RTK-GNSS points along with using a shape parameter of 0.9 and compactness parameter of 0.5. Following the segmentation, elevation statistical measures (mean, minimum, maximum, range, standard deviation) were obtained for every object using the original LiDAR point elevations (Cooper et al., 2019)."}, {"section_title": "LiDAR Normalization", "text": "Vegetation height may serve as an important explanatory variable in the OBML modeling for image classification of differing vegetation classes (Onojeghuo & Onojeghuo, 2017). One way to obtain vegetation heights throughout the study area is by LiDAR normalization, which is a method to standardize the LiDAR data. Many normalization procedures were found in the literature where one study extracted the height of a mangrove forest canopy to the mudflat defined by the LiDAR point elevation by using the point height mean, the point height standard deviation, and the point height variation coefficient (Li et al., 2019). In another study, Montealegre et al. (2015) used various interpolation types to normalize LiDAR data to obtain the best, suitable DEM to predict the formation of vegetation in a forested region. Several studies subtracted a DEM from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) to find the correct height (Dash et al., 2004;Brennan & Webster, 2006). For this study, it was apparent the vegetation elevation was being considered the \"ground\" elevation, so vegetation height was normalized by subtracting a corrected LiDAR DEM from a LiDAR DSM using Esri's ArcMap, which is explained in further detail below. First, a DEM was generated from the classified LiDAR ground returns using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK), which is a geostatistical interpolation approach that works to create an effective and acceptable kriging model (ESRI, 2016). Through trial and error, an empirical transformation and K-Bessel semivariogram provided the lowest cross-validation results. The NWI land cover raster was used to represent the different vegetation communities, which was resampled to the EBK DEM using so the rasters shared the same cell size of 1 m. The NWI and EBK DEM were then matched with the RTK-GNSS measures where the mean bias between the EBK DEM and RTK-GNSS measures could be calculated for each NWI land cover ( Table 1). The EBK was then corrected by the mean bias for each land cover so that the elevation better represented the RTK-GNSS measures.

By matching at the object level, the positional uncertainty is reduced between the RTK-GNSS and LiDAR measurements, and vegetation can be better characterized with an object than a grid cell (Cooper et al., 2019). Using OBIA to match the RTK-GNSS to objects is a better option than using a grid because vegetation communities have differing shapes and sizes."}, {"section_title": "Random Forest machine learning", "text": "In this study, a nonparametric machine learning algorithm, Random Forest (RF), was used for ground elevation modeling.

The \"psych\" package is a toolbox that offers different functions to calculate descriptive statistics between the validation dataset and the NCFMP and OBML DEMs. The validation .csv files of the two raster files (NCFMP and RF OBIA) were imported into R as a data frame (a table/2-D structure where each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column) using the utils package.

The value for regularly-flooded marsh accretion was from accretion measurements made at Cedar Island NWR (Cahoon et al., 1998), irregularly-flooded marsh accretion was obtained from other U.S. east coast marshes and tidalfresh marsh and inland-fresh marsh accretion was from regional accretion measurements (Reed et al., 2008). These values were collected through radiometric dating or a Surface Elevation Table). SLAMM defaults were used for tidal swamp and swamp accretion rates and marsh, swamp, and tidal flat erosion rates (Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc., 2016a)."}, {"section_title": "SLR Projections for SLAMM", "text": "The IPCC is an international administration that reviews and publishes scientific information on climate change. This organization creates SLR projections, which are continually east coast, the RSL has shown to be higher than the global average and will continue to increase. Also, the Carolinas are experiencing downward VLM, which in turn increases the RSL on the coast (NOAA et al., 2017). Many assessment reports have been published by the IPCC, and SLR projections have changed over the years. It is important to be familiar with SLR and the accompanying processes to understand future projections. SLR projections by IPCC are predominately structured by greenhouse gas emissions. One working group within IPCC assesses emission scenarios for possible socio-economic growth throughout the century, resulting in scenarios with differing emission intensities (different energy uses), which have been continually modified throughout the years. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were created by researchers and have been implemented by the IPCC (Church et al., 2013). Representative denotes to various scenarios that have comparable radiative forcing (energy imbalance before the climate can rebound (Archer, 2012)), concentration is the amount of emissions, and pathways is the longterm trajectories of the greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing results (Moss et al., 2008). There are four RCPs (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6, 8.5), each with a differing radiative forcing (2.6, 4.5, 6, 8.5 w/m\u00b2, respectively). RCPs are used in the IPCC assessment reports giving several SLR projections, and the newest report is the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5, 2013). Ice sheet components are an important addition to AR5 that impacts SLR, however, thermal expansion is predicted to have the largest impact on SLR throughout the century. AR5 uses process-based models creating a GMSL rise range having at least a 66% likelihood of being true to that range (Church et al., 2013), however, this may be deemed inadequate for planners who require a higher percentage of certainty (NOAA et al., 2017). These scenario projections have continued to evolve and advance with updated research and improved technologies and models. Global SLR, as well as fluctuations in local VLM and sea-surface height (SSH), is a major problem for coastal communities and habitats, which is why projecting future SLR is critical for planning purposes. Long-term SLR causing coastal flooding is an increasing problem for coastal environments. The rise in GMSL will continue to increase and at a faster rate throughout the 21 st century producing more intense high tides, storm surges and wave action. This sea level change can begin alterations in ecological systems of wetlands along the coast, which in turn can change the geomorphology of the coast (e.g., sediment buildup), moving where the flood risks may occur for the future (NOAA et al., 2017). Sea level science has been continually advancing over the years and sea level rise, GMSL and RSL, have continued to be revised with new information. To create RSL change projections, processes impacting the SSH and VLM must be accounted for, along with any spatial patterns, which should be at the same degree as the GMSL rise projections (NOAA et al., 2017). Hall et al. (2016) and Kopp et al. (2014) have generated RSL rise estimations based on future GMSL rise estimates. Hall et al. (2016) used the Parris et al. (2012) GMSL rise scenarios to make regional adjustments, while Kopp et al. (2014) created probabilistic projections of GMSL rise scenarios to determine regional adjustments. Both are used to create the most updated science and methodologies to modify GMSL regionally. The study site will only require local subsidence so relative SLR estimates will be produced, and the SLAMM scenarios will not need adjusting between global (eustatic) and local (relative) SLR trends (Clough et al., 2016). SLR estimates were obtained from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) sea level rise curve calculator Version 2017.55 (http://corpsmapu.usace.army.mil/rccinfo/slc/slcc_calc.html). This web-based calculator computes projected rates of sea level change to help evaluate the impacts, responses and adaptations required for the present and future. The nearest tide station available for this calculator is at Beaufort, NC. The intermediate scenario was chosen for this study, being a more conservative choice for coastal land managers to use ( Figure 5). By the end of the century there is predicted to be at least a meter rise in sea level at Swanquarter National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR). 48 cm was plugged into SLAMM, instead of 47 cm, because mean tidal level (MTL) is 1 cm more than mean sea level (MSL), according to the Beaufort tidal gauge (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov) for the year 2050.

An initial conditions map was created from a new simulation using general SLAMM categories. The NCFMP and OBML DEMs, NWI converted to SLAMM categories and slope file (in degrees) are the files required for the SLAMM simulation to run. 1998 was the year for the NWI photo date entered (beginning image year of the NWI photo range) and the date of the DEMs was 2014. The south was the direction offshore and the GT Great Tidal Diurnal Tide Range, which is the difference between the Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) and Mean Lower-Low Water (MLLW), was 1.079 m, according to the gauge at Beaufort (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov). The MTL minus NAVD88 was kept at 0 because the difference was already calculated into the DEMs. No other site parameters were used to set the initial conditions for this study. The model was run for the specific year of 1998. According to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) (2014), having a threshold tolerance up to 5% land cover change in total is considered an appropriate amount for calibration. With SLAMM being calibrated, predicting land cover change for the year 2050 can now be modeled."}, {"section_title": "2050 SLR Scenarios: NCFMP DEM vs. OBML DEM", "text": "The steps for the file setup were repeated from the initial conditions map, but additional site parameters were applied including SLR and accretion to assess the potential impacts of SLR in SNWR by the year 2050.

The horizontal erosion rates for marsh (1.8 m/year), swamp (1 m/year) and tidal flat (0.5 m/year) were included, as well as the vertical accretion rates for regularly-flooded marsh (3.7 mm/year), irregularly-flooded marsh (4.1 mm/year), tidal-fresh marsh (5.9 mm/year), inland-fresh marsh (5.9 mm/year), tidal swamp (1.1 mm/year), and swamp (0.3 mm/year) (Warren Pinnacle, 2012). The beach sedimentation, which is the vertical accretion for tidal flats and beaches, was also included from that study as 0.5 mm/year. The model was run for the specific year of 2050 with SLR set at 0.48 m after the site parameters had been set. SLAMM outputs included both tabular and graphic formats.

When compared to the OBML DEM, the NCFMP DEM clearly overestimates the ground elevation by several meters. Also apparent in the OBML DEM is the grouping of high elevation in two areas (shown in dark orange), which are loblolly pine forest where elevations are much higher than those of the surrounding marsh. This can be confirmed with observations made in the field. The NCFMP DEM may have been interpolated incorrectly causing the areas of higher elevation, where the loblolly pine forest is, to seem to have a lower elevation than the surrounding marsh. The OBML DEM better represents the topography spatially when compared to the NCFMP DEM. Using different DEMs can have major impacts on the results and can change the conclusions of a study.  Table 2 Independent accuracy assessment on the NCFMP DEM and OBML DEM created in this study. Where ( \u0305 ) = the average of elevation observations (RTK-GNSS validation data), ( \u0305 )= the average of elevation predictions defined by each DEM, ( ) and ( ) are the standard deviations of the observations and predictions, ( \u2212 ) is the standard deviation of the differences between the P and O, MBE = Mean Bias Error, RMSE = Root Mean Square Error, and n = number of measures, all in meters (except n). When comparing the NCFMP DEM with the OBML DEM, the OBML DEM displays a lower/better MBE, RMSE, and standard deviation (\u03c3) ( Table 2). The observed mean ( \u0305 ) of 0.05 indicated that the average predictions ( \u0305 ) of the NCFMP DEM (1.96 m) greatly overestimated the corresponding observed parameter \u0305 , while the average predictions ( \u0305 ) of the OBML DEM (0.03 m) only slightly underestimated the observed mean ( \u0305 ). The observation data's small standard deviation ( ) indicates the data has a tendency to be close to the mean, while a higher standard deviation would have showed a tendency for the data to be more spread out over a broader range of values. The standard deviation of the differences between the P and O demonstrates that the OBML DEM contains the smallest range of error (\u03c3 \u2212 ) of 0.11 m when compared to the NCFMP DEM (\u03c3 \u2212 =0.44 m).

Inland fresh marsh, transitional marsh/scrub shrub, and irregularly water that is seen throughout the area converted into tidal flat could be caused from ponding. Ponding had already started occurring in the refuge already, so it is very reasonable to predict that it will increase in the future with SLR and an increase in storm surges, which are very common in the rivers of the sound. For 2050, the NCFMP DEM showed no change for inland fresh marsh, while the OBML DEM showed no inland fresh marsh at all.

For example, SLAMM suggests using the USFWS's NWI for land cover data, however, the resolution is very coarse. Implementing a land cover layer that has a better resolution could be beneficial to improve the model's output and thus the results. The SLAMM simulation for the OBML DEM also showed major land cover changes, but this may be an overestimation since SLAMM does not include the ecogeomorphic feedbacks that take place in wetlands in response to SLR (Kirwan et al., 2016). There are many canals and tidal creeks throughout SNWR, but these hydrodynamic feedbacks are left out of the simulation. Including hydrological factors, like a water depth map, could have the potential to greatly improve SLAMM's predictability since that is not being taken into account and has a major influence. A study at SNWR by Taillie et al. (2019) stated that a vegetation gradient can be seen from brackish marsh to estuarine fringe loblolly pine forest and is reflected with marsh migration and found inundation and salinity tolerance to cause wider transition zone between the forest and marsh vegetation. Salinity in the soil and water was found to have large impact in vegetation patterns, so including this parameter could improve the results of the land cover. SLAMM results showed an increase in tidal flats for all scenarios but tidal flats are not a common occurrence on the coast of North Carolina. Tidal flats are commonly found in microtidal environments, but with accelerated SLR tidal flats and wetlands generally decrease and wetlands migrate inland. The tidal flat areas may actually be areas that are underwater instead. However, marshes that experience low salinity and regular flooding cause mineral deposition to occur and are known to form tidal flats (USFWS, 2008), so it might be possible for tidal flats to occur. A critical evaluation of this issue would be helpful for the USFWS in adaptation planning using SLAMM."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "An OBML technique was utilized in this study to model the potential change in coastal wetland vegetation due to rising sea levels. The objectives of this study were to: 1) examine the potential of the corrected, OBML DEM and the uncorrected, NCFMP DEM as critical baseline inputs in SLAMM, 2) compare SLAMM simulations between the NCFMP and OBML DEMs for the year 2050, 3) assess the percentage of potential habitat change due to SLR and generate corresponding habitat change maps, and 4) gain a better understanding of how North Carolina's coastal marshes may be impacted with future SLR. This research concluded that this method improved elevation modeling and mapping in SLAMM in contrast to using the current best available NCFMP DEM. The following conclusions were found: \u2022 Modeling using an object-based LiDAR correction method, instead of a grid-based method, presents a sounder option for wetland vegetation modeling. Positional inconsistency of an image object and the RTK-GPS metric can be improved with an object-based approach since vegetation is better depicted with an object rather than a grid cell. Using objects helps decrease the bias and uncertainty of a model. \u2022 SLAMM helps provide a representation of the impacts SLR has on coastal habitats. Further environmental dynamics can be evaluated to improve the accuracy of the vegetation community. \u2022 The OBML approach provides a possible representation of the potential impacts of future SLR on coastal wetlands in North Carolina. This approach may become an alternative option for conservation managers to implement for future planning. \u2022 More accurate and precise DEMs can be generated for future research modeling in SLAMM using the object-based LiDAR correction method, and should be used for other purposes, environmental settings, and in other models to continually improve the method's resilience. Object-based corrected DEMs may improve as new and improved data is collected and more accessible for future research. Possible future research can evaluate the object-based LiDAR correction method in other coastal and wetland models to monitor the changes of vegetation with concern to the elevation and other influencing environmental factors. This method could improve DEMs for generating SLAMM results. LiDAR DEMs are very important when creating SLR vulnerability assessments, so the accuracy of the DEM is essential. The best available GIS data should be used and improved upon to create a more accurate DEM of a coastal wetland. The OBML approach used in this study has the potential to improve future studies by implementing this technique on other DEMs. Implementing tidal station information when creating a DEM helps improve the DEM for coastal studies and should be included in any future SLR project. SLR projections are also important to include and will improve SLR vulnerability assessments in future research. The OBML approach used in this study should be implemented in other coastal models to increase the robustness of this model. Using this OBML technique on LiDAR DEMs can improve SLR land cover vulnerability assessment mapping practices. Wetlands are known to be very resilient to changes in SLR, however, this study shows a dramatic change in landcover using only an intermediate SLR scenario, which should be concerning to conservation planners and the surrounding community. Wetlands should be examined at both the regional and global level for the most appropriate coastal planning and protection (Turpie et al., 2015). SLR vulnerability assessments are necessary to be able to monitor and determine adaptation plans for managing coastal wetlands. Although, adaptation plans conducted by coastal managers of SNWR should be developed with the understanding that there is uncertainty in SLR calculations, which determines wetland migration and differing land cover types will respond differently to SLR in the wetland. The OBML approach to generating DEMs has the potential to improve predictions on SLR impacts for land cover assessments. Additional elements could be included in future studies to improve uncertainties, such as impacts from hurricanes and storm surges, saltwater intrusion, groundwater inundation, etc. SLAMM predictions always have some degree of uncertainty from the uncertainty of the inputs of accretion, elevation, erosion, SLR, subsidence, and tides, which is why creating a study with the most up-to-date and accurate data is needed to produce the best prediction for SLR assessments. It is important for future SLR assessments to include and improve these inputs (wetland feedbacks) to increase the assessments reliability. There are many different elements associated with a wetland system that can and will be impacted as sea-levels continue to rise throughout the century. Each coastal wetland has unique characteristics that differentiates it from other wetlands making their protection to be a very dynamic and complex challenge worldwide. However, it is expected that the OBML approach used in this study will help improve SLR vulnerability assessments to improve adaptation planning measures for coastal wetlands."}]
