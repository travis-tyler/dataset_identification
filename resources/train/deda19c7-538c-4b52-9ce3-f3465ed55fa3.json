[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation and the presence of symptoms such as dyspnoea and fatigue [1]. Besides pulmonary symptoms, systemic consequences of the disease are common, for example, impaired lower limb muscle function [2,3], body composition abnormalities [4][5][6] and various comorbidities [7,8]. Vitamin D deficiency is also common in patients with COPD [9,10] and observational studies have shown a positive association between circulating vitamin D and exercise capacity in patients with COPD [11,12]. In a post hoc subgroup analysis of a larger randomized trial comparing vitamin D supplementation with placebo to reduce time to exacerbations, 50 subjects participated in a rehabilitation programme [13]. In this subgroup, the supplemented group had larger improvement of inspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake [13]. Furthermore, vitamin D status has been found to correlate with lung function both in the general population [14] and specifically in patients with COPD [15]. In the general population, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with other COPDrelated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and anaemia [16][17][18]. As these comorbidities are more prevalent in patients with COPD than in agematched controls [19], the question arises whether and to what extent vitamin D deficiency is COPD specific or whether it is due to common features of COPD such as smoking, aging, reduced physical activity, and/or the presence of comorbidity? The aim of this study was to investigate whether and to what extent vitamin D deficiency is related to the degree of airflow limitation in an older population. Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether vitamin D deficiency was determined by conditions that frequently coexist with COPD: insulin resistance, hypertension, anaemia, obesity, and hypercholesterolaemia. We also wanted to examine whether modifiable variables, such as level of physical activity, exercise capacity and smoking, were determinants of vitamin D deficiency."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a prospective study of normative aging.

BMI/obesity and physical activity were the main determinants of vitamin D deficiency. Our data suggest that the frequent presence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with airflow limitation is due to general and modifiable features. Black and Scragg [14] were the first to show an association between vitamin D and lung function in the NHANES III cohort, also after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, height, smoking, and BMI. Since then, this finding was confirmed; among others, COPD has been suggested to be an independent risk factor for vitamin D deficiency (adjusted for BMI, GOLD stage, smoking and season) [10], and vitamin D deficiency was more frequent in patients with airflow limitation compared with controls [9]. In the latter study, the usually seen inverse relationship between BMI and serum 25(OH)D was not found [9]. Thus, it was plausible that airflow limitation could influence vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis was that airflow limitation is an independent determinant of vitamin D deficiency, even after considering common features like aging, comorbidity, reduced physical activity and smoking status, which are risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in the general population [23]. Our results suggest, however, that other determinants of vitamin D deficiency are more influential than airflow limitation by itself. In line with this, it has to be acknowledged that Black and Scragg [14] did not find any difference in the FEV 1 /FVC ratio between the highest and the lowest quintiles of vitamin D. And in a recent study by Afzal et al. [24], FEV 1% predicted and FVC % predicted were lower for lowest vs. highest decile of 25(OH)D in two general population samples; however, the association of 25(OH)D and FEV 1 /FVC ratio was inconclusive. Studies assessing the influence of vitamin D in CVD have found an association between elevated BMI and vitamin D deficiency [25][26][27]. A physiological explanation for this relationship is that vitamin D metabolites are sequestered in fat tissue [28]. In some of the studies that have linked vitamin D deficiency to CVD risk or outcome, adjustment for BMI did not change the result [29][30][31]. In the present study, obesity was the only morbidity significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency in the multivariate regression analysis. We found that serum 25(OH)D levels were higher in women than in men and increased with age. Several studies have found that lower vitamin D levels are associated with female sex [32,33], but in a study of patients with type 2 diabetes and in another study of morbidly obese patients women had higher levels of 25(OH)D; in both studies, the association was independent of BMI [34,35]. The positive association between age and vitamin D levels have been reported in some studies [36,37], but not in others [32,38]. In the present study of older subjects, only 14% of the women and 15% of the men were vitamin D deficient. A multicentre study from 1995 of an older European population (age: 70-75 years) reported that 36% of the men and 47% of the women had serum 25(OH)D below 30 nM (~12 ng/mL) [39]. A study from Germany in which all the participants were at least 60 years old found that about 26% of the women and 20% of the men had 25(OH)D <50 nM (~20 ng/mL) [40]. In both studies, subjects taking vitamin D supplements were not excluded, while this was the case in the present study. Furthermore, it has to be taken into consideration that Baltimore is located at the 39\u00b0N, which is comparable with the south of Italy. This could be another factor explaining the difference in prevalence of vitamin D deficiency between the studies. We showed that decreased physical activity is associated with increased risk for vitamin D deficiency. As stated in the literature, physical activity has been linked to spending more time outside and thus possibly being exposed to more sunlight [41] and increased physical activity may very well be related to a lower BMI and a more healthy lifestyle in general. Yet, it is less clear whether vitamin D supplementation has a direct effect on muscle strength and physical capacity. In a clinical trial of patients participating in pulmonary rehabilitation and randomized to either 100 000 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo, the patients receiving vitamin D had significantly larger improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake, but improvements in quadriceps strength or 6-min walking distance were not significantly different from the effects in the placebo group [13]. In another clinical trial, patients with COPD received 2000 IU vitamin D 3 daily with no effect on physical performance after 6 weeks of treatment [42]. A limitation of these intervention studies was that vitamin D deficiency was not an inclusion criterion; it is thus essential to confirm these findings in a population with vitamin D deficiency. The hypothesis that increased physical activity positively influences the vitamin D concentration has yet to be tested. Osteopenia was associated with vitamin D deficiency whereas osteoporosis was not. The reason for these results could be the fact that only subjects who did not take vitamin D supplements were included. Subjects already diagnosed with osteoporosis prior to entering the BLSA and at the time of the diagnosis were vitamin D deficient have most likely been supplemented with vitamin D and have thus been excluded from the analyses of the present study. As populations are aging, multimorbidity is often present and is defined as the coexistence of two or more noncommunicable diseases in the same individual. The terms comorbidity and multimorbidity are often used interchangeable depending on the context. Common risk factors such as smoking, poor nutrition and physical inactivity are leading to simultaneous development of noncommunicable diseases, but there is no standardized definition yet [43]. The implications of the concept of multimorbidity are better understanding of the aging process [44] and the possibility of future treatments targeting common pathways [45]. It could thus be speculated that vitamin D deficiency is just another condition in the multimorbid individual caused by aging. Our study has several limitations. First, the clinical diagnosis COPD was not established in this population. Information on self-reported asthma and COPD did only in part correspond to the observed airflow limitation. Nevertheless, the prevalence of airflow limitation was lower (9\u20228%) compared with that of NHANES 2007-2010 in which the prevalence of airflow limitation was 15% using the LLN criterion and prebronchodilator spirometry values on subjects aged 40-79 [46]. Of the subjects with airflow limitation 53\u20224% were never smokers. These subjects could have asthma or be never smokers with COPD. Never smokers with COPD have been characterized as having milder disease, being older and not having an increased risk of CVD comorbidity compared with current and former smokers [47]. The implications in relation to vitamin D status have not been studied. A second limitation of our study is the cross-sectional design; we cannot infer cause and effect relationship between the found determinants and vitamin D levels. Moreover, we do not know the dietary intake of vitamin D or the estimate of sunlight exposure. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency was not specific in subjects with airflow limitation in this sample of older subjects. BMI and physical activity as modifiable factors were associated with vitamin D deficiency. The effect of weight loss and increased physical activity on vitamin D levels should be investigated further in intervention studies.
