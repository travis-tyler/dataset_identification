[{"section_title": "iii", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Every year, millions of new college students arrive on campus lacking the necessary academic skills to perform at the college level. Postsecondary institutions address this problem with extensive remedial programs designed to strengthen students' basic skills. In 2011\u221212, about one-third of all first-and second-year bachelor's degree students-29 percent of those at public 4-year institutions and 41 percent of those at public 2-year institutions-reported having ever taken remedial courses (Skomsvold 2014). Remedial coursetaking rates could be higher if estimates were based on transcript data (Radford and Horn 2012) or if colleges made remedial education mandatory for all students assessed as academically underprepared for college-level work . Despite the prevalence of remedial programs in our nation's colleges, considerable uncertainty remains concerning their short-and long-term efficacy (Kurlaender and Howell 2012). While much research on the effectiveness of remedial education has been conducted, rigorous studies are limited and the results have been mixed. This Statistical Analysis Report attempts to contribute to the literature with a descriptive analysis of beginning postsecondary students' coursetaking spanning the 6-year period between 2003 and 2009, documenting the scope, intensity, timing, and completion of remedial coursetaking and its association with various postsecondary outcomes among students who began at public 2-and 4-year institutions. Remedial education programs may include support services in addition to precollege-level coursework, both of which are designed to get underprepared students ready for college-level work. However, this report focuses only on remedial coursework (not support services), using the terms remedial coursetaking, college remediation, or simply remediation interchangeably to describe students' participation in college preparatory coursework at the postsecondary level. The study addresses the following questions: \u2022 What percentage of 2003\u221204 beginning postsecondary students at public 2-and 4-year institutions took remedial courses from 2003 to 2009? What types of remedial courses did they take? What was the average number of remedial courses taken? \u2022 Who took remedial courses? When did students take these courses? What were their completion rates? Not all students who enrolled in remedial courses passed them. About half of remedial coursetakers beginning at public 2-year institutions (49 percent) completed all the remedial courses they attempted (referred to as remedial completers in this report) (table 3). The remedial completion rate among those beginning at public 4-year institutions was somewhat higher at 59 percent. Overall, 16 percent of remedial coursetakers beginning at public 2-year institutions and 15 percent of those beginning at public 4-year institutions did not complete any of the remedial courses they attempted (remedial noncompleters). The remaining students, about 35 percent of remedial coursetakers beginning at public 2-year institutions and 25 percent of those beginning at public 4-year institutions, completed some but not all of their remedial courses (partial remedial completers)."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Remedial Coursetakers", "text": "Because remedial courses are designed to strengthen academic skills, remediation was highly concentrated among students with limited academic preparation. 1 Among those beginning at public 2-year institutions, 75 percent of weakly prepared students, compared with 48 percent of strongly prepared students, took remedial courses during their college years (figure 1). Among those beginning at public 4-year institutions, the remediation rate for weakly prepared students was more than four times that for strongly prepared students (77 percent vs. 18 percent). Nevertheless, some weakly prepared students did not take any remedial courses (25 percent at public 2-year institutions and 23 percent at 4-year institutions), while some strongly 1 In this report, students' academic preparation is a composite measure derived from three precollege academic indicators: high school grade point average (GPA), highest mathematics course taken in high school, and college admission test (ACT or SAT) scores. BPS:04/09 did not collect data on these three measures for students age 24 or older; therefore, information on the academic preparation composite measure is only available for students under age 24. To prevent sample loss, students age 24 or older (about 13 percent of the study sample) were grouped into an \"unknown\" category in the academic preparation composite measure and retained in all analyses conducted for this report. Discussion of the results on students' precollege academic preparation, however, was only pertinent to students under age 24. See appendix A for a detailed construction of this composite measure. vi EXECUTIVE SUMMARY prepared students took one or more remedial courses (48 percent at public 2-year institutions and 18 percent at public 4-year institutions). These findings may reflect misalignment between high school and college academic standards and varying policies on remedial education and placement across states and institutions (Dillon and Smith 2013;Hughes and Scott-Clayton 2011;Kurlaender and Howell 2012). Participation in remediation was more common among several demographic groups, including Blacks and Hispanics 2 (at both types of institutions), students from lowincome backgrounds 3 (at both types of institutions), first-generation students 4 (at public 4-year institutions), and female students (at public 2-year institutions) (table 2). Regardless of these subgroup differences, college remediation overall was widespread, affecting both disadvantaged and advantaged populations. For example, among students who began at public 2-year institutions and came from high-income or college-educated families, a majority participated in remedial education (59 percent and 65 percent, respectively). Among students who began at 4-year institutions, about a third of students in these groups (33 percent and 31 percent, respectively) participated in remedial education. In addition, nearly 30 percent of students who entered highly selective 4-year institutions took one or more remedial courses during their undergraduate career.\nBecause remedial courses are designed to strengthen academic skills, it is not surprising that the majority of incoming college students with limited academic preparation take such courses. Depending on which academic preparation measure is used, the percentage of college freshmen taking remedial courses over their college careers ranges from 62 percent among those with a high school grade point average (GPA) below 2.5 to 68 percent among those who took no math beyond algebra to 74 percent among those with a combined verbal and math college admission test score (SAT) below 701 out of the full score of 1,600 (Radford and Horn 2012). Remediation is also high among students enrolling in 2-year or less selective 4-year institutions, where admission policies are open or relatively less restrictive. In addition, higher proportions of Black and Hispanic students, first-generation students (i.e., students whose parents did not attend college), and those from lowincome backgrounds participate in remedial education than do their peers (Adelman 2004;Attewell et al. 2006;Radford and Horn 2012;Snyder and Dillow 2012).\nBecause remedial courses are designed to strengthen limited academic skills, remediation is highly concentrated among students with weak academic preparation. At public 2-year institutions, 75 percent of beginning students with weak academic preparation took remedial courses, compared with 48 percent of those with strong academic preparation (figure 1). At public 4-year institutions, the remediation rate for weakly prepared students was more than four times the rate for strongly prepared students (77 percent vs. 18 percent). Nevertheless, the common perception that remedial coursework is strictly the domain of students with weak academic skills is not accurate. BPS:04/09 data show that many weakly prepared students did not take any remedial courses in college (25 and 23 percent at public 2-and 4-year institutions, respectively), while substantial shares of those with strong academic preparation did so (48 and 18 percent at public 2-and 4-year institutions, respectively) (figure 1). These findings may reflect misalignment between high school and college standards, varying policies on remediation across states, and the different assessment and placement strategies used by different institutions 25  . 24 All bivariate comparisons in this study were tested for statistical significance using a two-tailed Student's t statistic to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless specifically noted, all differences cited in the report were statistically significant at the .05 level. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons; consequently, some differences noted here might not be significant if multiple comparison procedures were used. 25 These findings could also be caused by arbitrary cutoffs and the coarseness of the composite academic preparation measure used in this study. See appendix A for a detailed construction of this composite measure.   Remediation was more common among several demographic groups typically associated with having weak academic preparation. At public 2-year institutions, 78 percent of Black students and 75 percent of Hispanic students (vs. 64 percent of White students) and 76 percent of students who were in the lowest income group (vs. 59 percent of those in the highest) took remedial courses (table 2). Similar differences were also found at public 4-year institutions: 66 percent of Black students and 53 percent of Hispanic students, compared with 36 percent of White students, took remedial courses; 52 percent of students in the lowest income group took remedial courses, while 33 percent of those in the highest income group did so. Remediation was also more prevalent among first-generation students and among older students at public 4-year institutions (54 percent for students whose parents had no more than a high school education vs. 31 percent for students whose parents earned a bachelor's or higher degree; 66 percent for students age 24 or older vs. 39 and 37 percent for those age 19 and age 18 or younger, respectively), but the differences by level of parental education were not detected 26 and the difference by age was reversed 27 at public 2-year institutions (table 2). Furthermore, proportionally more females than males at public 2-year institutions took remedial courses (71 percent vs. 65 percent), but the sex difference was not detected at public 4-year institutions. 26 An undetected difference between two estimates is not equivalent to no difference. The former implies that the difference may exist but is not detected given the sample size and standard errors of the estimates, while the latter represents the true equivalence between the two estimates. 27 Among students who started at public 2-year institutions, 70 and 69 percent for those age 19 and age 18 or younger, respectively, compared with 62 percent of those age 24 or older, took remedial courses.  Table 2. REMEDIAL COURSETAKING: Among 2003-04 beginning postsecondary students who first enrolled in public 2-and 4-year institutions, percentage who took remedial courses in any field, and of those students, average number of remedial courses taken, by selected characteristics: 2003\u221209"}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Outcomes of Remedial Coursetakers", "text": "This study began by examining the bivariate relationships between remedial enrollment/completion status and various postsecondary outcomes, including whether students enrolled and earned credits in college-level English and math courses; whether students persisted through college; whether public 2-year students subsequently transferred to a 4-year institution; how many college-level credits students earned; and whether students attained a postsecondary credential, especially a bachelor's degree, by the sixth year after their initial college entry. The study then examined the net association between remedial course enrollment/completion and these outcomes, controlling for many preexisting factors that may be associated with remedial placement, completion, and subsequent postsecondary outcomes. The main findings are highlighted below. \u2022 Remedial completion is associated with positive postsecondary outcomes. Bivariate results showed that remedial completers experienced EXECUTIVE SUMMARY vii better postsecondary outcomes than did partial remedial completers and noncompleters in terms of attaining various postsecondary outcomes, e.g., earning college-level English and math credits (tables 4 and 5), transferring to a 4-year institution (table 6), persisting through college (figure 5), accumulating college-level credits (table 7), and attaining a bachelor's degree (figure 7). In addition, remedial completers did as well as or even better than those who did not take any remedial courses in such areas as earning college-level English credits (table 4), transferring to a 4-year institution (table 6), and persisting through college (figure 5). Overall, remedial noncompleters experienced the worst outcomes, while partial completers showed mixed results. \u2022 Not all remedial completers experienced favorable outcomes once various demographic, academic, enrollment, and contextual characteristics were controlled for in the multivariate analysis. 5 As summarized in table A, the positive associations between remedial completion and various outcomes were apparent among weakly prepared students but not among moderately or strongly prepared students. For example, after controlling for related characteristics, remedial math completers with weak academic preparation surpassed their counterparts 6 without math remediation in many areas: they had a higher probability of earning college-level math credits (21 and 19 percentage points higher among students beginning at public 2-and 4-year institutions, respectively) (table 10), had a lower probability of dropping out of college during the first 2 years in college (11 percentage points lower among students beginning at public 4-year institutions) (table 11), and earned more college-level credits through 2009 (students beginning at public 2-and 4-year institutions earned 18 and 24 more credits, respectively (table 13). For students beginning at public 4-year institutions, remedial English/reading completers with weak academic preparation had a higher probability of earning college-level English credits (10 percentage points higher) (table 9) than their counterparts without English/reading remediation, and remedial completers with weak preparation had a higher probability of earning a bachelor's degree viii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (21 percentage points higher) (table 14) than their counterparts who did not take any remedial courses. None of these positive outcomes, however, was observed for remedial completers with moderate or strong preparation when compared with their counterparts who had similar demographic and enrollment characteristics and academic preparation but did not take remedial courses (table A). That is, there was no apparent advantage for remedial completers with moderate to strong preparation who began at 2-or 4-year institutions in terms of acquiring math or English credits or total college credits, persisting in college, or earning a bachelor's degree 6 years later when compared with nonremedial students who had similar demographic and enrollment characteristics and academic preparation. \u2022 The outcomes of partial remedial completers also varied with their precollege academic preparation. As shown in table A, partial remedial completers with weak academic preparation performed at least as well as their nonremedial counterparts in all areas except for bachelor's degree attainment. 7 When looking at the moderately/strongly prepared group, the pattern was different: partial remedial completers fared worse than their nonremedial counterparts in many areas. For instance, at public 2-year institutions, partial remedial completers with moderate or strong preparation had lower probabilities of earning college-level English credits than their nonremedial counterparts did (30 percentage points lower) (table 9). At both public 2-and 4-year institutions, partial remedial completers with moderate or strong preparation had lower probabilities of earning college-level math credits than their nonremedial counterparts (28 and 16 percentage points lower, respectively) (table 10). Those starting at public 2-year institutions also had lower probabilities of transferring to a 4-year institution than their nonremedial counterparts (13-19 percentage points lower depending on the transfer measure used) (table 12). Gaps were further observed for the number of college-level credits earned through 2009: partial remedial English/reading completers with moderate or strong preparation earned fewer college-level credits through 2009 than their nonremedial counterparts (26 and 34 fewer credits at public 2-and 4-year institutions, respectively) (table 13). Finally, partial remedial completers with moderate or strong preparation had lower probabilities of earning a bachelor's degree within 6 years after entering college than their nonremedial counterparts did (10-21 percentage points lower depending on the comparison group) (table 14).

However, students who took no remedial math courses enrolled and earned credits in collegelevel math courses at the highest rates (89 and 85 percent, respectively), surpassing remedial math completers, partial completers, and noncompleters.\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Students beginning at public 4-year institutions", "text": "x EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u2022 Remedial noncompleters lagged behind their nonremedial counterparts for most of the outcomes examined, but those with moderate or strong preparation lagged even further behind when compared with their nonremedial counterparts with similar demographic and enrollment characteristics and academic preparation. For example, while remedial math noncompleters at public 2-year institutions generally had a lower probability of earning college-level math credits than their counterparts without math remediation, the gap appeared to be wider among the moderately/strongly prepared group (47 percentage points lower) than the weakly prepared group (23 percentage points lower) (table 10). Similarly, remedial math noncompleters at public 2-year institutions generally earned fewer college-level credits than nonremedial math students, but the difference tended to be greater among the moderately/strongly prepared (27 credits fewer) than among the weakly prepared (18 credits fewer) (table 13). At public 4-year institutions, while remedial noncompleters with weak preparation did not differ measurably from their nonremedial counterparts in their probabilities of earning a bachelor's degree 6 years after college entry, remedial noncompleters with moderate/strong preparation had a lower probability of earning a bachelor's degree (28 percentage points lower) than their nonremedial counterparts did (table 14). In sum, the relationship between students' participation in and completion of remedial coursework and their subsequent college outcomes varied by their level of academic preparedness. Weakly prepared students who successfully completed all remedial courses (English/reading or math) experienced better postsecondary outcomes than did their counterparts who were weakly prepared but did not enroll in remedial courses. Similar patterns, however, did not hold for remedial completers with moderate/strong preparation when compared with their counterparts (i.e., students who had similar demographic and enrollment characteristics and academic preparation) who did not enroll in remedial courses. In almost all comparisons, remedial completers with moderate/strong preparation did not demonstrate significantly better or worse outcomes than their nonremedial counterparts when academic preparation and background characteristics were taken into account. Students who enrolled in but failed to complete remedial courses experienced worse outcomes than did their counterparts who had similar backgrounds but did not take remedial courses. Holding students' demographic and enrollment characteristics constant, remedial noncompleters, especially those with moderate/strong preparation, were less likely to move on to college-level courses, persist through college, transfer to a 4-year institution, earn sufficient numbers of credits toward  \nRegardless of these subgroup differences, college remedial coursetaking overall is a widespread phenomenon, involving both disadvantaged and advantaged populations. For example, among students who began at public 2-year institutions and came from high-income or college-educated families, a majority participated in remedial education (59 and 65 percent, respectively) (table 2). Among students who began at 4-year institutions, about a third of students in these groups (33 and 31 percent, respectively) participated in remedial education. In addition, nearly 30 percent of students who first entered highly selective 4-year institutions took at least one remedial course during the course of their postsecondary enrollment. The total income in 2003-04 for independent students or parents of dependent students. 3 This was derived from three precollege academic indicators: high school GPA, highest mathematics course taken in high school, and college admission test scores (ACT or SAT). Information for this variable is only available for students under age 24. Those age 24 or above (about 13 percent of the study sample) are included in the \"unknown\" category. See appendix A for a detailed construction of this variable. 4 The selectivity of institution was developed only for public and private nonprofit 4-year institutions using the following criteria: whether the institution was open admission (had no minimal requirements); the number of applicants; the number of students admitted; the 25th and 75th percentiles of ACT and/or SAT scores; and whether test scores were required for admission.

Consistent with their academic preparation, these students had higher remedial course completion rates than their peers with weak academic preparation did.

See table C-3 for complete regression results."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Every year, a sizeable percentage of new college students arrive on campus without the academic skills necessary for college-level work. For example, using transcript data and reading assessment scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Greene and Winters (2005) found that two-thirds of public school students in the 2002 high school graduating class were not college ready. Colleges and universities address this problem with extensive remedial programs designed to make up for students' weak preparation (Parsad and Lewis 2003). In 2011\u221212, about 29 percent of first-and second-year students enrolled in public 4-year institutions reported having taken remedial coursework after high school graduation, as did 41 percent of first-and second-year students at public 2-year institutions (Skomsvold 2014). Remediation rates could be higher if estimates were based on transcript data (Radford and Horn 2012) or if remediation were a mandated prerequisite to collegelevel work (Bailey and Cho 2010). 8 Postsecondary remediation has been a subject of ongoing debate among policymakers and educators for a long time (Martorell and McFarlin 2010). Supporters argue that remedial courses and services expand educational opportunities for underprepared students, giving them a chance to gain the competencies necessary for college success and gainful employment. Opponents contend that remedial education is costly and that colleges should not pay for academic preparation that students should have received in secondary schools (Bahr 2008). Critics add that remedial coursetaking increases the requirements that students need to fulfill before taking college-level courses, thereby prolonging time to degree and potentially hindering transfer and completion (Bettinger and Long 2005). Despite the investment in remedial programs and the large proportion of U.S. postsecondary students participating in them, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding their short-and long-term effects (Kurlaender and Howell 2012). While research on the effectiveness of remedial education abounds, rigorous studies are limited, and the results are often mixed. This Statistical Analysis Report attempts to contribute to the literature by using nationally representative data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and its associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09) to examine a INTRODUCTION range of short-and long-term postsecondary outcomes associated with remedial coursetaking among students beginning at public 2-and 4-year institutions. Capitalizing on the transcript data collected through BPS:04/09, this study provided transcript-based estimates of remedial course enrollment among various student subgroups. These estimates were based on coursetaking records from transcripts collected from all the postsecondary institutions that respondents of BPS:04/09 attended from 2003 to 2009. To provide a context for this analysis, the following sections review the research literature on college remediation, describe the purpose of this study and its research questions, discuss data sources and samples used for the analysis, and address some limitations of this study."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Remedial education (also developmental education or college remediation) 9 describes precollege-level courses and support services provided by postsecondary institutions to help academically underprepared students succeed in college-level courses (Institute for Higher Education Policy 1998). This report narrows this broad definition, referring to remedial education specifically as courses that are offered by postsecondary institutions but that cover curricular content below the college level. 10 Most remedial courses are designed to address entering postsecondary students' lowlevel skills in English/reading and math (Kurlaender and Howell 2012). Remedial English/reading courses focus on advancing students' literacy (reading and writing) skills, whereas remedial math courses are typically designed to prepare students for first-level college math courses (Hughes and Scott-Clayton 2011). The concept of college remediation is simple: students who arrive on campus unready for college-level work are provided with assistance to bring them up to an adequate level of academic proficiency. In practice, however, remedial education is complicated: the system is characterized by high costs with largely unknown benefits, lack of consensus about the definition of college readiness, and varying policies and implementing strategies across states and institutions (Bailey 2009;Bettinger, Boatman, and Long 2013;Kurlaender and Howell 2012). Because remedial courses cover precollege materials, the credits that students earn in these courses are usually not counted toward graduation requirements. Consequently, remedial students often need more time than nonremedial students to earn a credential (Lewis and Farris 1996)."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Policy Context for Remedial Education", "text": "With an estimated annual cost of over $2 billion 11 (Strong American Schools 2008), the debate about the investment in college remediation has intensified in recent years. As budgets become more constrained, many states question whether and how remediation should be offered and have implemented or are considering policies that would limit remedial services at postsecondary institutions (Bettinger and Long 2007;Merisotis and Phipps 2000). Some states (e.g., Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia) have reduced the number of remedial course offerings. Others have attempted to shift the primary responsibility for remediation to community colleges (e.g., Illinois, Montana, Tennessee, and Texas). Several states have implemented drastic measures to change remedial education. For example, Georgia recently adopted a policy requiring that all prospective students who do not have SAT/ACT scores take a placement test and be denied admission if they do not pass the minimum requirements for college-level courses. 12 Ohio passed legislation that would pull state subsidies from all remedial courses in state universities beginning in 2014. 13 In 2013, Florida approved legislation that gives community college students the choice of skipping remediation, even when college advisers or placement tests say they need it (Fain 2013). Finally, in 2012, Connecticut's General Assembly passed historic legislation that prohibits state community colleges from offering more than one semester of remedial instruction to students (Inside Higher Ed 2012). The high cost of remediation has also spurred debates among researchers about how to determine students' college readiness and place them into appropriate coursework (Bailey, Jeong, and Cho 2010;Hassel and Giordano 2015;Hughes and Scott-Clayton 2011). Thus far, however, there is no consensus definition for college readiness, direct measures of readiness are not available, and remedial and placement policies often vary across institutions and states (Bettinger and Long 2005; National Center on Education and the Economy 2013; Roderick, Nagaoka, and Coca 2009). 11 National data regarding the costs of college remediation are limited. A widely cited early study estimated that U.S. postsecondary institutions spent about $1\u22122 billion annually on remedial education (Breneman and Haarlow 1998). Another study suggested that the annual cost of remediation was between $1.9 and $2.3 billion at community colleges and about 500 million dollars at 4-year colleges (Strong American Schools 2008). A more recent study estimated that the cost of remediation at community college alone could be as high as $4 billion per year (Scott-Clayton and Rodriguez 2012). 12 University System of Georgia.

For example, philanthropists have demonstrated a growing interest in efforts to strengthen the weak academic skills of college students . Private foundations, such as the Lumina Foundation for Education, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, have launched and funded various initiatives designed to improve remedial education and increase completion rates of students with weak academic skills. Many colleges across the country are trying new, customized approaches to shortening the time needed for remedial education, thereby helping students move into college-level courses more quickly (Government Accountability Office 2013; Rutschow and Schneider 2011). Additionally, in 2010, President Obama signed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, providing resources to community colleges to meet the needs of students who are likely to require remediation. 14\n"}, {"section_title": "Trends in College Remediation", "text": "Based on students' self-reports in 2011\u221212, one-third of first-and second-year undergraduates overall-29 percent of those in public 4-year institutions and 41 percent of those in public 2-year institutions-had ever participated in remedial coursetaking (Skomsvold 2014). Remediation rates estimated from students' transcript data, however, are much higher. According to a transcript-based study, 50 percent of first-time 2003\u221204 beginning postsecondary students-39 percent of those entering public 4-year institutions and 68 percent of those entering public 2-year institutions-took at least one remedial course during their undergraduate career (Radford and Horn 2012). The remediation rate also varied by the selectivity of the institution that students first attended, ranging from 58 percent in openadmission 4-year institutions to 51 percent in minimally selective 4-year institutions to 37 percent in moderately selective 4-year institutions to 22 percent in highly selective 4-year institutions (Radford and Horn 2012). The rate could be even higher if remediation becomes a required prerequisite to college-level work. 15 In the California State University system, for instance, all entering students who do not INTRODUCTION 5 meet proficiency thresholds are required to enroll in basic skill courses, and the remediation rate is close to 80 percent (Kurlaender and Howell 2012). Trend analyses indicate that college remediation has declined somewhat over time. Using transcript data, Adelman (2004) found that the percentage of high school students who took remedial courses after entering 4-year institutions decreased from 44 percent in the class of 1982 to 25 percent in the class of 1992, and the percentage among those entering 2-year institutions changed from 63 percent to 61 percent in these cohorts. A downward trend was also reported in a more recent study examining changes in self-reported remedial enrollment rates from 1999-2000 to 2007-08: proportionally fewer first-year students reported taking remedial courses in 2007-08 than in 1999-2000 (21 percent in public 4-year institutions and 24 percent in public 2-year institutions in 2007-08, compared with 25 percent and 30 percent, respectively, in 1999-2000) (Sparks and Malkus 2013). It is unknown whether this decline is a result of an improvement in college readiness, a policy shift away from remediation, increasing numbers of students who deliberately avoid non-creditbearing remedial courses due to increasing college costs, or the possible inaccuracy of self-reported data on remediation."}, {"section_title": "Effects of College Remediation", "text": "Although research on remedial education is abundant, especially since the 1970s, knowledge about its effectiveness is equivocal at best (Bailey 2009;Bettinger, INTRODUCTION Boatman, and Long 2013;Kurlaender and Howell 2012;Levin and Calcagno 2008). Early research mainly focused on simple comparisons between remedial and nonremedial students. While these analyses were useful in providing context, they rarely provided deep understanding of the complex relationships between remediation and postsecondary outcomes. Assessing the impact of remediation is difficult because remedial students possess many characteristics that are associated with both their need for remediation and their likelihood of success in college. With these characteristics, remedial students are likely to do worse than nonremedial students in the absence of intervention. An informative assessment of the impact of remediation on postsecondary outcomes requires a comparison group that is as similar as possible to remedial students on preexisting characteristics and conditions, thus controlling against possible selection biases. In recent years, research has begun to employ more rigorous methods 16 to address these methodological challenges. The results have been mixed. While some studies did not find significant impacts of remediation on retention, transfer, and degree completion (e.g., Calcagno and Long 2008;Martorell and McFarlin 2010;Scott-Clayton and Rodriguez 2012), others revealed that remedial coursetaking improved students' chances of completing college-level courses, persisting in college, and attaining a degree, with the effects particularly evident for students who successfully completed remedial courses (Attewell et al. 2006;Bahr 2008Bahr , 2010Bettinger and Long 2005;Lesik 2006). Evidence also suggests that the effects of remedial coursework may vary by the level of prior academic preparation, with remediation potentially benefiting severely unprepared students more than others (Boatman and Long 2010). Despite these findings, the research community lacks a substantial knowledge base about the effectiveness of remedial education. Studies tend to be small and typically focus on one state or a single college. Some of the most rigorous studies are confined to students on the margins of needing remedial courses, precluding the generalizability of their findings to other populations and contexts. Furthermore, many studies do not track students over an extended period of time, precluding analyses of long-term outcomes (Bettinger, Boatman, and Long 2013;Kurlaender and Howell 2012)."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION 7", "text": "Study Questions, Key Terms, and Organization of the Report"}, {"section_title": "Study Questions", "text": "This study used nationally representative data from BPS:04/09 and its associated transcript study (PETS:09) to examine the scope, timing, and completion of remedial coursetaking and its association with various postsecondary outcomes among students who began their postsecondary education at public 2-and 4-year institutions across the United States. The study addressed these issues through the following questions: \u2022 What percentage of 2003\u221204 beginning postsecondary students at public 2-and 4-year institutions took remedial courses from 2003 to 2009? What types of remedial courses did they take? What was the average number of remedial courses taken? \u2022 Who took remedial courses? When did students take these courses? What were their completion rates? \u2022 Did remedial course completers and noncompleters experience different postsecondary outcomes than students who had similar demographic backgrounds, academic preparation, and enrollment characteristics but did not take any remedial courses? This study focused on public 2-and 4-year institutions for several reasons. 17 The vast majority of remedial coursetakers are concentrated at public 2-and 4-year institutions; 18 recent policy concerns about college remediation generally target public institutions, especially public 2-year community colleges (Complete College America 2012); and the samples of remedial coursetakers at various types of private institutions in BPS:04/09 are too small to support a reliable analysis. Due to differences in the remedial policies, scope, and intensity of remediation, and preparation of incoming students at public 2-and 4-year institutions, this study separated analyses for students beginning at public 2-year institutions and those beginning at public 4-year institutions. Much of the analysis also separated remedial English/reading coursetaking from remedial math coursetaking due to different remediation rates in these two areas (Radford and Horn 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Key Terms", "text": "Remedial Courses. This study identified remedial courses using the codes developed for PETS:09 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). BPS:04/09's PETS:09 collected information on all courses (e.g., course titles, credits, grades) that students attempted in all institutions that they had attended from 2003 to 2009. All courses were assigned a PETS code aligned with the 2010 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) taxonomy developed by NCES (Wine, Janson, and Wheeless 2011). Remedial courses were designated based on course titles and content descriptions. In general, courses described with terms like developmental, remedial, precollegiate, and basic skills were considered remedial. Identifying remedial courses is often difficult because there is no universally accepted definition of remedial courses, course descriptions do not always carry explicit terms to signify that the courses are remedial, and institutions also have varying policies and practices on remediation (Bobo et al. 2013; Institute for Higher Education Policy 1998; Lewis and Farris 1996;Wine, Janson, and Wheeless 2011). 19 Lewis and Farris (1996), for example, found that institutions had different policies for English as a second language (ESL): 38 percent of institutions offering ESL courses considered all of these courses to be remedial, while another 38 percent considered none of their ESL courses to be remedial. Given these uncertainties, it is likely that in this study some courses that are not remedial have been classified as remedial and some courses that are remedial have not been identified as such. For detailed information about how PETS codes were derived and how courses were coded in the BPS:04/09 PETS data file, see Wine, Janson, and Wheeless (2011) and Bryan (2012). Appendix D provides a detailed list of the courses classified as remedial in this study. College-Level Courses. In theory, any course that offers credit and leads to a degree or certificate from a postsecondary institution is a college-level course. In reality, however, the criteria and guidelines used to determine the level of courses may vary among institutions and states, resulting in inconsistent definitions. For simplicity, this study combined all English and math courses in PETS:09 that are not designated as remedial into college-level English and math courses, respectively. This classification strategy may result in counting some vocational courses-especially those where the distinction between remedial and college-level courses is blurred (e.g., technical INTRODUCTION 9 math)-as college-level courses. While this study cannot determine the nature of these vocational courses, it is important to note that the vast majority of U.S. postsecondary institutions offer vocational or career and technical education courses designed to prepare students for jobs after college (Levesque et al. 2008). These courses are concentrated in 2-year institutions, 20 and credits earned in these courses often lead to an associate's degree or a certificate. See appendix D for a detailed list of all collegelevel English and math courses used in this study. Remedial Students. This study referred to students who took at least one remedial course during their college enrollment as remedial students. The percentage of remedial students reported in this study indicates the extent of remedial course participation but not the full extent of the need for remediation. Nonremedial Students. This study referred to students who did not take remedial courses during their college enrollment as nonremedial students. Because not all institutions strictly enforce remediation for students deemed as underprepared for college , some students who are referred to remedial courses may skip remedial coursework entirely. By definition, such students were included in the nonremedial group in this study. It is important to note that the term nonremedial students used in this study simply indicates that these students did not participate in remedial coursetaking in college. It does not mean that all students in this group were college ready and thus not in need of remedial coursework. Remedial Completers, Partial Remedial Completers, and Remedial Noncompleters. Not all students who enrolled in remedial courses completed them. This study identified three groups of remedial students based on their remedial course completion status: remedial completers are those who completed all the remedial courses they attempted; partial remedial completers are those who completed some but not all of the remedial courses they attempted; and remedial noncompleters are those who did not complete any remedial courses they attempted."}, {"section_title": "Organization", "text": "The analysis of this report was organized into three main sections. The first section documented how much remediation occurred among postsecondary students beginning at public 2-and 4-year institutions, described what kinds of students took remedial courses, and determined the timing of their remedial enrollment and completion rates. The second section focused on remedial students who attained various levels of success in remedial coursework, comparing their postsecondary INTRODUCTION outcomes to those of students who did not enter remediation. The third section turned to multivariate analysis, exploring whether remedial coursetaking had any association with various postsecondary outcomes after controlling for other characteristics available in BPS:04/09 that are identified in the literature as important to both the need for remediation and success in college. The multivariate analysis also explored the interaction between remediation and academic preparation while controlling for other characteristics, determining whether the association of remediation with various outcomes differs or is conditioned by students' prior preparation for college. It is important to note that although the multivariate results may suggest topics for further research that might examine questions of causality, this study remains descriptive and does not purport to identify causal relationships and determine the effects of remediation."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Study Sample", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Data for this report came from BPS:04/09 and its associated transcript study, PETS:09. BPS:04/09 followed a nationally representative sample of first-time college students who began postsecondary education in 2003\u221204 for a total of 6 years, through 2009. BPS sample members were initially identified in the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04). 21 Approximately 19,000 NPSAS:04 sample members were confirmed as first-time beginning students. Interviews were then conducted three times: in 2004, around the end of their first year in postsecondary education; in 2006, about 3 years after students' initial college entry; and in 2009, about 6 years after students first enrolled. Through student interviews and other sources, data collected include students' demographic characteristics; their persistence in and completion of postsecondary education programs; their transition into employment; and changes over time in their goals, marital status, income, and debt, among other indicators.

The sample was further narrowed to students who began their postsecondary education at public 2-and 4-year institutions and who also had transcript data available for analysis. After these selections, the final study sample consisted of about 9,000 students-approximately 5,000 who began their postsecondary education at public 2-year institutions and 4,000 who began at public 4-year institutions. 22 Because these two groups of students participated in remediation at different rates, they were analyzed separately throughout the study. For brevity, the two groups are sometimes referred to as \"students at public 2-or 4-year institutions\" or \"public 2-or 4-year college students\" in the text, although some students subsequently transferred to a different level of institution."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Readers should be aware of the following limitations of this study. First, because BPS:04/09 is a general-purpose survey on postsecondary education, its questions and survey elements were not specifically tailored to include all variables relevant to research on college remediation. Some factors identified in the literature as potentially important to remedial coursetaking (e.g., placement test scores; remedial course sequences; students' motivation, engagement, and study skills; and institutions' remediation policies and implementation) were not measured in BPS:04/09. Consequently, the multivariate analysis in this study cannot control for all the factors that are potentially related to remedial course enrollment and success, and the results of this analysis may be biased. For example, the difference in an outcome between remedial and nonremedial students may be attributable to some unmeasured attributes, such as students' self-efficacy, motivation, and study skills, rather than taking remedial coursework per se (MacArthur, Philippakos, and Graham INTRODUCTION 2015). Readers are cautioned not to draw conclusions regarding causality based on the descriptive findings presented in this report. Second, this study reported data only on student participation in remedial coursework in college. BPS:04/09 did not collect assessment/placement data, which would have allowed the analysis to take into account students' skill level when they entered college. Prior research documents a gap between referral to remediation and actual remedial enrollment (i.e., not all underprepared students take the remedial courses that the institution recommends for them) (Bailey, Jeong, and Cho 2010). Thus, the group of nonremedial students in this study includes both students who are college ready and thus not in need of remedial coursework and those who may have been in need of such coursework. It is important to note that the findings presented here reflect only remedial course participation and not the full extent of the need for remediation among the 2003\u221204 cohort of beginning postsecondary students. Third, the design of this study would be strengthened if the multivariate analysis could control for the level or sequence of remediation. Many colleges offer multiple levels of remedial coursework in each subject area and place students into a particular level according to placement test scores (Boatman and Long 2010). Students who are placed into the lower levels usually have more remedial courses to take and are therefore at greater risk of not completing remediation. Due to lack of appropriate data in BPS:04/09 (e.g., remedial referral, placement, and course sequence), it is impossible to incorporate the level and sequence of remediation into the analysis in this study. Fourth, the terms remedial completers, partial remedial completers, and remedial noncompleters as defined in this study do not perfectly reflect students' success or failure in remediation. Without remedial placement and course sequence data in BPS:04/09, remedial completers as defined in this study may include, for example, students who completed low-level remedial courses (e.g., arithmetic) and moved on to college-level courses without taking the next level of remedial courses (e.g., intermediate algebra) in a sequence. At the same time, partial remedial completers and noncompleters may include, for example, students who were required to take only high-level remedial courses and took them but failed some or all. In this regard, some partial completers and noncompleters may have been more advanced in the remedial sequence than some remedial completers. If these three remedial groups were defined accurately (e.g., if remedial completers were only those who completed the entire remedial sequence recommended for them by their institution), the differences among these three groups may be different from what are observed in this analysis. Fifth, one critical piece of information needed for research on remediationstudents' precollege academic preparation-is missing for some students. BPS:04/09 collected data on students' high school grades, the highest math course taken in high school, and college entrance exam scores, all of which were used to construct a composite measure of precollege academic preparation (see appendix A for a detailed construction of this variable). However, information on these measures was not collected for certain students (mainly those who were age 24 or older at the time of the interview). 23 Consequently, all estimates pertinent to students' precollege academic preparation are only applicable for students under age 24. Lastly, this report used transcript data to identify remedial courses. While transcript data may produce more accurate estimates of remedial coursetaking than students' self-reported data do, they have several drawbacks that may induce potential biases. For example, complete transcripts were not received for about 13 percent of sample members in PETS:09 (Wine, Janson, and Wheeless 2011). In addition, some transcripts may have had missing data. The absence of complete or partial transcript information for some students may lead to underestimates of remedial coursetakers in this report."}, {"section_title": "Remedial Coursetaking: Scope, Intensity, Timing, and Completion Rates at Public 2-and 4-Year Institutions", "text": "This section begins with an overview of remedial coursetaking among a cohort of students who started their postsecondary education at public 2-and 4-year institutions in 2003\u221204.

For example, proportionally more students beginning at public 2-year institutions than at public 4-year institutions took two or more remedial courses (48 percent vs. 21 percent) and took remedial courses across multiple subjects (26 percent vs. 9 percent).

Students' expectations, however, may not accurately represent their plans because many students do not understand that bachelor's or graduate degrees cannot be earned at 2-year institutions, for example, or that these degrees may not be necessary to work in their intended occupation (Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, and Person 2009). For instance, when asked whether they planned to transfer to a 4-year institution, 55 percent indicated that they intended to do so, proportionally fewer than the 82 percent who said they expected to earn a bachelor's or advanced degree. The  percentage of students who actually transferred to a 4-year institution was even lower. Based on several measures that describe transfer behaviors in BPS:04/09, one-quarter of beginning public 2-year college students first transferred to a 4-year institution; 31 29 percent were last enrolled in a 4-year institution as of 2009; and 32 percent reported ever attending a 4-year institution from 2003 to 2009 (table 6). These figures increased somewhat when the sample was further restricted to students who expressed an interest in transferring to a 4-year institution or those who expected to earn a bachelor's or higher degree. For example, among beginning public 2-year college students who planned to transfer to a 4-year institution, 37 percent first transferred to a 4-year institution; 41 percent were last enrolled in a 4-year institution; and 45 percent reported ever attending a 4-year institution between 2003 and 2009.   Last institution enrolled was a 4-year institution\nThis outcome was only applicable for students beginning at public 2-year institutions. Two transfer measures were examined in the MNP analysis: whether students made their first transfer to a 4-year institution and whether the institution students last attended through 2009 was a 4-year institution. The regression results for these two outcome variables were largely similar. Overall, the association of remediation with transfer varied by students' level of academic preparation (table 12). For example, among weakly prepared students, remedial English/reading completers had a similar probability of transferring to a 4-year institution as those without English/reading remediation. Among the moderately/strongly prepared group, however, remedial English/reading completers had a lower probability of transferring to a 4-year institution (8 percentage points lower) than their counterparts. This pattern was also observed for partial remedial completers: among the weakly prepared group, there was no significant difference in the probability of transferring to a 4-year institution between partial remedial English/reading completers and their nonremedial counterparts; among the moderately/strongly prepared group, however, partial remedial English/reading completers had a lower probability than their counterparts who had no English/reading remediation of transferring to a 4-year institution (16 percentage points lower). Generally, regardless of students' academic preparation, remedial noncompleters were less likely than their counterparts without remediation to transfer to a 4-year institution. For example, among the weak preparation group, the probability of transferring to a 4-year institution for remedial English/reading noncompleters was 10 percentage points lower than that for students without English/reading remediation. Among the moderate/strong preparation group, the difference was 13 percentage points."}, {"section_title": "Ever attended a 4-year institution", "text": "Regardless of which measure was used, remedial completers consistently transferred at a higher rate than partial completers and noncompleters did.

Some have argued that placement into remediation may lower students' self-esteem, reduce their educational expectations, and increase their frustrations, all of which may discourage them from persisting in college (Deil-Amen and Rosenbaum 2002;Rosenbaum 2001). Low levels of college persistence are not uniformly distributed across remedial student groups however. Figure 5 presents cumulative percentages of students who had left college without a degree or certificate by the end of each school year from 2003 to 2009 and had not returned as of 2009 (referred to as \"dropout rates\" below for simplicity). 32 It shows that remedial completers at both levels of public institutions had consistently lower dropout rates (therefore higher persistence rates) than remedial noncompleters did. For example, 35 percent of remedial completers at public 2-year institutions and 22 percent of those at public 4-year institutions had left postsecondary education without a degree or certificate by 2009, percentages that were about half those of remedial noncompleters at public 2-and 4-year institutions (67 and 44 percent, respectively).

About 26 percent of remedial completers, compared with 12 percent of noncompleters, earned an associate's degree or certificate. While there were no measurable differences between remedial completers and nonremedial students in their rates of degree attainment (17 and 15 percent earned a bachelor's degree and 26 and 24 percent earned an associate's degree or certificate), proportionally more remedial completers than nonremedial students were still enrolled in 2009 (22 percent vs. 14 percent), again reflecting that remedial students may take more time to attain their degree.   "}, {"section_title": "Linking Remediation and Postsecondary Outcomes: A Multivariate Approach", "text": "Students who take remedial courses often possess a host of characteristics (e.g., lower ability, weaker skills) that are associated with their need for remediation, chance of completing remedial coursework, and eventual success in college. Because remedial and nonremedial students differ in several ways, simple comparisons of the outcomes of these two groups of students cannot accurately reflect the effectiveness of remediation. To estimate the potential benefits of remedial coursetaking, the biggest challenge is to isolate the effects of remediation from those of other factors (e.g., academic preparation) that influence remedial placement, completion, and the attainment of other outcomes. The most rigorous approach would employ an experimental design in which students with weak skills were randomly assigned either to a treatment group that receives remediation or to a control group that does not (Rutschow and Schneider 2011). This method would ensure that, before remediation, students in both groups were \"equivalent\" in every aspect (including measurable and unmeasurable characteristics), hence any subsequent differences in outcomes could be attributed to remedial intervention. Random assignment, though rigorous, is rarely used on a large scale due to its high costs and the ethical issues it poses. In the absence of experimental designs, researchers have focused on quasi-experimental designs, using various statistical tools to attempt to create a comparison group that is very similar to the group of students who receive remediation and then control for any measurable differences between students who participate in remediation and students in the comparison group (Rutschow and Schneider 2011). Three major methods have been used so far to examine the effects of remediation, including regression discontinuity, 34 34 Regression discontinuity can be used when there is a cutoff point that reliably determines who gets assigned to a treatment or control group. In the case of college remediation, a cutoff point on the college placement test is selected to determine two groups of students: those who score just below the cutoff and therefore are placed into remediation and those who score just above the cutoff and therefore are not required to undergo remediation (Boatman and Long 2010;Calcagno and Long 2008;Martorell and McFarlin 2010;Scott-Clayton and Rodriguez 2012). The method assumes that the two samples of students on either side of the cutoff are essentially identical due to some randomness around the cutoff point. By comparing outcomes of these two groups, one can derive a reliable estimate of the effects of remediation. The main criticism of this method is that the results are limited to students on the margin of needing remediation and are not applicable to the weakest students."}, {"section_title": "LINKING REMEDIATION AND POSTSECONDARY OUTCOMES: A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH", "text": "propensity score matching, 35 and conventional regression models attempting to statistically control for any observed or measurable pre-existing characteristics. Results from quasi-experimental designs are not as widely generalizable as those from experimental designs because they usually cannot control for such unobserved or unmeasurable characteristics as motivation. Nevertheless, quasi-experimental approaches improve upon simple bivariate comparisons in terms of mitigating the problem of selection biases. Although regression discontinuity and propensity score matching are the optimal approaches in evaluating the effects of college remediation in nonexperimental settings, these methods were not feasible for the current study for two reasons. First, BPS:04/09 lacks remedial placement test scores, which would be required for regression discontinuity analysis. Second, the sample of nonremedial students at public 2-year institutions (32 percent of all students) was too small to adequately match to remedial students (68 percent) for propensity score matching. 36 Therefore, this study used more conventional multivariate regressions-multinomial probit or negative binomial regression, depending on the outcome-to statistically control for observed characteristics in BPS:04/09 that are likely to be associated with remedial enrollment, completion, and postsecondary outcomes. 37\n\nThe bivariate results showed that partial remedial completers earned fewer collegelevel credits than nonremedial students did.

Remedial completers also compared equivalently or favorably to students who did not take any remedial courses. Overall, remedial noncompleters experienced the worst outcomes, and partial completers experienced mixed results. 35 The purpose of propensity score matching is to restrict the nonexperimental comparison group to a sample that is equivalent to the treatment group in terms of background characteristics (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). In the case of remediation, the method first uses a logistic regression to predict the probability (i.e., the \"propensity score\") of students being assigned to remediation given a set of observed covariates or preconditions (e.g., socioeconomic status, academic preparation). It then matches each remediated student who has a given propensity score with a student who has the closest propensity score but does not receive remediation (Attewell et al. 2006). One disadvantage of this method is that the propensity scores are based on observed covariates; unobservable characteristics that may affect assignment are unaccounted for in the matching process. Another disadvantage is that this method requires large samples and substantial overlaps between treatment and control groups in terms of propensity scores. 36 Propensity score matching was attempted, but the results were not optimal in this study. 37 An early study used both conventional regressions and propensity score matching to assess the impact of college remediation on various postsecondary outcomes and found that these two methods yielded similar results (Attewell et al. 2006). Following up on these bivariate results, the multivariate regression analysis contrasted the three remedial groups' postsecondary outcomes with those of nonremedial students while simultaneously controlling for a wide range of characteristics that may be associated with remedial placement, completion, and other postsecondary outcomes. To provide a more refined analysis, remedial English/reading coursetaking was separated from remedial math coursetaking in all regressions. The results of this analysis helped determine whether students who succeeded or failed in remedial English/reading or math courses experienced better or worse outcomes than their nonremedial counterparts who had similar demographic and enrollment characteristics and academic preparation.

Compared with nonremedial students beginning at 4-year institutions, remedial students were also less prepared for college, enrolled in school part time more often, and had a lower level of academic integration in college (e.g., participation in study groups, interaction with faculty, or contact with academic advisors). Relatively fewer of them had an expectation of attaining a master's or other advanced degree. In addition, remedial students tended to enroll in larger 2-year institutions or smaller 4-year colleges, less selective colleges, or institutions with higher concentrations of minority students. 38 Research has shown that these characteristics are also linked to students' chances of completing remedial courses, moving on to college-level coursework, and eventually succeeding in college (Bailey, Jeong, and Cho 2010;Berkner and Choy 38 Differences were observed at public 2-year institutions.

Thus, the regression analysis below attempted to control for as many of these characteristics as available in BPS:04/09 when examining the association between remediation and postsecondary outcomes. Specifically, the analysis included sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, and income level as demographic factors. Students' academic preparation, the most important determinant of remedial placement, was constructed from three precollege academic indicators: GPA in high school, the highest level math course taken in high school, and college admission test scores (ACT or SAT) (see appendix A for details). Students' initial educational expectations, enrollment intensity, and level of academic integration were included as proxies of student motivation and engagement 39 in postsecondary education. Besides separating students at public 2-and 4-year institutions, the regression analysis employed three additional institution variables to control for contextual factors that may be associated with college remediation: the size, 40 selectivity, and minority concentration of the first institution that students attended. Lastly, due to considerable variation in state policies on remedial education, the region (i.e., cluster of states) where the first-attended institution was located was also introduced into the regressions. 41 Detailed information on all these variables is provided in appendix A. Interaction Terms. College remediation may not benefit all students in the same way. Boatman and Long (2010) found that remedial coursetaking benefited students with weaker skills but provided little help to those at the margin of needing remediation, suggesting that the impact of remediation differs according to students' level of preparation. To explore this interaction, all regression models in this study also included an interaction term between precollege academic preparation and remediation, examining whether the outcomes of remedial students are conditioned on the level of their academic preparation. A significant interaction would indicate that the association between remediation and an outcome differs by students' level of academic preparation."}, {"section_title": "Regression Models", "text": "Depending on the type of outcome variable (categorical or continuous), either a multinomial probit (MNP) regression or negative binomial (NB) regression was used.

The model estimates the predicted probability of attaining one outcome over several mutually exclusive alternatives. The results are often presented as average marginal effects, which measure the change in the predicted probability of observing an outcome when an independent variable changes by one unit while keeping all other variables in the model constant (Liao 1994). NB is used when an outcome variable of interest is a count variable 42 (e.g., the total number of college-level credits that a student earned through 2009 in this study). This regression estimates the change in the predicted value of the outcome associated with a one-unit change in an independent variable while keeping all other variables constant in the model (Hilbe 2007).

The intensity of remediation was particularly evident at public 2-year colleges. BPS data indicate that 48 percent of incoming students at public 2-year institutions (vs. 21 percent of those at public 4-year institutions) took at least two remedial courses, and 26 percent (vs. 9 percent at public 4-year institutions) were enrolled in remedial courses across multiple subjects.

While remediation was concentrated among weakly prepared students, not all students with weak preparation took remedial courses, and conversely, a substantial share of strongly prepared students also took remedial courses. The latter may reflect institutions' varying policies on remedial education and definitions of college readiness. Many students who enrolled in remedial courses did not complete them.

Findings from the bivariate analysis suggested that remedial completers experienced better outcomes than did partial remedial completers and noncompleters in terms of enrolling in college-level English and math courses, transferring to a 4-year institution, persisting in college, accumulating credits that counted toward a credential, and attaining a postsecondary degree. They even outperformed nonremedial students in some areas. Students who enrolled in remedial courses but did not complete any of these courses experienced the worst outcomes, while those who completed some but not all of the remedial courses in which they enrolled had mixed results."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "The multivariate analysis suggested that the positive associations between remedial completion and various outcomes were apparent among weakly prepared students but not among moderately or strongly prepared students. Among those who were weakly prepared, for example, remedial math completers surpassed their counterparts who took no remedial math courses on many outcomes even after controlling for related characteristics: they were more likely to earn college-level math credits (at both types of institutions), were less likely to drop out of college (among those beginning at public 4-year institutions), and accumulated more collegelevel credits as of 2009 (at both types of institutions). Likewise, at public 4-year institutions, remedial English completers with weak preparation were more likely than their counterparts without English/reading remediation to earn college-level English credits and to earn a bachelor's degree. At both public 2-and 4-year institutions, remedial math completers with weak preparation earned more collegelevel credits than their comparable peers without math remediation did. These advantages for remedial completers, however, did not hold among students with moderate/strong preparation. Overall, remedial noncompleters generally lagged behind their nonremedial counterparts on all outcomes, and those with moderate/strong preparation exhibited the lowest probabilities of success after controlling for various factors. For instance, at public 2-year institutions, remedial English/reading noncompleters at both preparation levels were less likely than nonremedial English/reading students to earn college-level English credits, but the gap was 17 percentage points among weakly prepared students and 24 percentage points for moderately/strongly prepared students. Also at public 2-year institutions, remedial math noncompleters generally had a lower probability of earning college-level math credits than nonremedial math students, but the difference appeared to be larger for those with moderate/strong preparation (47 percentage points lower) than for those with weak preparation (23 percentage points lower). Among both weakly and moderately/strongly prepared students who began at public 2-year institutions, remedial math noncompleters earned fewer college-level credits than nonremedial math students did, but the gap tended to be wider among the moderately/strongly prepared (27 fewer credits) than among the weakly prepared (18 fewer credits). At public 4-year institutions, remedial noncompleters with weak preparation were no more or less likely than their nonremedial counterparts to earn a bachelor's degree. Among the moderately/strongly prepared, however, remedial noncompleters were 28 percentage points less likely than their counterparts without remediation to earn a bachelor's degree. In sum, the relationship between students' participation in and completion of remedial coursework and their subsequent college outcomes varied with their level of academic preparation. Weakly prepared beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in remedial English/reading and math courses and completed all of these courses experienced better outcomes relative to their counterparts who did not enroll in these remedial courses. This positive association, however, did not hold for remedial completers with moderate/strong preparation. In most cases, remedial completers and nonremedial students with moderate/strong preparation experienced similar outcomes. Students who enrolled in but failed to complete remedial courses experienced worse outcomes than did their counterparts who had similar backgrounds but did not take remedial courses. Holding students' demographic and enrollment characteristics constant, remedial noncompleters, especially those with moderate/strong preparation, were less likely to move on to college-level courses, persist through college, transfer to a 4-year institution, earn sufficient credits toward graduation, or attain a bachelor's degree within 6 years than their counterparts who did not take remedial courses. Given the different outcomes experienced by remedial completers and noncompleters, further research is needed to identify the underlying obstacles that hinder remedial course completion. Understanding the major obstacles can help colleges and universities better identify struggling students, design strategies to help them overcome their hurdles, and make remedial programs more effective in retaining students and enabling them to progress to college-level curricula and beyond.

The initial sample of approximately 19,000 first-time beginning students was drawn from the 2003\u221204 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04). These students were then surveyed at three time points: in 2004, at the end of their first year in postsecondary education; in 2006, approximately 3 years after they had started postsecondary education; and in 2009, approximately 6 years after they had started. The final BPS:04/09 dataset contains information on nearly 16,700 students with an overall weighted response rate of 89 percent (Radford et al. 2010). In the 2004 interview, first-time beginning students were asked a variety of questions regarding their academic and social experiences during the first year, their work while enrolled, their education plans and long-term goals, their demographic characteristics, and their family responsibilities and backgrounds. The 2006 interview focused on students' enrollment patterns since 2004, including transfers, stopout periods, attendance intensity, and completion of certificates and degrees. Those who were no longer enrolled were asked about their employment experiences. The last B-2 APPENDIX B-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY interview in 2009 focused on the degree completion of those still enrolled after 2006, the graduate school enrollment of those who had completed bachelor's degrees, and the employment of those no longer enrolled. In all 3 study years, student interviews were conducted via web-based questionnaires that were either self-administered or conducted by a trained interviewer via telephone.

Differences between estimates were tested against the probability of a Type I error 52 or significance level. The statistical significance of each comparison was determined by calculating the Student's t value for the difference between each pair of estimates and comparing the t value with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values were computed to test differences between independent estimates using the following formula: There are some hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading because the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in estimates but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large (and possibly statistically significant) t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. Statistical tests are designed to limit the risk of this type of error using a value denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 was selected for findings in this report and ensures that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced when there was no actual difference between the quantities in the underlying population no more than 1 time out of 20. When analysts test hypotheses that show alpha values at the .05 level or smaller, they reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two estimates. Failing to reject a null hypothesis (i.e., failing to detect a difference), however, does not imply the values are the same or equivalent."}, {"section_title": "Multinomial Probit Regression", "text": "Most of the multivariate analysis in this study used multinomial probit (MNP) regression.

MNP is one of the most common statistical techniques used to predict the probability of an event that will occur or the probability of a respondent choosing a certain outcome out of several mutually exclusive alternatives 53 (Borooah 2001;Koop 2008). Assuming that each individual faces a set of outcomes, an MNP model formulation may be written as follows: where represents an individual; represents one of M different outcomes of the dependent variable ; is a vector of independent variables that may be associated with or influence an individual's outcome or choice; and the error term, , is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. MNP assumes that each individual chooses the option yielding the highest utility of all alternatives. That is, an individual i chooses the outcome j if the outcome is the highest for j: The probability of an individual i choosing outcome j is conditional on or a function of the set of independent variables, : where for a probit analysis, F represents a cumulative probability function based on the normal distribution. Only M\u22121 of the probabilities can be freely specified because the probability for all alternatives sum to one (i.e., . The parameters of MNP models are generally not directly interpretable. Instead, researchers often rely on marginal effects (ME) to interpret MNP results (Liao 1994). The ME for an independent variable measures the change in the probability that 53 This report used a probit rather than a logit model because probit models do not require an assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). IIA implies that the preferences between alternatives A and B depend only on the individual preferences between A and B. In other words, if A is preferred to B out of the choice set {A,B}, then introducing a third alternative C, and thus expanding the choice set to {A,B,C}, must not change the preferences between A and B (i.e., A is still preferred to B after including C). An MNP model relaxes this requirement and allows more flexibility for considering outcomes in the analysis. alternative j is the outcome when this independent variable changes by one unit. For a categorical variable, the ME measures the change in the probability of the outcome that would occur if this categorical variable changes from 0 (reference category) to 1 (category of interest), holding all other independent variables constant. For a continuous independent variable, the ME measures the instantaneous rate of change, which typically depends on the position or value of the continuous variable. In this case, the use of the average ME, which is the mean value of MEs corresponding to all values of this continuous independent variable, is recommended."}, {"section_title": "Negative Binomial Regression", "text": "This study also used negative binomial (NB) regression to examine the net association between remediation enrollment/completion and the total number of college-level credits that a student earned through 2009. NB, a special kind of Poisson regression model, was used because the outcome of interest is a count variable-a variable that takes on only integer values of 0 or greater (0, 1, 2, 3, . . .) reflecting the number of occurrences of an event in a fixed period of time. In general, when the outcome variable in a regression is a count variable, Poisson regression is a more appropriate model than ordinal least squares (OLS) regression. OLS may result in biased standard errors and inappropriate significance tests due to violations of such OLS regression assumptions as constant variance and normal conditional distribution of error (Cohen and Cohen 1983;Coxe, West, and Aiken 2009;Gardner, Mulvey, and Shaw 1995). Poisson regression models are built on the Poisson distribution, which is a discrete distribution that takes on a probability value only for nonnegative integers (Coxe, West, and Aiken 2009). This property makes it an excellent choice for modeling count outcomes. The standard Poisson regression model can be expressed by the following equation: where is the predicted count for an individual i on the outcome variable given the specific values on the independent variables ; the symbol ln represents the natural logarithm; the intercept, , is the estimated value of when all values of the independent variables ( ) are zero; and the regression coefficient , indicates the average change in the predicted value of that is associated with a one-unit change in while keeping all other independent variables constant in the model.

One common situation has to do with the problem of \"overdispersion,\" in which the variance of the count variable exceeds its mean, violating the \"equidispersion\" assumption 54 of the standard Poisson regression. Overdispersion occurs for two main reasons: individual differences unaccounted for by the regression model (i.e., some important variables may be omitted in the regression); and dependent occurrences (i.e., each count that occurs for an individual may not be an independent event as assumed by the Poisson distribution). If the problem of overdispersion is present but not accounted for, the standard Poisson regression model may underestimate the standard errors and overstate the significance of the regression coefficients, therefore providing misleading inferences about the regression parameters. NB is one of the common regression models for handling overdispersion. The model is based on the Poisson distribution but assumes that there is unexplained variability among individuals who have the same predicted outcome value. This additional variability between individuals would lead to larger variance in the overall outcome distribution than what would be expected from the Poisson distribution. Thus, the NB regression produces the same mean as but larger variance than the standard Poisson regression. More technical information on Poisson and NB regression models can be found in Cameron and Trivedi (2013), Gardner, Mulvey, and Shaw (1995), and Coxe, West, and Aiken (2009). 54 Equidispersion refers to a situation in which the expected mean of the count variable equals its variance."}, {"section_title": "C-1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Appendix C-Multivariate Analysis Results", "text": "Tables C-1 through C-7 present the multivariate regression results for the association of remedial course enrollment and completion with various postsecondary outcomes.
