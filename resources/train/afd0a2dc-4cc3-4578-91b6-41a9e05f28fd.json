[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and aims: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia, interrelated metabolic risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A state of low-grade systemic inflammation may underlie this constellation of risk factors. Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as periodontal disease, may contribute to systemic inflammation and development of MetS. This study examines the association of periodontitis with MetS with and without consideration of systemic inflammatory status. Methods: The association of alveolar bone loss (none/slight vs moderate/severe) determined from panoramic radiographs and MetS parameters were analyzed using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking in 112 men and 78 women (mean\u00b1SD age 56.7\u00b113.3 and 60.0\u00b112.1, respectively) participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Results: Participants with radiographic evidence of moderate to advanced alveolar bone loss were significantly more likely to have MetS than those with minimal or no bone loss (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a group of metabolic conditions including central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, which comprise key risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (1). Clustering of multiple MetS components appears to have a greater impact on vascular parameters and risk for cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality than the expected risk based on an additive model (2, 3). Multiple age-related conditions have been associated with elevations in serum markers of inflammation, which may constitute a key factor underlying the co-occurrence of multiple MetS components (4, 5) . Elevations in circulating levels of multiple biologic mediators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, are thought to be important markers of a chronic inflammatory state and increased risk of mortality (6). Increases in white blood cell (WBC) count, for example, have been associated with poorer survival in the general population and patients with coronary heart disease (6, 7).\nPeriodontal disease is characterized by an inflammatory and immune response to microbial biofilm formation. Periodontitis is a destructive, often chronic form of periodontal disease that results in connective tissue degradation and alveolar bone resorption, ultimately leading to tooth loss in a susceptible host. Periodontitis has been associated with significant elevations in circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (8).\nChronic inflammation has been postulated as the basis for the association between periodontal disease and other systemic inflammatory conditions. Associations have been observed between periodontitis and obesity (9), triglyceride levels (10), diabetes (11), and systemic inflammation (12). Moreover, persons with periodontitis have increased risk for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (13). The pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease and MetS, therefore, may be related through common underlying and interacting inflammatory N No o N N N fo foun un women omen 1, 1, respe spective ctively) ly) Long gitud itudi inal nal Study Study of o nts with ra r diogr ographic aphic r r r evidence evid an nced d alv alveolar e bone e loss loss were li likely ke t to o hav have e Me MetS tS th than a thos o o b bon o e e los loss s (OR OR 2 2.6 61, 1 9 95% % C sign ignifi ifica c nt nt di differ ff i i enc r es i d betw between e peri d ion i of ocia mmati ation, n, w wh h lying th he e co-co-oc occu cur rr re enc n en ents (4, 4, 5) 5). .

We hypothesized that persons with advanced periodontal destruction, defined as moderate or severe alveolar bone loss, would be more likely to exhibit MetS than those with minimal or no evidence of periodontal breakdown. In addition, WBC count, a general marker of systemic inflammation, was examined in relation to periodontitis and MetS."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study population", "text": "Participants were community-dwelling volunteers enrolled in the BLSA, an ongoing observational study of normal aging initiated in 1958. Beginning in 1978, detailed dental data were collected on 692 BLSA participants, of which 320 had panographic radiographs taken. Two hundred participants with radiographs and complete data on MetS parameters constitute the study population."}, {"section_title": "Measurements", "text": "Periodontal status was determined from panographic images taken as part of the dental examination. Alveolar bone loss was measured by two trained examiners. Distance from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar crest was measured on the interproximal surface of each tooth. The average of these linear measurements was calculated and participants were scored as having none or slight (1-2 mm), moderate (3-4 mm), or severe (\u22655 mm) alveolar bone loss based on radiographic assessment of crestal bone height (excluding 3 rd molars). For analysis purposes, alveolar bone loss was dichotomized as none-slight and moderate-severe with periodontal disease defined as moderate-severe bone loss. Participants with less than ten teeth were excluded from the study.\nAssessment of MetS was based on blood pressure, waist circumference, triglyceride levels, and fasting glucose levels (Table 1 ). Blood pressure measurements were recorded in both arms with participants in a seated position following a 5-minute quiet rest period using a mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriately sized cuff. The average of the second and third measurements from both arms were used in this analysis. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were defined by Kortokoff phases I and V, respectively. Waist circumference was measured as the minimal circumference between the inferior rib cage and iliac crests. Blood samples were drawn after an overnight fast to assess lipid profiles. Participants were not allowed to smoke, engage in significant physical activity, or take medications prior to blood collection. The fasting plasma glucose concentration was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The concentration of plasma triglycerides was determined by an enzymatic method (Abbott Laboratories, ABA-200 ATC Biochromatic Analyzer, Irving, TX). Triglyceride data were unavailable for 62 participants on the date of the panoramic examination; therefore, triglyceride values were used from the closest adjacent visit (759\u00b1170 days).\nMetS was defined using a modified version of the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. In particular, participants with 2 or more of the following criteria were considered to have MetS: waist circumference \u2265102 cm for men and \u226588 cm for women, triglyceride level \u2265150 mg/dL, fasting glucose \u2265110 mg/dL, and blood pressure \u2265130/85 mmHg or documented use of antihypertensive therapy. High density lipoprotein (HDL) values were not collected in the BLSA prior to 1985; therefore, the MetS criteria based on HDL level could not be considered in this analysis.\nTotal WBC count (cells/mm 3 ) was performed with standard automated clinical methodologies. In a previous study of BLSA participants, Ruggiero et al. found a WBC of greater than 6000 to be associated with an increased risk of mortality (18). Therefore, participants were classified according to the following WBC levels (cut points): 3500, 6000, and 10,000 cells/mm 3 . Smoking status was obtained from self-report, and participants were categorized as nonsmoker or smoker.
