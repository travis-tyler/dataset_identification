[{"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "Phase 3 of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is the one of the longest and most detailed sample survey data collections conducted by the US Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). For this survey, NASS collects highly detailed economic data covering a calendar year from agricultural producers nationwide. Previous research with a self-administered mail-out/mail-back version of the ARMS questionnaire (Beckler, Ott and Horvath, 2005) showed benefits of indirect monetary incentives ($20 ATM cards). Face-to-face interviews are used to collect data from the Costs and Returns Report (CRR) sample of the ARMS Phase 3. For 2005, use of ATM cards was continued as standard practice with the mail-out/mail-back Core form sample and an incentive experiment was conducted comparing several types of incentives provided to ARMS Phase 3 CRR sampled operations. Five treatment groups (including a control group) in the CRR sample were used for this incentive experiment. All experimental groups received a pre-survey letter and were then contacted for a face-to-face interview. Treatment groups received either 1) a standard pre-survey letter with no incentive, 2) pre-survey letter with a prepaid indirect cash incentive (in the form of $20 automated teller machine (ATM) cards), 3) pre-survey letter with a promised individual financial profile comparing the operation with aggregated information about other operations, 4) presurvey letter with a NASS logo wall clock or 5) pre-survey letter with a pre-paid $20 ATM card and a promised individual financial profile. The entire ARMS Core version was provided with a $20 incentive but was not included in this experiment. Information for the Core form sample is provided along with the experimental groups. Response rates for the CRR incentive groups were slightly higher than the control group. However, the differences were not significantly different, with response rates for all groups in the low 70 percents. Each incentive tested required an additional cost for the incentives themselves and also for processing and delivery of the incentive. Used as tested, these incentives do not appear to be effective in increasing response rates on the face-to-face ARMS CRR sample. This is contrary to our prior evaluation of their use with the mail-back Core Version of the form where response rates were increased. For the Core form sample, incentives raised response rates and were also cost effective since they increased mail response and reduced costs from face-to-face interviews. In addition, the number of cards cashed was low, and the Core Version non-respondents cashed their ATM cards at a much lower rate than respondents (both in the previous research and in the current year). In the current research, Phase 3 CRR interview respondents and non-respondents cashed the ATM cards at comparable rates. This suggests that incentives, while increasing costs, are of limited effectiveness when combined with a face-to-face interview mode. Careful consideration should be made regarding how incentives are used in the future as they do not appear to be universally effective."}, {"section_title": "RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": "1. Incentives (both monetary and non-monetary), as tested in this experiment, should not be used for ARMS Phase 3 samples which use only face-to-face interviews. This is because they raise costs but do not significantly increase response rates. The ARMS consists of three phases: Phase 1 screens for potential samples for Phases 2 and 3; Phase 2 collects data on cropping practices and agricultural chemical usage; and Phase 3 collects detailed economic information about the agricultural operation as well as the operator's household. ARMS Phase 3 has been problematic because, compared with other NASS surveys, its response rates are low, and its data collection costs are high. All ARMS Phase 3 data are collected by face-to-face enumeration because of the length and complexity of the questionnaire. The ARMS Phase 3 contains several distinct subsamples. The Cost and Returns Report (CRR) sample provides information for the financial analysis of farm businesses, farm households and costs associated with producing agricultural commodities. In addition, cost of production and expenditure data are obtained with specific individual commodity subsamples. The CRR and commodity subsamples are all conducted with face-to-face interviews. The CRR questionnaire is over 30 pages long and interviews average about 1\u00bd hours in length. A much shorter self-administered Phase 3 \"Core\" questionnaire developed for the 2003 survey was used for part of the sample for mail-out/mail-back data collection. Since the utility of a self-administered ARMS Phase 3 Core form was demonstrated in 2003, NASS sought ways to implement its use and increase the overall response rate as well as contain data collection costs. Offering potential respondents incentives is a proven technique to increase response rates on a variety of surveys conducted by several agencies and companies (Church, 1993;James and Bolstein, 1992;James and Bolstein, 1990;Singer, 2002). An incentive experiment conducted with the 2004 ARMS Phase 3 Core indicated that monetary incentives increased response rates for the mail-out/mail-back sample of this survey while being cost effective (Beckler, Ott and Horvath, 2005). Based on the promising results of the use of incentives with the mail-out/mail-back Core form, it was hypothesized that incentives could also boost response rates in the ARMS face-to-face interviews. Therefore, an experiment comparing incentive use with the CRR face-to-face interview sample of the 2005 ARMS Phase 3 was conducted."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "The 2005 ARMS Phase 3 Costs and Returns Report (CRR) sample size was 11,625 including list and area frame samples. Ten thousand list frame sample operations were randomly assigned to 5 treatment groups. The total sample was stratified by state, the ARMS farm value of sales (as maintained on the sampling frame), and the type of operation (also as maintained on the sampling frame). Then, five sub-samples, each of size 2,000, were systematically selected. The sub-samples were drawn such that each was equally represented by the strata. Once the sub-samples were drawn, NASS Field Offices had the opportunity to remove operations from the samples with whom they had previous data collection agreements. This resulted in each subsample being slightly less than 2,000. In addition, the Core sample size was 16,498 farm/ranch operations across 15 states. The 15 states were those with the highest agricultural value of sales and included Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. For the 2005 ARMS Phase 3 sample, data collection could begin January 30 and ended in mid April. All data for the 5 treatment groups were collected via face-to-face interviews. The National Processing Center (NPC) in Jeffersonville, IN printed all of the presurvey letters and assembled and mailed all of the pre-survey materials to the treatment groups. They also assembled and mailed the Core sample questionnaires and ATM cards. Each of the 5 treatment groups were mailed a pre-survey letter, as is standard data collection methodology. In addition, treatment groups received incentives with their pre-survey letters in the form of $20 automated teller machine (ATM) cards, a non-monetary incentive in the form of a NASS logo wall clock, and the promise of a Farm Profile for their operation. The Farm Profile or \"Individual Farm Analysis\" was a report that displayed the percentile within which the operation's data fell compared to an overall group estimate for each of 16 expense categories. An example appears in Appendix A, Figure A3. Generic profiles without individual operation data were generated for non-respondents. The Farm Profiles were generated individually by staff in NASS's Statistics Division, printed in Headquarters, and sent to the appropriate NASS field offices in September 2006 for distribution to sampled operations. Combinations of these stimuli were administered to four of the five sub-samples mentioned above; a fifth sub-sample received no stimuli (except the standard presurvey letter) and served as the control group for this project. Collectively, these five sub-samples formed the five treatment groups used for this project. Table 1 contains descriptions of the treatment groups. All treatment groups received pre-survey letters that included some uses of the ARMS data. The letters also included a reference to the type of incentive the operation received ($20 ATM card, NASS logo clock, financial profile) as an advanced thank you for participation. The decision to use $20 ATM cards as incentives was based on their previous successful use with the ARMS Core form. Wall clocks were chosen as a prominent way to display the NASS logo to respondents. The letters and examples of the incentives are shown in Appendix A1-A6. The sub-samples in the incentive treatment groups all received pre-survey letters that: (1) explained the incentive was a \"thank you\", and; (2) described the uniqueness of the ARMS. Because all interviews were to be completed via personal interview, there was no statement justifying the ATM card being used as a cost saving measure. (This statement was included in the cover letter for the Core forms which were to be completed and returned via mail but were not part of this experiment.) The actual ATM card incentive was mailed with the pre-survey letter to recipients via United States Postal Service and was affixed to a standard 8\u00bd inch x 11 inch sheet of paper that reiterated a \"thank you\" and included instructions on how to use the card. This is shown in Appendix A, Figure A6. The wall clocks, with a pre-survey letter, were delivered via Federal Express. The $20 ATM cards were supplied by JPMorgan Chase bank and were usable in nationwide ATM machines that displayed the NYCE \u00ae , Pulse \u00ae , Maestro \u00ae , or Cirrus \u00ae logos. The cards were also usable at pointof-sale (POS) (i.e., retail) establishments that allow the use of debit cards as payment; however, recipients were not explicitly told this. In addition to the $20 incentive, the ATM cards were loaded with an extra $4 to cover any transaction charges. The cards were pre-activated and were immediately usable when the recipients received them. The personal identification number (PIN) needed to use the card was embossed on the front of each card after the words \"THANK YOU\". 1 The front of each card also included the embossed message, \"FOR HELP 1-888-424-7828\"; this toll-free telephone number was answered by NASS staff. Finally, all ATM cards expired on May 31, 2006 (there was no provision for extending this date). If a card recipient lost or could not use the card, a replacement could be requested by calling the toll-free phone number listed on the instruction sheet. For the few cases where this occurred, only the replacement card was used in our analysis. Interviewers were instructed to schedule interviews using the same procedures as in previous years when no incentives were provided to the CRR sample. Interviewers were informed of which CRR respondents received incentives. However, other Federal Agencies who have used monetary incentives have found that when interviewers ask respondents about receipt 1 There was a problem with how some card recipients were told to use their cards. This may have impacted how many recipients were able to cash their cards. The PIN was created from the cards \"sequence number\". For example, suppose the sequence number was \"12345\"; the actual PIN was \"2345\". The initial instructions did not acknowledge this or how to correctly enter the PIN. A postcard was sent a week or two after the problem was discovered alerting recipients (with five digit sequence numbers) to only enter the last four digits as the PIN. of the incentives, potential respondents often report they did not receive the incentive and ask for a replacement to be provided (see McGrath, 2006). This significantly increases costs and NASS did not have sufficient additional ATM cards to meet substantial numbers of replacement requests. For this reason, interviewers were specifically instructed NOT to mention the incentives in their contacts with respondents."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "Unlike previous incentive research conducted with the ARMS Core mail form, the results of this project showed that the incentives for the CRR sample did not significantly increase response rates. Table  2 shows the response rates by treatment group (treatment group descriptions are given in Table 1). While not part of the experimental comparisons, the response rate for the Core form (who all received $20 ATM cards) is also shown. 2/ Initially, all treatment groups contained 2,000 records, but field offices removed operations with whom they had previous data collection agreements (held in office), or otherwise did not want them to participate in the study. The Ns given here include only the count of operations that were provided with the incentives (except the Control, which only excludes the held in office). Counts are according to information obtained from NPC."}, {"section_title": "As shown in Table 2, although all treatment", "text": "groups that received an incentive had slightly higher response rates than the control group (Treatment Group 1), none were significantly different. See Appendix B for details on the significance testing. Pairwise comparisons of the groups' response rates are shown in Appendix C."}, {"section_title": "ATM Card Usage by CRR Sample", "text": "In previous research using $20 ATM cards with the Core Version of the ARMS, NASS realized a significant cost savings in large part due to the low number of people who actually cashed their cards (Beckler, Ott and Horvath, 2005.) As shown in Table 3, less than 30 percent of ATM cards were cashed by the treatment groups receiving them in this face-to-face interview sample. This is similar to findings of other government agencies (Kay, Boggess, Selvavel and McMahon, 2001). However, unlike the Core form respondents, the proportion of CRR sampled operations who cashed the cards is similar for respondents and nonrespondents. Core form sampled operations who receive ATM cards but were ultimately non-respondents, cashed their ATM cards at a very low rate, both this year and in previous research. This seemingly curious result may have occurred because the ATM cards were not described as resulting in cost savings for the CRR sample. For the Core form, respondents who received the ATM cards but did not respond may have felt they were not entitled to the money or perhaps that their cards would not be activated without the return of their form. In addition, for the Core form sample, the ATM card was delivered in the same package as the questionnaire they were to complete. For the CRR respondents, the incentives were delivered completely separate from the interviewer's request to provide the data (and as mentioned previously, the interviewers were instructed not to mention the incentive.) This may have impacted the response rates and card cashing rates for the current experiment. 1/ Counts include distinct operators who withdrew money using ATM cards (also includes those who made Point of Sale (POS) purchases). A small number of operators received multiple cards (because they requested a replacement claiming the first one did not work), and a small percent of those actually did cash both of their cards. Counts in this table count those who cashed more than one card only once; card expenses given in Table 4 include the expenses for all cards cashed."}, {"section_title": "Costs of Incentive Use", "text": "The use of ATM cards and also nonmonetary incentives such as clocks or other tokens of appreciation add additional costs both in dollars and other resources. The cost of ATM cards include the $20 dollars provided to the respondent who uses the card plus an additional $4 to cover any fees that may be charged by the particular machine used. These fees include withdrawal and purchase fees, balance inquiry fees and failure fees. In addition, since the ATM cards could be used at pointof-sale (POS) debit card machines, users could withdraw money at a variety of locations (although recipients were not explicitly told this.) The fees actually incurred by ATM recipients are shown in Table 4. Also shown in Table 4 is the substantial cost of using ATM cards operationally in the large Core form sample. For incentives that are not monetary, the costs of incentives include the incentive itself, and the additional costs of packaging and mailing the incentives. Unlike ATM cards whose full value is only paid if the recipient takes action to cash the card, the entire cost of non-monetary incentives is spent whether the potential respondent uses the incentive or not. The Farm Profiles were designed and generated by Statistics Division staff in the Economics Section. Operations who responded had profiles with their operation compared to similar operations; for those operations who did not respond, a generic profile was generated without individual operation data 2 . All profiles were created some time after the survey contacts (and were delivered to the Field Offices in September 2006). Once created and printed, the profiles were distributed to the respective field offices for final distribution to sampled operations. (Costs associated with this final step of field offices distributing the profiles to the operations were not tracked and are not included in this analysis.) A token incentive, like a wall clock, is more likely to be noticed due to its large size. However, it costs much more to package and mail these types of incentives. The costs of each of the incentives used in this study are shown in Table 5. 2 For sampled operations who reported incomplete data or refused to participate, the generic profiles included only information about farms of similar size and type (based on list frame control data for that operation). The cover letter for these profiles acknowledged their incomplete data or refusal.  40 $11,443.44 Core 3,772 80,994.27 3,760 3,760.00 34 514.24 34 11.90 105 47.25 238 70.45 $85,398.11 * = Point of Sale (POS), i.e., the ATM card was used as a debit card. 1/ Counts reflect the numbers of each type of transaction that were made. The sum of \"ATM Withdrawal\" and \"POS Purchase\" is slightly higher than the counts given in Table 3 because Table 3 reflects counts of distinct operators (i.e., state/POIDs), whereas the counts in this table reflects those who used their cards for multiple withdrawal/purchase transactions and the very few operators who received and cashed multiple cards. 2/ Includes amount of withdrawal/purchase as well as any transaction fees imposed by the ATM owner/retailer. 3/ JPMorgan Chase transaction fee. JPMorgan Chase was the issuer of the ATM cards. Because the incentives cost more but did not significantly impact response rates, the control group who received nothing more than the pre-survey letter was the least expensive in both cost per sample and average cost per completed interview. This is in stark contrast to the results of using incentives with a mail-back form where substantial cost savings can be realized by reducing the number of personal interviews, even if overall response rates are not affected. It should also be noted that the total additional cost of incentives would be multiplied if it extended to the entire sample instead of a small treatment group."}, {"section_title": "Data Quality and Non-response Bias", "text": "As there were no significant differences in response rates across the treatment groups, no analysis of potential non-response bias or potential impact on data quality was done. Even though non-response rates are comparable across groups, it is possible that characteristics of non-respondents differ across groups. However, we did not examine this."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In the research on incentives with the 2004 Core form, there were significant increases in response for groups receiving the $20 ATM cards. In contrast, the current research did not find incentives to be effective in raising response rates. There are several possible reasons for this. First, prior results were based on incentive use for a mail-out/mail-back form (with face-to-face follow up). The stated justification to respondents for providing incentives in a mail survey is to save the costs of personal enumeration. There may be a set of operations that may only be prompted to respond by mail, if provided with an incentive described this way. The justification to save costs cannot be provided to potential respondents in a face-to-face interview survey. In addition, with a mail survey, the incentive can be delivered with the questionnaire itself, so the incentive and the survey request are strongly linked. With a face-to-face interview survey, the incentive is delivered separately and not directly linked to the survey request (and indeed, our interviewers were explicitly told NOT to attempt to link the incentive to their survey contact). We have no way of knowing if making this connection more explicit (for example, by the interviewer asking about it when attempting to schedule an interview) might have increased response. Incentives can be beneficial in both increasing response rates and decreasing costs, but this may be highly related to the way in which the incentives are used. Even those incentives that have been effective in the past should be evaluated periodically to make sure that they continue to be effective. While we assume that the use of ATM cards with the Core form sample was beneficial in 2005, as it had been in 2004, we have no way of knowing this. Including a small sample control group for comparison would provide this information. As other organizations employ incentives, their novelty may wear off and decrease their effectiveness. In addition, if inflation changes the value of $20, this may no longer be an effective amount to stimulate response. Finally, if more respondents cash their cards, the cost of providing incentives would increase."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "Based on the results of the present study, the following recommendations are offered: 1. Incentives (both monetary and nonmonetary), as tested in this experiment, should not be used for ARMS Phase 3 samples which use only face-to-face interviews. This is because they raise costs but do not significantly increase response rates. 2. A small subsample control group should be used to monitor the continued effectiveness of incentives with the mail-back Core version of ARMS 3. "}, {"section_title": "6.", "text": ""}]
