[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "People with high levels of the amino acid, homocysteine, in the blood have an increased risk for stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and age-related memory impairment [1] . Recently, dietary supplements of vitamin B, such as folate, have been reported to lower the risk for cognitive decline and AD, possibly by lowering homocysteine levels [2] . To better understand how homocysteine levels might relate to brain degeneration, we studied anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 732 elderly individuals, relating homocysteine levels in the blood to brain atrophy. Our goal was to determine which brain systems showed greater atrophy in those with high homocysteine levels, and whether the relationship holds regardless of diagnosis [normal elderly, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD individuals].\nElevated homocysteine levels are a risk factor for cortical and subcortical atrophy in demented and nondemented elderly individuals [3] [4] [5] . High homocysteine levels may facilitate a build-up of toxic b-amyloid and tau in the brain, and may compromise DNA repair and promote degenerative changes due to oxidative stress, which may in turn lead to excitotoxicity and apoptosis [6, 7] .\nPrior studies have found associations between homocysteine and atrophy in specific brain regions, as summarized in recent reviews [8, 9] . Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with lower overall brain volumes and atrophy in subcortical structures on MRI, but the detailed anatomical pattern of these effects has not been mapped [4, 5] . To do this, we aimed to create a three-dimensional map of the structural brain differences associated with homocysteine levels, in a large cohort of elderly individuals scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We hypothesized that higher plasma levels of homocysteine would be related to lower regional brain volumes, regardless of diagnosis, and also within groups of individuals with AD and MCI. If this is true, some of the brain atrophy that affects elderly populations may be preventable in principle by homocysteine-lowering interventions such as folate and other vitamin B supplements. Homocysteine levels in blood may serve as a potential biomarker, among other neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid measures, for AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Individuals", "text": "We studied 732 elderly individuals (203 healthy controls, 356 with MCI, 173 with AD; mean age: 75.5 \u00b1 6.8 years) who received a 1.5T anatomical brain MRI scan as part of the ADNI study. ADNI At the time of their baseline MRI scan, all individuals had their blood samples collected in the morning before breakfast, after an overnight fast. Total homocysteine levels were measured from plasma samples using a validated enzyme immunoassay [10] . At the time of their MRI scan, all individuals underwent clinical and cognitive evaluations including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [11] . The MMSE, with scores ranging from 0 to 30, is a global measure of mental status based on five cognitive domains; lower scores indicate worse performance and scores below 24 are typically associated with dementia. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the ADNI protocol [12] .\nWe analyzed Caucasian ADNI individuals (n = 732) who had baseline brain MRI scans available at the time of analysis (January 2011) as well as plasma homocysteine levels assessed at the time of the baseline scan (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Image acquisition and processing", "text": "High-resolution structural MRI scans were acquired on 1.5T scanners from General Electric (Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA), Siemens (Germany), or Philips (The Netherlands) with a standardized MRI protocol [13] . Each scan involved a three-dimensional sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (2400 ms), flip angle (81), inversion time (1000 ms), 24-cm field of view, a 192 \u00c2 192 \u00c2 166 acquisition matrix, a voxel size of 1.25 \u00c2 1.25 \u00c2 1.2 mm 3 , later reconstructed to 1-mm isotropic voxels. To adjust for global differences in brain positioning and size, all scans were first linearly registered to the International Consortium for Brain Mapping template [14] with a nine-parameter transformation using the Minctracc algorithm [15] . Globally aligned images were resampled in an isotropic space of 220 voxels along each axis (x, y, and z) with a final voxel size of 1 mm 3 .\nTensor-based morphometry analysis and statistics\nTo assess regional brain atrophy in each individual, a minimal deformation template (MDT) was first created from the MRI scans of 40 cognitively healthy ADNI individuals, to serve as an unbiased group average template [16] . All preprocessed MRI images were nonlinearly aligned to the study-specific template so that they would all share a common coordinate system defined by the MDT. The local expansion or compression factor of the three-dimensional elastic warping transform [17] , calculated as the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the deformation, was plotted for each individual. These three-dimensional maps reveal areas of structural volume excess or deficits, relative to the MDT. At each image voxel within the brain, a multiple regression analysis was then carried out to analyze statistical associations between regional brain volumes and plasma homocysteine levels across all individuals, after adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis. We also analyzed statistical associations within each of the AD, MCI, and control groups, after covarying for age and sex. We then created threedimensional statistical brain maps to show brain regions where atrophy was significantly associated with homocysteine. To control false-positives, we enforced a standard false discovery rate correction for multiple statistical comparisons across voxels in the brain, using the conventionally accepted false-positive rate of 5% (q = 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Homocysteine and brain volumes", "text": "The average morning total plasma homocysteine levels in the ADNI cohort were 10.5 \u00b1 3.0 mM, with mean levels of 10.8 \u00b1 3.3, 10.6 \u00b1 2.8, and 10.0 \u00b1 2.9 mM for AD, MCI, and control groups, respectively (Table 1) . Compared with healthy controls, homocysteine levels were higher in AD (two-tailed t-test, P = 0.018) and MCI (two-tailed t-test, P = 0.015). Agreeing with a previous study [4] , homocysteine levels in men (n = 434) were higher (twotailed t-test, P < 0.0001) by 1.16 mM on an average, than in women (n = 298) in the cohort.\nA linear regression analysis across all the individuals covarying for age, sex, and diagnostic group, showed that the regional brain volume association with homocysteine levels was significant (Table 2) . Associations were detected in the frontal, parietal, and occipital white matter. After correcting for multiple statistical comparisons, every 5-mM increase in homocysteine level was associated with a relative brain volume deficit of 4.4% (0.88%/mM times 5) and an excess of 3.6% in the cerebrospinal fluid filled areas, relative to the MDT (Fig. 1a) . A subgroup analysis revealed significant homocysteine associated regional brain volume differences in the MCI group but not in the AD or control groups ( Table 2 ). The MCI group showed similar regions seen in the whole group (frontal, parietal, and occipital white matter), although to a greater extent, with a maximum brain volume deficit of 7.5% per 5-mM increase in homocysteine levels, relative to the MDT.

These results may Table 2 Critical P values for association between homocysteine and regional brain volumes improve understanding of the consequences of having elevated homocysteine levels, and the potential benefits of medications that lower them.\nIn our study, the group of MCI individuals showed large areas of association between homocysteine levels and brain volume. However, associations were not detected in the AD or the CTL group. This is most likely due to the larger sample size for the MCI group (MCI, n = 356 vs. AD, n = 173, and controls, n = 203), which offered greater power to detect associations.\nIn a recent randomized control trial, dietary supplementation with vitamin B slowed brain atrophy in individuals with MCI, possibly by lowering homocysteine levels [2] . As those with high homocysteine levels have a profile of greater atrophy, early interventions through homocysteine lowering diets and drugs may be considered as means to resist brain atrophy in the elderly.\nStrengths of our study include the large and well-defined cohort (ADNI) with high quality MRI scans of the brain, and well-validated computational methods for volume quantification. As of the ADNI study design, the sample sizes for AD and control groups were not as large as MCI, which could have limited our ability to detect associations in these groups."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Automated whole brain volumetric analysis of brain MRI revealed a three-dimensional pattern of homocysteineassociated brain differences.
