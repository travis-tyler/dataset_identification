More South Carolina students are taking Advanced Placement exams than in most states. (South Carolina ranks eighth in the nation.) Clearly we have charted an aggressive approach to meet the education needs of South Carolina's children and adults. Our educational system must change if we are to meet the Nation's Education Goals by the year 2000. As you will see in this report, reform efforts are well underway with representative efforts by teachers, patents, administrators and school boards working hard to make this happen. Thank you for your interest in education and for caring about and supporting the Children of South Carolina. Information is separated into four chapters. The first chapter explores answers to the question, \"What is South Carolina doing to improve education?\" Information is presented on the systemic strategies underway in South Carolina public schools to raise Schools restructure by: creating academic standards that describe what all students should know and be able to do at critical points in their education; changing the curriculum so it reflects new, higher academic standards; changing instruction, scheduling, and student/teacher ratios, so that All students, not just the college bound, can meet the new academic achievement standards; changing testing so that it assesses true performance and the skills necessary to meet the academic achievement standards; changing the working environment so that teachers can learn continuously as they work; changing management and administrative practices so they reward initiative, innovation, and achievement by emphasizing site based decision making to involve parents, administrators, teachers, and.support staff; and changing the school culture so it focuses on students, learning, quality, and continuous improvement. creating increased parent and community involvement in the school system. As restructuring takes place, South Carolina schools are continuing to bed upon the basic skills that all children must have to be successful, but must also stress the problemsolving skills that students will find necessary in our technological society. The following examples demonstrate changes needed in assessment practices.

The Basic Skills question requires that the child have the ability to perform a simple mathematical computation. The National Assessment question, however, asks that the child, using a variety of communication tools--words, pictures, numbers--think about a mathematical concept, and explore possible applications of that concept. The interpretative skills necessary to explore applications of a subject must become a central part of what is taught. Curriculum must focus on knowledge, problem-solving skills, and the integration and application of knowledge. The educational system must foster a love of learning within each child, enabling the child to be a life-long learner and a productive member of society. All concerned with education must believe wholeheartedly that all children can learn at high levels, and accept that each child's learning pace may be different. Consequently, all students must be provided access to a rigorous course of study. Schools must challenge all students to meet high academic standards by eliminating programs that focus solely on lower-level skills and by designing a curriculum that is challenging and stimulating for every child.

A variety of measures are needed to provide a rich picture of each area of knowledge. Major revisions in the statewide testing program have been proposed to the General Assembly. The proposed state assessment system is based on recommendations of the Governor's Task Force on Accountability and of the Educational Excellence Team on Assessment. These groups of legislators, parents, teachers and educators recognized that parents and teachers need frequent information on student progress in order to improve classroom instruction. If adopted, these changes will result in a testing program which not only provides information to South Carolina citizens about what our students know and are able to do, but also will give direction to schools and teachers on how they can improve student learning. Through the use of multiple measures of student learning, the revised assessment system will provide better information on students' problem solving skills, and their ability to apply their knowledge and skills in real life situations. The revised testing program will provide rigorous measures of student performance which will allow comparisons with students in South Carolina as well as the nation. Continuous assessment of students in grades K -3 will provide teachers an opportunity to record a student's competency in academic content areas throughout the year without relying on a single test administered on just one measure. Gathering information about a child's academic progress frequently through the year is necessary to allow a teacher to make daily decisions about a child's academic progress based on accurate and timely information. Feedback to parents on academic progress is provided frequently in continuous assessment in a way that is understandable and useful to the student, parent and teacher. After identifying what students should know and do, teachers develop assessments which evaluate the extent to which students can demonstrate performance.\n"}, {"section_title": "Promising Strategy", "text": "Assessment of student achievement should support the high content and performance standards specified in the curriculum frameworks.\nAuthentic Assessment South Carolina is currently participating in two projects intended to develop student assessment methods which will measure a student's application of knowledge and skills. One of thew initiatives, the Twelve Schools Project, is unique to South Carolina. The dozen schools originally selected for this project in 1991 continue to develop and pilot alternative student assessment methods stk.. as portfolios and performance tasks in their classrooms. With the addition of twenty-four schools to the project in the 1993, the new participating schools will work as partners with each other and with the original twelve schools to generate additional information on how to set high achievement standards which are integrated with curriculum and instruction. Through the use of the curriculum frameworks, national standards, and best practices, teachers are identifying what their students should know and do. They are then developing performance assessments that measure these critical skills. This development process includes devising criteria for scoring stueent performance; these criteria are referred to as \"rubrics.\" The rubrics lay out the expectations for students and provide a yardstick for teachers, . ludents and parents to assess student progress in terms of what the student has learned and can demonstrate performance. Teachers are using the frameworks' standards and assessments to analyze what they teach and how they. teach. , making changes in curriculum and instruction that will foster rigorous levels of learnme g. As the curriculum frameworks emerge, the alternative assessments and curriculum and instructional changes which the schools in the project have made provide valuable information to all teachers as they implement the frameworks in their classrooms. The second initiative is the New Standards Project, a national partnership of states and school district which is working to develop standardized performance tasks and portfolios. Approximately 200 South Carolina teachers and school administratori have participated in their project since Summer, 1991. The participants have tried 'Out performance assessments with their students and have attended national acid state meetings to learn how to score student ttsponses to the tasks. The New Standards assessments and scoring rubrics set high standards for students' performance, while at the same time providing teachers with guidance on how to improve curriculum and instruction to help students meet those high standards. In 1993, South Carolina received a $9.7 million competitive grant award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support mathematics and science education improvement across the state. This initiative, called the South Carolina Statewide Systemic Initiative (SC SSI), will assist teachers and schools in translating the instructional visions outlined in the South Carolina Mathematics and Science Cwriculum Frameworks into everyday classroom practices. The NSF award provides networks of educators, ideas, resources; and services at thirteen regional \"HUBs\" serving every school in the state. The HUBs will provide a number of services, including; Access to Mathematics and Science Teaching Specialists on staff who are prepared to assist teachers and schools on instructional models; Provision of workshops and institutes for teachers and administrators on topics such as new instructional technology and materials, student performance assessments, and local implementation of the South Carolina Mathematics and Science Frameworks; Expansion of successful teacher preparation pilot programs to colleges and universities; Development of successful teachers of mathematics and science into teacher leaders who will work with other districts, schools, and teachers in the process of changing, their mathematics and science education programs; and Creation of after-school and summer study programs, such as the highly successful Family Math and Family Science programs where parents learn mathematics and science side-by-side with their children. The .plan, currently undergoing field review, provides a comprehensive blueprint for improving students' academic achievement through the use of new and emerging technologies at the school, district, and state level, and through the training of teachers and support personnel in the use of technology to enhance instruction. INSTEP describes three models for implementation and defines the roles of agencies in the implementation process: The State Model, which defines specific technologies to meet those needs, and the role of the South Carolina Department of Education in implementing the specified technology throughout the state; The District Model, which assists districts in defining specific needs, broad categories of technologies to meet those needs, and the role of local school districts in identifying and implementing specific technologies-that are most appropriate for their local schools; and The School Model, which assists schools in defining specific needs, broad categories of technologies to meet those needs, and the role of the local school in identifying and implementing technologies that are most appropriate for their classrooms and support services. INSTEP provides a focus for linking all students, teachers, media specialists, counselors, administrators, managers, and others to the resources they need to learn, teach, and support those who learn and teach. The focus is on using technology in the most appropriate ways--thus providing opportunities to develop meaningful long-term skills and strategies for life-long learning and living. -15 -91 2. Of the money spent for education, how much reaches students for direct instruction as well as for other direct services, such as sports, guidance and library? Some 70 cents on each dollar received by school districts benefits students directly. The amount ranged from 67% to 74%. 3. What proportion of the resources is spent on younger children--those attending elementary schools --versus middle and high schools? As was the case across the country, elementary schools received the least funding per pupil and the high schools the most. Middle schools were in between. More advanced courses, the need for expensive laboratory equipment, and the cost of sports and extracurricular programs in the high schools could explain this difference. Over one-half of the state's tax dollars are spent on education. Since businesses, small and large, are the largest taxpayers, they perceive the task of educating youth to be one in which they have a vested interest. Many businesses are participating in business/education partnerships across the state. This year, forty-one businesses, the most ever, received State Board Awards for outstanding partnerships in education."}, {"section_title": "The South Carolina Network of Business Partners for Education assists the State", "text": "Department of Education business/education partnership program in the areas of planning, promotion, and evaluation. While the South Carolina Network of Business Partners for Education supports all levels of partnerships and strongly encourages the developmental states of partnership efforts, the Network has a strong commitment to bringing together all of the stakeholders at the highest level of partner programs, i.e., the collaborative level of partnerships. At the collaborative stage partners are mutually involved in all phases of activities including evaluations to determine the impact of projects. Planning includes activities with reciprocal arrangements and the setting of long-range commitments for large-scale educational projects. The key to creating successful business/education partnerships at the collaborative level lies in understanding the context of the community, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it is being affected by social and economic changes. The collaborative stage secures partnerships that can produce more than a community with good schools. It means a community with a healthy sense of the common goodknowing what we believe in and what we must do for our children and our families. The South Carolina Rural Initiative, established by the Office of Community Education, provides services to rural schools, and establishes and strengthens relationships among the rural schools, and between rural schools and the State Department of Education. Additionally, the South Carolina Rural Initiative; working with regional partners such as the Southeastern Educational Improvement Laboratory, identifies, gathers, and generates information about rural education for the following two purposes: 1. to assist rural educators in their efforts to improve instruction, and 2. to assist policymakers, business leaders and other community decision makers in understanding and becoming more aware of rural education issues. Central to the support of rural schools by the Department of Education is the development of the recently formed South Carolina Rural Education Association. The Association strengthens the ties and partnerships among rural school districts and provides a forum for the identification, discussion and solution of the unique needs and problems faced by rural schools. Several efforts are underway to improve services in rural schools. The Action Team collaborates with other major stakeholders to prepare a proposal for development and implementation of actions to improve the status of African American males in the public schools of South Carolina. A subcommittee of the Action Team has recommended the following actions: Devise incentives for educators to improve student performance, As they work on their service project in the community, students make the connection between what they are learning and its importance in the \"real world.\" Service Learning allows students to learn through active participation in wellorganized service experiences ... Tech Prep raises the standards of education by stressing rigorous academic and occupational preparatory programs. These programs are aimed at helping students understand the connection between classroom instruction and the real world. Tech Prep provides meaningful education and career preparation for the majority of today's high school students. After completing a strong academic and occupational program in high school, Tech Prep students are well prepared to enter full-time employment, continue their edu6ation at a two-year technical college, or at a four-year college. Schools that are effectively implementing the components of Tech Prep are seeing the following results: An increase in student achievement, A decrease in dropouts, A decrease in remediation, An increase in the number of students going to post secondary institutions, An increase in student and staff morale. Business/industry involvement ensures that school programs prepare students for current and future employment opportunities. A comprehensive career guidance plan for every Tech Prep student allows a student to \"map out\" a program of courses to prepare them for their future occupation-or higher education. Intensive staff development ensures that teachers and administrators learn 'riew styles of effective instruction. Elimination of the unproductive \"general track\" prevents students from being unprepared for work or for post-secondary education upon graduation. Integrating the content of academic and occupational education blends the strength of the various program areas. When teaching theoretical subject matter, academic teachers in math, science, and language arts incorporate real-,life applications learned from occupational teachers. Participation in entrepreneurship education helps students understand the principles of a free enterprise system. Unfortunately, high retention rates in early grades, low expectations for students' performance, and a focus on minimum standards have not fostered an education system that prepares all students to achieve their potential.

A profile of South Carolina shows economic and social factors that impact greatly on our schools. 15.4% (517,793) of South Carolina citizens had incomes below the poverty line, the 15th highest poverty rate in the nation. 21% (190,873) of South Carolina school children were classified as poor in 1990, the ninth highest ranking in the nation. Elementary School Students, K -3 There is a strong connection between how students begin school and how they finish school. Currently, 25% of South Carolina students do not meet state readiness standards as measured by performance on the Cognitive Skills Assessment Battery (CSAB) when they enter first grade. Early school performance has its roots in the learning experiences provided from birth to age 5. The relative performance of children across Kindergarten through Grade 12 is well established by the end of Grade 2. More than one in four third graders (12,700) were over-age for their grade. Most of these over-age students were retained more than once. Non-white male students were most likely to be over-age for their grade.

With increased attention on these important years in a child's life, the structure of the school has been altered, eliminating the junior high school (Grades 7-9) as the dominant instructional arrangement and moving to a middle school structure (Grades 4-8) as the preferred arrangement. In South Carolina, only 39 junior high schools are still in existence as compared to 169 middle schools. Middle school education has changed. The emphasis has shifted, moving the middle school philosophy from the belief that schools for these young adolescents should be content-centered, mini-high-schools, and focusing on the belief that schools should be student-centered. The following characteristics are common in an outstanding middle school: Students are actively engaged in learning. Multiple forms of student assessment are used to portray progress on skills and knowledge more accurately.  Movement of students into the top 25% of the nation also has occurred during this time period. In 1990, the percentage of students who scored in the upper quarter on the 3R Battery was 19% (9,222); in 1993, this figure rose to 24% (11,356).

Qualified teachers know the subject areas they teach and are equipped with the skills and techniques to engage students in the subject matter. Yet some school systems find it challenging just to get enough teachers to fill available positions. Many districts in South Carolina currently report shortages of qualified teachers in Mathematics, Science, Foreign Languages, Industrial Technology, Art, Guidance, Home Economics, Media Specialist, and Special Education. The shortage of minority teachers in South Carolina is SEVERE. Clearly, the need for a culturally diverse teaching force is great. Although 41.5% of South Carolina's students are Black, only 18% of South Carolina's teachers are members of ethnic minority groups. Projections indicate that this gap may widen. By the year 2000 in the nation, Black teachers are projected to compriseas little as 5% of the teaching force. Minority students who graduate from college are recruited heavily by business and the professions. Clearly, the education profession must increase recruitment efforts for minority teachers. The quality of teacher preparation programs varies throughout the state in their ability to prepare graduates to teach in a culturally diverse setting or to teach at-risk students. There are many efforts to improve teacher preparation programs. The Goodlad Project for restructuring teacher education has been initiated at five South Carolina colleges and universities. South Carolina also is one of 17 states participating in The Interstate New Teacher South Carolina's standards for Colleges of Teacher Education are under revision by an advisory committee of deans, superintendents, principals and schools. These new rigorous standards will be used in partnership with higher education to restructure teacher and administration preparation programs and foster Professional Development Schools. Many changes are taking place at a rapid pace in South Carolina schools. Often, teachers have not had adequate professional development to plan and to adjust to these changes. Education Week reports that businesses spend three times the amount that is spent by local school districts for employee training and development programs.
