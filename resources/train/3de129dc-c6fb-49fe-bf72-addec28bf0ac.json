We selected a total of 74 MCI subjects with a baseline diagnosis of amnestic MCI, based on the following requirements: First, all subjects had at least one resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) scan with corresponding anatomical scans. Second, all subjects had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentration values. Third, all subjects had scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), modified 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) (immediate recall score, i.e., the sum of trials 1 to 5). Of note, in this study, the CSF, p-tau, and ADAS-Cog biomarkers were used only to estimate the optimal temporal sequence of events by using event-based probabilistic model. Finally, in this study, 46 subjects had a threeyear follow-up clinical diagnosis of MCI and met criteria for inclusion as part of either a nonprogressive MCI (N-MCI) group or a progressive MCI (P-MCI) group, depending on whether they progressed to ADtype dementia at the three-year follow-up. At study entry (baseline), all subjects underwent a standardized clinical interview, cognitive/functional assessments, structural MRI, and R-fMRI scans. The clinical status of each MCI subject was reevaluated at the 36-month follow-up time point. According to the follow-up clinical diagnosis by the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the diagnosis of probable AD [2] , those MCI subjects who progressed to AD-type dementia within 36 months of entering the study were labeled as P-MCI, those who did not progress were labeled as N-MCI subjects. The clinical status for N-MCI and P-MCI subjects is employed as the \"ground truth\" in our classification experiments, as described below. Note that most of the subjects included in the ADNI dataset had not met both comprehensive neuropsychological assessment scores and had at least one R-fMRI scan with corresponding anatomical scans at the three-year follow-up. Therefore, data from the ADNI dataset were not used to investigate the links between the changes of the characterizing AD risk events and the changes of neuropsychological performance.\nThere are 12 P-MCI subjects who progressed to AD and 34 N-MCI subjects who did not within 36 months of entering the study.

For subjects j=1, \u2026, J, the dataset X could be regarded as X={X 1 , X 2 , \u2026, X J }. Specifically, X J represents the subject j data that is given by X j ={x 1j , x 2j , \u2026, x Nj }, where x ij is the ith biomarker measurement for subject j. This study determined the optimal temporal order in a data-driven manner, based on the criteria that the optimal temporal order, defined as the S optimal , yielded the highest probability in measuring dataset X. That is, the p(X|S) value of the S optimal sequence was calculated to be maximal among all of the possible sequences. To accomplish this objective, we first estimated the likelihood of measurement x ij given that biomarker event E i has or has not occurred. These likelihoods are labeled below:\n( \uf0fd ) = likelihood of measurement given that event E i has occurred (1) ( \uf0fd\u00ac ) = likelihood of measurement given that event E i has occurred\nWe assumed that subject j is at stage k, although the authentic biomarkers sequence and the subject's stage were unavailable. This means that for subject j, events Es(1), Es(2), \u2026, Es(k) already have occurred, and eevents E s(k+1) , E s(k+2) , \u2026, E s(N) have not occurred. The likelihood of data X j given the sequence S and the subject's stage at k was obtained using the formula below:\nWhere is the overall likelihood of measurements given that corresponding events have already occurred, is the overall likelihood of measurements given that these events have not yet occurred. Then, we obtained the likelihood of data X j in the condition of sequence S by summing the likelihood values of data X j across all possible stages within sequence S, as shown in Equ.

The fitted Gaussian distributions separated the data into two groups, i.e., abnormal (event occurred) and normal (event did not occur), similar to the approach by Young et al. [9] . Notably, we modified Young et al.'s approach by applying a k-mean clustering algorithm to separate the whole distribution into two clusters before applying the Gaussian mixture model fitting. This modified modeling method led to high consistency in the obtained model."}, {"section_title": "Self-growing greedy algorithm", "text": "The amount of time such an analysis would take to find a global optimal result is unpredictable due to the randomized initial sequence, and it may be quite long due to the inevitable searching loop. Therefore, we developed a new greedy algorithm to address this deficiency. The greedy algorithm explores the globally optimal solution by making the locally optimal choice at each stage, in a greedy heuristic manner. The greedy Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is a useful approach to find globally optimal results. Specifically, we started with a set of all possible initial root sequences, each of which consisted of two randomly selected events from the 10 biomarker events total. Second, for each initial sequence S, we generated the children of S by inserting a randomly selected event from the remaining events. Third, we selected the children sequence with the maximal ( | ) value; this replaced the initial sequence. Then, we entered another randomly selected event into the sequence and repeated the second and the third steps until no events were left. Thus, we generated whole sequences for each root sequence. Ultimately, we determined the sequence with the maximum ( | ) value as the final optimal sequence, S optimal . We repeated this greedy algorithm 100 times to ensure the S optimal had a high reliability.\nThis study used 45 CN and 25 AD subjects to determine the S optimal .

For example, when a subject's disease stage corresponds to the missing marker k, it is impossible to determine the subject's disease stage to be k in the \"winner take all\" approach. The disease stage will fall to the next available highest likelihood stage, most likely k\u22121 or k+1. To address this problem, here we employ the WA stage defined in Equ (10) .
