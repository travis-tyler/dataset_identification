There are a number of conditions where a disease under study is well understood when two outcomes are considered. For example, in clinical trials the clinician may be interested in the joint evolution of HIV RNA and CD4+t lymphocytes in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients treated with active antiretroviral drugs. Bellamy (1995) studied the study of the risk factors associated with the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. In this study two outcomes were collected, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) disability score and the number of missed work days for the past three months due to knee pain. The JMRE model allows the modeling of mixed effects and bivariate outcomes.\nFolefac Atem is a Biometric Consultant. Email him at: folefac_atem@yahoo.com. Julius S. Ngwa is a Ph.D. candidate in the Biostatistics Department at the School of Public Health. Abidemi K. Adeniji has a Ph.D. in biostatistics and is a researcher at The Epidemiology Data Center (EDC), University of Pittsburgh.\nThere are several advantages of modeling bivariate outcomes (see Laird and Ware, 1982; Dempster, et al., 1984; Bagiella, 2000; Pantazis & Touloumi, 2007; McCulloch, 2008; Atem, et al,. 2010) . First, this model allows exploration of variations at different levels of a hierarchy and modeling of a correlation structure serially and across two outcomes. Second, the bivariate JMRE model achieves greater bias reduction in all model parameters compared to the two independent JMRE models. Third, there is greater flexibility in dealing with exploratory variables; the JMRE model can conveniently test hypotheses on either end point individually or simultaneously. JMRE can also handle missing data as the parameter estimates are obtained by techniques of maximum likelihood; the variance and means of the outcomes are estimated, thus the choice of the variance must be taken into consideration. Rao (1973) suggested that irrespective of the chosen variance, the fixed effect estimates are unbiased; however, the estimates can achieve maximum efficiency only when the appropriate variance is specified. Lastly, multiple testing can be avoided by forming joint models without resorting to ad hoc methods such as the Bonferroni adjustment or using advanced methods such as those as presented by Dmitrienko, et al. (2009) "}, {"section_title": "Regression Techniques", "text": "Regression techniques for hierarchical data have been referred to in the literature under different names, including random coefficient models (Rao, 1965 ) and hierarchical linear model (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1987) . Song, et al. (2008) Y t respectively, for subject i at time t . Assume that the outcomes can be described by two linear mixed models with correlated random effects. A joint model can be constructed from the basic random effect model proposed by Laird and Ware (1982) : "}, {"section_title": "Y t t a b t t Y t t a b t t", "text": "where D is a matrix of the random effects with the following variance-covariance structure:\nThe variance-covariance matrix of the model parameter is often derived by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood method. The residual components are uncorrelated and independent of the random effects\nThe variance-covariance structure implies that conditioning on the random effects, both responses are independent. Other cases can be obtained by making additional assumptions about the variance-covariance matrix . D Thiebaut, et al. (2002) outlined further procedures on a number of special cases of the D matrix. For these analyses, models were fitted using the SAS GLIMMIX procedure, while the random effects were introduced through the shared random effects procedures as described by De Gruttola, et al. (1994) . A common objective for joint modeling is to investigate how outcomes are correlated. For example, a researcher might be interested in how the correlation of BMI and NCS are associated with age, while controlling for race and gender. The correlation between outcome variables BMI and NCS is derived from the variance-covariance matrix of the random effect and is given by: This formula implies that the marginal correlation cannot be higher than the correlation between random intercepts. If the measurement errors of BMI and NCS are smaller, the marginal correlation at 0 t = better approximates the correlation between the random intercepts. The covariance parameters of the random effects and the error components determine the shape of the marginal correlation function. Further, as t increases, the marginal correlation converges to the correlation between the random slopes. Methodology Simulation Study Yang, et al. ( , 2009 Yang, et al. ( , 2010 ) discussed methods to simulate and test for an over-dispersed Poisson distribution. A simple and efficient way to simulate a mixture of bivariate continuous and over-dispersed Poisson distribution using the specified parameters is: Data were simulated using a negative binomial distribution for the case where \u03b1 = 5. A negative binomial may result from a mixture of Poisson distributions with a Gamma distribution of the mean and a specified shape and scale parameters (R -Documentation). The mean to variance ratio was about 1:5. See Table 1 , Figure 1 for a table and plot of the mean and variance for a non-dispersed and see Akaike (1973 Akaike ( , 1985 , Sakamota, et al. (1986) and Bozgogan (1987) are specified as:\nrespectively. These definitions of AIC, AICC and BIC imply that smaller AIC, AICC and BIC estimates provide a better fit for the model. Gurka, et al. (2011) showed that the model with independent correlation structure offers a parsimonious model, but may not always be the best model. However, this study shows that -in the case of mixed Poisson and continuous longitudinal data -the independent and the unstructured correlation tend to perform best and have the lowest AIC, AICC and BIC (see Table  3 ). In the case of a mixed over-dispersed Poisson and continuous clustered data a number of transformations for the outcome variables were examined. First, the case with no transformation on the outcome was considered; this model Table 4 ). Next, a number of data transformations were performed and the best model was selected based on the AIC, AICC, BIC and the standard errors of the estimates. The transformation log( 1) Y + performed best for both responses using the independent and the unstructured correlation structure for the data (see Table 5 ). Using NHIS data, approximately 264,727 people were interviewed over the 10-year period 1997-2006. The sample size for this analysis was reduced to 42,138 after cleaning. First, BMI values were analyzed with a general linear mixed model. The fixed effects in the model were gender, race and age. The random effects in this model were year (time) and residual (see Table 7 ). Next, NCS was analyzed with similar fixed effect and random effect variables. The univariate analysis assumed a Poisson error because NCS is count data (see Table 8 ); however, the resulting fitting algorithm did not converge. The Poisson error might not be a proper residual term for this analysis even though NCS is count data because the means are not equal to the variances (see Table 6 ). Overdispersion was verified using techniques proposed by Lindsey (1999) . Assuming a normal error for NCS, the deviance is 323842.2 which is more than twice the degrees of freedom of 42139, hence the Poisson data is overdispersed. BMI and NCS were analyzed using a joint bivariate model (see Table 8 ) with normal and Poisson residuals for the two outcome variables, respectively. The joint bivariate model appears to converge; however, the corresponding univariate analyses for the overdispersed Poisson error did not converge. This bivariate model is inappropriate because this analysis requires proper consideration of the correlation of the outcomes, which might not be true. In this case, the result of the joint bivariate analysis is similar to the univariate analysis of BMI as the outcome. This may be attributed to the correlation between the outcome variables BMI and cigarettes smoked not being accurately taken into consideration. In order to be sure that the model properly accounts for the association between both outcomes, it is important to ensure that the model assumptions of the independent univariate models are satisfied. For example, if a Poisson error for the univariate analysis of NCS as a dependent variable is assumed, the resulting model might be subject to over-dispersion (see Tables 2 & 6) . Yang, et al. (2009) After transforming to the count variable, NCS, the joint bivariate random effects model is fit. Fixed effects were gender, race, age, age interaction with age and the distribution (normal). The random effects were year and residual (see Table 9 ); this result is different from the previous joint bivariate model. Furthermore, the analysis of residual from the joint model with normal error for BMI and Poisson error for NCS shows that the model is not performing well. The Poisson model plot of residual is expected to have a funnel shape, but as Figure 3 shows, this is not the case. The model with normal error for BMI and normal error for log-transformed NCS tend to have improved residual plots, based on the distribution of the residuals. This model is also more efficient (see Figure 4 ) with \u22122logRe = 579056.2, compared to the model with untransformed NCS (see Figure 3 ) with \u22122logRe = 663787.1."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "A number of methods have been discussed to handle correlated data with bivariate outcomes (Song, et al., 2008 ), Yang, et al., (2006 ), but little work has been done in cases with mixed over-dispersed Poisson and clustered continuous outcomes. Yang, et al., (2006 Yang, et al., ( , 2009 discussed estimation procedures for bivariate models with both complete and incomplete cases. Yang, et al., ( , 2009 introduced various methods to test for over-dispersion using a univariate repeated measure data. Fieuws and Verbeke (2004) compared the univariate to the bivariate model with and without correlated random effects using the Hearing Data collected in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA); they concluded that the bivariate correlated model performed best.\nThe purpose of this study was not to develop a new estimation technique, but rather to show that a simple transformation together with the correct correlation will stabilize the model. Modeling bivariate outcomes is essential when there is an association between primary outcomes or when the question of interest focuses on the joint behavior of multiple outcomes. The extent to which the dependent structure would be considered, however, depends on the question at hand. If interest is primarily on the population response means and the impact of covariates on these means, then a detailed consideration of the transformation and correlation mechanism may not be of significant importance. However, loss of efficiency could result if the assumed working correlation is far from the true correlation (Gardiner, 2009 ). On the other hand, if there is interest in both marginal and subject-specific inferences (for example, in estimating the growth trajectories of individuals (Potthoff & Roy, 1964) , a careful evaluation of the transformation mechanism and correlation structure is of tremendous importance.\nThe linear mixed model can be used for both marginal and subject specific inference. For example, on the subject-specific inference mean and the population mean, the significance test for this approach depends highly on the chosen covariance structure; therefore, careful consideration in choosing the right correlation structure is required. The fixed effects estimates with different covariance structures may yield the same values, even though the standard errors of these estimates can vary widely. One objective of data analysis using a linear mixed model is to define an adequate error covariance structure in order to obtain efficient estimates of regression parameters; however, to properly estimate the covariance structure, the normality assumption of the random effect must be met. After both conditions are met, multilevel models are most suitable for analysis of longitudinal data and data with hierarchical structure.
