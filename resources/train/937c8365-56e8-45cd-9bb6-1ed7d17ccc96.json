[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background-A common variant at chromosome 9p21 (tagged by the rs1333049 or rs10757278 single-nucleotide polymorphism) is strongly associated with myocardial infarction and major arterial aneurysms. An association with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was also reported in a sample younger than 75 years, but this disappeared on removal of respondents with a myocardial infarction history, resulting in an odds ratio of 1.09 for PAD (P\u03ed0.075). We aimed at estimating the association of this variant with an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and PAD in 3 older populations. Methods and Results-We used data from the InCHIANTI, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, and Health, Aging, and Body Composition studies. In 2630 white individuals (mean age, 76.4 years), the C allele at rs1333049 was associated with lower mean ABI measures and with an increased prevalence of PAD. These associations remained after removal of baseline and incident myocardial infarction cases over a 6-year follow-up for both ABI (\u03ea0.017 ABI units; 95% CI, \u03ea0.03 to \u03ea0.01; P\u03ed1.3\u03eb10 \u03ea4 ) and PAD (per allele odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.56; P\u03ed0.012). These associations also remained after adjustment for known atherosclerosis risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Conclusions-The C allele at rs1333049 is associated with an increased prevalence of PAD and lower mean ABI. This association was independent of the presence of diagnosed myocardial infarction and atherosclerotic risk factors in 3 older white populations.

Follow-up measures were collected during 2 waves at 3-year intervals from the baseline interview. For our investigation of the associations with ABI and PAD, only subjects 65 years or older at baseline were included in analyses. Of the 1453 samples in the cohort, 1155 were \u054665 years, and of these 804 have genotype and phenotype information available.\nThe Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study is a longitudinal cohort study designed to investigate factors contributing to changes in body composition in old age that contribute to disease and disability. A total of 3075 black and white US subjects, aged 70 to 79 at baseline, who reported no difficulty in daily activity-related mobility at baseline, were sampled. Follow-up measures were collected annually for 7 years, although ABI measurements were taken at year 1 and year 4 only. The sample for Health ABC was selected to have a substantial number of blacks (42%). Large differences between the allele frequencies at rs1333049 have been reported for different ethnic populations (http://www.hapmap. org/). Within Health ABC, those reporting their ethnicity as \"white\" or \"black\" had a frequency for the C allele at the variant of 0.49 and 0.26, respectively. Therefore, the sample contributing to the metaanalysis was restricted to those 1780 of European decent, of which 1569 participants had phenotypic and genotypic information available, whereas data for those 1266 of black ethnicity, of which 1070 had genotypes and phenotypes, were analyzed separately.\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a longitudinal study designed as a scientific study of aging. Of the more than 1400 participants, genotype information is available for 1230 participants, aged 17 to 92.

ABI was defined as the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the ankle to systolic blood pressure in the arm. In InCHIANTI, systolic blood pressure was measured with a hand-held Doppler stethoscope (Parks Electronics model 41-A, Aloha, Ore) in both posterior tibial arteries and the right brachial artery. The highest pressure at each set was used to calculate the index, and the final ABI was calculated using the lower of the right and left posterior tibial pressures divided by the brachial artery pressure. 17 Two follow-up measurements were also taken at 3 and 6 years after the baseline interview, and these were used in assessment of incident PAD.\nIn Health ABC, ABI was defined as the ratio of blood pressure in the right ankle to the right upper arm and similarly for the left. Two measurements were taken, and a mean was calculated for each leg. 18 One follow-up measurement was taken during the fourth year interview and was used to compile incident PAD cases. In BLSA, blood pressure was taken at both right and left arms and ankles, using an automated testing device (Colin VP2000/1000). The minimum value between the left and right legs was used in the analysis. ABI measures were also taken at the fourth year follow-up interview and were used to define incident cases.\nThose with an ABI measure \u03fe1.40 were removed because this is indicative of noncompressible, calcified arteries, 14 and although this also carries a risk of mortality, 19 inclusion of these individuals could have led to a misclassification of arterial extremity disease. An ABI measure \u03fd0.90 in either leg was used to define the presence of PAD because this has been reported to be highly sensitive and specific for defining angiographically documented PAD. 20 PAD cases at baseline across all 3 studies were analyzed within the main analysis.

In Health ABC, subjects are asked whether a health professional had ever told them that they had had a heart attack, and their current medications are checked to assess for those compatible with a history of heart disease. At follow-up interviews, participants are asked whether they have been told of a heart attack or hospitalized, and events are adjudicated according to specific algorithms that involve data from hospitalization, such as electrocardiographic findings and enzyme results. Information was combined to record individuals who had had an MI event at baseline or would go on to experience an event in the follow-up period. Smoking exposure and status at baseline in each study were included as 2 covariates: the first recorded as a categorical variable, where 0 was never smoked, 1 was former smoker, and 2 was current smoker and the second as number of pack-years exposure, where 1 pack-year is calculated as 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 1 year from individual self-report data. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were recorded using self-report questionnaires in InCHIANTI and BLSA, whereas hypercholesterolemia was adjusted for using baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, which were calculated using the Friedewald formula.\nIn Health ABC, those with diabetes at baseline were identified first by report of being told by a health professional that they had diabetes or by the identification of medications specific for diabetes treatment. For hypertension, those who reported hypertension or who were on medications consistent with treatment were considered hypertensive.

After removal of MI cases from the InCHIANTI and Health ABC samples and adjustment for atherosclerotic risk factors, the rs1333049 C allele remains significantly associated with lower ABI and increased risk of PAD (\u2424\u03ed\u03ea0.018; 95% CI, \u03ea0.03 to \u03ea0.01; P\u03ed1.5\u03eb10 \u03ea4 ; and OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.67; P\u03ed0.007, respectively).\nAlternative approaches to testing whether the reported associations with ABI and PAD were independent of MI diagnosis were considered.

In a previous study, the relationship between this marker and PAD was also explored, resulting in an association with an odds ratio of 1.14, 6 which disappeared when removing those with histories of MI, suggesting a lack of independent effect on the peripheral arterial system. In this study, we examined the association of the rs1333049 polymorphism with peripheral arterial function in older populations. We found that the C allele, present in 49% to 54% of the participants in our meta-analysis, was associated with both a lower ABI and an increased prevalence of PAD. Removing baseline and incident MI cases had very little effect on the association, indicating that the association with PAD is statistically independent of clinical MI in older subjects. In addition, the effect of the C allele of the variant increased when the analysis was restricted to those participants with an ABI \u05451.0.\nPAD is a common disease, with an estimated 27 million individuals affected in North America and Europe in 2007. 25 Up to 50% of patients experience both coronary artery disease and PAD concomitantly 26, 27 because atherosclerosis is involved in both conditions. A genome-wide association study of subclinical atherosclerotic measures had previously found no evidence for an association with continuous ABI and the CDKN2a/2b locus, but their analysis was based on 984 young to middle-aged individuals, 28 suggesting a lack of power to detect the small effect size expected. By using a sample of 2630 older individuals, we have shown that the rs1333049 variant, known to be associated with MI and major vessel aneurysms, is also associated with a higher prevalence of PAD, independent of diagnosed MI. This is also true for the association with lower ABI values, which suggests an effect on the full range of PAD, including the milder forms that may later progress to more serious disease. 29 Unfortunately, the available data do not allow a detailed analysis of the time sequence of onsets of MI and PAD. Future work could focus on this, in sufficiently large cohorts with multiple waves of data.\nOur analysis also suggests that rs1333049 can be considered a risk factor for PAD independent of common atherosclerotic risks, such as diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. In addition, the C allele increased the risk of PAD in the small number of incident cases from the follow-up ABI measurements of InCHIANTI and Health ABC, although this failed to reach significance.\nThe rs1333049 SNP is distal to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes CDKN2a and CDKN2b locus, which code for p16 and p15, respectively, closely related proteins involved in cell cycle control and cellular senescence. In a range of mice and human tissues, p16 expression increases with age. 30, 31 Experimental upregulation of p16 in mice promotes aging-related changes in a range of cell types, resulting in cell senescence and decreased tissue regeneration. [32] [33] [34] [35] Although evidence for the mechanism of action of the 9p21 polymorphism in human MI is limited, it has been suggested that cellular senescence plays a critical role in vascular pathophysiology and atherosclerosis (reviewed in reference 36). Accumulation of vascular senescent cells could lead to a reduction in regeneration and repair capabilities, leading to atherosclerotic damage. Lower levels and poorer quality of circulating endothelial progenitor cells have been reported in preliminary data on patients with PAD, 37, 38 which are implicated as determinants of subclinical atherosclerosis. 39 Although it should be noted that recent work by Samani et al 40 has found no association between early atherosclerotic markers in 1295 middle-aged to elderly individuals, there is evidence that the downstream ANRIL locus, which is partially overlapped by the coronary artery disease risk haplotype, is expressed in a number of cells and tissues affected by atherosclerosis, 41 suggesting a potential role in heart disease, despite the unknown function of its noncoding RNA transcript.\nFurthermore, it is interesting to note that other common (but independent) genetic variants near the p16/p15 locus have been associated with other aging phenotypes, including type II diabetes 2, 42, 43 and impaired physical functioning in elderly individuals. 44 In our analysis, we also examined SNP phenotype associations in black origin respondents from the Health ABC study. In this population, rs1333049 SNP was found not to be associated with ABI or PAD in any of the analysis models performed. This is not surprising because the rs1333049 SNP is not associated with MI in this population or in blacks from the ADVANCE study. 45 This lack of association may be caused by a different linkage disequilibrium structure in the locus of interest in non-European individuals, making this SNP a poor marker of the biologically relevant locus. In addition, it is possible that the effect size is much smaller in subjects of African descent than that seen in populations of European descent, resulting in a lack of power to detect the effect in 1194 individuals.\nIn conclusion, the common variant near the CDKN2a/2b locus on chromosome 9p21 is associated with a lower ABI and an increased risk of PAD in 3 studies of elderly whites. This association was independent of MI diagnosis and known atherosclerotic risk factors.
