Therefore, this is highly crucial to estimate the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic and predict the time course, peak time, total duration, and so on. Our study focuses on the COVID-19 case prediction using a modified SIR model (M-SIR) in the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). SAARC is considered as an intergovernmental organization and geopolitical union of states in South Asia. Its member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Our aim is to develop a prediction model for the SAARC countries to understand the epidemiological trend of novel coronavirus outbreak in these countries. Here we explore a modified version based on the Susceptible (S)-Infected (I)-Recovered (R) epidemic model to predict the short term (20 days), mid-term (90 days) and long term (180 days) evaluation of COVID-19 situation in these countries of SAARC regions."}, {"section_title": "Dataset Analysis", "text": "For this paper, we have used datasets from various sources for our analysis and building the model.

Similarly, we also predicted the epidemic curve of SAARC regions for the midterm (90 days) and long term (180 days) COVID-19 cases. After predicting the 20 days of the epidemic, we noticed that India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan are increasing gradually by minimizing the active cases, and their recovery rate is also rising over time. However, in this short period, the confirmed cases of these countries are also increasing till June 19, 2020.\n.

A midterm (90 Days) prediction model is further assessed until August 31, 2020, and the nature of the epidemic curve has been depicted in Figure 4 . For all the countries of the SAARC regions, we have predicted the total number of confirmed, death, recovery, and active cases.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 30, 2020. . Figure 4 : Based on the M-SIR prediction model, prediction statistics for the upcoming 90 days for all the countries in the SAARC regions has depicted here. Different predicted case scenarios (confirmed, death, recovered, and active) till August 31, 2020, helps to understand the epidemiological nature of COVID-19 in the south Asian region. The predicted model indicates that in the next 90 days prediction curve will increase sharply for India (in terms of confirmed and death cases). Moreover, India will also show a substantial increase in its recovery rate. However, the number of active cases will increase in Pakistan till August 31, 2020.\nLastly, a long term prediction model for the next 180 days (till November 30 2020) situation has been presented in Figure 5 . According to the prediction model, active cases will fall to zero at the end of June in Sri Lanka, and at the beginning of August in India ( Figure 5) . However, Bangladesh, Maldives, and Pakistan will take more few months to reduce its active cases. On the other hand, countries like Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan will show a steep increase in their active cases. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 30, 2020. . .

In a general SIR model, transmission rate (\u03b2) and recovery rate (\u03b3) are considered as two timeinvariant variables. Moreover, several research studies have shown that a SIR model works much better in presenting the information contained in the confirmed case data than an SEIR model 14 .\nTherefore we have developed a model that can dynamically adjust the crucial parameters while working on time-varying data, which is also treated as a modified SIR (M-SIR) model 15 .\nHowever, in a basic SIR model, the reproduction number (\u0734 ) is a simple division of transmission and recovery rates, as shown in Equation (3).\nFor building the model, we modified the primary reproduction number, \u0734 with respect to time (t).

Though the novel coronavirus originated and started to spread from China but, countries from the South-Asian region are also infected faster than other countries globally. The overall population density of the countries in the SAARC regions is also too high.\nAccording to Table 4 , we can observe the various parameters (population, land area, density, and world share) and their impact on analyzing the spread of novel coronavirus in these regions. We further extended our prediction model for the next 90 days and 180 days, respectively.\nBesides, the total number of the population of a country is also parameterized because the total population of a country cannot be infected. Therefore, if we consider the total population as infected, then the probable number of infected persons remains unknown.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the very first COVID-19 prediction model which focused on the countries of SAARC regions. This epidemic modelling can be a helpful tool for estimating and predicting the scale and time course of COVID-19, evaluation of the effectiveness of public health interventions, and information on public health policies in SAARC countries. In future machine learning tools can be further used to identify and optimize time profile for the confinement."}, {"section_title": "Author Contribution", "text": "All authors conceptualized and designed the study.
