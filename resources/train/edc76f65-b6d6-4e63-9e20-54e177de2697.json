[{"section_title": "", "text": "6 group of A-or G-rich oligonucleotides, such as GAG and GGA, showed a high positive 134 correlation independent of clade, which was not expected from the changes in 135 mononucleotide compositions alone. To confirm the extent of these changes, we also 136 calculated the fold change in composition for the first isolated month and the last 137 examined month (Fig. 2) and found clear increases and decreases in mono-and 138 oligonucleotide compositions common among the six clades, which supports the result 139 presented in Fig. 1 and Tables 1 and 2 . to slow approximately 10 months after the start of the epidemic. The increase/decrease 150 trend for SARS-CoV-2 is far from slowing after 10 months, and the next important 151 questions are how long these directional changes in this virus will last and whether there 152 are possible goals to these changes. 153\nTo conduct this near-future prediction, the following information concerning 154 influenza viruses should be useful. As mentioned before, mono-and oligonucleotide 155 compositions in influenza H1N1/09 changed towards those of seasonal influenza strains 156 such as the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes [11] . Furthermore, all the human subtypes 157 showed directional changes away from the compositions of all avian influenza A 158 subtypes and closer to those of the human influenza B type, which has been prevalent 159 only in humans [14] . If we assume that changes similar to those in the influenza virus 7 will occur, the mono-and oligonucleotide compositions of interest for SARS-CoV-2 are 161 expected to change towards those of other coronaviruses that have been prevalent in 162 humans and away from those of coronaviruses prevalent in bats. To test this hypothesis, 163\nwe analyzed the following coronaviruses: 238 human-CoV strains (alphacoronaviruses 164 229E and NL63: betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43) and 166 bat-CoV strains 165 (alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, including the SARS virus). 166\nAs shown in Fig. 3A , we compared the mononucleotide compositions of 167 SARS-CoV-2 with those of the human-and bat-CoV strains; the data for bat SARS 168 among bat-CoV strains, which is thought to be the original strain that caused the current 169 COVID-19 pandemic, are marked in pink. Interestingly, concerning the human-and 170 bat-CoV strains, differences in mononucleotide composition were more pronounced 171 between hosts than between the alpha and beta linages, and the levels for all six clades 172 of SARS-CoV-2 were between those for the two hosts. the current compositions are far from this hypothetical goal (Fig. 3) ; therefore, we 182 predict that directional changes of interest will continue in the near future. 183\nThen, assuming that the average value for all human-CoV strains is a 184 hypothetical goal, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 has approached this possible goal. Next, we considered the mechanisms that move oligonucleotide compositions away 207 from those of bat coronaviruses and closer to those of human coronaviruses. Certain 208 human cellular factors involved in viral growth may be candidates in such mechanisms. 209\nWhen considering possible protein factors, oligonucleotides longer than trinucleotides 210 should be a focus. As an attempt, we here focused on host RNA-binding proteins 211 because their binding to hepatitis C virus is known to be involved in the growth of this 212 RNA virus [20] . We thus searched for motifs for human RNA-binding proteins in 213 coronavirus genomes (see Methods section) and found multiple loci with binding motifs 214 for each protein. Table 3 (and Table S10 ) lists the motifs for which a directional time-215 dependent change was primarily common among six clades. Table 3 and Fig. 5A show 216 that only ELAVL1 showed a positive correlation, but the other nine proteins in Table 3  217 showed a negative correlation for almost all clades; the results for other motifs are 218 presented in Table S12 . 219\nWe next compared the numbers of these motifs in SARS-CoV-2 with the 220 numbers of human-and bat-CoV motifs (Fig. 5B ). Of the ten proteins shown in Table 3 , 221 the only elevated motif, that for ELAVL1 binding, was found in a significantly higher 222 number of loci in human-CoV than in bat-CoV, but motifs for PCBP2 and SRSF1 223 binding, which tended to decrease (Table 3) , were found in significantly fewer loci in 224 human-CoV. These observations appear to be consistent with the features found in the 225 mono-, di-and trinucleotide compositions of interest. However, unlike these changes, 226 there was significant diversity within even a single clade, which appears to be greater 227 than the differences between hosts, with the possible exception of ELAVL1. In regard 228\nto long oligonucleotides, they should carry out a variety of functions, and mutations that We first discuss possible molecular mechanisms related to time-dependent directional 235 changes in mononucleotide composition. Fig. 1A shows that the frequency of C tended 236 to decrease in SARS-CoV-2, while that of U tended to increase. Since a similar change 237 was previously found for MERS and all A-type influenza subtypes [12, 14] , these 238 changes may have biological significance for a wide range of RNA viruses that invade 239 from nonhuman hosts. One possible mechanism is the host RNA-editing function; 240\nSimmonds (2020) proposed that the C\u2192U hypermutation in SARS-CoV-2 may be due 241 to the influence of APOBEC family proteins in humans [19] . APOBEC is an antiviral 242 protein in various animal species, including humans, that can convert C to U by the 243 deacetylation of C [21-23]. Such RNA editing is also known to act as a defense 244 mechanism against various viruses, including retroviruses [24] . The APOBEC gene 245 family has generated various paralogs during mammalian evolution, with seven known 246 APOBEC genes in humans and ten in bat families [25] [26] [27] . The prevalence C\u2192U 247 change in SARS-CoV-2 upon transfer of its host environment from bats to humans 248 suggests that these changes may be due to human-specific APOBEC genes. 249\nWe next discuss changes in short oligonucleotides. Directional changes in 250 some oligonucleotides, such as GAG and GGA, cannot be explained by APOBEC-251 induced C\u2192U mutations alone. Although the evidence is weak, these oligonucleotides 252 are part of the binding motifs of several RNA-binding proteins, such as SRSF1 and 253 PCBP2 (Table S9 ); the number of loci for these motifs has decreased independently of 254 clade. In contrast, the number of motif loci for only ELAVL1 among the ten proteins 255 listed in Table 3 has increased independently of clade. As an RNA-binding protein that 256 binds A-or U-rich elements, ELAVL1 binding to mRNA is known to contribute to 257 RNA stability [28, 29]; SARS-CoV-2 and human-CoV, which are prevalent in humans, 258 may contain increased binding motifs for ELAVL1 for efficient growth in the human 259 cellular environment. However, for further analysis, information on RNA-binding 260 proteins in bat cells is needed. 261 262"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions 263", "text": "In the present study, we found that the compositions of a group of mono-and 264 oligonucleotide in SARS-CoV-2 genomes have changed in a host cell-dependent 265 manner.
