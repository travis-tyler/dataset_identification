This study aims to develop a composite biomarker that can accurately measure the sequential biological stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on an individual level. We selected 144 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 datasets.

We identified the numerical order of the S optimal as the characterizing Alzheimer's disease risk events (CARE) index to measure disease stage.

Chen et al. / Staging Alzheimer's Disease with CARE Index", "text": "AD stage and dictating stage-dependent therapeutic strategies, especially with regard to facilitating secondary prevention of AD [2] . Therefore, estimating the optimal temporal order (S optimal ) of AD biomarkers is essential in uncovering AD development processes and designing effective treatment strategies.\nAfter decades of research, we now understand AD development to be complex in nature, with a series of causal sequences between pathologies and functions. An earlier concept recognized amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) deposition as the earliest AD trigger, causing downstream neurodegeneration and cognitive deficit in turn [3] . However, this linear pathway concept appears to be flawed given that A\u2424 removal has proven ineffective in improving clinical outcomes [4, 5] . Recent studies indicate several neurodegenerative biomarkers arise upstream in AD. Specifically, neural dysfunction would induce A\u2424 pathologies [6] , and the soluble A\u2424 peptides can further exacerbate neural dysfunction before fibrillar A\u2424 deposits [7] . This corroborates observations of aberrant hippocampal hyperactivity and default mode network (DMN) hypoconnectivity or hypometabolism in apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers without detectable A\u2424 deposition [8] [9] [10] . Tau pathology also is required in mediating A\u2424 toxicity [11] . These diverse pathophysiological events constitute the temporal-dependent process underlying AD development [4] . Our study focused on determining the S optimal of those pathophysiological events represented by corresponding dynamic biomarkers, in order to accurately stage each individual across the whole AD spectrum.\nThree major technical challenges impede the determination of the S optimal among AD biomarkers. First, the conventional symptom-based group definition involves biologically heterogeneous populations and, therefore, poses a great challenge for disease staging [12] . Second, the dichotomizations of biomarker values by \"cut-off point\" thresholds appear to deviate from the continuous nature of insidious AD progression. Also, the cut-off points are difficult to standardize across laboratories [13] . Third, the S optimal determination among multiple biomarkers generally requires a large cohort with a long follow-up period to link preclinical to advanced AD stages, complicating study design and significantly raising costs. System biology is an emerging strategy to unravel temporal relationships among biomarkers and predict disease progression related to AD by modeling approaches [14] , thus exhibiting great potential in addressing the above challenges.\nSpecifically, the event-based probabilistic (EBP) model can learn the temporal order of biomarkers to describe disease progression from large crosssectional datasets based on the Bayesian theory [15, 16] . The EBP model is a decision-making tool that determines the order of a complex system of events by estimating the probabilities of occurrence and nonoccurrence of a series of events, rather than by dichotomizing biomarker status based on the cut-off point threshold.\nOur study extended the EBP model innovatively by integrating functional, structural, biofluid, and cognitive biomarkers to determine the S optimal , which links the appearance of any specific biomarkers in asymptomatic individuals to the subsequent emergence of clinical symptomatology across the whole continuum of the AD development process.\nbetween CARE index scores and clinical stages exists across all groups, including EMCI and LMCI subjects who were not involved in the estimation of S optimal .

As an example, we have selected four typical subjects, one from each of the CN, EMCI, LMCI, and AD groups, to illustrate the distribution of the normalized likelihoods at each position on the CARE index (Fig. 3A) . The AD risk for each of the four subjects was determined by the position of the subject's highest likelihood value on the CARE index, where a score of 1 is associated with a CN subject, 4 with an EMCI subject, 7 with an LMCI subject, and 9 with an AD subject. Moreover, the curve provides likelihood values at other CARE index scores, showing each subject's risk of developing AD. For example, the LMCI subject had a relatively high likelihood value (close to 0.6) at CARE index scores 7, 8, and 9, in addition to the highest likelihood value (0.65) at CARE index score 6. This suggests that this LMCI subject has a high risk of progressing from LMCI to AD-type dementia. Information of this nature may facilitate individual clinical inference.\nSpecifically, we found that all but one of the CN subjects have a CARE index score less than or equal to 6, while all AD subjects have a CARE index score greater than or equal to 6 (Fig. 3B) . Similarly, the CARE index scores for EMCI and LMCI groups were between those of the CN and AD groups (Fig. 3C) . With regard to CARE index score differences among groups (Fig. 3D) , the median CARE index scores of the CN, EMCI, LMCI, and AD groups were 2, 4, 6, and 9, respectively.

For the method of repeatability, please refer to the Supplementary Methods 8."}, {"section_title": "Intrasubject repeatability of CARE index measurement", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our study demonstrated that, given the availability of multimodal biomarkers measured by only three examinations, neuroimaging (brain function and structure), biological fluid (CSF), and cognitive assessments, the real-world cross-sectional datasets from cohorts comprising the whole AD continuum could be used to determine the AD development sequence. This accomplishment is significant because such a study would otherwise require rich resources involving a large sample size and a longitudinal design with high costs and a protracted period. The major finding of this study is that when multiple AD biomarkers are temporally ordered, functional abnormalities in the HIP and PCC networks comprise the earliest event, even antedating detectable CSF A\u2424 and p-tau abnormalities. This finding sheds light on the link between preclinical AD status and symptomatic onset and can be applied to accurately identify progressive AD trajectories, given the condition that disease onset remains insidious and no single biomarker serves as a predictor for future cognitive decline. Destabilized brain function can serve as a critical contributor to AD cognitive deterioration [22, 23] . Of the various brain networks, the DMN and the hippocampal functional connectivity network (HFCN) are closely associated with both AD pathologies and clinical symptoms [2] . With regard to the HFCN, major studies have observed hippocampal hyperactivity at the early AD stage [8, 24] and identified it as a potential indicator of impending cognitive impairment [25] . It is assumed that early-stage hippocampal hyperactivity may be related to A\u2424-induced hippocampal synaptic excitotoxicity, tau accumulation [22] , or mitochondrial dysfunction [26] . With respect to the DMN, it overlaps broadly with A\u2424 deposition, and the overlap is possibly attributed to continuously high neural activity in the DMN regions that advance A\u2424 accumulation [27] . Studies convergently demonstrate DMN hypoconnectivity and hypometabolism in AD-continuum subjects including asymptomatic APOE 4 carriers [28] , amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects [29] , and AD-type dementia subjects [30] . Accordingly, current findings indicate that aberrant DMN and hippocampal connectivity strength could be among the earliest events to trigger AD and may represent initial disease targets.\nAn unresolved issue in evaluating AD biomarker utilities is how their changes influence the cognitive decline trajectory and clinical onset. Although earlier studies suggest amyloidosis impairment on cognitive function [31] , this association remains weak and controversial [32] . This study observed that cognitive impairment, indexed by MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and AVLT scores, occurred following abnormal brain network connectivity, CSF A\u2424 levels, and p-tau levels. It indicates that clinical AD symptoms emerge as downstream events following brain amyloidosis and neurodegenerative changes. Also, this event sequence provides evidence to support a recent concept that neither amyloidosis nor neurodegeneration is sufficient in isolation to cause the AD pathophysiological and clinical cascade [33] ; rather, the co-occurrence of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration significantly advances gray matter atrophy [34, 35] , accelerates cognitive deterioration [36, 37] , and increases MCI or dementia hazard in cognitively normal elderly cohorts [38] . Mechanistically, emerging biological studies indicate that A\u2424 and tau interaction is a driving force in AD development. A\u2424 accumulation advances tau disease progression in that both enhance tauopathy [39] and potentiate tau impairment on brain function [40] . Further, tau is a required factor in A\u2424-induced neurotoxicity [11, 41] . Clearly, current findings regarding the S optimal support the notion that, while amyloidosis and neurodegeneration arise independently, once both are present they interact to advance the AD pathophysiological cascade and are a key mechanism in transforming normal aging into AD [33, 42] .\nThe conventional symptom-based AD staging system is limited in effectively facilitating disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This limitation can be attributed to remarkably inter-subject biological heterogeneity within each stage and relatively low temporal resolution of the three stages (cognitive normal, MCI, and dementia) in illustrating continuous AD progression. The estimated S optimal and derived CARE index discussed herein would address these attributions by characterizing the risk of the 10 AD events at the individual level through neither clinical diagnosis information nor a specific biomarker cut-off point. This study demonstrates that the CARE index scores closely parallel disease severity through the whole AD continuum, as indicated by its gradual increase from CN to MCI to AD at the symptom-defined group level and close correlation with episodic memory performance. The higher the CARE index score, the more advanced and severe the disease. Accordingly, the CARE index may serve as a surrogate to indicate the AD development process and facilitate clinical trials by a) identifying AD-risk subjects who do not yet have any clinical symptoms; b) staging and categorizing patient populations based on their CARE index scores to enrich response rates, as has been demonstrated in oncology; and c) monitoring and evaluating treatment efficacy through individual subjects' changes in CARE index scores. This personalized medicine technique would be particularly beneficial in assessing the efficacy of promising secondary prevention interventions in patients at the earliest discernible stage of AD.\nThis study has four limitations. First, this is the first attempt to incorporate the resting-state functional connectivity HIP FCI and PCC FCI biomarkers into the EBP model. Future studies could integrate other functional and structural biomarkers, including the executive control network, salience network, and insular network, into the biomarker sequence to characterize the trajectory of the neural network changes with AD progression. Second, currently available datasets include only 45 CN and 25 AD subjects, which limits the representative probability distributions of biomarkers generated to accurately estimate the temporal order of biomarkers. The S optimal determined from a larger sample size may be different from the current results. Third, this study relies on the assumption that all subjects follow a single optimal event sequence, despite heterogeneous pathways of sporadic AD development [1, 43] . A recent study introduced a cluster of subjects that may follow different event sequences in their disease progression [44] . Fourth, the current-event-based model used a na\u00efve Bayesian model that assumes the different biomarkers are independent measurements. The assumption is not always true. However, in practice, a na\u00efve Bayesian system can work surprisingly well, even when the independence assumption is not true [45] . Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes, additional biomarker events, and updated analysis, are required to enhance our understanding of AD pathogenesis and improve detection of AD progression on an individual level."}]
