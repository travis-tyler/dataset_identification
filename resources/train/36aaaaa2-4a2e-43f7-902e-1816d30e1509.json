[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Urban coastal flooding is a global humanitarian and socioeconomic hazard. Over 20 million people reside below present day high tide levels, and 200 million are vulnerable to storm flooding . Sea level rise will substantially increase risks to human life and infrastructure (e.g., Hanson et al., 2011) . In the context of coastal risk management, three prevailing options for addressing present and future flooding are to protect, accommodate or retreat (Linham and Nicholls, 2012) . Although new development may be built to accommodate high water conditions, economically valuable legacy structures require protection. Hard armoring can increase passive erosion, damage ecosystems and limit recreation (e.g., Airoldi et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2005; Pendleton et al., 2012) . Soft protection such as beach nourishment or artificial dune construction (e.g. Flick, 1993; Rogers et al., 2010; Cooke et al., 2012; Cooper and Lemckert, 2012; Pendleton et al., 2012) may be preferred in locations where beaches are central to culture and economy.\nExtensive research efforts have considered the protective effects of beach nourishments (e.g., National Research Council, 1995; Dean, 2001; Hanson et al., 2002) and coastal dunes (e.g., van Rijn, 2009; Bochev et al., 2011; El Mrini et al., 2012; Hanley et al., 2014) . van Rijn (2011) assessed the effectiveness of hard and soft erosion management practices on sandy beaches using a mix of numerical modeling, laboratory and field data. Matias et al. (2005) studied dune nourishment along an eroded barrier island and concluded that augmented natural dunes successfully mitigated overwash events. Sallenger (2000) developed a storm impact scale to assess dune vulnerability and Judge et al. (2003) proposed survival and failure indication parameters. Dune erosion modeling has received significant and sustained attention (e.g., Edelman, 1968 Edelman, , 1972 van de Graff, 1977; Vellinga, 1982; Fisher and Overton, 1985 ; Kriebel 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55 and Dean, 1985; Kobayashi, 1987; Kriebel, 1991; Overton et al., 1994; Sallenger, 2000; Roelvink et al., 2009) . Edelman (1968 Edelman ( , 1972 , Kobayashi (1987) ; Kriebel (1991) and Larson et al. (2004) developed simple analytical dune erosion models. Larson and Kraus (1989) presented SBEACH, an empirically based numerical model and Roelvink et al. (2009) developed a two dimensional flow and sediment transport model, XBeach, for predicting cross-shore beach evolution. Collectively, this work shows the beach-dune system's coastal protection utility. However, these studies do not examine artificial dunes constructed specifically to mitigate imminent coastal flooding hazards. Beach berming, also known as beach scraping, bumping, reprofiling, and nature assisted beach enhancement (NABE), is the mechanical transfer of a thin layer of sand from the lower beach foreshore to the beach crest (Bruun, 1983) that originated primarily as an erosion control method (e.g., Bruun, 1983; Tye, 1983; Wells and McNinch, 1991; McNinch and Wells, 1992) . In contrast to permanent dike structures found in continuously vulnerable regions such as the Netherlands, these berms are often sacrificial, intended only to deflect specific high water or energetic wave events. Temporary berming is a widely used coastal management strategy along the US coasts (e.g., Wells and McNinch, 1991; Clark, 2005; Kratzmann and Hapke, 2012) , Australia (Carley et al., 2010) and Europe (e.g., Rogers et al., 2010; Harley and Ciavola, 2013) . Kana and Svetlichny (1982) monitored a 14 km berming project along the US East Coast and found that beach berming provided relatively limited erosion protection. Froede (2010) concluded that although berms constructed on a barrier-spit island eroded in 15e27 months, they are integral to residential development protection. Recently beach berming has been used to mitigate flood risk (e.g., Harley and Ciavola, 2013) . In California, Edge et al. (2003) recognized the importance of beach berms for seasonal coastal protection and Schubert et al. (in press) studied prototype flood control berm failures. Extensive studies of artificial dunes in Fire Island, New York (Kratzmann and Hapke, 2012) and Florida (Magliocca et al., 2011) focused on the morphodynamic consequences on adjacent beaches rather than on the berms themselves. Hanley et al. (2014) considered the effects of winter dune construction on macro-invertebrate population at heavily managed beaches along the Adriatic Coast, but did not geometrically characterize the temporary dunes. Finally, Harley and Ciavola (2013) recognized the importance of artificial dunes protecting flood prone stretches of the Emilia-Romanga coast in Northern Italy and proposed a design tool, DuneMaker, to integrate berm geometries into a hydromorphological model. Clearly, beach berms play an important role in proactive coastal flood management. Near term sea level rise mitigation and adaptation strategies will increase berming activities, however fundamental berm design and performance data is absent in the literature. Understanding berm efficacy is crucial to optimal future beach management.\nLaser scanning, also known as LiDAR has been widely used to characterize both urban infrastructure and beach sand levels (e.g., Brock et al., 2002; Sallenger et al., 2003; Sanders, 2007; Fewtrell et al., 2011; Gallien et al., 2011) . Pietro et al. (2008) and Gares et al. (2006) monitored beach nourishment using LiDAR whereas Feagin et al. (2014) monitored dune volume change. Stockdon et al. (2002) used LiDAR to estimate shoreline change and extract dune crest elevations while Kratzmann and Hapke (2012) studied morphological consequences from berm building. In California, LiDAR has been used to estimate levee stability (Casas et al., 2012) , cliff erosion (e.g., Young and Ashford, 2006; Young et al., 2011) and seasonal sand level changes (Yates et al., 2009 ). Here, a decade of southern California coastal LiDAR is used to locate and quantitatively characterize anthropogenic flood control berms ranging from small ad-hoc event specific berms (Fig. 1a,b,d ) built in hours or days before a storm event, annual seasonal berms (Fig. 1c) to large sand T.W.

Prevailing winter wave energy results from Pacific Northwest storms (240 < D p < 320 ) characterized by swell frequencies of 12e18 s and significant wave heights of over 2 m (Adams et al., 2008) . Typical longshore transport is southward. The littoral cutoff diameter on southern California beaches is~0.125 mm and Griggs, 2006) , and median grain sizes typically range from 0.125 to 0.30 mm. However, all beaches in this study have been nourished, nourishment grains sizes of 0.34e0.62 mm have been reported (CSMW, 2013) .

Eleven possible berming sites were identified: Long Beach, Seal Beach, Sunset-Surfside, Newport Beach (Balboa), San Clemente, Moonlight Beach in Encinitas, Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, Naval Base Coronado (referred to hereafter as Coronado) and an area farther south in Silver Strand State Beach. Anthropogenic berms were found at eight sites, and analyzed at seven sites in Orange and San Diego Counties.

Slopes between 7 and 45 , the maximum beach slope and maximum angle of repose of wet sand, respectively, correspond to anthropogenic dunes. Slopes steeper than~45 , represent vegetation, vehicles and/or structures and were removed from analysis. Additionally, vegetated berms such as North Island in San Diego, and immediately south of the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado were also excluded from analysis. Individual berm cross-sections were examined to confirm both seaward and landward berm toes were appropriately delineated by the 7 steepness criterion (Fig. 3) . The elevation of berms ends (Z crest min ), defined as the termination of high gradients using the same 7 threshold, are typically slightly above the ambient beach (~25 cm). Slopes within the target range were converted to polygons and artifacts from structures or gaps in the berm were manually removed or joined as needed. Moonlight Beach has a steep and continuous slope seaward of the berm, therefore the seaward toe was identified using the average elevation between the seaward berm ends."}, {"section_title": "Berm statistics", "text": "Berm geometries (area, volume, crest elevation and toe elevation) were estimated using ArcMap using a 2 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Length and crest elevation were determined along a crest line through the highest DEM pixels within the berm polygon. Toe elevation was determined by extracting DEM pixels along the seaward edge of the berm polygon. To calculate berm volume, a 3D reconstruction of the un-bermed beach was created using a triangular irregular network (TIN). The berm volume, V berm , is defined as the volume above the reconstructed base (Figs. 5e11, dashed lines). The volume of sand above Mean Sea Level (MSL), V msl , was calculated by subtracting the MSL plane from the surface DEM. MSL (in 1983e2001 epoch) was determined by the nearest tide gauge.

Water level was obtained from the nearest NOAA tide gauge in Los Angeles (9410660) or La Jolla (9410230) California (NOAA, 2013) . Water levels are nearly identical between these two gauges (Flick, 1998; Schubert et al., in press) , and when observations were unavailable the other gauge was substituted.\nThe CDIP buoy network (http://cdip.ucsd.edu) was used in combination with a spectral refraction model (O'Reilly and Guza, , 1993 Guza, , 1998 to estimate hourly significant wave heights along the 10 m depth contour (100 m alongshore spacing) seaward of each berm. The refraction model includes the effects of complex offshore (e.g., the Channel Islands) and local shelf bathymetry. Ocean swell predictions (here 0.04e0.1 Hz) are initialized with offshore buoy data and sea predictions (0.1e0.5 Hz) use nearby local deepwater buoys along the mainland shelf break. Incident wave energy and f p were estimated as the mean of the alongshore 10 m depth predictions fronting the berm. The hindcast wave height in 10 m is linearly (un)shoaled to obtain H 0 .\nComparison of modeled and observed waves at three buoys (not used in swell predictions) located near the bermed beaches show generally good prediction of wave energy E, but scatter in f p (Fig. 4) .

The wave model is not accurate enough to routinely reproduce the f p instability in the observed data; however, the most extreme wave events are typically dominated by a single peak that is reproduced by the model. The widely used, Stockdon et al. (2006) empirical formula for runup (equation (1)) is based on field observations from many sources. In some cases, only the bulk properties of waves (e.g., wave height, peak period), were reported, so equation (1) respectively.

End flow is controlled by wave runup relative to the crest elevation (Z crest min ) as it converges toward the un-bermed beach surface (Fig. 3b) . Berm avalanching (i.e., slumping or notching) is the cumulative effect of water level and waves interacting with the berm toe (Z toe min ). Failure modes may occur concurrently.\nSouthern California berms interact with coincident high water levels and energetic waves only a few hours during a given deployment. In no case did maximum water levels, shown as the gray bands in Figs. 5e11, exceed crest elevations, suggesting Fig. 6 caption for details.) T.W.

Five individual berms were at risk of end flow (i.e., R 2% > Z crest min ) on up to ten occasions (Table 4) Fig. 7 ). Note that all end flow event waves are relatively long period (14 \u00fe sec), highlighting the strong dependency of R 2% (equation (1)\np . The minimum crest elevation, Z crest min , is slightly higher than the ambient beach elevation, but only 2% of runups reach this level and the volume of end flow associated with an event is unknown.\nTotal water level (TWL) exceeded the toe elevation of most berms, allowing at least limited avalanching. Note that at Coronado the slope break occurs near MHHW suggesting the seaward toe is under consistent attack. However, the percentage of berm volume under attack relative to the total seaward berm volume is small (~2%). A significant avalanching event is defined here as a minimum of 10% of the seaward berm volume exposed to the total water level for one of more hours (Table 5 ). The event berms at Balboa Beach and both Ocean Beach berms were subject to significant avalanching conditions. The December 2007 berm at Ocean Beach stands out as a particularly vulnerable, both end flow and avalanching may have occurred.\nLiDAR flights and coincident high TWL are rare. Only four berms at Balboa, Mission and Ocean beaches were surveyed shortly before or after high water events. The October 2005 flight (Table 4) (H s~3 m, T p~1 8 s) . Maximum TWL and minimum berm elevations differed by less than 15 cm for three of these events, suggest near optimal berm design. The berms were sufficiently high to prevent overtopping, but no taller than necessary."}, {"section_title": "Berm monitoring and design", "text": "Monitoring the performance of these widely used, but not well understood, mitigation structures is critical to assessing future adaptation strategies for the urban coast. Figlus et al. (2011) suggests berm resiliency depends on berm geometry and although literature mentions temporary anthropogenic sand dunes for flood control, location, geometrical properties or performance of these critical structures are not widely addressed and represents a significant gap in the current literature.\nThe highest total water levels and potential berm failures are caused by a combination of high tides and energetic long period swell (Tables 4 and 5 ). The maximum duration event was 4 h and most events were 1e2 h. Stockdon R 2% runup represents the maximum elevation of the runup tongue which carries only nominal volume. From a flood modeling perspective, the volume of water that overtops the berm or flows around the ends is the fundamental quantity of interest, thus berm efficacy hinges on the maximum admitted volume. Optimization of berm design requires careful consideration of the berm length, placement, beach width (infiltration) and end flow conditions. Designs may be optimized using maximum allowable volume for overtopping and end flow instead of runup alone. Unfortunately, empirical overtopping models do not accurately estimate overtopping rates (Laudier et al., 2011; Gallien et al., 2014) and numerical overtopping models are insufficiently validated in the field. 20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 Currently berms actively deflect high TWL events for only a few hours per year and erosion of these berms is minimal. The 2000e2009 data did not include a significant El Ni\u00f1o event, however higher future TWLs associated with sea level rise or El Ni\u00f1o greatly increase the number of impact hours per year (Fig. 12) . As berm duty cycles increase, morphological feedback and failure mechanisms become critical to flood forecasting. A berm can be completely eroded by wave attack without runup ever reaching the original (uneroded) crest level."}, {"section_title": "Alternative scenarios and adaptation", "text": "If an additional 30 cm of water level, consistent with a strong El Ni\u00f1o, were considered, nearly all event berms would experience end flow, and impact hours increase dramatically to over 27 h per berm per year. Event berm end flow exposure increases from <1 h/ berm/year to 5 h/berm/year (Fig. 12a ) while Coronado's exposure increases from nearly zero to 1 h/berm/yr. From an avalanching perspective, only the event berms become vulnerable with a 30 cm increase in TWL. If an additional 93 cm, the average of estimates for the Los Angeles region in 2100 (National Research Council, 2012 ) is considered, two event berms crests are overtopped and nearly all berms experience end flow. Additionally, the persistent berm at Coronado becomes vulnerable to avalanching.\nCurrently, berms are located on or near the highest portion of the beach Landward migration is limited by significant development. Elevating the berm crest alone would likely not provide sufficient protection, because berms subjected to chronic interaction are vulnerable to rapid avalanching and deterioration (Schubert et al., in press ). Nourishment may be required to maintain present levels of protection. For illustrative purposes, we assume the entire profile shoreward of MSL is elevated by the same amount. For 25, 60, 110 and 170 cm of water level rise, approximately 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% increase in volume above MSL is required, respectively (Fig. 12b) . In the near term, 30 cm of SLR requires nourishments ranging 13,300 m 3 for short reaches such as Moonlight Beach to over 238,000 m 3 at longer reaches. Longer term, extensive nourishments (~400,000 m 3 ) may be required. a Elevations are given for the main berm (Fig. 8) . Exceedance hours including the small western berm are in parentheses. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66 However, nourishment plans must be carefully considered, recent evidence suggests nourishment sand may, in some cases, increase flooding of homes (Moreno, 2013) . Finally, the steepest portions of the beach are directly in front of the berm, sustained higher water levels may interact with a steeper foreshore and consequently increase runup and therefore end flow and overtopping volumes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The volumes and geometries of 34 berms in southern California are characterized using 18 LiDAR datasets spanning nine years. Three berm classifications emerged based on deployment duration: event, seasonal and persistent. Event berms are temporary structures with triangular cross-sections, relatively low volumes (~4 m 3 / m) and crest elevations (~5 m NAVD88). Seasonal berm are larger, volumes vary from 6 to 28 m 3 /m, and average crest elevations between 5.3 and 6.4 m. One persistent berm, captured in all LiDAR data for that area, is the largest (48 m 3 /m), longest (1.2 km), and highest mean crest elevation (7 m) of all study berms. Total water levels, estimated using observed tides and a regional wave model coupled with an empirical runup formula, suggest that overtopping is rare. Concerningly however, berms may fail through avalanching associated with berm toe and water level interaction without TWLs ever reaching the initial berm crest elevation. Anthropogenic berms protect numerous urbanized coastal reaches of southern California from flooding by coincident high water levels (~MHHW) and long period swell (14 \u00fe seconds). Currently, berms are active for relatively short durations (1e4 h), modest sea level rise (~25 cm) or higher water levels associated with El Ni\u00f1o, will increase exposure significantly and substantial nourishments may be required to maintain current levels of flood protection. Comprehensive future monitoring of anthropogenic flood mitigation berms is crucial to developing berm deployment guidance, optimizing future designs and accurate coastal hazard prediction. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  641  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66 "}]
