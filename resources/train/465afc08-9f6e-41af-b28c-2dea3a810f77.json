[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Feature selection has been applied to the analysis of complex structured data, such as functional connectivity networks (FCNs) constructed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), for removing redundant/noisy information. Previous studies usually first extract topological measures (e.g., clustering coefficients) from FCNs as feature vectors, and then perform vector-based algorithms (e.g., t-test) for feature selection. However, due to the use of vector-based representations, these methods simply ignore important local-to-global structural information of connectivity networks, while such structural information could be used as prior knowledge of networks to improve the learning performance. To this end, we propose a graph kernel-based structured feature selection (gk-SFS) method for brain disease classification with connectivity networks. Different from previous studies, our proposed gk-SFS method uses the graph kernel technique to calculate the similarity of networks and thus can explicitly take advantage of the structural information of connectivity networks. Specifically, we first develop a new graph kernel-based Laplacian regularizer in our gk-SFS model to preserve the structural information of connectivity networks. We also employ an l 1 -norm based sparsity regularizer to select a small number of discriminative features for brain disease analysis (classification).

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Aadvanced neuroimaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), provide non-invasive ways to explore the function of the human brain, thus providing important insights into the basic cognitive processes of the brain [1] .

Functional connectivity networks (FCNs) constructed from fMRI data can characterize\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Vincenzo Piuri. the interactions of brain regions at the connectivity level, and have been widely applied to the analysis of various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Dysfunctions have been found in AD/MCI/ADHD patiens in FCN. Recent, FCNs based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) have been applied to computer-aided diagnosis of brain diseases by using machine learning methods [4] - [8] .\nConventional connectivity network based studies usually contains two essential steps, i.e., feature extraction and feature selection. The aim of feature extraction is to extract meaningful measures (e.g., local clustering coefficients and connectivity strengths) from connectivity networks as feature representation for each subject. Feature selection focuses on selecting the most discriminative features to improve the performance of learned model. For example, Wee et al. [9] extract local clustering coefficient features from both structural and functional connectivity networks, followed by t-test based feature selection for MCI identification. Liu et al. [10] extract connectivity strength features from FCNs, and perform feature selection using F-scores to identify patients with social anxiety disorder. Wang et al. [11] use the Regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures extracted from fMRIs as feature representation of each subject, followed by the t-test algorithm to select the discriminative features for ADHD classification. Jie et al. [12] extract clustering coefficient features from hyper-connectivity networks, and perform a sparse-learning-based feature selection for MCI classification. These studies have shown that feature selection can not only improve the performances of disease diagnosis, but also help discover neuroimage-based biomarkers for better understanding the pathology of brain diseases.\nPrevious studies typically extract vector-wise measurements from FCNs and perform vector-based feature selection for subsequent classification. The major disadvantage of these studies is that they simply ignore the local-toglobal structural information conveyed in the whole population of connectivity networks, while such information can be used as the prior knowledge to boost the classification performance. To solve this issue, we propose a graph kernel based structured feature selection (called gk-SFS) method for brain disease classification using rs-fMRI data. Different from previous feature selection algorithms, the proposed gk-SFS method uses graph kernels to calculate the similarity of connectivity networks, thus naturally preserving the structural information of all networks. Here, graph kernel is a kernel that measures the structural similarity of a pair of graphs/networks. Specifically, our gk-SFS model contains two regularization items: 1) a graph kernel based Laplacian regularizer that can preserve the local-to-global structural information of network data, and 2) a l 1 -norm based sparsity regularizer [13] , [14] that can yield the sparse solution of model, and thus ensure only a small number of important features to be selected for classification. We validate our proposed method on two public datasets with baseline rs-fMRI data, i.e., 1) the ADNI dataset 1 that contains 43 Late MCI (lMCI) patients, 56 early MCI (eMCI) patients and 50 healthy controls (HCs), and 2) the ADHD-200 dataset 2 that includes 118 ADHD children and 98 HCs. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed gk-SFS method.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as following: in Section II,we briefly review the related studies.

RELATED WORKS A. FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY NETWORK ANALYSIS", "text": "Studies on anatomy and physiology have suggested that cognitive processes of the human brain are related with the interactions between brain regions [15] . These interactions can be represented as connectivity networks with nodes corresponding to brain regions (e.g., regions-of-interest, ROIs) [16] and edges denoting the interactions between brain regions. These connectivity networks provide an important way for helping us to better understand the functions of the brain and pathology of brain diseases, by exploring connectivity of networks using graph-based methods. Currently, FCNs have been widely applied to various kinds of tasks, including brain disease analysis [17] - [19] and video shots representation [20] . Existing brain disease analysis studies based on FCNs can be usually classified into two categories: 1) specific hypothesis test using group analysis algorithms, and 2) subjectlevel classification using machine learning algorithms. The first category focuses on testing specific hypothesis to identify abnormal connectivity and properties of networks in patients with brain diseases. For example, previous studies have demonstrated abnormal connectivity between the hippocampus and other regions in AD/MCI brains [21] , [22] . And other studies also found disrupted small-world properties in connectivity networks of AD/MCI patients [23] , [24] . One of disadvantages of these studies is that they usually investigate the connectivity in FCNs using group analysis methods, thus can not be used for automatic classification of brain diseases.\nIn the second category (i.e., subject-level classification methods), various machine learning methods have been used to train learning models for identifying patients with brain diseases from HCs. For example, previous studies have proposed effective connectivity network based methods to accurately identify AD/MCI patients from HCs [4] , [12] , [25] - [27] and to classify ADHD patients from HCs [18] . These studies usually first extract meaningful network measures as feature representation for each subject, followed by vector-based feature selection for classification. However, they usually ignore the structural information of connectivity networks, thus leading to sub-optimal learning performance."}, {"section_title": "B. FEATURE SELECTION", "text": "As a dimension reduction technique, feature selection helps eliminate redundant/noise features and is therefore widely used in a variety of applications for machine learning and pattern recognition. At present, there are a large number of feature selection methods that can be generally divided into two categories, i.e., ranking-based methods and subset-based methods. In ranking-based methods, all features are first ranked and then selected based on a specific criterion. Typical feature ranking algorithms include Laplacian score [28] , Fisher score [29] , t-test based on p-values, and infinite latent feature selection (called inf-FS) method proposed in [30] . The major limitation of this kind of methods is that they only take into account the specific contribution of each single feature, without considering the possible complementary information conveyed in multiple features. In the second category, a subset of features is selected by optimizing a specific objective function. Typical methods in this category include recursive feature elimination (RFE) method [31] , [32] , LASSO method [13] and HSIC-LASSO method [33] . Subset-based methods can take into account the importance of combined features, thus usually achieve better performance compared with ranking-based methods.\nIn FCN analysis, feature selection is usually performed to choose important features and remove redundant/noisy features for improving the learning performance. Two simple feature selection methods have been widely applied currently, i.e., t-test and LASSO methods. In the t-test method, the standard t-test algorithm is first used for measuring the discriminative power of each feature, followed by selecting important features based on their discriminative capability. Existing studies have shown that the t-test method typically achieves good performance in small sample problems [34] , [35] . Different from the t-test method, the LASSO method selects features by minimizing an l 1 -norm regularized objective function. Existing studies have shown that the LASSO method can achieve good performance when there are a large number of unrelated features but only a small amount of subjects [36] ."}, {"section_title": "C. GRAPH KERNEL", "text": "Kernel methods, which implicitly map the original data to a high-dimensional space in which the samples are more likely linear separable, have been successfully applied to many tasks [37] . The kernel can also be regarded as a function that calculates the similarity of subjects. Besides on vector-wise features, kernels can also be constructed on complex structured data, such as graphs. Such kernels constructed on graphs are called graph kernels, which measure the topological similarity between graphs [38] , [39] and have been used in image processing [40] and bioinformatics [41] , [42] . Recently, graph kernels are also used for brain connectivity network analysis, including brain disease classification [43] and task-related state analysis [44] .\nGraph kernels are usually constructed by comparing small sub-structures (i.e., sub-graphs), such as shortest-path [45] and walk [46] . For example, Shervashidze et al. [39] construct a subtree-based graph kernel (called Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel) that can effectively capture the structural information of graphs. The key idea of Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel is to construct kernel based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Specifically, given a pair of graphs/networks E 1 and E 2 , let P i denote the set of labels for nodes in E 1 and E 2 at the i th iteration of Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism, and P 0 denotes a set of initial labels occurred in E 1 and E 2 . If no initial label on nodes of graphs is available, we use the degree of each node as its label. In each iteration of Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test, the label of each node is simultaneously updated using the labels of its neighboring nodes (i.e., mapping the original label of node and labels of its neighboring nodes into a new label). The Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel is defined as follows:\nwhere\nand\nwhere l represents the max number of iteration of Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test, p i,j \u2208 P i and\ndenote the number of the label p i,j occurred in networks E 1 and E 2 , respectively. It's worth noting that each updated label in graph isomorphism test denotes a subtree pattern, and the number of nodes in each subtree becomes larger with the increment of the number of iterations. Therefore, the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel defined in Eq. 1 can capture both local and global structural information of the network for network similarity computation. Empirical studies have shown that the graph kernel defined in Eq. 1 outperforms conventional graph kernels [39] .

IMAGE PRE-PROCESSING AND NETWORK CONSTRUCTION", "text": "For images from the ADNI dataset, followed the work in [47] , we use the standard pipeline for performing image pre-processing, including discarding the first 10 rs-fMRI volumes, slice timing correction, and head motion correction. The brain space of fMRI scans is partitioned into 90 ROIs using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template [48] with a deformable registration method [49] . The band-pass filtering is performed within a frequency interval of [0.025Hz, 0.100Hz]. The BOLD signals from the gray matter tissue are extracted, and the mean time series of each ROI is calculated to construct FCNs. For the ADHD-200 dataset used in this study, we directly used the time series from the Athena preprocessed data. The details of image pre-processing for this dataset can be found on the Athena website. 3 Briefly, the data pre-processing steps includes: removing the first 4 image volumes, slice timing correction, head motion correction, co-registering the image into template space, extracting the fMRI time series from gray matter regions, temporal band-pass filtering [0.009Hz, 0.08Hz], partitioning the brain space into 90 ROIs using AAL template [48] , and extracting regional mean time series of each ROIs.\nFinally, for subjects in both datasets, we construct the corresponding FCNs using the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient as the measures of functional connectivity between ROIs. And, we use the Fisher's r-to-z transformation on the elements of an FCN for normalizing the correlation coefficients."}, {"section_title": "C. GRAPH-KERNEL BASED STRUCTURED FEATURE SELECTION", "text": "Given a network set E = { E 1 , E 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , E N }, where E i denotes the thresholded network from the i th subject, N is the number of subjects. Motivated by [50] , we first introduce a graph-kernel-based Laplacian regularization term to preserve the local-to-global structural information of FCNs of all training subjects, i.e.,\nwhere w is the weighted coefficients whose each element is associated with a specific feature. S = [S i,j ] \u2208 R N \u00d7N is a similarity matrix that measures the similarity between subjects, and M = C \u2212 S is a Laplacian matrix. Note that C is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements is defined\nTo preserve the structural information of FCNs, we use the graph kernel to measure the similarity between networks i.e.,\nwhere k( E i , E j ) is a graph kernel defined in Eq. 1, which calculates the similarity between networks E i and E j . From Eqs. 2-3, we can see that if two subjects have similar network architectures, they will be encouraged to be as close as possible after mapping. It is easy to see that Eq. 2 can is expected to well preserve the structural information of networks, by embedding the local-to-global structural information in the mapping process.\nBased on the formulation in Eq. 2, the objective function of our proposed graph-kernel based structured feature selection (gk-SFS) model is defined as following:\nwhere M is a Laplacian matrix defined in Eq. 2. Also, \u03b2 and \u03bb are two positive constants that balance the importances of three items. In practice, we usually use inner cross validation on the training data to determine their optimal values. According to definition in Eq. 4, the objective function of our proposed gk-SFS method contains three items. The first item is a quadratic loss function that measures the difference between estimated and true values for training subjects. The second item is a graph-kernel-based Laplacian regularizer that preserves the structural information of network data. Here, we use the graph kernel to compute the similarity of networks, which can also capture the local and global structural information of networks, thus helping to learn more discriminative features. The last item is a sparsity regularizer with l 1 -norm [51] that lead to a sparse solution of model. The features corresponding to non-zero factors in w will be selected for classification.\nIt is worth noting that, when \u03b2 = 0, the proposed gk-SFS method will degenerate to the LASSO method [13] . And, the objective function defined in Eq. 4 can be effectively solved via using accelerated proximal gradient algorithm [52] ."}, {"section_title": "D. GK-SFS BASED DISEASE CLASSIFICATION 1) NETWORK THRESHOLDING", "text": "Since weights of edges correspond to the Pearson correlation coefficient between ROIs, the constructed FCN of each subject is a full-connected weighted network. To characterize the topology of networks, we threshold FCNs of all subjects using a given value T . Specifically, for i-th FCN (i.e., E i ), we threshold it via the following formulation:\nwhere A is the adjacency matrix of FCN E i , and A p,q is the element of matrix A, corresponding to the weight of edge between ROIs p and q. In this way, for any two ROIs p, q, there has an edge between p and q if and only if A p,q = 1.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we first introduce the experimental settings, competing methods, and classification results. Then, we analyze experimental results, including the influence of parameters in the proposed gk-SFS method on classification performance and disease-related brain regions identified by the proposed method."}, {"section_title": "A. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS", "text": "We extensively perform experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed gk-SFS method. Specifically, we perform three tasks: 1) lMCI vs. eMCI, 2) eMCI vs. HC and 3) ADHD vs. HC classifications. A 10-fold cross validation strategy is used in the experiments. Specifically, for each classification task, all subjects are first equivalently partitioned into 10 subsets. In each fold cross validation, one subset is alternatively used as the testing data, and the remaining 9 subsets are combined as the training set. In addition, the process of data partition is independently repeated 10 times to avoid any bias. We evaluate the performance of the proposed gk-SFS method via four evaluation metrics, including 1) accuracy, which is the proportion of subjects that are correctly classified samples in all samples, 2) sensitivity, which denotes the proportion of patients that are correctly classified, 3) specificity, which is the proportion of HCs that are correctly predicted, and 4) the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). We calculate the average performance in all folds of cross validation as final performance. We normalize each feature from the thresholded FCNs using its mean and standard deviation from all training subjects. In addition, we adopt the inner cross validation on training subjects to determine the optimal values of parameters used in the proposed gk-SFS."}, {"section_title": "B. METHODS FOR COMPARISON", "text": "We compare our proposed gk-SFS feature selection method with several state-of-the-art methods, including SVM-based RFE method (called RFE-SVM) proposed in [32] , t-test, LASSO, elasticNet, HSIC-LASSO [33] and inf-FS [30] methods. In all competing methods (i.e., RFE-SVM, t-test, LASSO, elasticNet, HSIC-LASSO and inf-FS), the optimal parameter values are still determined via using inner cross validation on training data. In addition, we also perform the method without feature selection as the baseline for comparison. That is, in the baseline method, all features extracted from the thresholded FCNs are used for classification. For fair comparison, the linear SVM classifier with a default parameter (i.e., C = 1) is used for disease classification in all eight methods. In addition, we calculate the classification results of all eight methods with thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 with step size of 0.05, and present the best classification performance of those eight methods for fair comparison. Table 2 summaries the results of all eight methods in three classification tasks. Figure 2 plots the corresponding ROC curves achieved by these eight methods in three tasks. As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 2 , compared with all competing methods, our proposed gk-SFS method can achieve better classification performance. For example, our proposed method achieves the accuracy of 68.4%, 71.7% and 63.0% for lMCI vs. eMCI, eMCI vs. HC and ADHD vs. HC classifications, respectively, while the best accuracy values achieved by the competing methods are 64.4%, 68.6% and 62.0%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed gk-SFS method obtains the AUC values of 0.74, 0.74 and 0.66 in three classification tasks, respectively. These results indicate that our proposed method can achieve good performance in AD/MCI classification and ADHD classification by selecting the most discriminative features via the proposed gk-SFS method. All these results indicate the efficacy of our proposed method in feature selection. From Table 2 and Fig. 2 , we can also see that methods with feature selection (i.e., RFE-SVM, t-test, LASSO, elasticNet, HSIC-LASSO, inf-FS and gk-SFS) can achieve better performance than the method without performing feature selection (i.e., baseline), indicating the important contribution of feature selection for improving performance in brain disease classification."}, {"section_title": "C. CLASSIFICATION RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "D. EFFECT OF REGULARIZATION PARAMETERS", "text": "Our proposed gk-SFS method contains two regularization items, i.e., Laplacian regularization item and sparsity regularization item. The first item is used to preserve the structural information of all networks during the mapping process, and the second item is used to control the sparsity of solution, and thus determining the number of selected features. The parameters, i.e., \u03b2 and \u03bb, are used to balance the relative contributions of two items. To investigate the effects of these two parameters on performance of the proposed gk-SFS method, we perform three classification tasks with varying the value of \u03b2 in the set of {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}, varying the value of \u03bb in the set of {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24,26,28, 30} . It is worth noting that a smaller \u03bb value means that more features to be selected. For example, when \u03bb = 0, all extracting features will be selected for classification. Also, when \u03b2 = 0, the proposed gk-SFS method degenerates to a LASSO method. It can be seen from Fig. 3 (a) -(c) that our proposed gk-SFS method w.r.t. different combinations of \u03b2 > 0 and \u03bb > 0 consistently outperform the LASSO method (i.e., \u03b2 = 0 and \u03bb > 0), indicating importance of introducing the Laplacian regularization item. Also, Fig. 3 suggests that the classification performance of gk-SFS is largely affected by the \u03bb value in three classification tasks. This implies that it is important to select the optimal \u03bb value in our gk-SFS method. The possible reason is that the parameter \u03bb controls the sparsity of solution in Eq. 4, and hence determines the number of selected features that are essential for the subsequent classification task."}, {"section_title": "E. EFFECT OF THRESHOLD", "text": "In FCN-based studies, thresholding the fully-connected network is an essential step for exploring structural information of FCNs [23] , [55] . Currently, we have no a gold standard to decide the optimal threshold. In practice, we often need to explore over a range of plausible thresholds to determine an appropriate one [6] , [24] . To investigate the effect of thresholds on the performance of our proposed gk-SFS method, we also vary the values of threshold from 0.1 to 0.8 with the step size of 0.05. Figure 4 reports the classification accuracy of our proposed gk-SFS method w.r.t. different thresholds in three classification tasks. For comparison, we also show the accuracy of the competing methods (i.e., baseline, RFE-SVM, t-test, LASSO, elasticNet, HSIC-LASSO and inf-FS) in three classification tasks.\nAs shown in Fig. 4 , the proposed gk-SFS method generally outperforms those competing methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, from Fig. 4 we can observe that our gk-SFS method usually achieves the good performance using the threshold value within the range of [0.2, 0.7] (e.g., the optimal thresholds corresponding to the best performance of the proposed gk-SFS are 0.45, 0.4 and 0.25 for three classification tasks, respectively). This range corresponds to the average connection density (i.e., the proportion of existing connections to all possible connections) of [80%, 30%], which is consistent with the existing study [6] . In addition, we can see from Fig. 4 , the ACC values yielded by eight methods are largely affected by the threshold values in three classification tasks. The underlying reason is that FCNs with threshold values actually contain different topological properties of the networks, thus leading to different feature representations for subsequent classification tasks. Therefore, it's essential to select an optimal threshold value for FCN-based studies."}, {"section_title": "F. IDENTIFIED BRAIN REGIONS", "text": "We now investigate which features (i.e., brain regions) are selected by the proposed gk-SFS method for brain disease diagnosis.

As can be seen from Table 3 some important brain regions include hippocampus, hippocampal gyrus, amygdala, cingulate, temporal pole and heschl gyrus, which have been reported in previous AD/MCI studies [55] - [58] , and some important brain regions, such as occipital gyrus, paracentral lobule, cingulate gyrus and precuneus, are also consistent with those reported in that previous ADHD studies [59] - [61] ."}, {"section_title": "V.
