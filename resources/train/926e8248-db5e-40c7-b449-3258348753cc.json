Endocrine Society committees and members and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.\nConclusion: Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ;17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials.

Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, with continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy. Despite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, further study is needed of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual to manifest one comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Furthermore, continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environments and total daily mobility, as well as methods for sustaining healthy body mass index changes, is of importance.

The Task Force followed the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group, an international group with expertise in the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines (2) . A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere (3) . The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength of a recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase \"we recommend\" and the number 1, and weak recommendations ue the phrase \"we suggest\" and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that \u00c5sss denotes very low quality evidence; \u00c5\u00c5ss, low quality; \u00c5\u00c5\u00c5s, moderate quality; and \u00c5\u00c5\u00c5\u00c5, high quality. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that the Task Force considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which the Task Force offers technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the Task Force and their values and preferences; therefore, one should consider these remarks as suggestions.\nIn this guideline, the Task Force made several statements to emphasize the importance of shared decision making, general preventive care measures, and basic principles of pediatric obesity prevention and treatment. They labeled these as \"Ungraded Good Practice Statement.\" Direct evidence for these statements was either unavailable or not systematically appraised, and thus considered out of the scope of this guideline. The intention of these statements is to draw attention and remind providers of these principles; one should not consider these statements as graded recommendations (4).\nThe Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-ofinterest review process for developing clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest by completing a conflict-ofinterest form. The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee reviews all conflicts of interest before the Society's Council approves the members to participate on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. All others participating in the guideline's development must also disclose any conflicts of interest in the matter under study, and most of these participants must be without any conflicts of interest. The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.\nConflicts of interest are defined as remuneration in any amount from commercial interests; grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interests [e.g., stocks and stock options (excluding diversified mutual funds)]; honoraria and other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; and all other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through the Endocrine Society office.\nThe Endocrine Society provided the funding for this guideline; the Task Force received no funding or remuneration from commercial or other entities."}, {"section_title": "Commissioned Systematic Review", "text": "The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews to support this guideline [Treatments of Pediatric Obesity: An Umbrella Systematic Review (5); The Association of Weight Loss and Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Obese Children: Systematic Review and Meta-Regression (6) ]. The first was an umbrella review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had a duration .6 months and evaluated medication, surgery, lifestyle, or community-based interventions in overweight or obese children or adolescents. The purpose of this review was to estimate the effectiveness of these interventions and to rate the quality of supporting evidence. This review summarized data from 133 RCTs enrolling 30,445 patients and provided an evidence profile for each intervention. The second was a study-level meta-regression that identified changes in BMI associated with cardiometabolic changes (lipid panel, liver function tests, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and fasting blood glucose) in pediatric overweight and obese subjects."}, {"section_title": "The Problem With Obesity", "text": "Pediatric obesity is a persistent, epidemic, international problem, and preventing pediatric obesity and its comorbidities is of paramount importance. Treating children or adolescents is difficult and requires changes in diet, activity, and environment. Intensive lifestyle interventions, contacting both patient and family at least monthly (and weekly if possible) for the first 3 months, and providing dietary and nutritional education, a physical activity prescription, and behavioral therapy are poorly reimbursed, which often impedes these services. Additionally, there is inadequate national and international recognition of the value of addressing global obesity prevention and treatment, and we must work with key policymakers to improve this. Elevated BMI among US children and adolescents 6 to 19 years of age is associated with 1.4 billion dollars of additional health care dollars for outpatient visits and other health care expenditures compared with children and adolescents with normal BMIs (7) . The Brookings Institution predicted that if all 12.7 million US children and adolescents with obesity became obese adults, the individual average cost would be .$92,000, and the societal costs during their lifetimes might be .$1.1 trillion (8). (9) . Extreme obesity is defined as a BMI $120% of the 95th percentile or $35 kg/m 2 (10) . A recent proposal suggests redefining this state as class 2 obesity, as it relates to the definition of class 2 obesity in adults; class 3 pediatric obesity is proposed (but not yet fully accepted) to be BMI $140% of the 95th percentile or $40 kg/m 2 , as this is considered to represent an even higher risk group. Class 2 and class 3 obesity are increasing significantly in girls of all ages, most clearly between 6 and 11 years of age, and in boys between 12 and 19 years of age with a nonsignificant trend in boys ,12 years of age (11) ."}, {"section_title": "Evidence", "text": "The CDC BMI charts (12) are the accepted standards for US children and adolescents $2 years of age and provide a means for determining changes in pediatric obesity prevalence. The US Preventive Services Task Force found that the BMI of children and adolescents correlates reasonably well to percentile rankings of percent body fat measured by more direct methods (13) . However, BMI cannot differentiate muscle from adipose tissue, and thus cannot differentiate between excess adipose tissue and increased lean muscle mass when classifying a child or adolescent as overweight or obese. Pediatric racial/ ethnic differences in the percentage of fat at a specific BMI further complicate BMI measures; for example, non-Hispanic black children and adolescents have a lower percentage body fat than do comparable non-Hispanic whites or Mexican Americans at the same BMI, and they are less likely to have high adiposity (14) . Additionally, Singapore Chinese adolescents have a higher percentage fat at the same BMI than do white comparison groups (15) . Furthermore, in the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey obese male Hispanic adolescents had a higher risk of hepatic steatosis than did girls and other ethnic groups, indicating the limits of BMI alone as a risk factor (16) . A systematic review found differences in regional mass and body composition in adults between race/ethnic groups when BMI and height are held constant and further differences within the same gender and race/ethnic group by age (17) . Therefore, although we do recommend using BMI in clinical practice, it is not an infallible indicator of overweight or obesity. Clinicians should consult endocrinologists when questions arise.\nThe prevalence of pediatric overweight and obesity in all racial and ethnic groups increased between the 1960s and 1970s until about 2000 when it leveled off in most groups ( Table 1) . As of 2014, the prevalence of obesity in subjects 2 to 19 years old is 17%. The reason 17% of the population is above the 95th percentile for age is that the CDC only uses weight data prior to 1980 (using NHANES II data) for ages .6 years (before the obesity epidemic developed) and uses height data up to the end of 1994 (the end of NHANES III data collection) for the stature charts. Some recent data suggest a decrease in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children ,5 years of age, but the durability of this potential decline remains unknown. This trend may be explained by the oversampling of Asian preschoolers in that particular dataset; these children had a lower overall BMI.\nDifferent racial and ethnic populations demonstrate differences in the prevalence of obesity and overweight and in the trajectory of change during the last decades (Table 1) . Thus, using these BMI definitions may underestimate risk to the health of pediatric Asian patients. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis including 53,521 patients between a mean age of 4 to 18 years demonstrated that using these BMI cutoffs led to a specificity of 0.93 but a sensitivity of only 0.73 when compared with reference standard methods for measuring body adiposity, such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, hydrostatic weighing, air-displacement plethysmography, isotope dilution, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and skin-fold thickness measurements. This suggests that most children and adolescents diagnosed as obese by BMI do indeed have excess fat, but that a normal BMI is compatible with excess body fat in ;25% of subjects (22) . Clinical judgment must augment the definitions of obesity based on BMI alone to determine which children or adolescents are actually overfat.\nThe odds ratio of adult obesity increases for obese adolescents as they approach 18 years of age. The odds ratio of adult obesity rises progressively with the number of parents who are obese, but the greatest predictive effect of parent obesity is found in infancy regardless of the infant's weight (23) . Determining overweight or obesity in young children may also help identify which individuals are most likely to become overweight or obese in adulthood. There is an increase in BMI in the first year followed by a fall and then a second rise in BMI at about 6 years of age (termed the adiposity rebound); an early BMI rebound before 5 years of age carries a higher risk for adult obesity. Recent analysis suggests that BMI (or possibly just height) at 7 years of age may provide equally robust predictive ability (24) . Longitudinal data from 7738 participants from the National Center for Educational Statistics, Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 demonstrated the greatest incidence (new onset) of obesity and overweight between the first to third grades; furthermore, there was a fourfold higher risk for obesity at age 14 years in the subjects overweight in kindergarten. These data support a focus on prevention before 9 years of age (25) . However, a longitudinal study of 4884 subjects from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the Population Study of Income Dynamics, and the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Surveys demonstrated that screening for obesity at 5 years of age would miss 50% of those who became obese by 18 years of age, whereas screening at 15 years of age would miss only 9%; the authors recommend using universal prevention methods instituted at a young age and continuing through childhood and adolescence, rather than focusing only on overweight young children (26) . These contrasting study conclusions demonstrate a continued need for research into childhood prediction of obesity.\nEndocrine and syndromic disorders as a cause of overweight/obesity are rare in children and adolescents and are associated with additional symptoms (26) . The distinguishing feature of endocrine causes of obesity, such as growth hormone (GH) deficiency, hypothyroidism, or Cushing syndrome, is that stature and height velocity are decreased, whereas a normal or increased growth rate generally excludes endocrine causes. However, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy/pseudohypoparathyroidism, although associated with short stature in adolescence, may be associated with increased growth velocity in the first 2 to 3 years of life. Pediatric overweight/obesity is also associated with earlier breast development, pubarche, and menarche in girls, and advanced skeletal development in boys that will lead to increased growth rate (27) (28) (29) (30) . The evidence is stronger in girls than boys because a subgroup of boys with obesity exhibit delayed testicular development (31) . Thus, clinicians should not test for endocrine causes of obesity unless the patient is short relative to genetic potential and has decreased growth velocity against the backdrop of continued weight gain (26, 32) .\nThis rule is not inviolable, however, as acquired hypothalamic obesity is a syndrome of intractable weight gain caused by hypothalamic damage from a tumor or its treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (33) . Such patients may have adequate growth velocity even when GH deficient but have tumor-related signs and symptoms or have already undergone tumor treatment.\nPediatric overweight and obesity is associated with substantial comorbidities, including prediabetes/type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); dyslipidemia; prehypertension/ hypertension; sleep apnea; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); proteinuria and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; early subclinical atherosclerosis; hyperandrogenemia/polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); slipped capital femoral epiphysis and pseudotumor cerebri (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) ; and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity, and premature mortality in adulthood (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) . The greater the severity of obesity, the higher the risks of cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly among boys (11) . Importantly, the risks of CVD outcomes among children and adolescents who were obese and became nonobese by adulthood appear similar to those who were never obese (46) . Thus, clinicians should carefully examine medical and family histories and laboratory assessments of children and adolescents who are overweight or obese to identify comorbidities early and initiate appropriate management.\nIn addition to the obvious environmental drivers, multiple common and rare genetic variants contribute to substantial heritability for BMI and waist circumference (83, 84) . Approximately 7% of patients with extreme pediatric obesity may have rare chromosomal abnormalities and/or highly penetrant genetic mutations that drive their obesity (85) . This percentage is likely to increase with newer methods for genetic testing.\nDrinking sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with developing obesity (157, 158) . Table sugar consists of 50% glucose and 50% fructose; sugar-sweetened beverages often have a higher percentage of fructose, sometimes up to 65%; and high-fructose corn syrup is found in many foods besides liquid beverages. Metabolic responses differ significantly between fructose and glucose.\nConsuming nutrient-poor, calorie-dense, high-fat foods and sugar-sweetened beverages is a risk factor for obesity (156) . Reducing sugared-beverage consumption (e.g., soda, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and excessive consumption of fruit juices) is an effective way to reduce ingested calories (159) . However, children and adolescents currently consume, on average, 30% to 40% of calories from nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods and drinks (160) . Although sugar-sweetened beverage intake is decreasing in younger children, it has actually increased since 2007 in adolescents (161) . Fruit juice provides a more concentrated dose of carbohydrates than does whole fruit and may not lead to the feeling of satiety experienced after ingesting whole fruits. Thus, healthy children should limit fruit juice ingestion and children with dental caries or excessive weight should ingest less than the maximal recommended volumes. Therefore, fruit juice has no role in the diet of infants under 6 months of age. After 6 months of age, fruit juice must be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day until children reach 6 years of age, after which 8 to 12 ounces is an acceptable serving, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics policy. In view of the fact that it is easy for children to exceed such limits, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort of .4000 children demonstrated that daily ingestion of fruit juice at 2 years of age resulted in an increase in BMI at 4 years compared with children who had no or infrequent fruit juice. The study also demonstrated that whole fruit provides increased nutritional benefit over juice. This committee encourages the consumption of whole fruits rather than fruit juices (162, 163) .\nSince 1965, teens have doubled their consumption of sugar-sweetened and fruit-flavored beverages (156, 164) . School-based interventions can reduce soda consumption and reduce weight in students at the highest BMI percentiles (152, 165) . Although there has reportedly been a 95% decrease in the amount of regular sodas shipped to schools, other sweetened beverages (such as sports drinks) have become more available in schools (166) .\nHowever, as of 2014-2015, federal guidelines now restrict the use of such \"competitive foods\" in the school environment. Obese or normal weight children and adolescents who substituted noncaloric beverages in lieu of sugar-sweetened beverages had less of an increase in BMI at 1 year (115, 116) . Because there was no difference in satiety between those who drank sugarsweetened beverages and those who did not, it appears that a child or adolescent will not compensate for the decreased caloric intake of nonsweetened drinks by increasing his or her caloric intake via other foods or drinks. This lack of compensation may partly explain the reduced weight gain associated with nonsweetened drinks (115, 167) .\nAlthough there are reports that reducing glycemic load may have a beneficial effect in the prevention or treatment of obesity, a systematic review of epidemiologic, prospective, and intervention studies did not demonstrate consistent results (168) .\nWater is frequently recommended as a beneficial replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages. Whereas a systematic review found only a weak association between water consumption and weight control in longitudinal studies, the introduction of water jets to New York City elementary school students led to a 0.022 to 0.025 decrease in BMI and a 0.6% to 0.9% decrease in risk for overweight; this is possibly related to a 12.3% decrease in milk purchases (169) . Water remains the most reasonable \"drinking\" choice for quenching thirst and changing behavior from high-sugar drinking habits (170) .\nDisordered sleep length and quality in adults, children, and adolescents affects appetite and decreases insulin sensitivity (150) . Table 4 lists 8 studies that show how different sleep durations or changes in sleep duration affect dietary intake in children and adolescents. These results suggest that sleep duration affects obesity development, although 2 other studies challenge these findings, weakening the strength of the evidence (130, 131) .\nA meta-analysis commissioned by the original Task Force demonstrated a nonsignificant trend associating family involvement with the prevention of obesity, especially if the child is ,8 years of age (140, 181) .\nOne recent meta-analysis suggested that family-based therapy is effective for treating obesity (137) , and another highlighted the importance of the intensity of parental involvement in the success of family interventions to prevent and treat obesity (138) . Furthermore, studies of weight loss in obese children and adolescents demonstrated the importance of including family members in the process; without parental inclusion, the effect on weight loss was not significant (182) . However, there is a need for more research into the influence of family participation for the prevention or treatment of pediatric obesity (139, 140, 183) . In spite of a general consensus that an authoritative parenting style is optimal and restrictive parenting in terms of food choice is not, there are insufficient data to determine what type of parenting approach is most effective in preventing pediatric obesity (184) .\nThere is evidence for an association between the development of pediatric obesity and family dysfunction as well as exposure to stress (Table 4 ).\nThe 2015 Endocrine Society Task Force commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the impact of weight change on metabolic outcomes in children and adolescents who are obese (5) . The results showed that change in BMI was associated with improvements in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and systolic blood pressure. This analysis is limited by the fact that it used aggregate data. Other studies also showed associations between weight change and other metabolic outcomes ( Fig. 2) (195, 196) .\nSuccessful weight management, through lifestyle interventions, delays the onset of T2DM in adults (197) and improves cardiovascular fitness (198, 199) . Many pediatric weight management programs have found improved body composition and metabolic parameters (13, 200) .\nA commonly held belief is that lifestyle modification is not sufficiently efficacious. Children and adolescents may not lose weight, or despite initial success, children and adolescents might regain weight after the active phase of the program has ended (201) . A factor in weight regain may be lack of continued exercise. The odds for weight regain are twofold greater in those who are sedentary (201) . In a 10-year study of adults who participated in the National Weight Control Registry, .87% of participants maintained at least 10% weight loss for 5 to 10 years. A worse outcome was associated with decreased physical activity, decreased dietary restraint, decreased frequency self-weighing, increased energy intake as fat, and increased disinhibition (202) .\nThere is sufficient evidence that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be effective tools for pediatric weight control in the short term (203, 204) . Furthermore, implementing a formal maintenance program after the completed treatment phase can be important for maintaining achieved weight loss (205) . This finding is consistent with the concept of obesity as a chronic disease (206) .\nA Task Force-commissioned meta-analysis of randomized pediatric trials of combined lifestyle interventions for treating obesity (diet and exercise) showed a modest but significant effect on obesity (equivalent to a decrease in BMI of 1.5 kg/m 2 ; P , 0.00001) when interventions targeted family involvement. When parents were not specifically included, the effect on weight loss was not significant (182) . These results suggest involving the family when delivering combined lifestyle interventions.\nAn additional meta-analysis of RCTs of lifestyle interventions (without an analysis of family involvement) found moderate positive effects from the interventions when compared with no treatment or information-only controls. These effects persisted for an average follow-up period of 15 months (207) . Although there was overlap with the Task Force meta-analysis, each study contained reports not covered by the other.\nAn evidence-based position statement of the American Dietetic Association supports the utility of family-based lifestyle interventions for children and similar multicomponent programs for adolescents (208) . These recommendations are consistent with conclusions of a combined CDC and American Medical Association expert committee (209) and an evidence-based review of pharmacological interventions for pediatric obesity that highlighted the importance of concomitant intensive lifestyle interventions, including dietary, exercise, and family counseling (210) .\nIn the absence of caloric restriction, moderate exercise does not cause weight loss. However, in combination with decreased caloric intake, exercise can achieve and maintain significant weight loss. Studies performed in the school setting have shown beneficial effects of exercise in children and adolescents (204) . The beneficial effects of both aerobic exercise and resistance training can be short-lived, and exercise must be sustained over months. Even 20 minutes of aerobic activity 5 days per week over 13 weeks can decrease body and visceral fat (124) . Recent studies in Denmark and elsewhere have demonstrated benefits in mild intensity jogging and in small 10-to 15-minute intervals of exercise, which may be more readily achievable (219, 220) .\nPhysical fitness, even without weight loss, may confer health benefits. Improvements in cardiovascular fitness were associated with improvements in body composition and diabetes risk factors in adolescents (220) . In addition to improving metabolic fitness, exercise has been linked to improvements in cognitive function and concentration (124) . (Refer to section 4.8 regarding school-based interventions to increase activity.)\nThe 2009 Cochrane analysis reported that a combined behavioral approach incorporating both dietary and physical activity changes can produce a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in overweight in children and adolescents (204) . A meta-analysis commissioned by the original Task Force of 3 randomized trials of interventions for reducing sedentary activity reported imprecise results (i.e., that these interventions had both a favorable and unfavorable impact on obesity outcomes) (182) . Both girls and boys demonstrated small decreases in the amount of screen time in a German study, and these decreases did not correlate with increases in physical activity (227) .\nIn section 4 we discuss the importance of involving the whole family, and not just the child or adolescent, in prevention and treatment interventions.\nHow interactions between parents and children and adolescents and parenting styles contribute to unhealthy lifestyle habits is a subject of investigation (230, 231 ). An additional factor to overcome before initiating any intervention may be the parents' inability to recognize that their child or adolescent is overweight, particularly for the preschool child (232) (233) (234) .\nObesity is associated with QOL, with levels measured in obese children and adolescents equivalent to those seen in pediatric cancer or diabetes (235, 236) . In addition to low QOL, children and adolescents with obesity have significant psychosocial comorbidities, including poor self-esteem (237) (238) (239) , increased risk of depression and anxiety (240) (241) (242) , and higher-than-average risk of eating disorders and substance abuse. Low self-esteem (243) and perceived or actual higher BMIs are associated with increased likelihood of smoking and alcohol consumption (244) .\nTo remove the bias that might be seen in a clinic sample, the Childhood Growth and Development Study in Australia enrolled healthy weight (n = 158), overweight (n = 77), and obese (n = 27) children from the schools and from families asking to be referred (n = 19). Heights, weights, and psychological testing were done in the schools for the school-based cohort (245) . Increasing BMI z scores were associated with decreasing selfworth and global self-esteem as well as with decreased athletic competency, social acceptance, and dissatisfaction with their physical appearance. These associations were reported as young as age 8 years, but the association with physical appearance was more pronounced in the older group (246) . The presence of psychosocial distress in a population of school children and adolescents not seeking clinic referral, as well as those seeking referral, indicates that psychosocial issues are present in both clinical and nonclinical populations of youths who are obese.\nA review of the literature found lower QOL scores for social acceptance, family life, physical appearance, school functioning, and physical functioning in all but 2 of the 34 publications included in the study. Factors influencing lower QOL included degree of obesity, symptoms of doi: 10.1210/jc.2016-2573 press.endocrine.org/journal/jcem depression, lack of social support from classmates/family, and low socioeconomic status (247) . In general, low self-esteem does not seem to be a significant problem until adolescence, as self-esteem is similar between preteen children who are obese and normal weight. During adolescence, however, self-esteem becomes more closely tied to body image, and rapidly plummets, with those adolescent females who have higher BMIs and body image dissatisfaction having the lowest selfesteem (248) .\nIndividuals with eating disorders tend to define selfworth by their body image (249) , possibly explaining the association between eating disorders and youths who are overweight and obese. Surveys from 135 Hispanic and African American girls who are obese or overweight revealed that 52% had been teased about their weight by girls and 60% had been teased about their weight by boys. Of those who were teased, 70% skipped meals, dieted, or starved themselves; 12% reported binge eating; and 33% stated they had \"emotional\" eating. All of the girls surveyed stated they were unhappy about their weight and wanted to be thinner (250) . Eating disorders, including binge eating and anorexia nervosa/bulimia, are more commonly seen in those who have depression, anxiety, and disruptive behavior (251, 252) . Parental reaction to their child's weight affects how the child responds. Bullying by peers and families contributes to poor body image and impaired psychosocial functioning (253) . Some may harass their child, letting them know how unattractive he/she is, resulting in worsening body image and poor self-esteem. A retrospective Internet-based study of college students with great concern about their weight, body shape, and eating behaviors revealed that .80% had a history of parents or siblings making negative comments about their weight, shape, or eating behaviors. Most scored above average in psychometric emotional-abuse tests, with positive associations with negative parental comments and higher weight and negative associations with social support and self-esteem (254) . Some parents are overly restrictive, potentially causing their children and adolescents to binge when they have access to unrestricted food (255, 256) . Alternatively, adolescents with extreme obesity may develop anorexia bulimia, anorexia nervosa, or purging behaviors in an effort to lose weight. A cross-sectional cohort study of adolescents with extreme obesity and their parents found bulimic symptoms did not correlate with the degree of obesity but were associated with maternal psychopathology, including somatization and anxiety (257) .\nYouths who are obese are more likely to be teased and bullied and are less likely to have a \"best friend\" or be considered popular by classmates than their thinner peers (258) . Parents, teachers, and peers indicate that youths who are obese are more isolated and have poorer social skills than do their thinner counterparts (259) . Those with low self-esteem (243) and perceived or actual higher BMIs are more likely to smoke and drink alcohol than those with higher self-esteem (244) . Additionally, they are less athletic and less likely to have romantic relationships, contributing to increased teasing, worsening of selfesteem, loneliness, depression, anxiety, and introverted behavior (260) .\nIn general, those who are most obese report more psychological distress (246, 261) . Girls become more depressed with increasing BMI than do boys, and some studies indicate that depression in African American boys is not linked to BMI but rather to peer teasing (246, 262) . Race and socioeconomic status (in addition to sex) affect how children and adolescents react to obesity; however, there are conflicting reports on the effect of obesity on psychological status in different groups. One study found that African American children have more body image dissatisfaction and anxiety than do their sameweight white counterparts (262) , whereas a study of adolescents found that African Americans and Hispanics are less stigmatized than whites (263) . High socioeconomic status adolescents who are obese with psychopathology are less likely to seek help at a weightloss program than are low socioeconomic status adolescents who are obese (252) , possibly due to a more negative perception regarding obesity in high socioeconomic status families.\nAs adolescents who are obese consistently report high rates of depression, anxiety, and binge eating disorders, all overweight patients should be assessed for psychopathology. Assessment and counseling by a psychologist are often indicated. Clinicians should prescribe antidepressant medications with caution, as atypical antipsychotics cause rapid (often extreme) weight gain (264) .\nDiuretics, diet pills, and self-induced emesis are not uncommonly used to achieve rapid weight loss by adolescents. One study demonstrated that laxative use, selfinduced vomiting, and diet pill ingestion were more common in adolescents who are obese compared with those who are normal weight and overweight (265) . Six percent of 6957 middle school children and adolescents in North Carolina used diet pills and 7.1% used laxatives or self-induced vomiting. The case prevalence of diet pills was 3.4 in normal weight, 4.1 in overweight, and 9.5 in adolescents who are obese; the case prevalence of laxatives was 1.3, 0.7, and 3.2, respectively; and the case prevalence of self-induced vomiting was 3.4 in normal weight vs 7.6 in adolescents who are obese. Females more commonly abused substances for weight loss, such as tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana; they were also more likely to participate in risky sexual behaviors (265) . Clinicians should discuss these maladaptive behaviors at clinic visits, as they are potentially harmful. It is important to emphasize moderation rather than restriction and to counsel against risky weight loss strategies\nThe FDA recently approved a number of weight-loss medications for adults (216, 267, 268) and considers these medications to be appropriate for those $16 years of age who have BMI $ 30 kg/m 2 or who have BMI $ 27 kg/m 2 and at least 1 weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension or T2DM). However, although the utility of pharmacotherapy in pediatric obesity has been recently reviewed (269) (270) (271) , there are no published data directly comparing adult and adolescent outcomes for obesity pharmacotherapy.\nPhysicians should be discouraged from prescribing weight loss medications off-label to those ,16 years old because of: 1) the lack of FDA approval for use; 2) the limited number of well-controlled safety and efficacy studies in obese children and adolescents, 3) the limited efficacy demonstrated in adults for most agents, and 4) the need to weigh the relative risk of drug-induced adverse events in children and adolescents against a medication's long-term theoretical potential for reducing obesity-related morbidity and mortality.\nDespite these concerns, the negative health impact of pediatric obesity may justify long-term medication. However, pharmacotherapy should only be prescribed in combination with comprehensive lifestyle modification programs (210, (271) (272) (273) (274) that have substantial efficacy (270) . The limited available evidence suggests the best pediatric pharmacotherapy outcomes are among patients adherent to lifestyle program recommendations (275) .\nAmong pharmacotherapeutic agents approved for adult obesity (Table 5) , only orlistat is FDA approved for obesity treatment of ages 12 to 16 years. Orlistat (299) (300) (301) (302) (303) (304) (305) inhibits gastrointestinal lipases, reducing adolescent's fat absorption by ;30% (299) . Orlistat reduces BMI significantly in adolescents by ;0.7 to 1.7 kg/m 2 (150, 318) , but treatment is associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects ( Table 5 ). Orlistat must be taken with each meal, thus reducing its utility in schoolattending adolescents. Orlistat appears to affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins E and D (299) . Available data suggest that ;50% of pediatric patients that are prescribed orlistat discontinued it within 1 month, 75% stop using it by 3 months, and only 10% remain on orlistat after 6 months (319, 320). Given its limited doi: 10.1210/jc.2016-2573 press.endocrine.org/journal/jcem There was a dose response decrease in insulin resistance measured by the area under the curve of an oral glucose tolerance test, decreased total body fat and visceral fat, and a similar improvement in fitness measured by peak VO2; the conclusion is that there is benefit for a child who is obese if the child will actually engage in at least 20 min of aerobic exercise 5 d/wk, (and we expect this may extend to the prevention of obesity) \nClinicians prescribe bariatric procedures for weight loss in adolescents because of the poor success of nonsurgical treatment in achieving and maintaining weight loss in adolescents with extreme obesity.\nIndications for weight loss surgery include BMI of .35 kg/m 2 with major comorbidities of obesity (T2DM, moderate to extreme sleep apnea, pseudotumor cerebri, debilitating orthopedic problems, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis). Patients are also candidates for bariatric surgery if they have a BMI of .40 kg/m 2 with mild comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, moderate orthopedic problems, mild sleep apnea, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and extreme psychological distress that is secondary to their obesity) (363) .\nBecause of the beneficial effects on QOL, social relationships, and depression in studies of adolescents (364) (365) (366) (367) , some as long as 2 to 3 years in duration (368, 369) , proponents of bariatric surgery suggest that extreme psychological distress is an indication for doi: 10.1210/jc.2016-2573 press.endocrine.org/journal/jcem (363, 370) . A psychologist must assess the bariatric surgery candidate to determine the severity of psychological impairment as well as ability to comply with the requirements for successful outcome. It is essential that all potential candidates have a stable home environment with good family support and the ability to carry out the necessary postoperative behaviors-adherence to dietary guidelines (including macronutrient administration) and physical activity recommendations. Adolescents who are unable to give assent; who have untreated or unstable psychiatric issues other than depression; who are substance abusers; or who are pregnant, planning pregnancy, or breastfeeding are not good candidates for bariatric surgery (370) . All candidates for bariatric surgery should agree to psychological evaluation before surgery and in the perioperative period (371) .\nSurgery can be malabsorptive, restrictive, or combination procedures. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (83) is a purely restrictive procedure that isolates the upper stomach by placing an adjustable silicone ring around the entrance to the stomach [ Fig. 3(A) ] (223) . The LAGB procedure has high reoperation and long-term complication rates, which increase with time and thus it is rarely used anymore (373) (374) (375) .\nMalabsorptive procedures decrease intestinal mucosal function by rearranging the anatomy of the intestine, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients. RYGB is a combination procedure in which the surgeon creates a small stomach pouch and the remainder of the stomach is bypassed. The surgeon inserts a segment of the jejunum in the small gastric pouch, which connects to the proximal portion of the jejunum that drains the bypassed portion of the stomach and the duodenum [ Fig. 3(C) ]. The RYGB has the restrictive properties of a partial gastrectomy while causing malabsorption and \"dumping syndrome\" by bypassing much of the stomach.\nIn vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a surgeon resects ;85% of the stomach, removing the fundus and greater curvature, leaving a narrow gastric remnant [ Fig. 3(F) ]. There is no rearrangement of the anatomy, making it less likely that patients having VSG will have malabsorption of micronutrients or postoperative bowel obstruction, as compared with RYGB (370) . Because VSG has less surgical complications than the RYGB, patients use it with increasing frequency (373, 376) . The Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study (a prospective, multisite observational study at 5 academic centers) performed 52 RYGB and 1 VSG in 2008 vs 24 RYGB and 29 VSG in 2011 (377) .\nIn addition to the anatomic effects of the procedures, both RYGB and VSG decrease the orexigenic hormone ghrelin (87, 378, 379) and increase the anorexogenic incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY (380, 381) , thus decreasing appetite and improving insulin sensitivity (382). \nNote: All agents are contraindicated in pregnancy. See full prescribing information for all adverse effects, cautions, and contraindications. Pharmacotherapy is not usually considered if the BMI is below the 95th percentile, but there are additional factors to consider. If we initiate pharmacotherapy early in the course of obesity, we may prevent extreme weight gain and metabolic complications, but we may treat an excess of children and adolescents, raise the rate of unwarranted side effects, and increase the costs to individuals and to society. Alternatively, if we begin medication late in the course of obesity, we run the risk of runaway weight gain and long-term morbidity. One approach that reconciles these difficulties is to act aggressively with lifestyle intervention in overweight and mildly obese patients to prevent extreme obesity and to consider pharmacotherapy when the risk of complications is high or soon after complications emerge. The tipping point for pharmacotherapy could be if the family history is strongly positive for a major comorbidity. Lifestyle intervention should precede pharmacotherapy and should be maintained during pharmacotherapy. Derived from August et al.

The largest pediatric study to date found a similar BMI reduction with VSG (37%) (384) as with RYGB (35% to 37%) (385) at 1 year following surgery. This is consistent with the results of the Adolescent Morbid Obesity Study (376) , a Swedish study of 81 adolescents with a mean BMI decrease from 45.5 to 29.7 kg/m 2 2 years following RYGB (367) . Three-year data from the Teen-LABS study found that the mean BMI decreased overall from 53 to 38 kg/m 2 (a decrease of 27%) with a 28% BMI decrease in those receiving RYGB (n = 161) and a 26% decrease in the teens who had VSG (n = 67) (369).\nRegardless of procedure, the percentage of weight loss is independent of initial BMI, so those who are extremely obese will still be obese following surgery (385) . Even when obesity persists, most comorbidities associated with obesity improve markedly following the surgery. A study of 22 adolescents who were extremely obese showed positive effects of RYGB on glucose homeostasis parameters with 38% decline in BMI (61 to 39 kg/m 2 ) 1 year after surgery (386) . Positive effects of bariatric surgery have included the reversal of T2DM (387), improvements in glucose homeostasis in nondiabetics (379) , improved insulin sensitivity and secretion (388) , resolution of sleep apnea (389) , improvements in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (381) , improvements in severe arthropathy (371) , and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors [dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation (390) and increased adiponeptin and decreased IL-1, IL-8, CRP, and TNF-a (391)], as well as decreased left ventricular mass index, improvements in left ventricular hypertrophy, improvements in diastolic function, and improved ratepressure product, all of which suggest decreased cardiac workload (392) .\nThe Teen-LABS study indicated that 39% of enrolled patients had more than 4 major comorbid conditions at baseline (376) . Three-year follow-up of the patients enrolled in Teen-LABS found a 95% remission of T2DM (19 of 20 teens who had diabetes at the time of surgery), 76% remission of prediabetes (13 of 17 patients), 74% remission of hypertension (56 of 76 with initial high blood pressure), and a 66% normalization of dyslipidemia (84 of 128 patients) (369) .\nThe Teen-LABS study assessed comorbid conditions and surgical complications in the perioperative period in 242 adolescents during the first month following surgery (377). There were no procedure-related deaths. Sixty-six percent had laparoscopic RYGB, 28% had VSG, and 6% had LAGB. Major complications occurring within the 30 days following surgery (gastrointestinal leaks, suicidal ideation, anticoagulation for pulmonary embolus) occurred in 7 patients (0.4%), and minor complications occurred in 27 patients (11.2%; 2.5% of patients undergoing RYGB, 3.0% VSG, and 7.1% AGB) (377) . The most common complications with both RYGB and VSG were abdominal pain/diarrhea/nausea/dehydration followed by stricture with RYGB and wound infection with VSG (373) . Nineteen of 242 patients had major complications within 30 days of surgery (9.3% with RYGB, 4.5% following VSG, and 7.1% with AGB). Late complications occurred in 10% to 15% of patients and included hernias at incision sites, cholelithiasis, small bowel obstruction, stomal stenosis, protein calorie malnutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and weight regain (376, 377, 393, 394) . The Adolescent Morbid Obesity Surgery Study in Sweden had a 33% adverse event rate, with 15% (n = 12) requiring reoperation, 5 for internal hernias, 5 for cholecystectomy, 1 for adhesions, and 1 for pain without surgical findings (364) . Seven percent had psychological sequelae, 2 with suicide attempts from medication overdose, 1 with self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation, and 3 with depression and anxiety. All had psychological problems before surgery. Five patients had excessive use of addictive drugs (none of these patients disclosed the fact that they had preexisting addictions at the time of presurgery assessment) (367) . Although most patients have improvement in QOL, selfesteem, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (365), these improvements were not universally maintained at 2 years following surgery (368) . Suicidal ideation has been reported, possibly related to unrealistic expectations that their life would be completely different following surgery or to continued poor self-image with weight regain (367) . The most recent Teen-LABS study, evaluating 242 adolescents at 3 years after RYGB or VSG, found the mean QOL improved from 63 to 83 based on the total score from the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids survey (369) .\nAs these procedures all have potential adverse events, it is important to have life-long monitoring for complications. Adherence to prescribed nutritional guidelines is essential for all weight-loss surgery patients postoperatively because low levels of minerals and vitamins can occur due to restricted nutrient intake, decreased gastric acid production, decreased production of intrinsic factor and digestive enzymes, or food intolerance (especially following the dumping syndrome with RYGB) (121, 395) . Iron deficiency is the most common mineral deficiency, as RYGB not only causes malabsorption but also has low gastric acid production, further impairing iron absorption (121, 370) . Decreased bone mineralization is common, as RYGB decreases cholecalciferol absorption by 25% and calcium and phosphorous concentrations may be low, resulting in significant bone density loss (396) . Vitamin deficiencies are common, including deficiencies of vitamins B12, B1, and folate, as RYGB and VSG both reduce the surface of the distal portion of the stomach, resulting in inadequate secretion of intrinsic factor. Annual screening is recommended for patients at risk for developing vitamin deficiencies. As RYGB can result in copper, selenium, and zinc deficiencies, it is recommended that all patients having bariatric surgery receive supplementation with a multivitamin with minerals (370) . Patients need to be monitored long term for changes in bone density, hair loss secondary to zinc deficiency, and neurologic complications (363) . It is recommended that they avoid alcohol and decrease the intake of sugar and fructose-containing drinks. Despite the importance of nutritional supplementation following bariatric surgery, the Adolescent Morbid Obesity Surgery study found a 67% noncompliance rate with prescribed vitamin and mineral intake at 2 years following surgery. Low ferritin levels were found in 12% of patients before surgery and in 39% of patients 2 years after surgery. Similarly, Vitamin B12 deficiency increased from 1.3% before surgery to 13% after surgery (367) . The 3-year follow-up data from the Teen-LABS study found similar results. Low folate levels were found in 3% of youths at baseline and in 8% at 3 years, low vitamin B12 concentrations increased from ,1% to 8%, low 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels increased from 37% to 43%, and the percentage of adolescents with low ferritin levels increased from 5% at baseline to 57% at 3 years (369) .\nThese data emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary team that should include a bariatric surgeon, a pediatric obesity specialist to screen and manage the comorbidities, a dietitian to plan the diet and assure adequate nutritional intake, a mental health professional to perform the initial psychological assessment and provide counseling during the postoperative adjustment, a program coordinator to facilitate compliance and follow-up, and a social worker to provide resources to help overcome barriers to care and run support groups (373) . Long-term follow-up is essential to maintain compliance with nutritional recommendations.\nWe agree with the expert panels (226, 227) that suggest bariatric surgery for adolescents with obesity-related comorbid conditions that threaten the adolescent's health-a BMI of .35 kg/m 2 and an extreme comorbidity or a BMI of .40 kg/m 2 and less extreme comorbidity."}, {"section_title": "Values and preferences", "text": "The Task Force placed a high value on the ease of calculating BMI and familiarity with this measure among providers and patients over other limitations of using BMI. BMI currently is the most reasonable measure for evaluating overweight and obesity, guiding proper management, and determining the need for specialist referral (when values rise toward the extreme). The utility of predicting adult obesity and comorbidities from childhood and adolescent BMI calculations may be somewhat limited, supporting a universal prevention approach to obesity that begins in early childhood.\nThe Task Force placed a high value on limiting endocrine assessments for the etiology of pediatric overweight or obesity to those rare patients who are obese and short or with decreased height velocity and placed a low value on the unnecessary diagnostic endocrine laboratory screening of children and adolescents who are obese without other signs or symptoms or contributory neurosurgical history.\nThe Task Force placed a high value on identifying adiposity-related complications and screening for comorbidities because of their high prevalence and their association with morbidity and mortality. The Task Force also placed a high value on reducing unnecessary testing and evaluation, such as the routine measurements of fasting insulin, because of lack of scientific evidence for its usefulness in clinical practice by general providers.\nWhen assessing children and adolescents with extreme obesity, clinicians should consider potentially treatable causes and genetic conditions (Fig. 1) . The diagnosis of a genetic obesity syndrome can provide information that helps the family and health care providers appropriately manage the child's or adolescent's health and possibly lessen the social stigma. Additionally, clinicians can provide genetic counseling. A genetic diagnosis can inform management, including the possibility of bariatric surgery (many such patients are relatively resistant to weight loss through changes in diet and exercise).\nIn making this recommendation, the Task Force placed a high value on promoting healthy, safe pediatric lifestyle modification that included family involvement, with potential wide-reaching benefits.\nThe committee placed a high value on decreasing snacking and decreasing overall caloric intake to reduce weight gain among children and adolescents.\nThe committee placed a high value on limiting digital access time and other efforts to decrease sedentary time. As our ever-increasing digital environment necessitates increased screen time, a plan for the world's children and adolescents should complement necessary screen time with: \u00b7 environments that demand and facilitate movement \u00b7 monetary incentives for decreased caloric intake (such as taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages).\nThe committee agrees with research that finds an association with the presence of a television set in a child's bedroom to increased screen time and increase caloric intake while weakening the positive influence of parents on promotion of healthy habits (228, 229) .\nWe placed a higher value on avoiding drug side effects and on achieving healthy weight through the incorporation of healthy behaviors. The suggestion to minimize the use of pharmacotherapy in children and adolescents reflects the limited efficacy and small number of long-term pediatric trials for existing agents, along with the imperative to manage pediatric obesity as a serious chronic condition in which long-term success overrides short-term gains.\nThe Task Force suggestion of bariatric surgery in adolescents who are extremely obese with serious comorbidities places a high value on amelioration of lifethreatening complications and lower value on surgical cost and perioperative complications."}, {"section_title": "We recommend against routine laboratory eval-", "text": "uations for endocrine etiologies of pediatric obesity unless the patient's stature and/or height velocity are attenuated (assessed in relationship to genetic/familial potential and pubertal stage).\n(1 j \u00c5\u00c5\u00c5s)"}, {"section_title": "Remarks", "text": "Clinicians can determine a deceleration in height velocity (as needed to account for the stage of puberty) either by using a height velocity (34) curve normalized for age and/or stage of puberty or by observing that the patient is crossing height percentile curves downward on the standardized height attainment charts (12) for average-maturing, earlymaturing, and late-maturing children (35) . Clinicians should refer maturing children who are obese with short stature and decreased growth velocity despite continued weight gain to a pediatric endocrinologist, as these patients may have an endocrinopathy.\n1. 6 We recommend that children or adolescents with a BMI $85th percentile be evaluated for potential comorbidities (see Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). (1 j \u00c5\u00c5\u00c5s) 1. 7 We recommend against measuring insulin concentrations when evaluating children or adolescents for obesity. (1 j \u00c5\u00c5\u00c5s)\nA thorough medical and family history is crucial for assessing obese youths, because obesity and associated comorbidities may be asymptomatic/subclinical but have familial tendencies. The family history should encompass obesity; bariatric surgery (typically not revealed by families unless specifically asked); T2DM; gestational diabetes; dyslipidemia; hypertension; NAFLD; cirrhosis; sleep apnea and use of continuous positive airway pressure; premature CVD events/deaths (such as heart attacks or strokes); and (in women) infertility, PCOS, or hyperandrogenism-associated signs and symptoms. Clinicians should assess the presence of polyuria/polydipsia, blurry vision, fungal vaginitis/discharge in girls, and unexplained weight loss, all of which could be indicative of hyperglycemia. Clinicians should also look for the presence of frequent unexplained headaches, which raise the possibility of hypertension or sleep apnea; habitual snoring, restless sleep, morning headaches, generalized tiredness, and/or excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as hyperactive inattentive behavior in young children as manifestations of sleep apnea (48) ; gastrointestinal discomfort as a manifestation of NAFLD (39); musculoskeletal symptoms (49) ; and (in pubertal girls) acne, hirsutism (including the recent use of hair removal techniques that would mask the degree of hirsutism at the time of the examination), and onset and pattern of menses to screen for the possibility of PCOS. Clinicians should obtain a careful history for psychiatric disorders, because children and adolescents who are overweight or obese are more likely to suffer from mental health disorders than their normal weight counterparts (50, 51) . Furthermore, clinicians should obtain a history of second-generation antipsychotics use, such as clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, because of their association with weight gain (52, 53) . Although the various techniques assessing dietary intake are unreliable and subject to error (9, 54) , it is still important to estimate the type and quantity of beverage intake, the frequency of dining out and where, and the frequency and type of snacks (among other dietary issues). Clinicians should also obtain a history of sedentary behaviors, such as hours spent on screen activities, and physical activity (e.g., duration, frequency, in school and at home, sports participation, walking to school and stores).\nClinicians should evaluate the following: \u00b7 weight, height, and BMI calculation [Even though the International Diabetes Federation includes waist circumference (an indicator of insulin resistance measured at the level of the iliac crest $ 90th percentile) as a defining factor for metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents 10 to 16 years of age and as a finding of concern in children 6 to 10 years old (55, 56) , given the intermeasurement variability of waist circumference measurements in a clinical setting performed by different support staff, this research tool does not add significantly to what we learn from BMI (57).] Given variability in testosterone levels and the poor standardization of assays, it is difficult to define an absolute level that is diagnostic of PCOS or other causes of hyperandrogenism (familiarity with local assays recommended) (63) . The preferred assay is HPLC tandem mass spectroscopy (64) . \u00b7 acanthosis nigricans and skin tags \u00b7 extreme acne and hirsutism in pubertal girls \u00b7 fundoscopic examination for pseudotumor cerebri \u00b7 tenderness and range of motion of the knee, leg, or foot \u00b7 peripheral edema, thyroid examination for goiter \u00b7 physical findings associated with syndromic obesity, particularly if there is a neurodevelopmental abnormality (see section 3).\nWe list suggested screening tests in Table 2 .\nIn 2009 an International Expert Committee recommended using HbA1c to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes (65) . It recommended classifying asymptomatic individuals as having diabetes if they had HbA1c $ 6.5% ($48 mmol/mol) on 2 separate occasions and classifying asymptomatic individuals with prediabetes if they had HbA1c $ 6.0% ($42 mmol/mol) (65), or HbA1c of 5.7% to ,6.5% (39 to ,48 mmol/mol) (66) . Although they based these recommendations on studies in adults with no validation in pediatrics (65) , the committee recommended that the same criteria be applied in adolescents. However, several studies have demonstrated poor performance of HbA1c in diagnosing prediabetes or diabetes in pediatrics, underestimating the prevalence of both (67) (68) (69) . Another pitfall in using the HbA1c is the unresolved issue of racial/ethnic disparities in the correlation between HbA1c and ambient blood glucose (70) . Given such drawbacks, HbA1c screening (alone) in overweight or obese children and adolescents is a poor diagnostic tool for prediabetes and T2DM. Additional definitive testing (fasting or random glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) may be necessary in high-risk youths based on medical history, familial risk, race/ ethnicity, and/or the presence of additional risk factors for diabetes (71) . In a cost effectiveness analysis of various screening strategies for identifying pediatric diabetes and dysglycemia, the preferred strategy for dysglycemia was the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with 100% effectiveness (proportion of cases identified) and efficiency (cost per case identified) at $390 per case, and the least effective and efficient was HbA1c (ranges, 7% to 32% and $938 to $3370 per case) (72) .\nNAFLD is usually asymptomatic and thus requires screening for detection. Presently, no screening guidelines exist outside of recognizing those at risk by weight categorization (BMI $ 85% for age and sex) (39) . Recently new normative standards were proposed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations (#25 U/L for boys and # 22U/L for girls) (62), because pediatric liver biopsy specimens from patients with normal or mildly elevated ALT ($26 to 50 U/L for boys and $23 to 44 U/L for girls) had significant histologic abnormalities, including advanced fibrosis (73) . Using highly sensitive research methods of magnetic resonance spectroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging, fatty liver is likely present in most pediatric obesity whether the liver enzymes are high or not. High ALT levels would suggest a more advanced stage of NAFLD, hepatitis, or fibrotic changes. Thus, even though ALT elevation underestimates liver injury in NAFLD, it is still an easily available screen for clinicians to use when assessing children and adolescents who are overweight or obese.\nMany clinicians measure insulin values thinking it adds to the diagnosis of comorbidities. In fact it does not, and such measurements are not recommended. Although obesity is associated with insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, attempts to diagnose insulin resistance by measuring plasma insulin concentration or any other surrogate (74) in the clinical setting has no merit because it has no diagnostic value. Fasting insulin concentrations show considerable overlap between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive youths (74) . Therefore, there is no well-defined cut point differentiating normal from abnormal and no universally accepted, clinically useful, numeric expression that defines insulin resistance (75) , unlike the case for glucose or lipids. A major requirement for any screening program is the availability of an accurate, reliable, reproducible, standardized, and easily applicable method of measurement. Adult studies have shown that measures of fasting insulin explain no more than 5% to 50% of the variability in insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic subjects (76) . Different studies have proposed different cutoffs for so called \"insulin resistance values\" varying by 2.5-fold (76) . In pediatrics, the transient puberty-related insulin resistance that occurs with the completion of puberty further complicates this (77, 78) . Moreover, measuring insulin is hampered by the lack of standardized insulin assays, and poor reproducibility of even the same assay (79) . Further limitations include race/ethnicity-related differences in insulin concentrations due to differences in the metabolic clearance rate of insulin (80) and the crossreactivity between insulin and proinsulin. In youths with T2DM, despite severe deficiency in insulin secretion, fasting insulin concentrations are higher than in youths without diabetes (81) . Importantly, fasting insulin concentrations are similar in youths who are obese with normal glucose tolerance vs impaired glucose tolerance (82) , allowing for the possible danger of missing a diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance if one uses fasting insulin concentrations as a screening tool. Because of these limitations, measuring plasma insulin concentrations remains a research tool with no clinical value for evaluation of obesity. Measuring fasting insulin concentrations to try to diagnose insulin resistance within general practice should be abandoned.\nIt is currently useful to categorize genetic obesity syndromes as those with developmental delay and/or dysmorphism and those without these features, although the clinical spectrum can be quite variable (Table 3) . Clinicians should obtain a careful family history to identify potential consanguineous relationships, a family history of severe obesity/bariatric surgery, the ethnic and geographical origin of the child or adolescent, and family members to guide the appropriate use of diagnostic tests ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe costs of comorbidities related to pediatric and adult obesity are spiraling, and we must explore measures to limit nonnutritive excess calories as one means of preventing obesity. No nation can afford the social and financial ramifications of increased obesity incidence left unchecked. The individual practitioner cannot prevent obesity alone; a multidisciplinary health care team including dieticians, mental health practitioners, and nurses provides the optimal setting. However, the committee agrees with the WHO that such changes must reach beyond the clinical setting and require policy changes at the highest level, as well as the cooperation of commercial entities. The committee supports the suggestion by the WHO for worldwide tax leverage on calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods (110, 171) .\nFor most children and adolescents and their families, lifestyle patterns related to eating and exercise are established early, affecting children and adolescents not only when they are young but also throughout life. Health care providers should follow universal prevention methods to avoid the harmful health consequences of less-than-optimal lifestyle choices, conveying to all patients and families in a culturally sensitive and language-appropriate manner the energy needs and essential nutrient requirements of young children, and the importance of physical activity. This is of particular importance when we consider the increased efficacy of prevention trials when directed toward younger children.\nThe intestinal microflora may influence the development of obesity. Although it is premature to discuss methods of altering the intestinal flora, evidence suggests that Bacteroides fragilis is more frequent in the stool of overweight vs normal weight children, adolescents, and adults (193) . The intestinal microflora varies between vaginal and cesarean section birth and also due to the composition of early diets, including breast milk. Upcoming results of clinical trials, which modify the microbiome, may suggest new methods of obesity prevention and treatment.\nA recent systematic review that looked at the way urban environments affect health behaviors or outcomes for children and adolescents reported some evidence of potential health benefits from urban environment interventions relating to road safety and active travel. However, evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions was weak due to study designs that were opportunistic and nonrandomized, used subjective outcome measures, and did not incorporate follow-up of study participants (194) . Nonetheless, health care providers are encouraged to advocate for common sense changes, including providing safe walking/biking areas in parks, school routes, and neighborhoods and providing programs for active play in free time. Environmental change recommendations require additional research with more robust study designs incorporating objective outcome measures to inform meaningful policy change.\nClinicians should encourage BMI reduction for patients with obesity. A Task Force commissioned metaanalysis demonstrated favorable effects on systolic blood pressure, serum triglycerides, and serum high-density lipoprotein with decreasing BMI or weight (5) . When interpreting these data, one must consider that the beneficial effects seen in the 133 RCTs and 16 systematic reviews are for averaged data, not individualized patients; other factors such as age, ethnicity, or genetics may modify individual responses. Very large changes may not be necessary. Although a BMI decrease of 1.5 kg/m 2 (reported in the meta-analysis commissioned by the first Task Force) may seem small, if maintained for the long term, overweight or obese children and adolescents may benefit by maintaining weight as they grow; BMI will decline as linear growth proceeds, and lifestyle modification may reduce fat mass, increase lean body mass, and improve cardiovascular fitness (211) . Seven percent weight loss may be a more realistic goal for children and adolescents with extreme obesity. Well-designed RCTs, with large numbers of patients, employing intensive lifestyle intervention and follow-up maintenance programs, will help develop refined techniques. A review of 25 years of behavioral therapy intervention in children and adolescents has demonstrated that longterm weight loss maintenance is possible (212) . Other RCTs of diet, physical activity, and/or behavior modification have also demonstrated persistent changes in BMI (212, 213) . Evidence (Refer to section 3.2 for some of the evidence for recommendation 4.2.) Children and adolescents who are overweight are more likely to skip breakfast and consume few large meals per day (214) than do their leaner counterparts who are more likely to consume smaller, more frequent meals (215) . Because snacks tend to be higher in calorie density than meals, frequent snacking (among children and adolescents) is associated with a high intake of fat, sugar, and calories and with overweight (216) .\nEducating families, children, and adolescents about the need to measure out single snack portions from multiserving packages and place them in single-serving containers can significantly change the amount of food children and adolescents consume (217) .\nA meta-analysis in children and adolescents suggests that improved weight can be achieved regardless of the macronutrient composition of the diet, and this mirrors similar results found in adults (218) . The WHO has recently recommended that adults, children, and adolescents limit sugar to ,5% to 10% of total daily energy intake, unless the sugars are contained in fresh fruits and vegetables, which are lower in calories and higher in fiber than processed carbohydrates. The other carbohydrates, which they term \"free sugars,\" include honey; other sweeteners; glucose/fructose; and sugar added by a cook, consumer, or producer. This recommendation was termed \"strongly\" because of moderate quality evidence that increasing free sugars in one's diet increases body weight, and decreasing free sugars decreases body weight (110) .\nA dietician familiar with the energy needs of growing children and adolescents should supervise calorie reduction for weight loss or maintenance in patients of this age group. Unbalanced hypocaloric diets (e.g., \"fad diets\") may be deficient in essential vitamins and minerals.\nAlthough current recommendations state that school children and adolescents (who spend about half their waking hours in school) should receive a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of moderately vigorous physical activity and at least 60 minutes of aerobic (moderate and vigorous) physical activity each school day, only 5% of school districts in the United States have a requirement for a specific amount of physical education (221) (222) (223) (224) (225) . Clinicians should place emphasis on increasing a child's or adolescent's activity by helping facilitate: \u00b7 the ability to safely walk to and from school \u00b7 increased use of stairs (and improved signage to indicate their location) \u00b7 increased breaks for movement in the classroom \u00b7 increased movement during recess and gym.\nModerate to vigorous exercise is defined as causing some increase in breathing and heart rate; in a healthy person this is usually associated with brisk walking, dancing, swimming, or cycling on flat terrain. In exercise physiology terms, the energy expended should be at least 3 metabolic equivalents (85, 226) . Moderate exercise allows talking but not singing, and vigorous exercise makes it impossible to sing and difficult to talk. This generalization should help families understand and identify the difference between moderate and vigorous exercise.\nThe use of motivational interviews to help an older child or adolescent and/or his or her parent set physical fitness or dietary goals may lead to greater success in decreasing BMI (218, 219) . In spite of limitations inherent in the method, clinicians should assess a patient's readiness for change when determining how to approach the family.\nAs psychosocial issues are so prevalent, providers should psychologically screen all youths who are obese for the presence of mental health issues, asking questions regarding: \u00b7 school absences/refusal \u00b7 teasing by peers regarding weight/appearance \u00b7 persistent anxiety \u00b7 depression/self-harm \u00b7 anger outbursts \u00b7 sexual activity, alcohol, drug use \u00b7 eating disorders-purging, anorexia, binge eating \u00b7 family functioning/family attitudes about weight and specifically obesity/parent psychopathology.\nParents and/or children and adolescents should complete a mental health screening measure, such as the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (266) . Clinicians can review this during patient visits and refer patients to a mental health professional when indicated. Obesity-related mental health issues are a pervasive problem, and a team-based approach is essential, involving school counselors, nurses, and teachers, as well as health care providers. It might also be helpful to consult with school personnel to initiate school-based counseling. A list of local programs (e.g., YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs) that offer physical activity programs and healthy snacks is also helpful. Behavioral modification is helpful in determining the child's readiness to change and potential barriers to achieving change (264) .\nDrug efficacy is based only on reductions of BMI or BMI z scores. Antiobesity drugs may have differential effects on obesity-associated comorbidities based on their mechanisms of action. For example, certain medications (e.g., metformin) have more potent effects on glucose tolerance. Clinicians should tailor drug selection to the individual patient and pay strong attention to the patient's concomitant medications, medical conditions, and family history, as well as each medication's efficacy and adverse event profile. The benefits of any drug used to treat pediatric obesity should clearly outweigh its long-term risks. Clinicians should be aware that no obesity medication has been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality (267) .\nThe recommendation to discontinue medication when it appears relatively ineffective after 12 weeks of use is consistent with adult obesity pharmacotherapy labeling. The FDA label for liraglutide recommends discontinuation when adults have ,4% weight reduction. Most drugs should be discontinued if a 5% decrease in BMI/ BMI z score does not occur.\nAlthough pediatricians prescribe many medications \"off-label\", we think pharmacotherapeutic agents not yet approved for the treatment of pediatric obesity should be restricted to large, well-controlled clinical studies. 4. 12 We suggest against bariatric surgery in preadolescent children; pregnant or breast-feeding adolescents (and those planning to become pregnant within 2 years of surgery); and in any patient who has not mastered the principles of healthy dietary and activity habits and/or has an unresolved substance abuse, eating disorder, or untreated psychiatric disorder.

Plasma ghrelin levels are markedly elevated in children, adolescents, and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome, although the physiological relevance of this finding is unknown (89) . GH treatments decrease body fat and increase linear growth, muscle mass, and energy expenditure (90) .\nMaternal transmission of heterozygous mutations in GNAS1 leads to classical Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and resistance to several hormones that activate heterotrimeric G proteins in their target tissues, whereas paternal transmission leads only to Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (91) .\nChromosomal rearrangements and heterozygous mutations involving single-minded 1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor (92, 93) , or its receptor, TrkB, lead to hyperphagia and developmental and behavioral abnormalities (94, 95) .

Homozygous mutations in melanocortin 4 receptor have also been identified in offspring from consanguineous families (101) . Heterozygous missense mutations affecting proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides and rare variants in melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2 may also contribute to extreme obesity by modulating melanocortin signaling (102, 103) . In the near future, selective melanocortin receptor agonists may be feasible therapies for patients with mutations in the melanocortin pathway.

Recombinant human leptin is currently available on a named patient basis through selected centers.\nSerum leptin is a useful test in patients with severe obesity, as undetectable serum leptin is highly suggestive of congenital leptin deficiency.

Clinicians should take a careful history to identify foodseeking behavior, searching for/stealing food, waking at night to find food, and eating food others leave behind, which should prompt genetic investigation (neurologic causes should be excluded in patients with a new history of these behaviors).

The study found modest effects of these interventions; there was decreased sedentary behavior in long-term trials (P = 0.05) with a significantly greater effect when directed toward children in contrast to adolescents (P = 0.02), reduced unhealthy dietary habits (P = 0.02), but only a trend towards increased physical activity (P = 0.06-0.07). These beneficial effects did not translate into important changes in BMI (111), but the Task Force recognized that weight maintenance in a growing child or adolescent is as effective as weight loss in an adult. The present committee updated and expanded upon these findings as listed below and in Table 4 .\nDecreasing caloric intake by consuming more fruits and vegetables and reducing dietary fat and refined carbohydrate intake can decrease the risk of developing obesity and T2DM (152) . Many children and adolescents eat fewer than 3 servings of fruits and vegetables a day rather than meeting the US Department of Agriculture dietary recommendation of 5 to 7 fruit and vegetable servings per day. Inadequate consumption of dietary fiber may contribute to excessive weight gain, highlighting the need to continue to address vegetable and whole fruit intake (153) . Whole fruit intake increased and fruit juice intake decreased from 2003-2004 to 2009-2010 (154) .\nChildren and adolescents in the public school system in the United States consume up to 40% of their calories at school, so attention to the composition of foods and drinks available to them during the school day is critical (155) .

However, metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, increases peripheral insulin sensitivity, and may reduce appetite (335) . Metformin decreases BMI, but with a mean decrease of only 1.16 kg/m 2 over 6 to 12 months (336) . Metformin may also possibly be useful in combating the weight gain observed in children and adolescents who are taking atypical psychotropic medications (337, 338) or who have PCOS (324, 331, 339) . However, given its limited weight-loss efficacy, metformin is not a considered a weight-loss treatment.\nSibutramine (275, 284, 285, 340-346) was removed from the US market in 2010 because of concerns for Meta-analysis of 37 studies of 27,946 children generally between 6 and 12 y of age There were beneficial effects of pediatric obesity prevention programs on BMI with school curriculum that includes healthy eating; physical activity and body image; increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week; improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools; environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day; support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities, as well as parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods, and spend less time in screen-based activities; however, weaknesses in studies and potential bias point to the necessity for improved studies in the future Abbreviations: AOR, adjusted odds ratio; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; RCT, randomized controlled trial; SKOT, Scottish Childhood Obesity Treatment Trial; SMD, standardized mean difference; TV, television; VO2, oxygen consumption. a Some studies included obese children and adolescents, but results may relate to prevention. doi: 10.1210/jc.2016-2573 press.endocrine.org/journal/jcem cardiovascular safety but remains available in several other countries. Other medications approved for obesity treatment of $16 years of age or under investigation generally have few relevant pediatric data (297, 298) (Table 5) .\nSome centrally active, amphetamine-like catecholaminergic and dopaminergic stimulants, such as phentermine and diethylpropion, are FDA approved as short-term monotherapy (a few weeks) for obesity in adults. Recently, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was FDA approved to treat binge eating in adults (282, 283) . Lisdexamfetamine treatment was associated with short-term weight loss, but this medication is not FDA approved for weight management. Because of adverse effect profiles (Table 5) , abuse potential (347) , and the absence of trials showing long-term weight loss efficacy, none of the amphetamine-like agents is recommended for obesity management in children and adolescents.\nAlthough not FDA approved for the treatment of obesity, GH treatment of children and adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly when started early (90) , decreases body fat percentage and increases lean body mass (348) , with effects that may be sustained for the long term (90) . A summary of the benefits and risks of GH treatment (349) and consensus guidelines for GH therapy in Prader-Willi Syndrome are available (350) .\nOctreotide limits the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in beta cells (351, 352) , decreasing the magnitude of insulin response to glucose (353) . In obese adults with insulin hypersecretion, treating with long-acting repeatable octreotide for 6 months resulted in ;2% greater weight loss than in controls (316) . Studies have reported weight stabilization, instead of significant weight gain, in children and adolescents with hypothalamic obesity treated with somatostatin analogs (315, 354) . Given its side-effect profile, octreotide appears to be potentially beneficial only for those with hypothalamic obesity.\nLiraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog, is approved for long-term adult obesity treatment; the effective 3 mg dose produced an additional weight loss of 4.5% vs placebo at 1 year, with sustained effects for up to 2 years (355) . Small trials suggest that another glucagonlike peptide 1 analog, exenatide, may potentially have efficacy in adolescent obesity; used for .3 months, exenatide reduced BMI by .1 kg/m 2 (compared with control), with continued BMI reduction during a 3-month open-label phase (297, 298) .\nLeptin therapy in leptin-deficient patients produces significant loss of fat mass (295, 356, 357) . Unfortunately, leptin therapy in adults who are not leptin deficient has little effect on body weight (358) (359) (360) .\nAgents that have been recently approved for long-term obesity treatment in adults (Table 5 ) currently lack pediatric-specific data. The additional weight loss (beyond that achieved with placebo) at 1 year among adults ranges from ;3% (lorcaserin) to ;10% (phentermine plus topiramate) (267), but none is without potential risks. If adult patients taking full-dose lorcaserin, bupropion plus naltrexone, liraglutide, or phentermine plus topiramate do not see clinically meaningful weight loss (.3% to 5% of body weight) after 12 weeks, clinicians should discontinue treatment, because significant weight loss after 1 year is unlikely. Similar results were found for adults given orlistat (361) . In the largest adolescent orlistat trial (362) , 21% of orlistat-treated adolescents decreased their body weight by $5% at 12 weeks and went on to decrease body weight by 7.8% after 1 year of treatment; however, those who lost ,5% at 12 weeks had a 2.3% weight gain after 1 year (362) . Thus, clinicians should discontinue pharmacotherapy agents when sufficient weight loss is not observed after 12 weeks."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ;17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in the most seriously affected mature teenagers who have failed lifestyle modification, but it requires experienced teams with resources for long-term follow-up. Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, such as continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy.\nDespite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, there remains an unmet need for further study of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual to manifest 1 comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environs and total daily mobility, as well as methods for sustaining healthy BMI changes, is of importance."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Changes", "text": "Since the publication of the original guidelines 8 years ago there have been an additional 1778 references added to PubMed concerning pediatric obesity. We have incorporated the most relevant data from these to update and enhance the original text.\nThe epidemiology and definition section contains the latest statistics on trends in childhood obesity, including an apparent recent stabilization of the prevalence. New definitions for extreme obesity are added with a notation that this is the group that continues to rise. The prevalence in ethnic minorities as well a discussion of the limitations of applying the BMI equation to all ethnic groups are addressed.\nThe evaluation section provides the latest guidelines for utilizing laboratory evaluation for diagnosis and management of comorbidities of obesity. Special emphasis on avoiding endocrine evaluation in most children as well as avoiding measurement of insulin values is provided to prevent unnecessary laboratory testing.\nThe genetics section has been extensively revised with the latest genomic findings presented in table form and provides guidelines on when to invoke genetic testing in obese children, particularly those with early onset obesity, family history of extreme obesity, and hyperphagia. A combined flowchart demonstrating pathways of diagnosis from history and physical examination to genetic testing is included.\nPrevention of obesity is discussed with numerous new studies that support most previous conclusions on lifestyle modification. However, although breast-feeding is beneficial for an infant in numerous ways and was supported as a recommendation to prevent obesity in the previous guidelines, recent data weaken support for breast-feeding as a means of preventing obesity and breast-feeding is now a suggestion.\nThe treatment section focuses on lifestyle changes as the basis of all efforts to treat childhood obesity and supports most previous recommendations and suggestions. A chart demonstrating how much change in systolic blood pressure and lipid values might be expected with a decrease in 1 unit of BMI (kg/m 2 ) or a decrease of 1 kg of body weight is added.\nA discussion of the significant toll childhood obesity takes on the psychological function of a child follows. Guidelines for evaluation of children and access to tools to evaluate child and family function are provided. Referral to appropriate counseling programs is emphasized when psychological problems or aberrant family dynamics are found.\nAlthough noting that all but one of the pharmacological agents targeting obesity are not approved until 16 years of age, agents and their method of action are presented in detail in a table. Lifestyle modification is emphasized as a basis for any additional pharmacological therapy. Should pharmacological therapy be invoked, even off label, guidelines for use and for discontinuation in the case of lack of efficacy are provided. When pharmacotherapy is considered, only clinicians experienced in the use of the agents should use them.\nThe increasing information on the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery is presented along with a discussion of the types of procedures that might be used. There is emphasis upon contraindications in the use of bariatric surgery in growing children and immature teenagers. Emphasis that procedures should only be carried out in those mature pubertal individuals with severe comorbidities of obesity in the presence of a motivated and compliant patient and family and only in the hands of an experienced surgeon with a dedicated and experienced support team is provided.\nThe last section sets new goals for future research into the thorny questions of the best method to determine the etiology of childhood obesity and methods to prevent and treat childhood obesity and its comorbidities. * Financial, business, and organizational disclosures of the Task Force cover the year prior to publication.
