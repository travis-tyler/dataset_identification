Prior studies showed that SMC individuals might precede amnestic mild cognitive impairments (aMCI) and exhibit a high conversion risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [2] . Moreover, longitudinal studies noted that the risk for SMC individuals to convert to MCI or AD is 4.5-6.5 times higher than healthy aging individuals [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, SMC might serve as the typical presymptomatic stage along the AD continuum [1] .\nRecent neuroimaging studies found that SMC individuals is accompanied by cortical atrophy [8, 9] and white matter (WM) abnormalities [10] in AD-related regions, such as the medial temporal lobe. Functionally, SMC individuals feature both functional connectivity and metabolic alterations in the medial temporal and occipitoparietal regions [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . These results jointly suggested SMC as the middle stage between MCI and normal controls (NC) and demonstrated that SMC might be among the earliest AD clinical symptoms. Pathological changes may explain these neuroimaging abnormalities. For example, autopsy studies have found higher levels of amyloid-\u03b2 deposits and tau tangles in SMC individuals than healthy aging [16] . Further, PET study found increased entorhinal cortical tauopathy in SMC individuals and noted that tauopathy might be the most suggestive sign of SMC [17] . Despite these findings, the link between AD-related biomarkers and functional changes in SMC individuals is unclear.\nTo cover this gap, we combined graph theoretical approaches based on resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and pathological biomarkers. By definition, graph theoretical centrality considers the brain as one vast network and measures the overall importance of individual brain regions. In the present study, we assessed two representative centrality metrics, degree centrality (DC) and eigenvector centrality (EC), across the entire brain. These metrics could capture the functional relationships of a given voxel (node) within the entire connectivity matrix of the brain (connectome). Specifically, DC is a local metric, calculating the number of direct connections for a given node [18] . In other words, a higher DC represents more direct connections with the node. In contrast, EC is a global metric calculating both the number and the weight of the connections [19, 20] . A brain region with a higher EC value means strong connection with more nodes and with higher weighting (i.e., there is a central role for the region in the whole-brain connectome). Furthermore, we assessed amyloid deposition in a voxel-wise manner and explored pathological changes in SMC individuals. Additionally, we examined the possible amyloid burden, neuronal death, and accumulation of tangles based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data [21] .\nWe aimed to explore the intrinsic functional network and its corresponding pathologies in SMC individuals. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that SMC individuals had more severe topological network impairment and a higher pathological burden than controls, especially in regions susceptible to AD pathologies such as the temporal and parietal lobes [22] . Moreover, aberrant functional connectivity metrics might relate to pathological change."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging and initiative Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).

To remove residual effects of motion and other non-neuronal factors, we corrected covariates including 24 head motion parameters and signals of white matter and CSF signal.

Based on centrality analyses, we found that the SMC individuals showed both impairment and compensation in the default mode network (DMN) at the local level Fig. 1 Shows the DC differences between SMC individuals and controls. SMC individuals showed higher DC (hot color) in the bilateral HP, left fusiform gyrus and lower DC (cold color) in the right inferior parietal region than controls (P<0.001, cluster size > 10 voxels, uncorrected, covariates including age, gender, education and geriatric depression scale). Abbreviations: DC degree centrality, SMC subjective memory complaint, HP hippocampus, IPG inferior parietal region (reflected by DC) but not at the global level (reflected by EC). Moreover, the links between the DC value and CSF tau level in the temporal regions suggested that the functional alternation in SMC individuals may result from tau-related pathologies.\nSMC is at a stage of mild neuronal damage but still with sufficient functional compensation [37] . This stage may reflect the first effects of AD pathology on cognitive functioning between full compensation and the very first decline. Here, we found no difference in EC between groups, which suggested that SMC individuals have relatively intact global connectivity. This result was in line with the work of Wang et al. which reported similar global efficiency in SMC individuals and NC by examining the white matter connectivity network [38] . On the other hand, we found that the SMC individuals displayed increased DC in the medial temporal region (MTL, including the HP and fusiform gyrus) and decreased DC in the inferior parietal gyrus (IPG), suggesting aberrant local connectivity in the DMN. Another functional study came to similar conclusions, reporting that DMN function was alternated in SMC individuals and proposed it as the early AD-related connectivity failure [39] . Moreover, one study also reported reduced parietal activation while increased HP activation [40] in normal aging, demonstrating that successful memory encoding requires the coordination of neural activity in hippocampal and parietal regions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that reduced functional activity in the inferior parietal gyrus might indicate network deficiency, but increased activity in MTL might compensate for decreased memory in SMC individuals.\nSupporting evidence for our hypothesis also comes from studies using different modalities. The inferior Fig . 2 Shows the association between tau and DC value. Across groups, the DC value of the bilateral HP and left fusiform gyrus was positively associated with the T-tau and P-tau 181 levels. a DC value of left HP related to T-tau (r=0.32, P<0.05); b DC value of left HP related to P-tau 181 (r=0.37, P<0.05); c DC value of right HP related to T-tau (r=0.47, P<0.05); d DC value of right HP related to P-tau 181 (r=0.45, P<0.05); e DC value of left fusiform gyrus related to T-tau (r=0.39, P<0.05); f the DC value of left fusiform gyrus related to P-tau 181 (r=0.40, P<0.05).

Abbreviations: DC degree centrality, HP hippocampus, T-tau total tau, P-tau 181 phosphorylated tau; the unit of CSF: (pg/ml) parietal region, as a functional core of the DMN, is vulnerable to functional connectivity breakdown in AD patients [32, 41] . Similar results can also be found in white matter network studies, demonstrating decreased nodal strength in the parietal region in SMC individuals [38, 42] . Moreover, early suffering from decreased glucose metabolic rates in the inferior parietal lobe in SMC individuals may help explain these connectivity abnormalities. [11] . Therefore, we proposed that the inferior parietal region is the primary target of functional decrease in SMC individuals which may further lead to cognition decline. Meanwhile, we observed that MTL exhibited increased function at the local level, which may help maintain cognitive performance in SMC individuals. Similarly, several memory encoding-related fMRI studies found increased activation in the MTL in SMC individuals [13, 14, 43] , suggesting that this region may be involved in memory compensation [14] . Additionally, one white matter connectivity study reported impaired WM microstructure and integrity in MTL in SMC individuals [44] . Previous literature has hypothesized that before a global connectivity failure, brain regions with high activity could reflect an attempted compensation of early pathophysiological processes [45, 46] . Combined with the correlation between tau level and functional connectivity in the MTL, we proposed that the hyperconnectivity in SMC individuals is a result of brain plasticity after damage to the neural system. Conclusively, we hypothesized that both functional impairment and compensation simultaneously existed in SMC individuals, and such a functional pattern works jointly to maintain normal cognition in SMC individuals.\nRegarding the pathological results, we did not observe significant amyloid differences between the SMC and NC groups. However, correlation analyses showed the links between MTL DC value and CSF tau level in all subjects. One possible explanation is that tau-mediated neuronal dysfunction [47, 48] , but not amyloid burden is the initial pathology in SMC individuals. Some PET studies supported this interpretation to some extent [49] [50] [51] [52] . Specifically, the SMC individuals tend to suffer tau pathology accumulation early in the MTL, in regions involved in memory function [17, [53] [54] [55] [56] . In addition, Risacher et al. [57] reported that olfactory identification was more related to tauopathy than amyloid deposition in individuals with SMC. Another explanation is that the SMC group consists of a heterogeneous population [58] . Here, we included SMC individuals according to the framework and tried to meet the plus criteria [1] . Evidence such as informant-based complaints provides additional predictive ability for the progression to dementia in SMC individuals [59] . Notably, apart from AD-related pathologies, other neuropsychiatric factors such as depression or anxiety may also contribute to SMC [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . These symptoms may also be manifestations of preclinical AD and can further lead to increases in amyloid formation and tau accumulation [65, 66] at the early stage of AD and could constitute a risk factor for subsequent dementia [67] . In our study, SMC individuals had a higher depression score (but within the clinically normal range), which was controlled to eliminate its possible effect according to the framework [1] . Considering the mixed function of subthreshold symptoms and pathologies, we still inferred that these possible mixed factors might affect the results to some extent.\nThere exist several limitations in our study. First, the sample size was relatively small, which reduced the statistical power. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required. Second, the SMC group is a heterogeneous group, easily resulted from other neuropsychological factors apart from AD-related pathologies. Future studies should consider these neuropsychiatric factors associated with SMC [58] . Moreover, the pathological ATN classification can help to define the SMC due to AD and should be used in the further analysis [68, 69] . Third, some CSF data are missing, which may lead to a selection bias. We performed a complementary correlation analysis based on extended CSF, which may support the stability of our findings to some extent. However, further studies with larger CSF sample sizes are urgent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We found an impaired local, but not global, intrinsic functional network in SMC individuals, mainly involving the DMN.
