[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Two of the major concerns of researchers and clinicians performing neuroimaging experiments are managing the huge quantity and diversity of data and the ability to compare their experiments and the programs they develop with those of their peers. In this context, we introduce Shanoir, which uses a type of cloud computing known as software as a service to manage neuroimaging data used in the clinical neurosciences. Thanks to a formal model of medical imaging data (an ontology), Shanoir provides an open source neuroinformatics environment designed to structure, manage, archive, visualize, and share neuroimaging data with an emphasis on managing multi-institutional, collaborative research projects. This article covers how images are accessed through the Shanoir Data Management System and describes the data repositories that are hosted and managed by the Shanoir environment in different contexts."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Searches on distributed neuroimaging databases for similar results and images containing singularities (quirk, peculiarities, etc.) or the use of data mining techniques may highlight possible similarities. Such efforts also broaden the possible panel of people involved in neuroimaging studies while maintaining the quality of the work. Indeed, the explosion of data generated by the neurosciences community in the early 1990s has resulted in the need for innovative techniques for data and knowledge sharing and reuse (Roland and Zilles, 1994; Mazziotta et al., 1995; Shepherd et al., 1998) . This has led to the emergence of large-scale projects on the human brain. A recent objective added to these initial issues is the application of data analysis and data processing software to various data repository systems for knowledge discovery and data mining, including its more recent extension to merging imaging and genetic data (Hibar et al., 2015) . In parallel, the development of web applications has stimulated the interest of researchers and clinicians in distributed databases and information sharing."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "It is now commonly accepted in the neuroimaging community that sharing data and image processing services will play a crucial role in translational research (Barillot et al., 2003; Walport and Brest, 2011; Poline et al., 2012; Keator et al., 2013; Van Horn and Gazzaniga, 2013; Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014) . Research funding agencies now clearly identify the sharing of scientific resources (data processing) as a top priority. International organizations such as the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) 1 are now dedicated to promoting the field of neuroinformatics (Book et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2015) . Sharing data and image processing services for translational research are needed for:\n(1) the integration of large data sets for population-wide studies and construction of imaging cohorts (Shepherd et al., 1998; Van Horn et al., 2001; Barillot et al., 2006; Evans and Brain Development Cooperative Group, 2006; Jack et al., 2008; Hall et al., 2012; Weiner et al., 2012; Marcus et al., 2013; Van Essen et al., 2013) , (2) the validation of image processing tools on reference datasets for validation and quality control of image processing procedures (Styner et al., 2008; Menze et al., 2015) , (3) the reuse of image processing pipeline on different sets of data and different peers for sharing processing tools (Keator et al., 2009 (Keator et al., , 2013 Ooi et al., 2009; Dinov et al., 2010; Gorgolewski et al., 2011; Bellec et al., 2012; Glatard et al., 2014) , and (4) the validation of research results based on proofed control statistical analysis of images for validation and quality control of experimental research (Carp, 2012; Button et al., 2013; Ioannidis, 2014; Ioannidis et al., 2014) . This is particularly significant in the field of neuroimaging as several large recent multicenter initiatives have shown. These include Evans and Brain Development Cooperative Group (2006) , which performed a study using magnetic resonance 1 http://www.incf.org/.\nimaging (MRI) of normal brain maturation from birth to adulthood in approximately 500 children with behavior disorders, and the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), which has assembled a very large variety of images for its work (Weiner et al., 2012) . The Human Connectome Project (HCP), which worked with 1,200 healthy volunteers to investigate brain connectivity in the normal brain (Marcus et al., 2013; Van Essen et al., 2013) , is another well-known example illustrating the importance of aggregate imaging data and relating data warehouses to image processing resources.\nTo provide archiving solutions for large or various multicenter projects, several architectures have already been proposed. The Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) has been a pioneer in launching brain imaging solutions (Gupta et al., 2003; Keator et al., 2008 Keator et al., , 2009 Ashish et al., 2010) . Another early initiative, the FMRIDC project sought to share task-based fMRI imaging data (Van Horn and Gazzaniga, 2013) . @NeurIST set up a dedicated solution (funded by an Integrated European Project) to support research and treatment of cerebral aneurysms using heterogeneous data, computing, and complex processing services (Benkner et al., 2010) . The LORIS/CBRAIN project is an initiative to develop a pan-Canadian platform for distributed processing, analysis, exchange, and visualization of brain imaging data (Das et al., 2011; Sherif et al., 2014) . Finally, other generic data management systems have been proposed to offer shared solutions for managing multicenter studies. These include the Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) (Marcus et al., 2007) , which has been successful due to its integration in the management of large projects (Marcus et al., 2013) and ability to communicate with data management servers via dedicated REST web services, and the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite (COINS), which provides a web-based neuroimaging and neuropsychology software suite (Scott et al., 2011) . Although the extensibility of these platforms is part of the motivations, none of them are built on top of a formal semantic model or ontology that can guarantee the sustainability of any evolution of the original data scheme."}, {"section_title": "significance", "text": "In this context, the Sharing Neuroimaging Resources (Shanoir) environment enables sharing between distributed sources of neuroimaging information over the Internet, whether the sources are located in various centers of experimentation, clinical departments of neurology, or research centers in cognitive neurosciences or image processing. A large variety of users can thus share, exchange, and have controlled access to neuroimaging information using the software as a service (SaaS) type of cloud computing (Rimal et al., 2009 ) almost as easily as if the data were stored locally.\nIn this paper, we introduce the Shanoir software environment for managing neuroimaging data production in the context of clinical neurosciences and show how the images are accessible through the Shanoir Data Management System. Shanoir is an open source neuroinformatics environment designed to structure, manage, archive, visualize, and share neuroimaging data with an emphasis on multi-institutional, collaborative research projects. The software offers features commonly found in neuroimaging data management systems along with research-oriented data organization capabilities and enhanced accessibility. It also provides user-friendly secure web access and an intuitive workflow that facilitates the collection and retrieval of neuroimaging data from multiple sources.\nIn Section \"Shanoir Software Environment, \" we provide a brief overview of the software environment including its core (web portal, Study Card, and quality control) and extensions for loading, querying, and processing data. Section \"Data Repositories\" describes the data repositories, while Section \"Conclusion and Perspectives\" covers the use of these repositories and potential evolution.\nshANoIR soFtWARe eNVIRoNMeNt"}, {"section_title": "General description of the software environment", "text": "Shanoir is an open source software environment with QPL licensing designed to archive, structure, manage, visualize, and share neuroimaging data with an emphasis on managing collaborative research projects. It includes the common features of neuroimaging data management systems along with research-oriented data organization and enhanced accessibility. Shanoir is based on a secure J2EE application running on a JBoss server that is accessed via graphical interfaces in a browser or by third-party programs via web services using simple object access protocol (SOAP). It behaves like a repository of neuroimaging files coupled with a relational database containing metadata (Figure 1) .\nShanoir uses semantics for structuring the concepts as defined by the OntoNeuroLOG 2 ontology (Temal et al., 2008; Michel et al., 2010) . OntoNeuroLOG reuses and extends the OntoNeuroBase ontology defined earlier (Barillot et al., 2006 ) (see Figure 2 ). Both were designed using the methodological framework (Temal et al., 2008) of the foundational Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) (Masolo et al., 2003) and a number of core ontologies that provide generic, basic, and minimal concepts and relationships in specific fields such as artifacts, participant roles, information, and discourse acts. In Shanoir, the OWL-Lite implementation was manually derived from the OntoNeuroLOG initial expressive representation to Java classes. The data model based on this ontology is dedicated to the neuroimaging field and is structured around research studies in which patients are examined to produce image acquisitions or clinical scores. Each image acquisition is composed of datasets represented by acquisition parameters and image files. For security and legal reasons, all data on the system are anonymous by default, this can be customized with specific algorithm (e.g., defacing is not currently implemented but can easily be embedded in a specific anonymizer that Shanoir will call).\nRaw as well as derived (i.e., post-processed) image files can also be imported into the system using medical imaging technology [e.g., media based on the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard, picture archiving and communication system (PACS), or image files in the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI)/Analyze-style data format] using online wizards, which complete related metadata, command line tools, or SOAP web services. Once identity information has been removed from raw data during the importation process, the DICOM header content is automatically extracted, enriched, and inserted into the database with the customizable \"Study Card\" feature. Shanoir can also record any execution process for retrieval of workflows applied to a particular dataset along with the derived data.\nClinical scores from instrument assessments (e.g., neuropsychological tests) can be recorded and easily retrieved and exported in different formats (Excel, CSV, and XML). The instrument database is scalable and new measures can be added in order to meet specific project needs (Figure 3) . Scores, image acquisitions, and post-processed images are bound together, so that relationships can be analyzed. Using cross-data navigation and advanced search criteria, the user can quickly indicate a subset of data for download. Client-side applications have also been developed to locally access and exploit data though web services. The security features of the system require authentication with user rights set for each study. A study manager can define the users allowed to see, download, or import data into his/her study or simply make it public. In practice, Shanoir serves neuroimaging researchers by efficiently organizing their studies while cooperating with other laboratories. By managing patient privacy, Shanoir offers the possibility of using clinical data in a research context. Finally, it is a handy solution for publishing and sharing data with a broader community."}, {"section_title": "study Card and Quality Control Concepts", "text": "Images can be imported in Shanoir from various sources: DICOM media, PACS (with DICOM Query and Retrieve), and 3D/4D image files (in NIfTI/Analyze format). Users are guided step-by-step through online forms to perform imports. In addition to archiving DICOM files, NIfTI copies are automatically generated and saved. This is convenient since the NIfTI format is better suited to perform image processing (such as registration, segmentation, and statistical analysis) than the DICOM format."}, {"section_title": "The Study Card", "text": "During archiving, the DICOM files are processed in two phases. The first phase de-identifies the images. The second phase populates the database with the new metadata items generated from the DICOM header and enriched with the Study Card, which enables online metadata wrapping between the local data to be imported (center, acquisition equipment, etc.) and the semantic concepts of the research study to which the data will be assigned. The actual DICOM metadata can thus be aligned with the ontology and also provides additional allocation of concepts to the stored images that are more closely related to the research study protocol (e.g., functional MRI, perfusion imaging, contrast agent, diffusion imaging, etc.). The mechanism behind this feature is based on a set of rules that the user predefines to associate specific acquisition equipment and a specific data production site to the desired research study. Each rule determines the specific value of a metadata item according to the value(s) of one or more specific DICOM tag(s) (e.g., Series Description, see Figure 4 ). This greatly facilitates the consistent recording and alignment to the ontology of metadata for all data in a research study without the need for tedious workflow during the online import of images. Due to the simplicity of the process, no specific skills are required to perform data import, and it only takes a few minutes over the Internet. The \"Study Card\" concept makes possible an automatic quality control of the imported data using their metadata. For instance, a conformal statement can be attached to the imported data according to a match score to the Study Card rules.\nFIGURe 3 | shanoir \"instrument\" database can be used for attaching clinical scores to images (e.g., edss score in Ms). An instrument can be any record where an alphanumerical value can be attached. "}, {"section_title": "Quality Assessment", "text": "Shanoir's next major functionality concerns the quality check of the images for conformity of the imported data with the predefined study protocol and ensures the integrity of the archived data. We have identified three levels of control:\n\u2022 study protocol: controls the time interval between examinations (expected visits) as defined by the principal investigator (PI) of the study; \u2022 acquisition protocol: controls the presence of all the sequences of the imaging protocol as defined by the PI of the study; and \u2022 raw data:\n\u26ac the software automatically checks the range of parameters for a given protocol, experimental center, or acquisition scanner as defined in the Study Card by the PI's technical representative; \u26ac visual inspection of the image quality and integrity can be reported and assigned to the imported data; however, the mechanism to detect the visual quality is not yet integrated in the Shanoir environment.\nIn the next release of Shanoir, quality assessment will be present as flags (flawless, acceptable, or inadmissible) in the database.\nThis QA capability does not address the control of image formation as, for instance, to check image artifacts (bias, motions, ghosting, etc.) . This category of QA can be implemented in a dedicated image visualization and processing tools that interoperate with Shanoir through the dedicated web services. Web Portal\nShanoir provides user-friendly secure web access and offers an intuitive workflow to facilitate the collection and retrieval of neuroimaging data from multiple sources ( Figure 5 ).

A large community of users, both clinicians and scientists, uses the resources as part of local, national, and international imagingbased research projects.\nAll data produced at Neurinfo for academic or clinical research purposes are managed through a dedicated Shanoir@ Neurinfo repository (Figure 12 ) administered by the facility's staff. The Shanoir@Neurinfo server also hosts data from imaging studies at multiple sites. In total, around 2To of data from 42 centers and 50 MR scanners are archived at this repository. The amount of data increases by 30 GB per month (see table in Figure 12) .\nIn daily practice, DICOM data are imported by a technician from either a local PACS, a CD/DVD, or a disk drive containing the DICOMDIR in its root directory and the DICOM files.\nThe clinical studies stored on the Shanoir@Neurinfo server concern the whole body (brain, spine, heart, lung, pelvis, vasculature, etc.) with a major focus on brain anatomy and function in normal control and pathological populations. Out of the 70 or so ongoing research studies on the Neurinfo platform, 75% relates to brain imaging, 15% concern abdominal imaging, and 10% concern heart imaging. Among the neuroimaging clinical studies, multiple sclerosis, dementia, tumors, stroke, and mood disorders are the most investigated pathologies. Depending on the specific nature of the research study, typical neuroimaging protocols include structural imaging, functional BOLD MRI, Arterial Spin Labeling perfusion imaging, diffusion imaging, relaxometry sequences, pre-and post-gadolinium T1w sequences, or vascular sequences. The following studies are examples of research carried out with the Shanoir@Neurinfo service as well as the types of data that are managed by the Shanoir@ Neurinfo repository.\nAlong with the MRI raw data, post-processed images can be stored for each dataset. For example, in a study on functional motor activation, the motor areas were delineated by a trained radiologist and associated with each 3D T1w image. Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation masks can also be attached to the examination. In addition to image data, clinical scores can also be stored for each subject in the repository. Several MS clinical studies collect measurements such as the number of T2 new lesions, and number of T1w Gd enhancing lesions or clinical scores such as EDSS. These measurements are also included in the search engine and consequently easily accessible through requests. For more advanced clinical follow-ups, Shanoir can easily be interfaced with existing databases.\nThe general policy for the Shanoir@Neurinfo repository for dissemination of data related to a particular study is decided upon beforehand with the PI in compliance with the informed consent form approved by the ethics committee and signed by the participant. Any opening of the data to third parties is submitted to the approval of the PI prior to allowing (complete or partial) access to a third-party user. Nonetheless, to ensure dissemination and the best use of data acquired from public funding, the Neurinfo team strongly encourages investigators to share their data, which is usually done after an embargo period.\nFIGURe 11 | schematic diagram of a shanoir server.

The aim of the project is to build and maintain a nationwide cohort of patients with MS and enrich the clinical data with biological samples, socio-economic data, and neuro-images. imaging data and allow modifications, queries, annotations, and access control, the Shanoir environment has been selected. It will also ensure interoperability and data management related to the imaging aspect of the cohort (the clinical part is managed by the EDMUS 11 system). For this purpose, we have set up a specific Shanoir@OFSEP image repository that is currently in its pilot phase.\nBegun in 2012, the Shanoir@OFSEP server was installed to store the imaging data of the OFSEP cohort, which will study the neuroimaging data of 40,000 MS patients over the next 10 years. A consensus has emerged concerning the acquisition protocol, which requires (at least) one brain MRI every 3 years, one spinal MRI every 6 years, i.e., 200,000 MRIs over 10 years. The Shanoir@OFSEP database will grow during this period and beyond (Cotton et al., 2015) .\nSince OFSEP is a nationwide project covering many patients, many IRCs, and many different kinds of MRI acquisition equipment, a national repository with nationwide access and uniform measures was therefore needed. The OFSEP imaging working group is continuously gathering new acquisition centers volunteering to take part to the cohort. In Shanoir@OFSEP, there are currently about 30 IRCs which include 31 pieces of MRI acquisition equipment representing 14 different MR scanner models from three MR manufacturers (Siemens, Philips, and GE). All the centers are importing data in one main study called the \"Mother Cohort. \" Each center follows the OFSEP protocol, which will be checked through the quality control module as described in Section \"Quality Assessment. \" If necessary, derived imaging data can then be imported back to the server in order to refer to potential post-processing information and MS-specific imaging biomarkers to make them available for authorized users.\nCurrently, the Shanoir@OFSEP repository is hosting five studies: the \"Mother Cohort\" (200,000 MRIs planned over the next 11 EDMUS: http://www.edmus.org. 10 years) as well as four MS imaging clinical research projects. More of these \"OFSEP-labeled\" clinical research projects or nested cohorts will be integrated in coming years. Everyone can join the \"Mother Cohort\" study as long as they use the OFSEP protocol. One can also ask the OFSEP to contribute to the project through his study as soon as the PI presents his research study subject to the OFSEP scientific committee that can grant (or not) the hosting. Data hosted on Shanoir@OFSEP will remain confidential (private) throughout the duration of the study but can be made available to all researchers through a specific OFSEP application."}, {"section_title": "CoNCLUsIoN ANd PeRsPeCtIVes", "text": "The Shanoir SaaS manages the sharing of distributed information sources in neuroimaging over the Internet, whether these resources are located in centers of experimentation, clinical departments in neurology, or research centers in cognitive neurosciences or image processing.

Through the description of the Shanoir software environment, we have illustrated how neuroimaging data can be structured, managed, archived, visualized, and shared.\nIn the medium term, we plan to integrate Shanoir's resources and services with the open community through the French National Infrastructure's \"France Life Imaging\" (FLI), 12 and more specifically, the \"Information Analysis and Management\" (IAM) node that is dedicated to provide large scale IT infrastructure for in vivo imaging. For this purpose, the FLI-IAM node will build and operate an infrastructure to store, manage, and process in vivo imaging data from human or preclinical procedures.
