[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This E.D. TAB presents selected findings about the price of attendance and the types and amounts of financial aid received by postsecondary undergraduates during the 2003-04 academic year. It is based on the undergraduate data in the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04), a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students. The information about undergraduate students in NPSAS:04 was collected from a sample of about 80,000 undergraduates who were enrolled at any time between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, in about 1,300 postsecondary institutions that offered undergraduate programs of study. The sample was limited to institutions that were eligible to participate in the federal financial aid programs included in Title IV of the Higher Education Act and were located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The NPSAS:04 sample of undergraduates represents about 19 million students. Because NPSAS:04 includes students enrolled at any time over a 12-month period, it includes more students than were enrolled only in the 2003 fall term. Preliminary data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System indicate that about 15 million undergraduates were enrolled in the fall of 2003. The tables in this E.D. TAB show the percentage of students who received financial aid of a particular type or combination, and the average amount that was received by those students who were awarded that type or combination of aid. Financial aid includes any type of aid received from any source except parents, friends, or relatives. However, the aid estimates do not include federal tax credits for postsecondary education (Hope and Lifetime Learning) and do not include all of the possible types of loans that students may take out to finance their educational expenses. In this report, all federal, state, and institutional student loans are included, in addition to alternative private student loans from sources such as Sallie Mae and The Education Resources Institute (TERI). Some examples of borrowing that are not included in the estimate of total loans or total aid are the use of credit cards, home equity loans, and loans from individuals. The estimates presented in this E.D. TAB were produced using the NCES Data Analysis System (DAS) Online, a web-based table-generating application that provides the public with direct, free access to the NPSAS:04 data as well as other postsecondary datasets collected by NCES. The NPSAS:04 estimates are subject to sampling and nonsampling errors. The DAS will suppress the printing of estimates when the number of sample cases in a table cell is too low to produce a reliable estimate; this is indicated in the tables of this E.D. TAB by the note \"Reporting standards not met.\" The DAS produces the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences in the estimates. All comparisons made in the text were tested using Student's t statistic for comparing two numbers and all differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the E.D. TAB", "text": "This introduction briefly describes the student characteristics, price of attendance and types of financial aid that appear in the tables that follow. The first set of tables (tables 1-4) presents national (including Puerto Rico) percentages and averages for undergraduates at all types of institutions. These tables of national totals are followed by comparable sets of tables for undergraduates in each of four major types of postsecondary institutions: public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, public 2-year, and private for-profit. Students who attended more than one institution during the 2003-04 academic year are included in the national totals, but are excluded from the tables for each type of institution. The percentage distributions of students and their characteristics among and within the types of institutions are shown in appendix A. The variables used to produce the tables are described in the glossary (appendix B). Additional information about public access to the data files with the DAS, the methodology of the survey, and the statistical procedures used in this E.D. TAB is presented in appendix C. married, have dependents of their own, are veterans, or are orphans or wards of the court. These exceptions and any students age 24 or older are considered to be independent for financial aid purposes. For dependent students, financial aid need analysis takes into consideration the income of the dependent student's parents, but for independent students only the income of the student (and a spouse, if married) is considered. The income levels shown in the tables are the total income for 2002, because financial aid need analysis is based on income in the calendar year prior to the academic year . The median family income in 2002 for parents of dependent undergraduates enrolled in 2003-04 was about $60,000; about one-fourth of the dependent students came from families with annual incomes of less than $32,000 and about onefourth came from families with incomes of more than $92,000. The median income of independent students (and a spouse, if married) was about $25,000."}, {"section_title": "Price of Attendance and Financial Aid", "text": "The tables include the average amount of tuition and fees charged by the institutions and the average total price of attendance to the students. The total price of attendance includes the tuition and fees as well as all other expenses related to enrollment: books and supplies, room and board (or housing and meal allowances for off-campus students), transportation, and other personal living expenses. These are the average estimated expenses for various categories of students (e.g., on-campus, off-campus, dependent, independent) reported by the institutions. There are many different types of financial aid available to students, but the focus of this E.D. TAB is on grants and student loans, which are the two major types of aid to undergraduates. Grant aid includes grants, scholarships, or tuition waivers from federal, state, institutional, or other sources (such as private foundations, employers, and parents' employers). The major federal grant programs are Federal Pell Grants and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants. The federal student loan programs (Stafford and Perkins loans) are the major source of student loans to undergraduates. Federal Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) were excluded from the student loan totals because the focus of this E.D. TAB is on the amount that students themselves borrow for their education. Parent PLUS loans, work-study aid, veteran's benefits and job training aid are not shown separately in this E.D. TAB, but they are included in the total aid averages. Financial aid is typically awarded in \"packages\" that may include more than one type of aid (e.g., loans and grants) and aid from more than one source (e.g., federal grants and state grants). The tables show three categories of financial aid packages, based on whether the financial aid package included loans to students. The category \"grants or any other aid except loans\" includes the students who received any type or combination of grants, work-study, veteran's benefits, or job training funds, but did not take out a student loan in 2003-04. The category \"grants or any other aid with loans\" includes the students who received grants or any other type of aid and also took out student loans in 2003-04."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings 1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "All Institutions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "All undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary institutions in 2003-04:", "text": "\u2022 Sixty-three percent of all undergraduates enrolled in 2003-04 received some type of financial aid (table 1).

To be eligible for NPSAS, students had to be enrolled in either an academic program with at least one course for credit that could be applied toward fulfilling the requirements for an academic degree or enrolled in an occupational or vocational program that requires at least 3 months or 300 clock hours of instruction to receive a degree, certificate, or other formal award. Eligible students could not be concurrently enrolled in high school and could not be enrolled solely in a GED or other high school completion program. The institution sampling frame for NPSAS:04 was constructed from the 2000-01 IPEDS Institutional Characteristics (IC) files. The institutions on the sampling frame were partitioned into 58 institutional strata based on institutional control, highest level of offering, and Carnegie classification. NPSAS:04 also includes state-representative undergraduate student samples for three types of institutions (public 4-year, public 2-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year) in 12 states. 1 Interested readers are referred to the forthcoming NPSAS:04 Methodology Report for a more detailed description of the sample designs, including a complete listing of the 58 strata and further details. Institutions were selected using Chromy's sequential probability minimum replacement (pmr) sampling algorithm (Chromy 1979), which is similar to systematic sampling, to select institutions with probabilities proportional to a composite measure of size based on expected enrollment. Initially a sample of about 1,600 institutions was selected in fall 2002 so that these institutions could be notified of their selection early and to allow a separate field test sample to be selected from the remaining institutions on the sampling frame. In summer 2003, a small sample of additional institutions was selected from a frame of institutions not included on the initial sampling frame. Of the final total 1,670 sample institutions, 810 were selected with certainty. 2 Of these 1,670 sample institutions, 1,630 were found to be NPSAS eligible institutions and 1,360 of these 1,630 institutions provided student enrollment lists for use as the second stage (i.e., student) sampling frame. Table C-1 shows the number of institutions sampled, the number of eligible institutions, and the count and unweighted and weighted percentages of institutions providing enrollment lists by institutional characteristics. The sampling frames for selecting sample students were paper and electronic lists of students provided by the sample institutions for those students enrolled in terms or courses of instruction during the previously defined NPSAS year. Student lists were sampled on a flow basis as they were received, using equal probability stratified systematic sampling. There were eight student sampling strata as follows: (1) in-state first-time beginner students; (2) out-of-state first-time beginner students; (3) in-state other undergraduate students; (4) out-of-state other undergraduate students; (5) master's students; (6) doctoral students; (7) other graduate students; and (8) first-professional students. 1 These 12 states were selected by NCES from those expressing interest. The 12 states were categorized into three groups based on population size: four small states (Connecticut, Delaware, Nebraska, Oregon), four medium-size states (Georgia, Indiana, Minnesota, Tennessee), and four large states (California, Illinois, New York, Texas). 2 Number of institutions have been rounded to 10's. 1 Institutional characteristics are based on data from the sampling frame which was formed from the 2000-01 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). 2 Among the ineligible institutions: 35 percent closed after the sampling frame was defined, 38 percent were treated as merged institutions because two or more campuses were included on one combined student list, and the remaining 27 percent failed to meet one or more of the criteria for institutional NPSAS eligibility. First-time beginner students (FTBs) were stratified separately from other undergraduate students because they were oversampled to allow for sufficient numbers to be surveyed in the 2006 follow-up study, the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06). FTBs and other undergraduate students were each divided into in-state and out-of-state strata because undergraduate in-state students were oversampled in the 12 states with staterepresentative samples. These in-state and out-of-state strata were used for all institutions to allow for sampling ease and consistency; however, in states that did not have state-representative samples, in-state students were sampled at the same rate as out-of-state students. For each student stratum, the enrollment list was sampled at a rate designed to provide approximately equal student-level probabilities. Student sampling rates were revised after sufficient lists had been received to more accurately estimate the overall sample yield. Those sampling procedures resulted in the selection of 109,200 students. Upon the completion of data collection, 90 percent of the 101,000 sample members determined to be eligible for NPSAS were determined to have sufficient key data to meet the definition of a respondent. A student respondent is defined as any sample member who is determined to be eligible for the study and, minimally, has valid data from any source for the following: \u2022 student type (undergraduate or graduate/first professional); \u2022 date of birth or age; \u2022 gender; and \u2022 at least 8 of the following 15 variables: \u2022 dependency status; \u2022 marital status; \u2022 any dependents; \u2022 income; \u2022 expected family contribution (EFC); \u2022 degree program; \u2022 class level; \u2022 first time beginner (FTB) status; \u2022 months enrolled; \u2022 tuition; \u2022 received federal aid; \u2022 received non-federal aid; \u2022 student budget; \u2022 race; and \u2022 parent education.

TAB as well as those included in the related Data Analysis System (DAS) release have been imputed. The imputation procedures employed a two-step process. In the first step, the matching criteria and imputation classes that were used to stratify the dataset were identified such that all imputation was processed independently within each class. In the second step, the weighted sequential hot deck process was implemented, 3 whereby missing data were replaced with valid data from donor records that match the recipients with respect to the matching criteria. Variables requiring imputation were not imputed simultaneously. Basic demographic variables with full information were imputed first. Then, variables with increasing levels of missing data were imputed using previously imputed variables in the determination of optimal matching criteria. The order in which variables were imputed was also determined to some extent by the substantive nature of the variables. For example, basic demographics (such as age) were imputed first and these were used to process education variables (such as student level and enrollment intensity) which in turn were used to impute the financial aid variables (such as aid receipt and loan amounts). For variables with less than 5 percent missing data, the variables used for matching criteria were selected based on prior knowledge about the dataset and the known relationships between variables. For example, in almost all cases the student's age and enrollment intensity (fulltime/part-time status) were used as matching variables in the imputation process. For variables with more than 5 percent missing data, a process called Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) was used to identify the matching criteria that are most closely related to the variable being imputed (Kass 1980). This step produced a number of imputation classes that contain sets of donors that were used to impute recipients belonging to that class. Next, the imputation classes were used as input to a SAS macro that implemented the weighted sequential hot deck procedure. Additionally, data were sorted within each imputation class to increase the chance of obtaining a close match between donor and recipient. The hot deck process is sequential in that the search for donors occurs sequentially, starting with the recipient and progressing up and down the sorted file to find the set of eligible donors from which a random selection of one was made. The process is weighted since it incorporates the sample weight of each record in the search and selection routine. 4 In some cases, further intervention was needed to ensure accuracy and consistency of imputation as determined by preexisting edit rules. For example, to impute the level of parents' education, when we know the parents have some college but not the parents' specific education level, the potential pool of donors was limited to those with at least some college education, to prevent imputing parents' education level as less than college."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "All estimates in this E.D.

As shown in table C-1, 1,360 of the 1,630 eligible sample institutions were respondents (83.5 unweighted percent and 80.0 weighted percent). The institution weighted response rate is also below 85 percent for six of the nine types of institutions. The weighted response rates by type of institution range from 70.3 percent for public 4-year nondoctorate institutions to 92.6 percent for private not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for all institutions and for the six types of institutions with a weighted response rate below 85 percent (U.S. Department of Education 2003). The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known, i.e., non-missing, for most respondents and nonrespondents. There are extensive data available for all institutions from IPEDS, and the following variables were used: 6 \u2022 type of institution; 7 \u2022 Carnegie classification; \u2022 degree of urbanization; \u2022 OBE region; \u2022 historically Black College or University indicator; \u2022 percent of students receiving federal grant aid; \u2022 percent of students receiving state/local grant aid; \u2022 percent of students receiving institutional grant aid; \u2022 percent of students receiving student loan aid; \u2022 percent of students enrolled: Hispanic; \u2022 percent of students enrolled: Asian or Pacific Islander; \u2022 percent of students enrolled: Black, non-Hispanic; \u2022 total undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 male undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 female undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 total graduate/first-professional enrollment; \u2022 male graduate/first-professional enrollment; and \u2022 female graduate/first-professional enrollment. First, for the institution-level variables listed above, the nonresponse bias was estimated and tested (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level. Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed, and the variables listed above were included in the nonresponse models. The nonresponse adjustments (see the weighting section of this appendix) were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for variables included in the models. Third, after the weights were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias. As shown in table C-4, the institution weighting adjustments eliminated some, but not all, bias. However, for all institutions, public less-than-2-year institutions, and public 2-year institutions, before weighting 5.6 percent, 6.3 percent, and 6.8 percent, respectively, of the variable categories were significantly biased, and after weighting, no significant bias remains for the variables analyzed. For the other types of institutions, the percentage of variable categories with significant bias decreased after weight adjustments. Significant bias was reduced for the variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, which are considered to be some of the more analytically important variables and are correlated with many of the other variables. "}, {"section_title": "Student-Level Bias Analysis", "text": "As mentioned in the sample design section above, a student respondent is defined as any sample member who is determined to be eligible for the study and has valid data from any source for a selected set of key analytical variables. These are minimal data requirements and the vast majority of study respondents were characterized by considerably more complete data. As shown in table C-2, of the 101,000 eligible sample students the unweighted response rate was 89.8 percent, and the weighted response rate was 91.0 percent. The student weighted response rate is also above 85 percent for all types of institutions with the exception of public 2year institutions. The weighted response rates by type of institution range from 83.9 percent for public 2-year institutions to 96.9 percent for private not-for-profit 4-year nondoctoral institutions. Therefore, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted only for students from public 2-year institutions. The nonresponse bias was estimated for the seven variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents. Five of these variables were known for all sample members, and the remaining two variables were only known for federally aided students. These variables are included on the DAS and are listed below: For all sample members: \u2022 institution total enrollment; \u2022 CPS match (yes/no); \u2022 Federal Pell Grant recipient (yes/no); and \u2022 Stafford loan recipient (yes/no). For federally aided students: \u2022 Federal Pell Grant amount; and \u2022 Stafford loan amount. Additionally, it was determined that percent part-time fall enrollment and in-state tuition are important variables to include in the nonresponse bias analysis for students in public 2-year institutions. These variables are not known for both respondents and nonrespondents; however, institution-level data available from IPEDS were used to conduct the analyses. The steps listed above for institution nonresponse bias analysis are also applicable for the student nonresponse bias analysis. That is, the nonresponse bias was estimated for the above variables, tested (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level, and nonresponse adjustments were computed including the above variables in the nonresponse models. Any remaining bias was estimated for these variables and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias. As shown in table C-5, the student weighting adjustments eliminated some, but not all, bias for students in public 2-year institutions. Significant bias was reduced somewhat for the variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, which are considered to be some of the more analytically important variables and are correlated with many of the other variables. However, significant bias still remains because there were small numbers of nonrespondents in this type of institution applying for and receiving federal aid. This may be due to the definition of a respondent. All significant bias was eliminated for the non-aid variables, i.e., region, institution total enrollment, percent part-time fall enrollment, and in-state tuition. 8 In summary, Table C-5 demonstrates that weighting adjustments have reduced the overall level of nonresponse bias, but that bias remains even after adjusting weights. The percentage of all variable categories considered with significant nonresponse bias decreased from 35.4 percent before weighting adjustments to 29.2 percent after weighting adjustments. Although there was considerable reduction in bias due to weighting adjustments, nonresponse bias remains in nearly 30 percent of the variables after weighting adjustments.

As shown in table C-6, for the responding students, the weighted item response rates for items used in this E.D. TAB for all students ranged from 68.5 percent to 100 percent. The item response rates by type of institution ranged from 47.6 percent to 100 percent. All of the items, except for other grants, dependent student income, and independent student income, had response rates of 85 percent or above, both overall and by type of institution. For each of these three items, the overall response rates are below 85 percent. For other grants, the response rate is below 85 percent for each type of institution. For dependent student income, the response rate is below 85 percent for three of nine types of institution. For independent student income, the response rate is below 85 percent for six of the nine types of institution. Therefore, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for other grants, dependent student income, and independent student income. The variables listed above in the student-level bias analysis section were used to compare the item respondents and nonrespondents. These variables are important to the study and will be related to many of the items being analyzed for low item response rates. For these items, the nonresponse bias was estimated as described in the above section for each of these variables known for both respondents and nonrespondents and tested (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias is significant at the 5 percent level.  Table C-7 shows that other grants, dependent student income, and independent student income have a large amount of significant bias prior to imputation. For all students, the mean estimated relative bias ranges from 0.09 to 0.11, the median ranges from 0.03 to 0.05, and the percentage of all variable categories with significant bias ranges from 47.3 to 50 percent. Results are also presented for nine institutional sectors. The three statistics vary considerably. For example, the percentage of categories with significant bias ranges from a low of 2.6 percent to a high of 42.2 percent. A byproduct of the imputation (described in the imputation section of this appendix) is the reduction or elimination of item-level nonresponse bias. Imputation reduces or eliminates nonresponse bias by replacing missing data with statistically plausible values. Missing data and the associated nonresponse bias for variables such as other grants, dependent student income, and independent student income are usually non-ignorable (i.e., the respondents' distribution patterns differ from those in the full population). Therefore, replacing missing data with reasonable values produces imputed sample distributions that resemble full population distributions, thus reducing if not eliminating nonresponse bias. The use of carefully constructed imputation classes, donor-imputee matching criteria, and random hot-deck searches within imputation cells are all designed to ensure that imputed data are in fact plausible and that the nonresponse bias is ignorable within the imputation classes.

Once the replicate weights are provided, this estimate can be produced by most survey software packages (e.g., SUDAAN [RTI 2004]). The replicate weights were produced using a methodology and computer software developed by Kaufman (2004). This methodology allows for finite population correction factors at two stages of sampling. The NPSAS application of the method incorporated the finite population correction factor at the first stage only where sampling fractions were generally high. At the second stage, where the sampling fraction was generally low, the finite population correction factor was set to 1.00."}, {"section_title": "Cautions for Analysts", "text": "Multiple institutions.

Nonsampling errors are due to a number of sources, including but not limited to, nonresponse, coding and data entry errors, misspecification of composite variables, and inaccurate imputations. In a study like NPSAS there are multiple sources of data for some variables (CPS, CADE, Student Interview, etc.) and reporting differences can occur in each. Data swapping and other forms of perturbation, implemented in order to protect respondent confidentiality, can lead to inconsistencies as well. Sampling errors exist in all sample-based datasets, including NPSAS. Estimates calculated from a sample will differ from estimates calculated from other samples even if all the samples used the same sample design and methods. For similar reasons, estimates of average aid amounts based on the NPSAS sample will probably differ from specific program amounts reported by the department's program offices. The standard error (described earlier) is a measure of the precision of the estimate. In this tabulation, each estimate's standard error was calculated using bootstrap replication procedures and can be produced using the NPSAS:04 Data Analysis System (DAS) software . Standard  errors for table 1 are presented in table C -8. 9 All differences reported in the selected findings were significant at the 0.05 level."}, {"section_title": "Comparing NPSAS:04 Estimates to Prior NPSAS Estimates", "text": "Comparison of results with prior rounds of NPSAS requires compensation for three changes in the design of the survey over time. For NPSAS:2000, the survey was restricted for the first time to institutions participating in Title IV student aid programs. According to the Data Analysis System for NPSAS:96, only about 1 percent of the sampled undergraduates were attending an institution not eligible to participate in the Department's Title IV aid programs. When students attending non-Title IV-eligible institutions were excluded from the NPSAS:96 sample, the percentage of undergraduates who received financial aid increased by less than 0.3 percent. This small change primarily affects comparisons of students enrolled in less-than-2-year and private for-profit institutions. When using the DAS from prior NPSAS studies for comparisons to NPSAS:2000 and NPSAS:04, analysts may want to filter cases in the prior studies (e.g., NPSAS:96 or NPSAS:93) based on the variable that identifies whether the student was sampled from an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs (T4ELIG). Another design change was made beginning with NPSAS:90 to improve full-year estimates. NPSAS:87 sampled students enrolled in the fall (October). However, NPSAS:90 sampled students who were enrolled at four discrete points in time: summer (August), fall (October), winter (February), and spring (June). Since implementation of NPSAS in 1993, institutions have been asked to provide one list that represented students enrolled at any time during the respective financial aid award year. In NPSAS:87 and NPSAS:90, those students who were initially sampled in the fall could have been enrolled for the full academic year. Another difference to note is that Puerto Rico was not part of the sample in NPSAS:87. The final restricted data files and the NPSAS DAS software will allow users to produce estimates comparable to 1987 by selecting only students who were enrolled in the fall and excluding those sampled from Puerto Rico (see the variable description for COMPTO87 in the DAS). These estimates will reflect full-year amounts of aid for students who were enrolled in the fall. Such estimates, however, will not reflect total expenditures as reported by the Department's specific Title IV program offices. This difference will be explained more fully in the forthcoming methodology report. Table C-8.-Standard errors for table 1: Average tuition and fees, average total price of attendance, and  Table B-8.-percentage of undergraduates receiving any aid, any grants, or any student loans and average  Table B The estimates for average aid amounts in this E.D. TAB are only for aid recipients who received the specified type of aid. Average aid amounts for specific groups where most students do not receive aid are not reflective of the amount of support received overall, and the type of support (e.g., whether it is grants, subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, work-study, or some combination) is likely to differ. NCES recommends that readers not try to produce their own estimates such as the percentage of all students receiving aid or the numbers of undergraduates enrolled in the fall who received any aid, federal aid, state aid, etc., by combining estimates in this tabulation with the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) fall 2003 enrollment numbers. The IPEDS enrollment data include some students not eligible for NPSAS (e.g., those enrolled in U.S. Service Academies, those taking college courses while enrolled in high school). Additional information on the NPSAS:04 sample is presented in the sample design section of this appendix and will also be described in the forthcoming methodology report."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this E.D. TAB were produced using the NPSAS:04 Data Analysis System (DAS). The DAS software makes it possible for users to specify and generate their own tables. The DAS also contains a detailed description of how each variable was created, and includes question wording for items coming directly from an interview. With the DAS, users can replicate or expand upon the tables presented in this E.D. TAB. In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates the proper standard errors 10 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table C-8 contains standard errors that correspond to estimates in table 1 in this E.D. TAB. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce a reliable estimate (fewer than 30 cases), the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. All standard errors for estimates presented in this E.D. TAB can be viewed at http://nces.ed.gov/das/library/tables_listings/2005163.asp. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Included in the output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFTs) for each variable in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the stratified sampling method used in the NPSAS surveys. The DAS can be accessed electronically at http://nces.ed.gov/DAS. For more information about the Data Analysis System, contact: 10 The NPSAS samples are not simple random samples, and therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedures and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by replication of the sampled population. The procedure used is a bootstrap technique. se E E t + + \u2212 = . (3) The estimates and standard errors are obtained from the DAS. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used: where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 13 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error, denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 selected for findings in this E.D. TAB indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced no more than one time out of twenty when there was no actual difference in the quantities in the underlying population. When we test hypotheses that show t values at the .05 level or smaller, we treat this finding as rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities. However, there are other cases when exercising additional caution is warranted. When there are significant results not indicated by any hypothesis being tested or when we test a large number of comparisons in a table, Type I errors cannot be ignored. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When the either of the two situations described in the previous paragraph was encountered in this E.D. TAB, comparisons were made when p < .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p < .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p < .05. 14 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who attend public institutions, only one comparison is possible (males vs. females). In this family, k=1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When respondents are divided into three income groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k=3 and the significance level of each test must be p < .05/3, or p < .017. The formula for calculating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. There were a few instances when apparent differences between income or need levels were significant when k=1, but not when k=3. These comparisons are stated in the text and the significance level is footnoted."}]
