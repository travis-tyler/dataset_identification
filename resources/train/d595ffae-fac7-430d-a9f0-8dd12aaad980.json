[{"section_title": "", "text": "an open access to code in order to harness the power of the Internet and make research efficient on a worldwide scale.\nA sobering thought is that, in spite of all of this knowledge, at the outset, all one can do is enlist the key questions that emerge and quickly report early but key findings (Callaway and Cyranoski 2020, Fauci et al. 2020 , Huang et al. 2020b , Munster et al. 2020 ).\nAn epidemic, or even pandemic, of a different nature was the HIV-induced AIDS epidemic Gail 1994, Castillo-Chavez 2013) . Confronted with a lethal viral infection that affected predominantly younger people and hence led to a considerable number of life years lost, a massive response ensued, with large academic and collaborative AIDS research groups formed around the globe, predominantly in the United States (e.g., the AIDS Clinical Trials Group). It led to the acceptance of placebo controlled trials with frequent interim analyses overseen by an Independent Committee (Broder 2010) . Also, coerced by the \"fourth player\" (i.e., the patients and their advocacy groups, next to the three other players: regulators, industry, academia), co-enrolment in several trials simultaneously was grudgingly accepted, but arguably led to the development of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART; Castillo-Chavez 2013).\nUndoubtedly, it dynamized the clinical research community and arguably paved the way for dynamic treatment regimes and a new emphasis on personalized medicine. It is evident that any deviation from standard practice poses methodological challenges that may be partially addressed during a crisis. A WWII example thereof is Wald\"s development of the sequential trial framework: there simply was no time for the established rigorous but slow industrial quality control processes (Wald 1945) . The new paradigm proposed by Wald led to further developments that continue to influence clinical research today (Todd 2007) .\nThe current pandemic, just like the earlier ones, shows the need to trust the good faith of experts, and the good intentions of health professionals, rather than build onerous and time-consuming systems that are premised on the possibility of fraud and misbehavior. It is instructive to point out that the position of science and scientists was questioned in 1918 as well as today. Some referred to a \"totalitarian system of science\" (Spinney 2017) . It is natural that the position of biomedical science and its biostatistics and epidemiological counterparts is debated because seldom are they so prominently present in the public debate. To understand this, note that an epidemic is somewhat archaically referred to as a \"crowd disease\" (Greenwood 1935) . It is natural to consult a physician for an ailment and, the more severe the condition, the more a patient is willing to accept side effects, as long as there is a sufficiently strong therapeutic effect. In fact, this is not different in a crowd disease. In the absence of PIs, the NPIs are society\"s only therapeutic class. Prescription, dosing, and monitoring of side effects then becomes a societal responsibility, where expert advice is blended with policymaking by mandated politicians, and with input from advocacy groups."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiological Background", "text": "The biomedical and public health community, as well as the world population, have quickly been learning crucial lessons about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. To date, several aspects, though, remain uncertain or simply unknown.\nIt is useful to briefly review some basic concepts of infectious disease modelling. While more complex models for COVID-19 are undoubtedly more appropriate to account for heterogeneity related to gender and age (in relation to social contact behavior, acquisition of infection, infectivity per average person, symptomatology of infected individuals and corresponding risks of hospitalization as well as subsequent mortality risks), spatial heterogeneity, and/or variation in risks due to societal position, the so-called basic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) compartmental model provides a reasonable starting point (see, e.g., Hens et al. 2012) . Although simplistic in the face of the current epidemic, the SIR model does contain the essential ingredients. have developed a much more elaborate model, i.e., an age-structured, stochastic model, tailored to the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the subsequent human response upon contracting the disease, both at the level of the symptomatology as well as in terms of humoral immunity responses within hosts. In the basic SIR model, at any time 0 t \uf0b3 , the population is divided into three fractions or compartments: () St represents the susceptible fraction, () It is the infected (and infectious) fraction, and () Rt is the recovered fraction (immune survivors and potentially deaths). The initial states are (0) S , (0) I , and (0) R . Flows of individuals between these states can be described using (ordinary) differential equations. The model is further influenced by two critical numbers: the recovery rate k , and the basic reproduction number 0 R . While 0 R is an implicit model parameter, the force of infection,\ni.e., the instantaneous rate at which susceptible individuals become infected, determines the basic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof and time-varying effective reproduction numbers, together with the recovery rate, through the so-called next generation matrix, providing information about the next generation of infected individuals resulting from a single typical infected individual.\nThis basic model is rigid in that it assumes homogeneous (random) mixing within the population, and requires the population to be a closed system. In reality, as in Abrams\" model, a population consists of various subgroups, or silos, with different behaviors (such as different levels of social contacts), and borders in a country like Belgium are merely administrative lines between neighboring countries. Also, the three-fraction system is often too simple. For SARS-CoV-2, we need to add an exposed state in which exposed individuals are not yet infectious while viral load is gradually building up, a pre-symptomatic compartment in which individuals are able to infect others even though they do no have symptoms yet, and compartments including asymptomatic individuals and individuals with mild symptoms, severely ill, hospitalized, and intensive care unit (ICU) admitted persons. Recovery and death are ideally kept separate as well. Such an elaborate model is essential if it is to be used against the background of the hospital capacity available, and to gauge the death toll.\nConsider now the reproduction number 0 R , defined as the average number of susceptible individuals infected by a single typical infected individual during his/her entire infectious period, at least in a fully susceptible population. There is a whole world \"not\" captured by a single 0 R value. First, it may depend on the initial population characteristics (age distribution, geographical spread, etc.). Second, as time evolves and () St depletes, the effective reproduction number e R is more relevant. The basic reproduction number as a measure of transmissibility of a pathogen is very different for seasonal influenza, where it is usually around 1.5, as compared to  where it is estimated around 2.5 without medication or vaccines, and without NPIs. For an overview of COVID-19 related 0 R estimates, see . An early estimate for COVID-19, based on the Wuhan outbreak, can be found in ) it picks up until immunity is sufficiently widespread or the susceptible reservoir is uncertainty surrounding the nature and extent of immunity is considerable, because humoral immunity seems to wane over time and the role of T-cell immunity is yet to be studied in more detail.\nAt the onset of the Wuhan outbreak, there was considerable uncertainty regarding key epidemiological parameters, in particular 0 R , but also the associated (case and infection) fatality rate. We now know that both 0 R and the infection fatality rate (IFR) are relatively high, the latter being highly variable with age. influence on disease dynamics (e.g., superspreading events). The infectiousness is strongly person-dependent (cf. the so-called superspreaders) and here secondary transmission via the airborne route is key, i.e., via aerosols .\nA key population characteristic is the contact rate, i.e., the frequency and intensity of physical social contacts between population members. The number and intensity of social contacts is not a constant. There are group-and individual-specific aspects to the contact rate and, importantly, it can be modified. During the time frame without PIs, modifying the contact rate and intensity (briefly or for a very extended period of time) is essentially the only option available.\nFor a variety of reasons, describing and predicting a real-life epidemic curve may be very difficult. As the pandemic has been unfolding, the country and state specific epidemic curves take about any possible non-linear shape (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states), underlining the importance and extent of heterogeneity in infectious disease dynamics."}, {"section_title": "The Non-pharmaceutical Intervention Period", "text": "Let us turn to the three possible strategies to modify the aforementioned contact rate, because when the house is on fire, and neither medicinal products nor vaccines are yet available, NPIs are all that one has got.\nThe first strategy is suppression. It essentially means that the reproduction number is forced below one by imposing severe contact restrictions at the population level, as was done in China is in this situation, and will be until vaccines and medication are available. Cheap, widespread, sensitive and specific diagnostic tools help maintain control, potentially supported by electronic means such as smartphone apps, as well as contact tracing and isolation (Hellewell et al. 2020 ). Needless to say, international travel in and out of susceptible regions is and remains problematic.\nSuppression is only possible when the viral spread is radically suppressed at an early stage, however, SARS-CoV-2 has stealth characteristics. Its incubation period is relatively long, with a very infectious period near the end of the incubation period (Jiang, Rayner, and Luo 2020) . To aggravate matters, there is a large fraction of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic but infectious cases (possibly 40-50%, although estimates vary widely and could be even higher). These characteristics, combined with a high reproduction number, make the epidemic resemble a bush fire: one match is sufficient to ignite it, after which the fire starts to spread at ground level, invisible to the naked eye until it suddenly evolves in an all-out fire. For this reason, in Europe, suppression was not a viable option after the initial outbreak in Northern Italy.\nThe second strategy is mitigation (The Lancet Respiratory Medicine 2020). This was practiced by about all European countries during their first wave, to more (Italy, Spain) or lesser (Sweden) degrees. Here, measures are taken to bring the reproduction number down, such as reducing the number and nature of social contacts to a pre-specified level, so that the epidemic is slowed sufficiently and the number of critically ill cases at any time can be handled by the health care system. The difference between suppression and mitigation is that the latter aims to build up herd immunity, in such a way that the health care system is able to cope. It can be supplemented by a temporary capacity increase of the system (e.g., field hospitals, annexes to existing hospitals).\nThe third strategy, or perhaps absence thereof, is counting solely on herd immunity (Peeples 2019) . Generally, it will typically produce a shorter epidemic than with mitigation, and afterwards the population will be immune at population level. That is, the fraction of recovered people (immune for a certain time, e.g., the rest of the season) will be large enough, i.e. above the critical threshold, so that the re-emerging virus will not find enough susceptible population members to push the reproduction number above one, and the epidemic will soon decrease and become seasonal (where transmission is typically increased during winter months, as it is for influenza virus and other, more benign, betacoronaviruses, such as hCoV-OC43).\nIt was anticipated, early March 2020, that mitigation in a country or region would lead to a population with roughly 30% of recovered, hence immune, members, whereas herd immunity could lead to 60-70% immunity, at least in the absence of clusters (Britton et al. 2020 ). The latter is sufficient to prevent further outbreaks, or to ensure that they would be short-lived. That is, provided that immunity is sufficiently strong and sufficiently long-lasting. Unfortunately, none of this has played out as anticipated. Sero-prevalence has been building up depressingly slowly . In Belgium, sero-prevalence was estimated at roughly 3% by the end of March, 6% mid-April, 7% mid-May, and back down to 6% and 5% in early June and July, respectively. This points to waning of IgG antibodies, after their discovery has been ridden between a long delay in onset of detectability (Borremans et al. 2020 ) and relatively poor sensitivity. At the time of writing, this suggests that other aspects of immunity, such as T-cell immunity, need to be scrutinized (Altmann and Boyton 2020)\nA key limitation to herd immunity strategies is the high fraction of critically ill patients, leading to overburdening of the health care system, and the high IFR ). In the Belgian non-nursing home population, the IFR is about 0.4%, but this figure masks the strong age gradient, with an IFR close to 0% in the population under 25, but rising to 2.5% in the 85+ population outside of nursing homes, and to 35% for the 85+ in nursing homes. Not surprisingly, the death toll in nursing homes is very large (two thirds of the nearly 10,000 COVID-19 related (with a coping health care system) and 250,000 (for a strongly overwhelmed health care system).\nHow to proceed with the mitigation strategy when the peaks in the relevant curves lie in the past? Given the large reproduction number (super-spreading virus combined with a long infectious period), relaxation of NPIs needs to be done with utmost care. Re-emergence of the epidemic is likely as the virus will have built up reservoirs already. Reservoirs take the form of animal species that harbor the virus during time periods when there is no human epidemic (e.g., geese and pigs in the case of influenza). Changing tactic and opting for herd immunity is extremely difficult because it would undo the effects of NPIs, including the hardships they will have induced. It is only a viable strategy if supplemented with sufficiently promising PIs (antiviral medication and vaccines).\nWhile pharmaceutical breakthroughs are happening at an unprecedented speed, it is unrealistic to expect major relief from this end in less than a year. It is more realistic to move towards suppression, or a combination of mitigation and suppression when the epidemic is sufficiently under control, i.e., when the number of new infections falls below a certain level. At that point, contact tracing and quarantine measures, needed for suppression, become a viable strategy, supported by increased reliability and capacity of diagnostic testing, the use of electronic tracing (e.g., based on apps) in addition to human tracing (by infectiologists and health inspectors). A final but extremely important aspect is whether or not contact between populations will be possible in periods when there are no peaks or outbreaks. The answer is that this could well be detrimental.\nNot only is travel itself a risk factor, as is clear from the early introductions around the globe, but contact between populations in different epidemic stages is complex. China\"s cautious protection of its borders after its initial peak, as well as Europe\"s initially prudent but now complex international travel situation, even within the Schengen zone of the European Union, are cases in point.\nInevitably, new outbreaks will keep emerging until immunity is sufficiently widespread or adequate vaccines are available. Antivirals will not stop this but may prove important in turning mitigation strategies into a success . Note that this provides an interesting link between NPIs and PIs, between mathematical modeling and the outcome of successful clinical trials.\nThe seasonality of COVID-19 (and its successors in subsequent years, i.e., etc.) is poorly understood at this point, although Kissler et al. (2020) provide useful predictions, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof based on knowledge from coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. Corona virus-induced diseases (typically but not exclusively, common cold) are seasonal, but less so than, for example, influenza. Kissler et al. (2020) report that outbreaks are possible at any time of year, with more acute outbreaks in autumn and winter. Depending on the extent of (non-permanent) immunity, either annual or biennial outbreaks are more likely. Other scenarios would be possible if immunity is lifelong (i.e., outbreaks in cycles of 5 years or more). Also, cross-immunity with other betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 will play an important role in temporal SARS-CoV-2 dynamics."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Modeling and Monitoring the Epidemic 3.1 Modeling Jewell (2020) underscores the importance of high-quality mathematical and statistical models for epidemics. Using such models, key epidemiological quantities are estimated: numbers of infected cases, hospitalizations, people in ICU, and deaths. Some models also permit short-term, medium-range, and long-term predictions, and allow to examine how such quantities change with changing human behavior and measures taken, such as social distancing, face masks, hygiene and, eventually, vaccination programs.\nIt is useful to cast predictions according to a variety of scenarios, to inform policy makers, other scientists, and the public opinion. Each model has its strengths and pitfalls, and simultaneously considering various models strengthens prediction. Some models operate at macro level (e.g., to study the number of cases in the population of an entire country), while others operate regionally or locally. Models are informed by data, mathematical infectious disease theory, and assumptions. Each model provides a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, and it requires a good amount of expertise and skills in infectious disease modeling to lay the entire puzzle.\nModel uncertainty and sensitivity analysis must accompany every modeling effort.\nModels, no matter how refined, will never be able to capture every detail of human behavior. In fact, there are striking examples of models that were poorly predictive because they ignored behavioral aspects, such as the need for college students to gather and party (Chang 2020). Also, important epidemiological quantities, such as the ones referred to earlier, are (typically) fully unknown at the onset of a pandemic. Over the first half year of the crisis, several quantities have been estimated with increasing precision, though sometimes with hiccoughs (e.g., the length of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof pre-symptomatic period). Others, such as seasonality, remain hazy. The determination of immunity has been a roller coaster of progressing insight (see Section 5).\nIn a growth model, such as a logistic (Verhulst 1838) or Richards model (Richards 1959) , hospital admissions, number of tests, etc. are used to compute how the spread of the virus evolves over time. This approach lends itself naturally to estimating how the growth factor of the epidemic changes according to measures taken, or under the influence of a changing testing strategy.\nTransmission trees aim at mapping the chain of infections among people (Held et al. 2020) .\nOne examines the genetic similarity of the virus among people or one makes use of contact tracing.\nFor COVID-19, contact tracing was applied at the onset of the epidemic to find out in which region a person could have been infected. As the epidemic in March 2020 gained strength and the number of infected people increased, contact tracing was no longer feasible in Belgium. However, it is considered a vital component of a suppression strategy for second and later waves. Transmission trees are helpful to estimate key characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, such as the basic and effective reproduction number, and the generation interval, i.e., the time lapse in a so-called infector-infectee pair, the serial interval, i.e., the time between symptom onset in the infector and in the infectee, and the incubation period. Based on COVID-19 data from China and Singapore, Ganyani et al. (2020) were able to show that 0 R is larger when estimated from the generation interval as compared to the serial interval, pointing for the first time to pre-symptomatic infections, its associated risks, and implications for an exit strategy (Colletti et al. 2020) . See also Nishiura, Linton, and Akhmetzhanov (2020) .\nA meta-population model is a robust, large-scale model, that allows to incorporate people\"s mobility. It divides the population into groups based on age category, residence, etc. Each of these groups follow an underlying mathematical model for the spread of the epidemic. Such a model assigns people to the various compartments (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered). By mimicking interaction between such groups according to various scenarios (e.g., little or a lot of contacts with people outside the household, little or more mobility between towns, etc.), it is possible to predict how the number of infected people changes over time, in the short run as well as terms of (1) describing the spread of the disease, and (2) examining the consequences of relaxing the measures taken, i.e., candidate exit strategies. In such a model, each individual is assigned to a family, a school category, type of workplace environment, and the population at large. This assignment is guided by data available from school registries as well as employment data. The model mimics behavior of individuals on a day-by-day basis. It accounts for changes in behavior on weekend days relative to weekdays, during holiday periods and, importantly, also as a result of measures taken, such as school closure and reduced social contacts. When investigating the consequences of exit strategies (e.g., reopening of schools and certain workplaces), the team also examines the added value of household bubbles (i.e., a combination of members from multiple households, matched to have a similar structure in terms of age, composition, etc.), allowing repeated contacts within bubbles and lensuring a reduction in community-level mixing, and contact tracing to monitor and avoid new infections.\nAlthough simple deterministic compartmental models, such as the basic SIR model introduced previously, have been used in the initial phase of the pandemic, making an abstraction of some of the important properties of both the pathogen as well as the infected host, an additional layer of complexity is of utmost importance to incorporate in order to adequately describe the dynamics of COVID-19 and to make reliable predictions of the future course of the epidemic. As more and more evidence has been accumulating throughout the progression of the pandemic, it became clear that age-specific differences exist in susceptibility to infection, infectiousness upon infection, probability of being symptomatic and disease severity, thereby leading to large differences in hospitalization and mortality risks upon contracting SARS-CoV-2. Research groups with ample of experience in infectious disease modeling were well equipped to expand and refine existing models for disease spread to account for such complexities. In retrospect, when a number of predictions have been cast, under a variety of scenarios, at most one of these will come close to what actually happened, at least for the country or region for which it was intended. But, in a pandemic, countries and regions around the globe, with varying characteristics, all exhibit their own curves. For example, the Southern and Western states in the US exhibit a very different curve than the Northeastern states (cf."}, {"section_title": "Nowcasting and Early Warning", "text": "Modeling the event history of COVID-19 is important for public health policy, especially towards critically ill patients . Event history analysis includes studying the timing (or delay) between different events: infection, symptom onset, confirmed case, hospitalization, recovery and death. First, due to the incubation period and the delay of reporting and/or hospitalization, the impact of intervention measures is only observed after several days. For example, if the sum of the incubation period and delay of reporting is 10 days, then we expect to see an impact of the interventions on the number of confirmed cases after 10 days. However, as the delay time varies from individual to individual, the effect of the intervention is spread over several days. The delay distribution of the incubation period (Reich et al. 2009; Linton et al. 2020) and the time between symptom onset and hospital admission (Vekaria et al. 2020 ) is therefore crucial, as is understanding the heterogeneity in the delay times amongst individuals.\nGood knowledge of such delay distributions allows one to back-calculate the number of newly (symptomatic) infected cases, known as nowcasting, from either the number of confirmed cases or hospitalized cases, and assess the impact of intervention measures.\nSecond, the length of stay in hospital is important, which varies amongst individuals and amongst countries due to different health systems. Information about the length of stay in hospital is important to predict the number of required hospital beds, both for beds in general hospital and beds in the ICU, and to track the burden on hospitals (Vekaria et al. 2020) . Individual-specific characteristics, such as, for example, sex, age, comorbidity, and frailty of the individual, can explain differences in length of stay in the hospital and are therefore important to correct for. The estimation of the length of stay is complicated by the truncated and interval-censored nature of the data collected during the unfolding epidemic .\nThird, the time delay from infection and illness onset to death is important for the estimation of the case fatality ratio (Donnelly et al. 2003) . A na\u00efve case fatality ratio based on the proportion of reported deaths to reported cases during an outbreak is generally biased upwards, due to both the delay between case and death incidence and underreporting of cases. An early warning system to monitor COVID-19 trends and forecast increases of the hospital burden are essential in times of a pandemic (Kogan et al. 2020) . Multiple data streams are used as predictors of increases at the national and provincial level in Belgium. The mobility of individuals (tracked via mobile phone data), absenteeism at work, the number of patients with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof respiratory diseases visiting their general practitioner and the proportion of positive tested cases are important predictors for the immediately following two-week period ).\nThis is especially relevant at crucial times during an epidemic with multiple waves.\nNowcasting is essential at the onset of the epidemic and when the curve begins to flatten and a peak is reached. It is also relevant when the rate of decrease slows, an often missed signal. While a decreasing curve is qualitatively a favorable evolution, it is important to constantly monitor the rate of decrease: if the decrease slows down while the curve is still at a relatively high level, it might be an early sign that it might eventually stop and then, unfortunately, start to increase again."}, {"section_title": "Mortality Reporting", "text": "Mortality among COVID-19 patients is relatively high when measured by IFRs (Zylke and Bauchner 2020, Molenberghs et al. (2020) . The overall IFR is estimated around 0.6% in many countires, but is very strongly age dependent, and the risk is higher for males than for females. This was clear even from early reports .\nIn a pandemic like the current one, it is not uncommon to have ( Something that has become saliently clear is the very steep IFR curve as a function of age (Molenberghs et al. 2020, Khafaie and Rahim 2020) . This, combined with the superspreading context that nursing homes provide has led, in many countries, to a huge death toll in such settings (Declercq et al. 2020) , which has in turn triggered dedicated epidemiological research."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence Determination and Other Surveys", "text": "Unlike testing and tracing, which is aimed at finding as many new cases as possible, prevalence determination is aimed at reliably estimating what fraction of the population is recovered and hopefully immune. Apart from the viral and immunological issues related to prevalence determination, it should be done based on representative samples. Hence, sample survey methods can be used, although often alternative methods are used. Prevalence determination is important to gauge IFRs and to assess whether or not herd immunity is building up."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence Determination", "text": "An obvious way of prevalence determination is by means of the sero-prevalence, based on the detection of antibodies in blood serum samples. Herzog et al. (2020) proceeded via a nationwide cross-sectional survey of residual blood samples tested for the presence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This method, as we know now, is ridden with a number of issues, such as time to IgG seroconversion, detectability, and waning (Borremans et al. 2020 , Grzelak et al. 2020 , and Huang et al. 2020a . In Belgium, sero-prevalence around April 1, 2020, was around 3%, three weeks later it was 6%, rose to nearly 7% mid-May, and then started to drop to 5.5% (around June 10) and even 4.5% around July 1. In other words, as mentioned in the literature (Long et al. 2020) , waning of IgG antibody concentrations is also observed in this sero-epidemiological study, and the primary route for immunity may not be these antibodies but rather T-cell mediated immunity or other antibodies not measured so far. As a consequence, IFR determination and the status of a population\"s immunity are referred back to the drawing board and the interpretation of (serial) sero-prevalence studies have to be reconsidered. Evidently, the decrease in seroprevalence implies that the status but also extent of immunity may be very different when based on T-cell mediated and humoral immunity responses. Also, cross-immunity with endemic coronaviruses, especially beta-coronaviruses such as hCoV-OC43, is a relevant J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof study subject, but one about which there is little or no knowledge available (Kissler et al. 2020) .\nNote that different survey sampling methods and different sub-populations considered (e.g., blood donors, or people spontaneously reporting at hospitals) may well yield different estimates. Apart from immunological issues with prevalence determination, the quality of the representative sampling method used influences the reliability of the findings."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Public Opinion Surveys", "text": "It is important to keep the finger on the pulse of the public opinion, for various reasons.\nWell-conducted surveys are vital to get a feel for how the population perceives risk, the impact of measures taken, acceptance and compliance to NPIs, etc. At the same time, it can be a component of an early warning system (Section 3.2) if the occurrence of symptoms is queried. One such example is the \"Big Corona Study\" (see also Neyens et al. 2020) , an online survey that can be filled in by all members of the public on every Tuesday since March 17, 2020; from June 2, 2020 onwards, the survey shifted to a bi-weekly frequency. It collects data about public adherence to measures taken by the government, contact behaviour, mental and socio-economic distress, and spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 symptoms\" incidences. While public participation is useful as a low-cost method to collect timely information within the context of a pandemic, caution should be exercised at the analysis stage; online surveys, based on self-reporting, often do not reach every societal group equally (Alessi and Martin 2010). It typically causes response rates to vary among citizens of different ages, genders, cultures and economic statuses. This is particularly the case in 2020, where the perception of the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic varies considerably between individuals and has become politically coloured. This then translates to increased difficulties to correct for unrepresentative samples, even after standardization methods such as inverse probability weighting are performed. In essence, these problems all relate to non-random missingness patterns (Molenberghs and Kenward 2007) , where the absence of information is driven by complex processes. These processes do not lie far from opportunistic sampling phenomena that often occur in biodiversity studies that make use of citizens to collect data (Neyens et al. 2019) . For example, using such surveys to pinpoint areas of increased disease incidence necessitates careful investigation, since response rates\" spatial dynamics may be stochastically dependent on the underlying spatial process that generates heterogeneity in the symptoms\" incidences. If present, this opportunistic sampling phenomenon, termed preferential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof sampling (Diggle et al. 2010) , invalidates statistical inference on the spatial dynamics of COVID-19 symptoms. This can be accommodated by using a shared latent process approach where a geostatistical binomial model for the proportion of participants of each Belgian municipality that experiences COVID-19 symptoms shares a spatial random effect with a model for the response rates. The result of this approach is shown in Figure 1 , which depicts predicted symptoms\" incidence, corrected for preferential sampling, using data of 397,529 individuals collected during the third round of the \"Big Corona Study\" (March 31, 2020). In many countries, all such surveys take place in an ad hoc fashion. It can be beneficial, though, to make use of a permanent (online) representative panel for public opinion research. Such a panel exists in the Netherlands (Institute for data collection and research 2020). Catalyzed by the current pandemic, a panel of this type is likely to be initiated in Belgium as well."}, {"section_title": "Diagnostic and Serological Testing", "text": "The battle against a novel emerging pathogen such as COVID-19 requires the development of a rigorous screening strategy to detect the virus, with the objective to mitigate its public health impact and to bring the pandemic under control.

This \"latent prevalence\" can then be linked to the apparent prevalence (i.e., the observed proportion of positive results of the diagnostic tests) through a set of equations allowing estimating all parameters at stake (i.e., prevalence, sensitivities and specificities of each of the tests used) (Speybroeck et al. 2013) .

Over the years, an entire body of research has indeed been developed around group testing in a diagnostic context, for example when resources are scarce and/or under time pressure (Chen et al. 2009 ).

This changed for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Takasuka et al. 2020 ) but in these cases there was no opportunity to put potential vaccines to the test.\nWhile existing vaccine-constructs (e.g., adeno-based, adjuvants, etc.), in particular for influenza and the aforementioned coronaviruses, can provide a step-up for SARS-CoV-2, success is not automatically guaranteed. Because the general consensus is that the global population will be able to return to normalcy only after the development of effective vaccines and the implementation of large vaccination programmes, the challenge is to develop a vaccine at unprecedented speed.\nEvidently, global collaboration is essential. where healthy subjects are infected to test a vaccine, while effective treatment may not yet be available. A further challenge is that vaccines need to be developed while the immunology associated with SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear, and knowledge is accumulating, with trial and error.\nSeveral pharmaceutical companies have taken the unprecedented step to plan and build production capacity in parallel with candidate vaccine development and testing.

The best outcomes to use will undoubtedly emerge as the results of clinical trials begin to appear and clinicians have built experience on how to measure these outcomes. "}, {"section_title": "Multi-Arm Designs", "text": "The main challenges when conducting clinical trials in the COVID-19 context are (a) the multitude of potential treatments, (b) the lack of patients in some regions to conduct several trials in parallel, (Law and Emery 2003; Juszczak et al. 2019) , the statistical analysis of such studies has not received much attention.\nAs an example, consider a scenario in which patients are randomized to treatment A, B, or SOC in a (1:2:1) ratio. Interest is in comparing A with SOC, and B with SOC. Further assume that 10% of the population eligible for A and/or B is eligible for A only (subpopulation 1), while 30%\nis eligible for B only (subpopulation 2). The remaining 60% is eligible for both A and B (subpopulation 3). This situation is graphically shown in Figure 2 . Out of 100 patients eligible for A or B, we expect 10, 30, and 60 subjects in subpopulations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In each subpopulation, randomization is performed according to the appropriate ratios, i.e., (1:1), (2:1), and (1:2:1), in subpopulations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. When analyzing the effect of treatment A versus SOC, only concurrent controls can be included. Hence the SOC patients from subpopulations 1 and 3, will be compared to all A patients from the same two subpopulations. However, in subpopulation 3, 50% of the patients received B, implying that subpopulation 3 is underrepresented in the comparison of A versus SOC. If the objective is to estimate the marginal effect of A versus SOC, i.e., the effect one would estimate in a placebo controlled trial of A versus SOC, the patients from subpopulation 3 need to be reweighted by a factor 2, in order to restore the balance between subpopulations 1 and 3. The final analysis of A versus SOC is then a weighted analysis of the 2 x 20 patients from the subpopulations 1 and 3 who received either A or SOC, however, the patients from subpopulation 3 get each a weight of 2.\nLikewise, the marginal effect of B versus SOC can be estimated using a weighted analysis of the 25 SOC patients and the 50 B patients from subpopulations 2 and 3, but the patients from subpopulation 3 need to be reweighted by a factor 4/3 in order to correct for the imbalance due to the removal of the 25% patients on treatment A in subpopulation 3.\nNote that the gain of the design in Figure 2 is that an expected 15 SOC patients, i.e., 25% of 60% of the study population, can be used twice, once in the comparison with A and once in the comparison with B, while not having to exclude patients that are eligible for A or B only. The gain obviously highly depends on the eligibility criteria and on the randomization ratios used. Note also that the methodology can easily be extended to trials with more than two research treatments and to trials with adaptive designs allowing for adding new treatments or removing non-promising treatments."}, {"section_title": "Factorial Designs", "text": "Factorial designs, a rare exception in trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies who prefer to focus on a single therapeutic question, were suggested for situations in which more than one treatment could be tested simultaneously in the same patients. As an example of such a design, the patients receive usual care while 7 receive usual care plus at least one experimental drug (see Table   2 ). "}, {"section_title": "Interim Analyses and Multi-Stage Designs", "text": "In view of the huge uncertainties associated with anticipated clinical outcomes as well as treatment effects, it was generally considered appropriate to include one or more interim analyses for safety and/or futility and/or efficacy in the trial designs. Group sequential trial methodology provides a well-known framework for incorporating as many interim analyses as deemed necessary while adequately controlling the probability of a type I error. Any substantial trial benefits from being monitored by an experienced IDMC (Independent Data Monitoring Committee), and in particular trials with interim analyses of efficacy; however IDMCs are in high demand and short supply, and the flurry of COVID-19 trials will not ease the current shortage. Adaptive design methodology was also considered, though its most common applications (choice of an optimal dose, increase in sample size, or enrichment in specific patient subsets) did not address the most acute need in COVID-19 trials, which was to allow seamless addition or dropping of treatment arms to reflect a changing therapeutic landscape. This is the objective of platform trials, such as the multi- Platform trial. Logistical challenges in the setting of COVID-19 include the timely identification of eligible subjects, obtaining informed consent when isolation at home is needed, as well as the delivery of study medication. Initially, this trial will compare camostat with standard of care in community dwelling adult patients who are at least 50 years old presenting with signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The aim of this large pragmatic trial is to avoid hospitalisation by using a well tolerated antiviral to rapidly treat patients at risk who have first symptoms of COVID-19. Like in PRINCIPLE, the DAWN trial will use Bayesian posterior probabilities to add or drop treatment arms while the study is ongoing, but unlike in PRINCIPLE, randomization will not use adaptive randomization, for there is neither a statistical advantage nor an ethical imperative to do so (see Hey and Kimmelman 2015, with discussion). Instead, minimization can be used to allocate treatments in a constant ratio while allowing for several prognostic factors to be balanced across the treatment arms."}, {"section_title": "Pragmatism in Trial Conduct", "text": "Perhaps the most impressive aspect of clinical trial activities during the pandemic was the collaborative pragmatism that naturally evolved in response to the crisis. Statisticians from academia, the public and the private sectors voluntarily contributed ideas and resources to come up with optimal trial designs to address the most critical clinical questions. Some of these collaborations pre-dated the pandemic, but many were improvised to respond efficiently to the most pressing needs. When it came to launching the trials, the usual delays and bureaucratic hurdles evaporated, and the trials could all be launched within a couple of weeks -instead of the several months usually required to fulfil all administrative requirements. While excessive speed may create challenges, as discussed in Section 10, on balance it may be preferable to unnecessary delays whenever the health of patients is at stakeand this is the case for many non-COVID-19 related health issues. likely to result in more conservative estimates of treatment effects (with the exception of non-inferiority trials). In other words, the ITT estimates of treatment effects will in general not be biased by systematic differences between the randomized treatment groups, but they may well underestimate treatment effects that would have been estimated in \"normal\" circumstances. In multinational or multiregional trials, the COVID-19 pandemic may take a different course in different regions; in addition, regional differences such as distance traveled to health care J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f centers may create very different patterns of missingness across regions. This variability may not create a systematic bias if it affects all treatment arms equally. It does offer an opportunity to perform sensitivity analyses using region as a potential modulator of treatment effect. Other sensitivity analyses (such as shift imputation and tipping-point analyses) will likely play a more prominent role due to the larger than usual volume of missing data."}, {"section_title": "Missing Data", "text": "Finally, it will be important to rule out situations of differential drop-out rate between the randomized treatment groups. This could happen, for instance, in open-label trials if patients in the control arm are more likely to miss their planned visits than patients who receive an experimental therapy.

If outcome assessments were due to take place at the hospital or doctor\"s office (e.g., a 6-minute walk test), it may be preferable to replace these assessments by their home-based equivalent assessments, when available. In most situations, some data are better than no data at all, under the assumption that data taken in less than ideal situations are not grossly erroneous or misleading. In fact, even if assessments taken at home in poorly controlled conditions are less reliable than those taken at the hospital in the most rigorous conditions, the loss in efficiency in detecting a treatment effect may be surprisingly small, assuming no systematic bias between the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f randomized treatment groups .\nIt is sometimes believed, wrongly, that patients who have symptomatic COVID-19\ninfections should be removed from trials of other indications. This is unjustified and should not be done unless it is mandated by the patient\"s safety or personal choice."}, {"section_title": "COVID-19 Related Events", "text": "It is conceivable that in some cases a randomized trial has its treatment arms differentially affected by the pandemic if the intervention under study is a risk factor for COVID-19. As an example, in oncology, chemotherapy is felt to increase the risk of infection among cancer patients, and some authors have cautioned the medical community about this risk. In a trial comparing chemotherapy with a non-cytotoxic intervention, the incidence of COVID-19 may therefore be higher in the chemotherapy arm. If the infection is a risk factor for one or more of the outcomes of interest (e.g., survival), an association may be created between the exposure (treatment) and the outcome (in this case, survival) through the infection, thus confounding the analysis of such outcome(s), unless cause-specific mortality is used. The reporting of causes of death is generally unreliable and variable from center to center, but COVID-19 related deaths are likely to be reported reliably (respiratory diseases being an exception). It may also be useful to perform competing risks analyses for the outcome of primary interest in the trial (such as disease progression) and\nCOVID-19 infection.\nIt is conceivable that patients with COVID-19 infection will receive treatments that interact with their treatments for other indications. Such interactions would only create a potential bias in randomized trials if they were different for the treatments being compared, an unlikely situation but one that may on occasion occur. A related issue is that most clinical trials forbid the inclusion of patients in other trials of investigational drugs. AIDS advocacy groups argued long ago that co-enrollment in multiple trials was both ethically and scientifically desirable, a view that still prevails today and should be pro-actively implemented in trials (Myles et al. 2014 )."}, {"section_title": "Protocol Amendments", "text": "Because the results of randomized clinical trials are, by nature, protected against changes in the environment that affect all randomized groups equally, there will generally be no good reason to amend the statistical sections of the protocols of ongoing studies, except for sample size Some trials will have to stop as a result of the pandemic with a lower sample size than initially planned. For trials that can continue throughout the pandemic, major protocol deviations may result in a lower treatment effect than anticipated, which might justify a sample size increase to compensate the loss in statistical power. Such sample size increases do not affect the type I error.\n10 The Price of Speed: Methodological Sloppiness"}, {"section_title": "Uncontrolled Trials", "text": "In times of great pressure, such as when the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, it is very tempting to take shortcuts and experiment with potentially effective treatments in an uncontrolled way, with the hope that some of the treatments tested will be so effective as to constitute real breakthroughs in the management of the disease. Finally, finding international consensus to select or change trial interventions is far more challenging than at the national level. The right balance between national and international efforts will have to be addressed going forward, with the overarching goal of maximizing the efficiency of clinical research. Trial implementation is definitely more efficient at the national level; however the number of patients in a small country like Belgium is insufficient to size the trials properly.\nMost of the trials started during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic will be too small to provide reliable estimates of treatment effects, and it would therefore be advisable to plan prospective meta-analyses of all such trials as soon as possible. Such prospective meta-analyses should be based on patient-level data (see Section 11). In the UK, the large RECOVERY trial tested standard of care against low-dose Dexamethasone, Azithromycin, Tocilizumab or convalescent plasma (University of Oxford 2020b). This trial accrued 11,303 patients between\nMarch and June 2020 and, in this short period of time, was already able to show a highly significant benefit of dexamethasone on mortality (The RECOVERY Collaborative Group 2020), which immediately led to the use of glucocorticoids as standard of care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Errors", "text": "Methodological issues have arisen in a number of studies dedicated to prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis (mortality risk, progression to severe disease, length of hospital stay) of patients with COVID-19. Wynants et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review and detected 51 studies with methodological issues and errors among a collection of 4,909 titles screened.\nIn clinical trials conducted in COVID-19 patients, the statistical methods commonly used are based on the standard Cox (1972) proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier (1958) estimator (see, for example, Beigel et al. 2020, and Li et al. 2020) . When time to death due to COVID-19 is the outcome of interest, these methods implicitly treat discharged or recovered patients as right censored. Doing so is incorrect, however, as right censoring means that the unobserved time to death can be any time point larger than the observed one, whereas patients who recover may in fact never die from COVID-19. A correct way of analyzing this type of data is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof through the use of competing risk models, such as the model proposed by Fine and Gray (1999) which is based on the subdistribution hazard, or on cure models. To study the impact of incorrectly classifying recovered patients as right censored, Oulhaj et al. (2020) simulated data from a fictive clinical trial on COVID-19. Six scenarios representing different situations of the effect of treatment on death and its competing event recovery were considered. The hazard ratio of death and the 28-day absolute risk reduction were estimated using the Cox model and the Fine and Gray model. The Cox model estimated the hazard ratio of death due to COVID-19 and the 28-day absolute risk reduction incorrectly in almost all cases. The magnitude of the estimation bias increased when the process of recovery was faster and/or the chance of recovery was higher. In some cases, the estimates obtained from the Cox model also incorrectly showed a harmful effect of treatment when it was in fact beneficial. The simulation study therefore shows that there is a substantial risk of misleading results in COVID-19 research if recovery and death due to COVID-19 are not considered as competing events, and the assumption of non-informative censoring is violated. This issue, and others related to intercurrent events, is best addressed using the estimand framework, which has now become a regulatory requirement for trials aimed at new drug registration (Kahan et al. 2020) .\nAnother well-known issue with the Cox model is the presence of strongly non proportional hazards. Much literature has recently focused on alternatives to the Cox model, especially for situations where deviations from proportionality are expected or have been observed, e.g., in trials of immunotherapy for cancer patients. Accelerated failure time models and the restricted mean survival time have been advocated in such cases, as have approaches based on generalized pairwise comparisons such as the win ratio and the net benefit (Buyse et al. 2020 ). Further experience is needed with these alternative approaches, which might advantageously be considered in COVID-19 trials."}, {"section_title": "The Need for Data Sharing", "text": "During the pandemic, one of the key needs was and remains the collection of personal and medical data at an individual and group level. This need provided impetus for contact tracing and opened possible avenues of research for understanding the spread of the virus throughout the population and specific subgroups. In the discussion regarding the use of existing medical data, the collection of new data and in particular the collection of contact tracing data, some policy makers argued that (Zwitter et al. 2020 ) the COVID-19 pandemic is not a free pass to use these data without any safeguards. The pandemic actually has been an opportunity to show that the principle underlying GDPR can actually be an advantage for data-driven research. The confrontation with a new situation, may also require reflection time, i.e., for a debate, but this time was not available, and hence public interest should prevail, within limits defined by the ethical committees. The availability of granular data from differing sources like individual medical files, or data held by mutual health organisations would provide unique opportunities to support health policy making and develop successful strategies for the current and future pandemics. The adoption of standards for data citation and referencing would also promote data sharing in an international, interdisciplinary, and interdependent research community. Guidelines have been developed by DataCite (https:https://datacite.org/cite-your-data.html) and DataVerse (http://best-practices.dataverse.org/data-citation/)\nAs far as clinical research is concerned, there has been a remarkable push towards sharing of individual patient data for a number of years, both from publicly-funded trials but also from the pharmaceutical industry (Rockhold et al. 2019 ). The goal is to share individual patient data from all completed trials within reasonable time after their completion so as to allow for further analyses of these patient data, as well as to help the design of other trials. Such maximization of the use of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof patient data is certainly in line with greater patient involvement in clinical research, and would pave the way to truly patient-centric research. For the sharing to be maximally useful, the data should be made available as early as possible (without infringing intellectual property rights or publication in full by the trial principal investigators). The COVID-19 pandemic has also made it clear that data should be shared even earlier, albeit confidentially, among the Independent Data Monitoring Committees of trials investigating similar treatments in order to inform decisions about amending or stopping ongoing trials after careful review of all relevant data (Petkova et al. 2020 )."}, {"section_title": "Reflections, Concluding Remarks, and Outlook", "text": "In this section, we suggest some specific lessons learned for both the modeling and prediction as well as for clinical research.\nFirst and foremost, there is a huge need for international collaboration through formal and informal scientific networks during pandemics. While there are local, country specific aspects to the epidemic (culture, population density, demography, health care system), there is commonality from an infectious diseases perspective.\nThe statistical and methodological teams in academia, industry, and government need to connect with each other, nationally and internationally. Steady research capacity is needed, that can quickly scale up in pandemic times in order to respond to pandemics efficiently. For example, statisticians working in other areas (exact sciences, economy, humanities) can be converted quickly to COVID-19 response work provided they are sufficiently broadly trained, and there are University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), and Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). These offer valuable resources on how the epidemic is playing out elsewhere. Especially in contiguous and highly connected areas, such as in the United States and the European Union (especially the Schengen Zone), the epidemic\"s evolution cannot be seen in isolation, except at the rare times where state or international borders are virtually closed."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Research", "text": "The COVID-19 crisis has provided an exceptional opportunity to question the way in which clinical research is conducted, not just for the treatment of COVID-19 patients but also for all other diseases. One of the priorities today should be to streamline clinical research in diseases with high morbidity and mortality (cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc.) This could entail drastic simplifications of trial set-up (protocol review committees, ethical approval, regulatory submissions, access to drugs from competing drug companies for comparative effectiveness trials, etc.) as well as trial conduct (pragmatic trials comparing standards of care using ultra-simple protocols, real-time electronic data capture, central statistical monitoring, common resources for Independent Data Monitoring Committees, etc.) These ideas are by no means new (see, e.g., https://moretrials.net/) but with the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, they may get more traction than ever before.\nThe need for a strengthened international collaboration in epidemiology should be accompanied by a corresponding international preparedness for clinical research, in order to quickly deploy large simple trials simultaneously in as many countries as possible. If the urgency to carry out clinical trials of treatments against COVID-19 could now be expanded to all other diseases, it would be a revolution in using statistical methodology to improve global health."}]
