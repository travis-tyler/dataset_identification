INTRODUCTION", "text": "When interactions among independent variables exist in forecasting problems, the performances of the multiple linear regression models and ridge regression models [1] are not good enough. For improving this situation, G. Choquet proposed his fuzzy integral, called Choquet integral, in 1953 [2] , M. Sugeno rediscovered the concepts of fuzzy integral and fuzzy measure and also proposed his \u03bb-measure in 1974 [3] , L. A. Zadeh's simple sub-additive fuzzy measure with closed form, P-measure, was proposed in 1978 [4] , the author, H.-C. Liu, proved that the P-measure is the smallest fuzzy measure and proposed the largest fuzzy measure, B-measure in 2009 [10] .\nAll of above measures and traditional additive measure [5] are univalent fuzzy measure with only one formulaic fuzzy measure solution, the author, H.-C. Liu, proposed a multivalent fuzzy measures with infinitely many fuzzy measure solutions, called L-measure [7] [8] , Due to Lmeasure does not contain \u03bb-measure, and then, an extensional fuzzy measure of L-measure containing \u03bb-measure, called extensional L-measure, was proposed by the author H.-C. Liu in 2009 [9] .\nHowever, both L-measure and extensional L-measure do not attain to B-measure, and then two new multivalent fuzzy measures, called completed L-measure [10] , and extensional completed L-measure [11] , were also proposed by our next previous work [10, 11] . It is showed that the interactions problem can be improved by using Choquet integral regression models with \u03bb-measure and above multivalent fuzzy measures [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .\nAs we known, the performance of Choquet integral is predominated by its fuzzy measure, and the performance of each of fuzzy measure is predominated by its fuzzy density function. In other words, how to find a better fuzzy density function is the most importance issue in Choquet integral regression model problem.\nIn this paper, a new fuzzy density function, called Ndensity is considered, we will show that each of the performance of the Choquet integral regression model with respect to six measures, P-measure, \u03bb-measure, Lmeasure, extensional L-measure, completed L-measure and extensional completed L-measure based on this new density is better than which based on the old fuzzy support fuzzy density function, R-density, respectively."}, {"section_title": "II.
