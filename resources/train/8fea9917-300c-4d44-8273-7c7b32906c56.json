Hydrographic survey projects support Coast Survey's mandated mission to provide reliable nautical charts and other products necessary for safe navigation, economic security, and environmental sustainability in U.S. ocean and coastal waters. Coast Survey's proposed action would be to continue surveying approximately 3,000 square nautical miles of coastal waters each year. In order to conduct these surveys, Coast Survey would engage in a combination of some or all of the following field activities: use of high frequency echosounders mounted on or towed behind vessels traveling at a slow speed, use of aircraft-mounted lasers during light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys, vessel transits to and from survey areas, anchoring, sound speed data collection, bottom sample collection, tide gauge installation on land, and testing of survey products in development, such as autonomous underwater vehicles. Coast Survey conducts surveys primarily in shallow waters critical for safe navigation using high frequency echosounders during operations. This PEA focuses on aspects of the physical, biological and cultural marine environment that could be affected by the activities listed above, including marine mammals, sea turtles, essential fish habitat, historic wrecks, Alaska Native community subsistence hunts, and National Marine Sanctuary resources. Hydrographic surveys could cause temporary, non-significant, low impact adverse effects on the environment. Examples of these effects include avoidance behavior of whales and dolphins in the presence of a survey vessel or disturbance of wildlife while drilling during tide gauge installation. The risk of vessel strike to marine mammals and sea turtles is present, but unlikely due to slow survey speeds. Serious damage to marine mammals from underwater echosounder noise is also unlikely since Coast Survey uses downward-facing, high frequency echosounders out of most species' hearing range. Additionally, Coast Survey incorporates mitigation measures into its survey activities to reduce or avoid these impacts wherever practicable. While there is a low risk of serious adverse impacts to the environment, the environmental consequences section of this PEA includes a detailed analysis of echosounder noise and the potential effects on marine mammals. Coast Survey's conclusions are based on the best available scientific data and consultations with underwater acoustic experts and biologists from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with a special emphasis on the impacts to marine mammals, endangered species, and essential fish habitat. Coast Survey's analysis also includes special discussions on the effects of vessel or aircraft noise on seabirds, nesting sea turtles, and hauled-out pinnipeds, as well as the temporary land disturbances during tide gauge installation. The positive and negative effects of conducting surveys locating historic wrecks, as well as those of surveying in Alaska Native subsistence hunt waters, are also discussed in the analysis. Potential impacts resulting from the proposed action and the no-action alternative were analyzed for the physical, biological, and cultural environment. Coast Survey acquires data vital to safe navigation, economic security, and environmental sustainability in U.S. and coastal and Great Lake waters, reducing the risk of maritime accidents that can be potentially devastating to the coastal environment. In its analysis, Coast Survey identified no significant negative environmental impacts associated with its program of conducting hydrographic surveys."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "This PEA analyzes the potential impacts on the human and natural environment associated with the National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey program of conducting hydrographic surveys and related activities in the marine environment. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, Coast Survey has prepared this PEA to ensure that environmental impacts resulting from survey activities are incorporated into the decision-making process (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 4321 et seq). The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as a federal agency, to \"interpret and administer the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States in accordance with the policies set forth in the Act\" (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.2(a)). NOAA defines the proposed action described in this PEA in NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 216-6 as a \"Routine Program Function,\" which includes \"mapping, charting and surveying services\u2026ship and aircraft operations\u2026basic environmental services and monitoring\u2026environmental data and information services\u2026and for which any cumulative effects are negligible\" Section 6.03c.3(d)). Coast Survey hydrographic survey and charting services have traditionally fallen under a Categorical Exclusion. However, given the recent attention surrounding the issue of high-frequency underwater sound and its potential effects on marine mammals, Coast Survey has decided to perform a PEA for its field activities. Coast Survey involved the public early in the decision-making process by publishing a draft of this PEA in the Federal Register for a 30-day public comment period in June 2012. In addition to adhering to the requirements set forth in NAO 216-6, Coast Survey has followed CEQ guidance on the use of appendices and incorporation by reference wherever possible. In particular, NOAA has limited the main body text of this environmental assessment to a \"plain language summary,\" and has included research papers directly relevant to the proposal, lists of affected species, discussion of the methodology of models used in the analysis of impacts, and extremely detailed responses to comments in the appendices (CEQ 1981, question 25a). Throughout the preparation of this PEA, Coast Survey collaborated with biologists from NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Both Services provided expertise on marine mammals protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, marine species listed under the Endangered Species Act, and essential fish habitat as defined by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, or Magnuson-Stevens Act. Coast Survey's preferred alternative is to continue its hydrographic survey program and related activities with mitigation measures incorporated into its standard protocols wherever practicable. Through research using the best available science and consultations with biologists and underwater acoustic experts, Coast Survey has concluded that this preferred alternative does not result in any significant changes to the human or natural environment. While anchored to receive supplies and transfer personnel to or from smaller vessels, cargo ships are often exposed to harsh weather from all directions."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Sustainability", "text": "Hydrographic survey data support healthy, resilient coastal communities and ecosystems by providing valuable bathymetric \"base layers.\" To protect and restore ecological resources, managers of NOAA's National Marine Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves, as well as managers of Marine Protected Areas and coastal zones around the country, rely on this bathymetric data to map the marine environment, including critical habitat for endangered seabird, coral, seagrass, fish, sea turtle, and marine mammal species. By establishing a baseline resource assessment, coastal managers measure change over time to the environment, including the impacts of sea level change."}, {"section_title": "PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Proposed Action (Preferred Alternative)", "text": "The proposed action is Coast Survey's preferred alternative. To meet its mandate to survey and chart ocean and coastal waters, Coast Survey would continue to survey approximately 3,000 square nautical miles of selected navigationally significant areas each year (Appendix A). Using four NOAA ships (three of which are equipped with small boats for near shore work), six 28-foot survey boats, a 54-foot research vessel, and private contractors, Coast Survey would acquire hydrographic data that would update the nation's nautical charts with the accuracy and precision that is essential to maintain the public trust in navigational products (Figure 1). Following field survey operations, Coast Survey cartographers would use the data to update the nation's nautical charts. The public can access survey data at NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center, and nautical charts are available from a variety of sources, including Coast Survey's website. Each year, Coast Survey would survey approximately 30 discrete locations. Many survey projects carry over from year to year, although some surveys require only one year's effort. The list of planned 2013 projects and locations in Appendix B provides a good example of a typical year's survey projects. (Note: this list includes only 2013 projects.) Hydrographic survey plans are available on the Coast Survey compliance website before each field season (approximately mid-March). The actions listed below include all survey-related field activities in support of the Coast Survey mandate to survey and chart navigationally significant waters. All of the elements listed below in the remainder of Section 3.1 would be undertaken if the proposed action is selected.\nThis section addresses the direct and indirect impacts of the proposed action on the environment. Examples of direct impacts from the proposed action are survey vessels striking marine mammals or sea turtles, sound from active echosounders harassing marine mammals, or noise from tide gauge installation operations harassing seabirds, nesting sea turtles, or pinnipeds. The sub-sections (activities) within Section 5.1 correspond to the sub-sections within Section 3.1. Mitigation measures incorporated into the preferred alternative are included within the discussion of impacts by activity."}, {"section_title": "Hydrographic surveys", "text": "Coast Survey conducts hydrographic surveys with high-frequency side scan sonar, and with single beam and multibeam echosounders, which use sound waves to find and identify objects in the water and to determine water depth. During a survey, a vessel equipped with one or more echosounders \"mows the lawn\" at a slow speed to ensonify (or visualize) the seafloor bottom and ensure full coverage of the seafloor within each project area ( Figure 2). Single beam and    "}, {"section_title": "Echosounder Characteristics", "text": "An echosounder transmits and receives acoustic pulses by sending a sound pulse through the water column until it reaches the seafloor, at which point the pulse reflects off the seafloor and returns to the echosounder's receiver. The time elapsed during the two-way trip is converted to a distance by multiplying this number by the speed of sound in water (de Moustier 2009). Sound speed is measured independently throughout a survey in order to provide the multiplier. The methods for sound speed data collection are discussed in Section 3.1.6. An echosounder that measures water depths during a typical hydrographic survey is optimized for surveying in a specific range of environmental conditions. Echosounders that transmit low frequency sound can travel a longer distance in the water (good range) but have a lower resolution and are less precise. Sound from high-frequency echosounders cannot travel long distances in water but the data have a higher resolution and are more precise. Coast Survey conducts surveys primarily in shallow waters critical for safe navigation, where depths are low (approximately 4 -200 meters) and the need for precision is high. As a result, Coast Survey uses primarily high frequency (50-500 kHz) echosounders during survey operations. Pulse width and power also affect data quality and are adjusted in the field to accommodate a variety of environmental conditions such as depth and bottom type. Sound from an echosounder with a long pulse width (typically measured in microseconds, or \u03bcsec) travels further in the water and can be \"heard\" better by the transducer (good signal-to-noise ratio), but has a lower range resolution. A shorter pulse cannot travel as far in the water and has a weaker signal-to-noise ratio, but has a higher range resolution and can detect smaller and more closely spaced objects in the water. Echosounders have a maximum power setting associated with a peak sound source level (measured in dB re: 1 \u03bcPa); however, when the power is too high, the amount of bad, unusable data increases. Power is typically set to the lowest possible level (approximately 190 -210 dB re: 1 \u03bcPa) in order to receive a clear return with the best data. Power level is also adjusted according to bottom type, as some bottom types have a stronger return and require less power to produce quality data. The echosounder's duty cycle, or \"ping rate,\" is also set to the lowest possible level (approximately 10-30 Hz), regardless of the manufacturer's stated \"max ping rate.\""}, {"section_title": "Office of Coast Survey Echosounders", "text": "In-house and contractor vessels may be equipped with more than one type of echosounder; side scan sonar, single beam echosounders, and multibeam echosounders each have different advantages. Survey vessels can also be equipped with echosounders that can be adjusted between one of two frequencies, or with multiple echosounders of varying frequencies. In 2012, Coast Survey conducted survey operations using 18 sound sources (side scan sonar, single beam echosounders, and multibeam echosounders). Coast Survey anticipates acquiring new echosounders and discontinuing the use of others over the next few years. While Coast Survey cannot provide a complete list for the future, the 2012 table of echosounders (by vessel) in Appendix C provides a typical list of echosounders used each year. Although the specific brand or model of the listed echosounders may change on board each vessel, the frequency or power of the systems is unlikely to change significantly over the next few years."}, {"section_title": "Acquisition Windows and Survey Duration", "text": "Hydrographic surveying occurs year-round, although projects are limited by environmental windows. Typically, Alaska projects in the Arctic or Bering Sea operate between June and September to avoid dangerous, icy conditions. Projects in Southeast, Central, and Southwest Alaska take place between March and November. West Coast, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic projects are also conducted between March and November. Projects in the Southeast or Gulf of Mexico are conducted-year round. Actual time surveying averages approximately 15 days per month over the course of a survey project, although larger ships can often survey 20-25 days per month under good conditions. Bad weather or equipment repairs are the most common reasons for a non-survey day. Smaller boats operate 8-12 hours per day. (Sometimes, the large vessels carry the small boats to the survey area, and those small boats conduct the surveys.) When the large ships are surveying, they often operate 24 hours per day. The total time required for a project can vary from a few days to several months over multiple years."}, {"section_title": "Lidar Surveys", "text": "One airborne lidar project is usually conducted each year. Airborne lidar bathymetry measures depths of nearshore waters using laser pulses emitted from a scanner on board a low-altitude, twin-engine turbo prop airplane flying at speeds of 140 -175 knots. Lidar systems used for bathymetry emit visible green laser pulses to measure the timed sea floor bottom return, and near-infrared laser pulses measure the sea surface return ( Figure 5). Depth is determined by the time of the return back to the lidar sensor from the energy reflected off the seafloor. The aircraft flies at altitudes of 1,000-1,200 feet for an average duration of up to five hours per flight. Aircraft would transit between a home base (determined by the location of the contractor or subcontractor providing the aircraft) and an airport near the survey site before and after lidar operations.\n"}, {"section_title": "Vessel Transit Operations", "text": "Hydrographic survey vessels must transit to and from survey sites before, during, and after survey operations. During the survey, a vessel would return to port sometime within three weeks. Their port time depends on the size of the ship, and how far offshore they are surveying. Coast Survey is responsible for environmental compliance during all survey operational activities that occur while on board the primary survey ship platforms Rainier, Fairweather, Thomas Jefferson ( Figure 6), and Ferdinand Hassler. NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations is responsible for transit operations to, from and between survey areas, unless the ship is acquiring data with its survey systems during the transit. Coast Survey considers transit operations by contractors to be part of this PEA, as Coast Survey contract funds are used to pay for the transit as well as the actual survey. Coast Survey owns and operates navigation response team small boats and the Bay Hydro II; transits for these vessels are also included in the PEA. Coast Survey contracts approximately half of its hydrographic survey projects (measured by square nautical mile) from several firms. Contracts are firm-fixed price and performance-based, covering all services and personnel required to complete a survey from start to finish. Coast Survey is operating under five-year contracts and has initiated a new contract for FY 2014-18. Each year, task orders are issued against these contracts for several projects, each to be performed by a different contractor. In addition to compensating firms for the cost of surveying and data processing, task orders include the cost of transiting to and from the project site from the contract vessel's home port, as well as the cost of transiting back into a port closer to the survey site as frequently as every day and as infrequently as every three weeks. Contractors often use the same vessels from year to year, regardless of whether the vessels are chartered (\"vessels of opportunity\") or owned by the contract firm. In 2011, for example, one contractor used two survey vessels for a project in the Mississippi Sound. One vessel was transported from its homeport in Vancouver, Washington, across the country on a trailer to Biloxi, Mississippi, where the other vessel was already home ported. Since this project was only conducted during the daytime, each day the vessels returned to port in Biloxi for groceries, fuel, and crew change. Also in 2011, another contractor sailed its survey vessel from Seattle to the survey site in the Krenitzin Islands, Alaska. The transit lasted eight days in each direction. Every two to three weeks during the survey, the vessel made port calls to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, for groceries, fuel, and crew change. The transits for port calls lasted five hours in each direction. During transits, contractors operate under all of the normal regulations for vessels in the area, using shipping lanes, recommended routes, and natural channels as appropriate.\nEnvironmental consequences of transit operations to, from, and between survey sites are similar to the risks involved in operating vessels during the survey operation itself, although without the added impact of echosounders used only during survey operations."}, {"section_title": "Anchoring", "text": "When survey ships (NOAA and contractor) are not performing survey operations, the vessels are anchored either within the project area or just outside the project area. NOAA's survey launches return to the ship each day and do not require anchoring. Navigation response team boats, the Bay Hydro II, and some contractor vessels return to port every day and are tied up to a pier, eliminating the need for anchoring. Ships usually anchor within the survey area to reduce the transit time to the working grounds and to save on fuel consumption. Vessel operators select the anchor location based on depth, protection from seas and wind, and bottom type. Preferred bottom types are sticky mud or sand, as those characteristics allow the flukes of the anchor to dig into the bottom and hold the chain in place. Sensitive areas such as coral reefs are avoided when they are known to exist; however, project areas have often not been surveyed for many decades, and not all coral areas are charted. When working in an unsurveyed area or in an area that has not been surveyed in many years, the ship will try to anchor in bays where data has already been collected, providing the ship with better information on where to drop the anchor. Coral reefs in particular show up well in the multibeam data and can be avoided for anchoring. Vessels avoid coral reefs and hard bottom areas as part of their protocol because these bottom types do not provide for good anchoring. Reefs can snag an anchor and the ship might not get the anchor back aboard, and corals or hard bottoms do not provide for good holding, leaving the ship vulnerable to dragging anchor and shifting around. However, a vessel can anchor to a hard bottom in a weather-protected area if there are no soft bottom (mud or sand) areas available, as is often the case in rocky seafloor areas off the coast of Alaska.\nAnchoring during survey operations as described in Section 3.1.4 would not adversely affect essential fish habitat, individually or cumulatively. Preferred bottom types for anchoring are sticky mud or sand, which would not be permanently harmed. Ships are required to avoid coral reefs, seagrass beds, and other sensitive areas during anchoring. Due to the small footprint of anchoring activities and the vessel operator's preference for anchoring away from submerged aquatic vegetation and hard bottoms, anchoring would not likely alter the water column habitat for managed fish species or otherwise adversely affect the quality or quantity of essential fish habitat. If Coast Survey changed practices described in Section 3.1.4 such that essential fish habitat could be adversely affected, Coast Survey would contact the Office of Habitat Conservation to reevaluate the impacts and potentially initiate consultation as described in the Department of Commerce's essential fish habitat consultation regulations (50 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 600.905 -930). Mitigation Measures: No additional mitigation measures would be undertaken during anchoring beyond those that are already incorporated into the action. Anchoring in preferred bottom types, such as sticky mud or sand, will not permanently harm the seafloor."}, {"section_title": "Bottom Sample Collection", "text": "Coast Survey would grab samples of seafloor sediment during survey operations by lowering a grab sampler through the water column. During survey operations, bottom samples are characterized and charted primarily so mariners can better select their anchorages. Typically, surveyors use a clamshell bottom snapper ( Figure 7) or similar type of grab sampler to obtain samples of the surface sediment layer (approximately the first two inches of sediment). As the sampler is lowered, two hinged upper lids swing open to let water pass through. When the sampler reaches the bottom, the overlapping spring-loaded scoops are tripped on the line, and the lids close to contain the sediment and prevent sample washout. The line is lowered and raised, at a rate of about one meter per second. After the sediment is collected, analyzed, and photographed, the crew releases it from the sampler underwater. Field units have a bottom sample plan as a guideline of sampling density, although surveyors are given discretion on where to take exact samples. They do not collect samples in waters deeper than 80 meters. Additionally, in areas surveyed within the last 30 years, the surveyor might not need to collect samples at all. In some cases, the surveyor can use backscatter or side scan data acquired during the survey operation to determine the best place to sample. Samples are characterized by color and type of bottom material. For example, a sample of fine black sand that contains some broken shells would be classified and charted as f bl S bk Sh, while a sample of mud with fine sand would be charted as M f S (Figure 8). The surveyor populates fields for color and further descriptors if obtained, although not all characteristics end up on the nautical charts. \nBottom sample collection during survey operations as described in Section 3.1.5 would not reduce the quantity or quality of essential fish habitat. Bottom sample collections have a small, one square meter footprint and are taken approximately 2,400 to 4,800 meters apart. In addition, samples are not collected in the same area year after year. Individually or cumulatively, these samples would not adversely affect the quality or quantity of essential fish habitat, due to the small footprint and low intensity of the activity. If Coast Survey changed practices described in Section 3.1.5 such that essential fish habitat could be adversely affected, Coast Survey would contact the Office of Habitat Conservation to reevaluate the impacts and potentially initiate consultation as described in Department of Commerce's essential fish habitat consultation regulations (50 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 600.905 -930)."}, {"section_title": "Sound Speed Data Collection", "text": "Surveyors must collect sound speed data throughout the survey, to determine the speed of sound in the water column at a given location and time, and to correct for refraction errors in the echosounder data. Taken together, the two-way travel time of the acoustic pulse from a single beam or multibeam echosounder and the speed of sound in water determine seafloor depths. Sound speed data is collected periodically in one of two ways. In the first scenario, every one to four hours, a survey technician slowly lowers a sound speed profilerknown as a \"conductivity, temperature and depth\" instrument ( Figure 9) -from a stationary vessel, down to the seafloor and back. The second method involves a moving vessel profiler ( Figure 10), which is automatically lowered and raised through the water column at regular intervals while the vessel is in motion.\nSound speed data collection using a sound speed profiler, a conductivity, temperature, and depth instrument, or a moving vessel profiler would not reduce the quality or quantity of essential fish habitat.

These gauges, part of local networks of operating water level stations, provide important support to survey operations. Tide gauges compute the water level referenced to a tidal datum, producing a correction value for depth soundings collected during a hydrographic survey. Temporary local gauges are sometimes used to augment the permanent gauges within the National Water Level Observation Network, maintained by NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services. Taken together, the local and national networks provide the vertical reference system and data density required to describe water level variations at several time and geographic scales. Time scales range from short-term (real-time) data for navigation, to long-term (several years) for estimation of relative sea level trends. Geographic scales include regional coverage of significant variations in tidal characteristics and gradients in relative sea level trends. Depending on specific requirements, water level stations can be either short-term (one year or less), which is typically the case for Coast Survey-maintained tide gauges, or long-term (one year to several decades). Tide gauge sites are chosen based on a number of factors, including available water level data from historical site locations, proximity to long-term water level stations, and dynamic environmental variables."}, {"section_title": "Components of a Tide Gauge", "text": "A tide gauge is a system of instruments that measures the changes in water levels and transmits the data by satellite to a computer database for processing. The gauge consists of a sensor, data collection platform, solar panels, and satellite transmitter. A single gauge can be used for other purposes besides reducing survey data to a tidal datum, although the four types of gauges listed below are the most common types used during hydrographic surveys: 1. An acoustic sensor uses sound waves to measure the distance between the sensor and the water level surface. It is most often used when an existing pier or dock is available on which to mount the sensor and includes a protective well that houses the sounding tube ( Figure 11). A short-term acoustic tide gauge includes some or all of the following nonpermanent equipment: tide house (located on pier), data collection platform, sensor housed in a 30\" x 30\" portable plastic case, benchmarks, and satellite transmitter (tripod station with antenna and solar panel). A long-term acoustic tide station typically includes some or all of the following equipment: primary and backup water level sensors; primary and backup data collection platforms; a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite transmitter and antenna; Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna; batteries; solar panels; water temperature sensors; mast or tower on which to mount wind sensors; barometric pressure sensor; and air temperature sensor. The acoustic sensor requires a six-inch diameter PVC protective well to house the sounding tube; the well is attached to the pier with stainless steel brackets to maintain sensor stability. 2. A pressure sensor measures the pressure of the water column above an underwater orifice that is securely attached to maintain its position ( Figure 12). It is used when there is little infrastructure available. A constant supply of air is pumped through a tube to the orifice to establish a zero point from which to measure the changes in pressure in the water column. In the absence of a pre-existing structure, Coast Survey typically installs a bottom-mounted pressure sensor gauge. There is no pier or dock construction required for a bottom pressure sensor. 3. A microwave radar sensor uses radar waves to measure the distance from the sensor to the water. It is used when the existing infrastructure permits its installation in a location overlooking the water surface. This is the only type of sensor that is not in direct contact with the water."}, {"section_title": "4.", "text": "A tide buoy employs a GPS receiver that measures both horizontal and vertical position using GPS technology. It is used primarily for hydrographic surveys to obtain data in remote locations without existing infrastructure on which to mount a gauge. It is also used to collect data in shipping channels. Tide buoys are currently in development and testing for Coast Survey operations and are discussed further in Section 3.1.8.2."}, {"section_title": "Tide Gauge Installation", "text": "Tide gauge installation occurs primarily out of the water. Piers, docks, and bulkheads are typical manmade structures used to secure tide gauges. Rocks are the most common natural structures used to secure sensors in remote locations for short-term stations. Equipment includes primary and backup systems for sensors, data processing, and data transmission. All equipment is installed to last several years before needing service or replacement. Short-term stations involve only one primary system with no backups. They are less extensive, easier to install and remove, and usually only stay in place for the length of the hydrographic survey (one to three months). Geodetic \"bench marks\" must be installed near each water level station and are long-term reference points to which the tidal datums can be related through standard surveying techniques. A long-term station requires 10 bench marks to \"level\" the tide gauge during operations, while a short-term station only requires five bench marks. The larger number of marks required for a long-term station is proportional to the investment made over time in the data collection and tidal datums determined. Additional marks ensure that there are at least five marks, even if future construction destroys several marks at once. The bench marks are spaced at least 200 feet apart to reduce the chance of losing several marks at a time. They are typically established in a variety of permanent structures, including deep driven stainless steel rods when existing structures are not available. A field party (in-house or contractor) performs the installation of equipment. The party may consist of three to six people, depending on the complexity of the job. Parties travel to most gauge sites over land, but a few locationsespecially in remote areas of Alaska -can only be reached by boat, seaplane or helicopter. Installation equipment includes hand and power tools, drills, saws, stainless steel hardware, clamps, steel masts, equipment enclosures/shelters, sensors, conduit and hangers, laptop computers, handheld GPS receivers, leveling equipment, GPS static survey equipment, stainless steel rods for deep rod bench marks, bench mark disks, concrete, ropes, chains, safety equipment, cell phones, and diving equipment."}, {"section_title": "Tide Gauge Maintenance and Removal", "text": "Short-term stations may be operational for as little as one month, or they may operate up to a year. Personnel would return to the station periodically for water level measurements, with one final visit upon removal of the tide gauge following the survey. Personnel level the gauges when they install them and when they remove them ( Figure 13). Diving may or may not be involved, depending on the location and the type of sensor installed. Emergency repairs are occasionally required. Long-term stations, such as those within the National Water Level Observation Network, remain in operation indefinitely. They receive a preventative maintenance visit once a year that involves a standard inspection of all equipment, leveling from sensors to bench marks to determine sensor stability, GPS observations, and diving operations to inspect the underwater components. Emergency repair visits address failed components. A field party, similar to the installation field party described in Section 3.1.7.2, would remove a short-term gauge upon project completion.

In the traditional approach to hydrography, depths are referenced to a tidal datum via in situ water level measurements derived from instantaneous water level observations. Ellipsoidally referenced surveys improve the efficiency of hydrographic surveys by removing the requirement for concurrent water level observations and hydrographic survey data collection. The technology also improves vertical and horizontal measurement precision through the use of kinematic GPS-based positioning techniques. Hydrographic data acquired from ellipsoidally referenced surveys is referenced to a common, worldwide datum, which increases the long-term utility of the data for future users and applications. Equipment used in ellipsoidally referenced surveys includes a ship-based inertially-aided GPS system and a shore-based GPS reference station. If an existing network, such as the Continually Operating Reference System, is not available, the field unit must establish a new network by using a tripod, an antenna, a receiver housed in a hardened waterproof \"suitcase,\" and data storage connected to a radio modem for remote downloads. If electrical service is not available at the reference station site, the network system requires a set of 12-volt marine, deep-cycle rechargeable batteries and a solar panel array. The site chosen on shore must provide an obstruction-free view to GPS satellites and accommodate line-of-sight radio communications. No equipment maintenance is required, although if no remote data download capability is available the field unit must visit the site periodically to download data vital for survey processing. Coast Survey is currently conducting quality control tests on the effectiveness and reliability of ellipsoidally referenced surveys compared to surveys that employ traditional tide gauge-derived water levels. Ellipsoidally referenced surveys also rely on a vertical datum transformation tool in order to translate the vertical component of survey data from the geodetic datum (ellipsoid) to the localized mean lower low water datum for nautical chart products. VDatum (NOAA's vertical transformation software) is important to the success of ellipsoidally referenced surveys and is operational in the coterminous United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands."}, {"section_title": "GPS Tide Buoys", "text": "Coast Survey would install GPS tide buoys ( Figure 14) during some surveys, as this technology moves from a testing to operational phase, to measure both horizontal and vertical position using GPS technology. Tide buoys provide a new opportunity to acquire water level data in remote locations that do not have infrastructure to mount a tide gauge. The use of GPS-tracked buoys can increase the geographic density of water level observations away from shore, with an explicit reference to a geodetic datum (ellipsoid) in support of ellipsoidally referenced surveys. If the tidal datum-to-ellipsoid relationship is determined beforehand, NOAA can significantly reduce the need for dedicated shore-based tide gauge resources (time, money, logistics, and personnel) in support of hydrographic surveying. GPS tide buoys remain operational for the same duration of time as traditional, short-term tide gauges (typically for the length of the survey or 30 days, whichever is greater) in order to establish the required ellipsoid and tidal datum relationship for ellipsoidally referenced surveys. Buoy deployment requires a limited area of flat and preferably sandy seafloor, similar to the type of bottom characteristics sought for small boat anchoring. Since the survey has not yet taken grab samples of the sea bottom, however, the team chooses the location based on the information on a nautical chart that may be outdated. During installation, GPS tide buoys are tethered to the anchoring hardware with a 15-meter, 1\" diameter rubber cord, followed by a section of 3/16\" Amsteel rope. The rubber cord attaches to the bottom of the buoy, and the rope attaches the rubber cord to the anchor. The combined length of the rubber cord and the rope exceeds the nominal water depth by a factor of approximately two (i.e., \"mooring scope\" = 2). The GPS buoy is deployed by floating the buoy away from the vessel to the extent of the rubber cord and rope. The anchor is then lowered slowly to the point where the rope attaches to the rubber cord, at which point the anchor is released. During recovery, the GPS buoy (float) is brought aboard the vessel along with the length of the rubber cord. The total anchoring hardware is then hauled in by rope. There is very little maintenance of the buoys required during a survey deployment. Occasionally the batteries must be replaced or recharged, and field units must retrieve the buoy with a small boat and bring it back to the ship or shore. When they bring the buoy on board, the team attaches a temporary float to the end of the mooring so that it can be re-used after the buoy batteries have been refreshed. At the end of the survey, the field unit recovers all components of the buoy. The Hydrolevel\u2122 buoys are programmed to send out a \"health message\" email to a predetermined distribution list at regular intervals using the Iridium satellite service. Currently, Coast Survey buoys are configured to send a message once every hour. If the buoy reports its position outside of a certain radius (\"watch circle\"), it issues a separate alert. Field personnel respond to emergencies where the buoy breaks its mooring or stops sending messages."}, {"section_title": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles", "text": "The Coast Survey Development Laboratory is evaluating the use of autonomous (or unmanned) underwater vehicles (AUV) for use in Coast Survey hydrographic surveys. These vehicles can perform underwater survey missions, such as detecting and mapping submerged wrecks, rocks, and obstructions that pose a hazard to navigation for commercial and recreational vessels. They can also collect ancillary hydrographic survey data, such as sound speed. The AUV operator programs the survey mission and operating behavior in advance, including parameters such as survey course, speed, altitude from the sea floor or depth, and mission duration. When a mission is complete, the autonomous underwater vehicle returns to a pre-programmed location, where crews may retrieve it manually or by using the vessel's crane or davits. The acquired data can be downloaded and processed in the same way as data collected by shipboard systems. Coast Survey's autonomous underwater vehicles have depth ratings from 100 to 600 meters, can travel at speeds up to 4 knots, and can go on missions up to 16 hours in duration. The operational procedures include programming the vehicles to avoid known obstructions. They also have navigation safety features that allow them to avoid striking the sea floor, and are designed to pause their mission and reverse or surface if the AUV strikes a submerged object. Autonomous vehicles can be equipped with a wide variety of oceanographic sensors or sonar systems. NOAA's hydrographic survey AUVs ( Figure 15) are typically equipped with side scan sonar, conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors, GPS-aided inertial navigation systems, and an acoustic doppler current profiler. In collaboration with NOAA's manned survey fleet, AUVs could greatly increase survey efficiency, particularly in areas too dangerous for a typical manned vessel. Additionally, their small size and flexible deployment options could make AUVs useful for marine incident response and port security surveys.

These systems use the measurement of acoustic signal phase at each of several receive elements, spaced at precisely known distances, to determine the angle from which the acoustic return originates. This angle of origin, in combination with range calculated from the two-way travel time, provides a discrete location on the seafloor. This sampling is done thousands of times per acoustic ping, providing a cross-track profile of bathymetry. A number of consecutive profiles are then combined to build a three dimensional model of the seafloor. Coast Survey is studying several commercially available phase measuring bathymetric sonar systems and has procured some for operational testing. Initial studies indicate that these systems may be capable of providing high quality data while significantly increasing efficiency and safety of operations in nearshore and very shallow water areas. The gains in efficiency and safety are attributable to the wider swath width that phase measuring bathymetric sonar produces, relative to traditional shallow water multibeam systems. This increased swath width, coupled with co-registered imagery, may increase survey efficiency and allow hydrographers to survey twice the shallow water area per given time. It may also allow vessel operators to stand further off of hazardous features and the shoreline. At the same time, they could acquire more data than is possible with technologies used today.

While some data is acquired from other federal and non-federal entities, the vast majority of survey data in U.S. waters is currently acquired by NOAA or its contractors. Were NOAA to cease these operations, as the data on nautical charting products aged over time and no longer accurately portrayed the real-world conditions in the water, the marine transportation system would face an increased risk of maritime accidents. As part of its survey program, NOAA also responds to regional requests for emergency surveys following natural and anthropogenic incidents. U.S. commerce relies on rapid response surveys in order to re-open major shipping ports following these events (e.g., oil spills, hurricanes). Under the No Action Alternative, NOAA would no longer be able to provide rapid response survey support following incidents, even when those events are of national significance, resulting in a major disruption of the import and export of goods vital to the U.S. economy. Indirect effects from the No Action Alternative include a loss of mission readiness and personnel proficiency. Hydrography is a highly specialized field and relies upon continuity of education and training. If NOAA's mapping and charting programs (which includes in-house and contracted personnel and equipment) were to discontinue for a significant time, the pool of highly trained personnel would experience major losses. No other public or private organization in the United States conducts hydrographic surveys at the scale of the Coast Survey program. NOAA relies on the program's continuity of regular operations for maintaining a well-trained workforce that is prepared to conduct emergency surveys when the need arises.

However, even in the best environmental conditions, reliable laser \"returns\" from the seafloor diminish in waters deeper than 20-30 meters. Environmental variables such as water clarity (turbidity), sea state, and sea surface also limit the effectiveness of bathymetric lidar. In particular, lidar does not produce good results when used in turbid waters. When conditions are not ideal, lidar fails to identify small, potentially hazardous objects on the seafloor.

Each year, Coast Survey would survey approximately 3,000 square nautical miles of navigationally significant waters around the coast and in the Great Lakes. Water depths vary for each survey, although the survey vessel would rarely move into waters shallower than four meters. Most Coast Survey projects occur in nearshore, coastal and continental shelf areas with depth ranges from 4-200 meters, although some projects, particularly in the \"steep and deep\" waters of Alaska, extend into deeper waters at the shelf break. Temporal constraints (i.e., the best time of year to survey in a given location) also dictate the marine physical environment of hydrographic surveys (see Section 3.1.1.3). Physical characteristics of the seafloor vary for each survey, from flat and sandy in the Gulf of Mexico to steep and rocky in much of Alaska. Wrecks, oil and gas platforms, pipelines, and other man-made obstructions are also located in many of the survey areas, particularly on the east coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. Existing ambient underwater noise from natural and anthropogenic sources is part of the physical marine environment. Surface waves and animal vocalizations provide the greatest source of naturally occurring ocean noise. Sources of anthropogenic noise include vessel propellers, seismic airguns, explosives, construction, naval sonars, and standard vessel depth finders (National Research Council 2003).

In the case of the North Atlantic right whale, for example, ship strikes are the greatest threat to the species' recovery, accounting for 11 deaths or serious injuries over the five years from 2003 to 2007. (Total population estimates for the North Atlantic right whale are currently 300-400 animals.) (Glass et al. 2009). Of 323 recorded historical ship strikes in the International Whaling Commission database, 142 (44%) resulted in death of the cetacean. Injuries from collisions (which may or may not result in death) include broken bones, hemorrhaging, and propeller cuts (Silber, Slutsky and Bettridge 2010). Polar bears are unlikely to be located in Coast Survey project areas since they are in areas of sea ice (Perrin, W\u00fcrsig and Thewissen 2009). Sea otters are at higher risk for a vessel strike, given their likelier presence in Coast Survey project areas and the difficulty of spotting them in high sea state conditions (USFWS 2011b). Manatees migrating to and from warm water refuges in Florida and Georgia are vulnerable to vessel strikes, although the small boats used for surveys in manatee habitat operate at very slow speeds (4-6 knots). While vessel strikes pose a direct threat to marine mammals and sea turtles, Coast Survey does not anticipate a vessel strike during survey operations. (NOTE: Impacts of transiting activities are discussed later in this document, beginning at Section 5.1.3.) Excessive speed is an important factor in determining the severity of injury during a vessel strike. Survey vessels typically operate at 4-8 knots during a survey, although larger ships can operate at up to 10 knots and still collect high-quality data during deeper water surveys. North Atlantic right whale ship strike rules require an operating speed of 10 knots or less in known right whale areas. Coast Survey would follow this protocol during its surveys. Mitigation Measures: Survey vessels operate at slow speeds (4-8 knots) by necessity to achieve high-resolution data during survey operations. The potential for a ship strike is mitigated further by the presence of lookout observers who alert the vessel operator if a marine mammal or sea turtle appears in the path of the vessel during the survey. OCS requires that a designated lookout stand watch on the ship's bridge during transit and survey operations, scanning the water for humans, animals, vessels, and other objects. Personnel on board NOAA and contractor vessels are required to monitor and report locations of marine mammal sightings as part of their regular operational protocol. Currently, the lookout records any sightings of marine mammals on either a paper marine mammal log or by an automated marine mammal report logging system such as AMVER/SEAS, which many NOAA ships also use for weather reporting. NOAA Fisheries' Office of Science and Technology is developing a smartphone application for filing reports. Regardless of format or mode of delivery, the observation report records the species, number of animals, behavior, time, and location of the sighting. Appendix J includes an example of a marine mammal and sea turtle observation log. On smaller vessels, the coxswain is required to perform lookout duties in addition to steering the boat. The launches do not have logs but the launch personnel call in any unique sightings to the ship. In congested areas, the coxswain is required to asks that an additional person stand on the bow to scan the water for dangerous objects. Lookouts are trained to call out any obstructions they see, including boats, kelp, logs, or marine mammals, and call them out as soon as possible to avoid a collision. Each year, NOAA ships are required to include 24 hours of \"safety stand down\" training activities for on-board personnel. NOAA is incorporating basic strategies for marine mammal detection and monitoring into standard ocean observatory roles for personnel. The Office of Science and Technology is working with other NOAA Fisheries offices and universities to establish a uniform submission site for recorded observations of marine mammals and sea turtles. They also want to develop a marine mammal and sea turtle identification book to aid personnel scanning the water for animals. Contractor vessels would also be required to incorporate these basic strategies for marine mammal detection and monitoring as they are developed. As a general precaution, vessel operators follow entry restrictions to protected areas for marine mammals, which are depicted on NOAA's nautical charts and described in detail in the U.S. Coast Pilot, both used for navigation during surveys. Important updates to restricted areas are broadcast through the U.S. Coast Guard \"Local Notice to Mariners\" and, in more urgent cases, are released through broadcast on VHF channel 16 or 22. Coast Survey applies Local Notice to Mariners updates to all charting products. Vessels are required to follow the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \"Skiff Operation Guidance\" for avoiding sea otter strike (USFWS 2011b) and the \"Polar Bear Interaction Guidelines\" for avoiding polar bear strikes (USFWS 2011a). The survey crews also comply with all federal and state speed restrictions while operating in and while transiting through manatee areas, particularly in critical habitat areas. Typical nearshore survey speed (4-6 knots) is below the speed restriction in manatee areas. Additionally, the survey crews follow all local, state, and federal regulations and tie up closely to the dock when in port to avoid crushing manatees between the vessel and the pier.\nThe risk of vessel strike to marine mammals and sea turtles during transits is similar to the risk of vessel strike during survey operations, as described in Section 5.1.1.1. While vessel strikes pose a direct threat to marine mammals and sea turtles, Coast Survey does not anticipate a vessel strike during transit operations on contractor ships, navigation response team small boats, or the Bay Hydro II (NOAA ships operate under the direction and control of NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations during transits). Large vessels that would cause the greatest injury to the animal operate at slow (less than 10 knots) transit speeds. North Atlantic right whale ship strike rules require an operating speed of 10 knots or less in known right whale areas. Coast Survey would follow this protocol during transit operations. During transits, ships may travel at higher speeds than 10 knots, but lookouts are required by OCS; these lookouts would alert the captain when right whales or other large whales are observed in the ship's path, and would slow to a safe speed of 10 knots, remaining at least 500 yards away from observed whales. Mitigation Measures: Monitoring requirements for transits (contractor, navigation response team, and Bay Hydro II) are the same as those associated with survey operations as described in Section 5.1.1.1."}, {"section_title": "Risk of Vessel Strike to Molting Seabirds", "text": "Steller's eiders, an ESA-listed seabird species, typically go through their molting season anytime from mid-August to mid-October in Southwest Alaska nearshore waters. During this time, the eiders are flightless and must preserve their energy for their wintering period. If disturbed by the presence of a survey vessel, these birds are likely to swim out of the way, exhibiting avoidance behavior, and so would not be struck. However, the effort of swimming out of the way while unable to fly may consume too much energy for the birds to survive the Alaskan winter. Mitigation Measures: Small vessels (which are used in the nearshore areas of a survey) operate 8-12 hours per day. Often these nearshore areas may only take one or two days to survey. In most cases, survey technicians and boat operators can survey the areas further offshore while performing daily observations and waiting for the seabirds to leave the area. Coast Survey would work toward incorporating seabird molting seasons into its survey planning over the next few years. Survey environmental windows can coincide with molting seasons of any protected seabird, particularly in Alaska but, in most cases, it is practicable to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine the best times to survey in sensitive areas.

Mysticetes, otariids and manatees cannot typically hear in the 50 -500 kHz frequency range underwater, and are not at risk for acoustic harassment from side scan sonar and multibeam echosounders. Single beam echosounders can operate as low as 12 kHz, but due to their narrow, downward-facing orientation, these echosounders do not exhibit spherical spreading (see further discussion below). Walruses can hear in frequencies up to 50 kHz, and many odontocetes and phocids can hear in frequencies greater than 50 kHz, putting these marine mammal groups at risk for exhibiting avoidance behavior in the presence of high frequency sound from Coast Survey operational side scan sonar and multibeam echosounders (Richardson et al. 1995, Southall et al. 2007). Coast Survey's multibeam and side scan sonar systems have a high peak source level (~215-235 dB) at the moment the sound wave is generated in the water from the echosounder. The sound intensity level decreases rapidly, however, as the energy per unit area is reduced (\"transmission loss\") through spreading loss and absorbed as sound is converted to heat through attenuation (Urick 1983, Au andHastings 2008). The sound from higher frequency echosounders used by Coast Survey for typical coastal surveys attenuates much more quickly than the lower frequency sound used in deep water or seismic surveys, such as those surveys often associated with naval operations, and decreases in intensity as it moves away from the sound source. To overcome the effects of absorption, shallow water bathymetric echosounders use a high output power in order to visualize a clear return and accurately measure water depths with high precision. Sound from echosounders used during regular hydrographic survey operations could lead to behavioral changes in marine mammals that might affect migration, feeding, breeding, and the ability to avoid predators (Au and Hastings 2008). One method for estimating the potential effects of high frequency underwater sound on marine mammals is to assess the minimum distance the animal needs to be from the sound source in order to avoid a change in behavior. The method described below is based on the Southall, et al. (2007) and Richardson, et al. (1995) method of calculating threshold radii of echosounders (Weber 2008). The sound pressure level (SPL) at a distance R from an echosounder received by an animal in the water is dependent upon the peak source pressure level at the sound source (SL peak ) and transmission loss due to spherical spreading (20log 10 R) and absorption loss (\u03b1R), where \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient for the echosounder at a given frequency (Richardson et al. 1995). At a distance R from the echosounder, the SPL experienced by the animal would be: where \u03b1 = 0.036(freq 1.5 ) (Richardson et al. 1995, Southall et al. 2007 The equation above demonstrates how sound from a higher frequency echosounder experiences a much more rapid absorption loss than a low frequency echosounder with the same peak source pressure level. The MATLAB script in Appendix K solves for R at the 190, 180, and 160 dB received SPL with user inputs of frequency and peak sound source pressure level of each echosounder that would be used during Coast Survey in-house and contractor surveys in 2012. The calculated radii (R) for the 190, 180, and 160 dB received SPLs are included in the table of echosounders with specifications and SPLs in Appendix L. Note that these radii are theoretical and based on the assumption of spherical spreading from an acoustic source. In practice, the acoustic energy of hydrographic echosounders and side scan sonars is limited by the downward-facing orientation of the transmit beam (Weber 2008)in water depths shallower than most of the 190, 180, and 160 dB radii, resulting in the majority of the energy lost to interaction with the seabed before reaching the maximum range possible in the water column. This is true particularly for single-beam echosounders, whose narrow along-track and across-track beam widths would be barely noticeable among a background of standard depth sounders found on almost all small and large vessels. Coast Survey estimated take (\"Level B harassment\" under the Marine Mammal Protection Act) by underwater acoustic harassment of marine mammals based on animal density and the total ensonified area of each survey. This method, although simplistic, produces conservative estimates based on the assumption of spherical spreading and assumes the entire seafloor within each survey area to be ensonified twice (\"200 percent coverage\") during each survey. Acoustic take estimations were grouped by major geographic region as required under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and included the following regions: Alaska (Beaufort/Chukchi Seas, Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska estimated separately), Pacific Coast, Atlantic Coast, and Gulf of Mexico. Coast Survey did not calculate take estimates for marine mammals in the Pacific Islands and Caribbean geographic regions, since no hydrographic survey projects are planned for those areas in the next several years. Animal densities were derived from several different sources, which are listed for each species in Appendix M. In cases where a source provided densities for more than one season, Coast Survey chose the season with the highest density. When Coast Survey could not locate species-specific animal densities, a proxy or surrogate species' density was used to derive a population-adjusted density. The method for estimating take included the following steps: 1. Total planned survey area (in square nautical miles) per year for all projects in each major geographic region was estimated based on the average percentage of surveys occurring in that region (completed and planned projects) 2010-13. 2. For each region, this value was multiplied by two (each area is assumed to be ensonified at least twice during a survey to meet Coast Survey's \"full bottom coverage\" standards for hydrographic surveys). 3. For each region, take estimates were calculated by multiplying this value by the animal density for each non-deep water marine mammal species. The table in Appendix M summarizes Level B take estimations for affected marine mammal species in each major geographic region calculated from the steps listed above. Estimates were made for one year based on the assumption that Coast Survey would survey approximately 3,000 square nautical miles per year based on a typical appropriations year. Of that number, approximately 1,700 square nautical miles would be surveyed in Alaska waters (300 in Beaufort/Chukchi Seas, 400 in Bering Sea, and 1,000 in the Gulf of Alaska), 100 in Pacific coastal waters, 800 in Atlantic coastal waters, and 400 in Gulf of Mexico waters. For example, killer whales in Alaska have a mean density of 0.034299 animals per square nautical mile (Zerbini et al. 2007). Each year, Coast Survey would survey approximately 300 square nautical miles in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. The annual take estimate for killer whales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (21 animals/year) was calculated using the steps outlined above: Beaufort/Chukchi annual survey area = 300 square nautical miles/year 300 square nautical miles/year x 2 = 600 square nautical miles/year ensonified 600 square nautical miles/year x 0.034299 killer whales/square nautical mile = 21 killer whales/year In some cases there were no density values for a particular species and Coast Survey used proxy or surrogate values that were then adjusted for population values, when known. For example, when estimating bowhead whale densities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, Coast Survey used density values for killer whales based on the predator/prey relationship between bowheads and killer whales. The mean killer whale density of 0.034299 animals per square nautical mile was multiplied by the ratio between the latest bowhead population estimate (10,545) and killer whale population estimate (3,213) for an estimated bowhead whale density of 0.112569 animals per square nautical mile. The annual take estimate (68 animals/year) for bowhead whales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas would be calculated using the derived density value as follows: Beaufort/Chukchi annual survey area = 300 square nautical miles/year 300 square nautical miles/year x 2 = 600 square nautical miles/year ensonified 600 square nautical miles/year x 0.112569 bowhead whales/square nautical mile = 68 bowheads/year Based on the results of its evaluation, Coast Survey has concluded that underwater sound associated with hydrographic survey operations may lead to temporary avoidance behavior (acoustic harassment), but is unlikely to injure marine mammals in the long term. These mammals include the toothed whales, true seals, and walruses that can hear within the lower end of the frequency range of Coast Survey echosounders."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of Vessel Noise on Pinnipeds", "text": "Vessel noise (in air) has the potential to result in the disturbance of pinnipeds on land or foraging in the water during nearshore operations. Some projects occur in or near rookeries or haulouts during mating or pupping seasons. In 2011, for example, one survey project in the Krenitzin Islands occurred near a Steller sea lion rookery on Akun Island, Alaska. Vessel noise could scare male pinnipeds into the water, crushing newborn pups. There is no scientific evidence supporting a disturbance of nesting or breeding sea turtles and seabirds in the presence of a ship surveying in nearshore waters. Mitigation Measures: NOAA and contractor small vessels (used in the nearshore areas of a survey) operate 8-12 hours per day. Depending on the size of the colony and how close one would need to be to disturb the pinnipeds, these nearshore areas may only take one or two days to survey. Survey technicians and boat operators can survey areas further offshore while performing daily observations and waiting for the animals to leave the rookery, haulout, or foraging area before moving closer to shore to complete nearshore survey work. Coast Survey would incorporate mating and pupping seasons, particularly those of depleted pinniped species such as the Steller sea lion, into its survey planning over the next few years. Survey environmental windows often coincide with pinniped pupping or mating seasons, particularly in Alaska but, in most cases, it is practicable to work with the Fisheries Service to determine the best times to survey in sensitive areas.

For Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act designates NOAA as the responsible party for identifying and protecting the historic, cultural, and archaeological properties (e.g., historic shipwrecks) within the sanctuary limits. As part of an existing protocol between Coast Survey and the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, Coast Survey would notify state historic preservation officers and state archaeologists, as well as other managers of federally protected areas (e.g., sanctuary supervisors) of its intent to conduct a hydrographic survey. Coast Survey would provide these managers, including the state historic preservation officer, a description of the project, including any tide gauges that must be installed on shore, and a graphic of the survey area. These managers have 30 days to comment about known historic properties or to request an additional survey. Upon completion of a hydrographic survey, Coast Survey would notify the appropriate state historic preservation officers, state archaeologists and federal managers about the availability of the survey report and metadata. Managers have an additional 30 days to comment on any findings. As part of this protocol, Coast Survey would not allow its actions to negatively affect historic properties. If a particular archaeological resource is clearly revealed in the survey data, the manager may request that the data be retracted from the National Geodetic Data Center website. Coast Survey may also chart the wreck if it is a danger to navigation (in less than 60 feet water depths) as a general, unidentified obstruction. If the wreck is not a hazard to navigation, parties can ask Coast Survey to keep the wreck off of nautical charts. When conducting a survey within a sanctuary, Coast Survey and cultural resource managers would work together to identify known wreck locations within the survey area and would establish survey protocols such that the side scan sonar towfish and cable would not strike or snag the wreck, keeping negative impacts to the resource at a minimum. Surveying and mapping of the cultural environment can have several positive effects for the sanctuary. Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary is federally-mandated to inventory, identify, and assess the historic, cultural, and archaeological properties and resources in the waters it manages. Coast Survey brings a level of surveying expertise and equipment currently unavailable to the sanctuary, and plays a critical role in the sanctuary's mandated responsibilities to search for shipwrecks and other archaeological resources.

Hydrographic surveys also add to the general vessel traffic in the marine environment. Each year, Coast Survey will survey approximately 700 square nautical miles in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas. Table 3 includes Level B Acoustic Harassment take estimates for the bowhead and beluga whale, as well as the ringed, spotted, ribbon, and bearded seals. Avoidance behavior among Arctic subsistence marine mammal species is the most common behavioral change to be expected, particularly as survey ships approach, with beluga whales in particular traveling several kilometers away from the ship's track (Richardson et al. 1995). Bowhead whales will typically try to outswim the vessel, but will swim away from the ship as it moves closer (Richardson et al. 1995). Beluga and bowhead whales will usually return to the site following displacement after one or two days if the ship has moved to a different area (Richardson et al. 1995). Arctic seals are typically associated with the sea ice and are therefore unlikely to be located near survey ships, which must avoid the ice; however, if seals are swimming far away from the ice, they will most likely exhibit shorter term avoidance behavior in the presence of a ship (Richardson et al. 1995). Coast Survey will make every possible effort to avoid areas where these animals are known to be concentrated or if they are observed during operations in order to minimize disturbances, and does not expect to observe a reduction in species numbers a result of its operations. The above take estimates are very conservative, with a \"take\" defined as any exposure to an operational single beam or multibeam echosounder. In reality, the animals are not likely to remain within the ensonified area during operations and injury would be minimal or negligible; however, for the purpose of this analysis, avoidance behavior is considered a Level B acoustic harassment \"take.\" Throughout the year, the Anchorage-based Alaska navigation manager, who undertakes Coast Survey customer service and outreach in the region, works with local Alaska Native communities and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Native Corporations to discuss planned surveys. The navigation manager works with his or her shipping contacts around the state to contact the appropriate local shipping, political, and Alaska Native representatives in each coastal village. Typically, Native leadership (political and Native governmental) is interested in where Coast Survey is surveying, which activities would take place during the survey, and how the survey could affect their communities. These meetings also provide Coast Survey with valuable insights into local knowledge. They inform Coast Survey about particular areas where surveys would disturb subsistence fishing or hunting activities, and give Coast Survey notice on areas to avoid surveying. In the summer of 2011, the Director of Coast Survey, Marine Chart Division Chief, and Alaska navigation manager met with local and regional Alaska Native leadership in Kotzebue, AK and participated in a radio interview on Radio KOTZ (AM 720) to discuss survey plans and navigation products in the approaches to Kotzebue Sound. Further, the NOAA Ship Fairweather engaged in public outreach during the 2011 survey operations in Kotzebue Sound. Scientific support stations were located on shore and many local residents were very interested and supportive of these activities. The Fairweather engaged in a similar type of outreach when conducting the Bering Strait Survey in 2010. Select local village residents of Little Diomede were hosted aboard the Fairweather for a tour of survey operations. The village also hosted the crew of the Fairweather for an evening of traditional song, dance, and food. The village residents were very engaged in the survey activities and provided guide services for installation of support stations atop Little Diomede Island. The lessons learned from these two surveys have provided invaluable outreach lessons that continue to be implemented in planning for future surveys. In 2012, the Alaska navigation manager attended the Arctic Open Water Meeting (March 6-8, 2012) in Anchorage in order to develop and strengthen relationships with Alaska Native advocacy groups throughout the state. He also met with members of the Kawerak community in Nome (April 26, 2012) and Inupiat communities as part of the North Slope Borough Assembly Meeting (August 7, 2012) to discuss planned surveys in those areas. The aforementioned meetings in the Alaskan villages were broadcast on local AM radio stations throughout the region. Mitigation Measures: Coast Survey's principal mitigation measure is avoidance of areas used by Alaska Native communities for the bowhead whale, beluga whale, and Arctic seal hunts during each hunting season. The Coast Survey Alaska navigation manager will continue to work with communities to avoid surveying in known subsistence hunting areas at the times of year when the hunt will occur. Coast Survey will make every attempt possible to avoid interfering with bowhead and beluga whale, and Arctic seal subsistence activities. The Coast Survey Alaska navigation manager will continue to work with local Alaska Native communities to avoid surveying in known subsistence hunting areas at the times of year when the hunt will occur. Coast Survey would make every attempt possible to avoid interfering with bowhead and beluga whale, Arctic seal, walrus, and polar bear subsistence activities.

In discussions with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Coast Survey has reviewed the potential effects of aircraft noise on marine mammals and fish, as well as sea turtles and seabirds during nesting. While operations would temporarily add to the general noise in the air, aircraft noise from lidar operations would not have a long-term adverse impact on the environment based on the short duration (five hour sorties), low intensity (aircraft flies 1,000 -1,200 feet above the land and sea surface), and limited survey locations (less than one lidar survey per year)."}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Measures:", "text": "To mitigate the effects of aircraft noise on marine mammals and nesting sea turtles, aircraft operators would follow Federal Aviation Administration and state or territorial regulations and limitations on aircraft operations in sensitive areas, including minimum altitude requirements.

Survey vessels introduce a new source of vessel noise into the existing baseline of underwater ambient sound, particularly in heavy commercial traffic areas. However, the cumulative impact of this one new source of vessel noise is negligible in the context of thousands of much larger and louder ships that travel in and out of busy harbors. Large ships, such as tankers and container ships, produce low frequency (1 -500 Hz) sound source levels of 172 -198 dB re 1 \u03bcPa (Richardson et al. 1995). Sound from smaller ships and boats, such as Coast Survey vessels, produces low-medium frequency (1 Hz -6 kHz) sound source levels of approximately 145 -170 dB re 1 \u03bcPa (Richardson et al. 1995). All vessels in the water, except for the smallest boats, are typically equipped with a single-beam depth finder that is used for navigational safety in conjunction with nautical charts. These depth finders determine the instantaneous depth underneath the vessel in real-time, although they operate in the same manner as a typical survey single beam echosounder. Depth finders usually operate at 50 and 200 kHz (Husick 2009). Coast Survey echosounders would add to the existing levels of high frequency sound in the marine environment, but the baseline level of such sound is low since standard depth finders (as with all single beam echosounders) are downward-facing with a minimal beam range. The principles of spherical spreading discussed in Section 5.1.1.2 do not apply to these types of single-beam echosounders. Climate change effects, particularly in the higher latitudes where melting sea ice and major shifts in temperature bands are predicted, could lead to behavioral changes in marine mammals. Ice seals, beluga and bowhead whales, polar bears, and walruses conduct each major life history function in relation to the position of the sea ice. These animals might shift their migration, breeding, and birthing patterns to adjust to climate change effects (Perrin et al. 2009). If these same animals exhibit avoidance behavior in the presence of survey vessels, the effects could be compounded during survey projects. Energy depletion and disorientation are the direct behavioral effects of vessel avoidance, but could lead to indirect, yet more serious effects such as the inability to reach the sea ice in time for breeding and giving birth, which ultimately could affect the survival of some species (Perrin et al. 2009). However, the vast range of area in which NOAA vessels operate coupled with the low number of vessel hours per project point to low cumulative impacts on species even when the effects of climate change are taken into account. Given the uncertainty and degree of climate change effects, Coast Survey has evaluated the effects of its actions on the environment using conservative range estimates at every stage, including the spatial and temporal habitat range, as well as the functional hearing ranges for marine mammals."}, {"section_title": "OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND COMPLIANCE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Endangered Species Act", "text": "Endangered Species Act Section 7(a)(2) requires federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service before implementing an action that may affect listed species or their critical habitat (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1531-1544).

While Coast Survey has established a finding of no adverse effect on shipwrecks from its actions, it recognizes that survey projects designed to detect and display underwater wrecks and other obstructions could be misused by recreational divers following the discovery of a historical wreck. Therefore, at the beginning of each survey season, Coast Survey would contact the state historic preservation officer from each state where a survey is going to be conducted in state waters. Where a tide gauge is to be installed on land, the location of this tide gauge would be identified. An example of this letter is in Appendix O.

Tide gauges and GPS base stations can be located on private, public, or Native American lands. The procedure for obtaining land access and necessary permits varies depending on the type of land: 1. Private lands: For short-term stations (less than 12 months), written permissions are not always pursued. Verbal permission and documentation of the landowner's contact information is generally sufficient. License Agreements (access permits) are established and maintained with the property owner for long-term installations. The License Agreement typically is valid for five years and allows NOAA access to the property for annual inspections and emergency visits. NOAA discusses the agreement with the property owner during the reconnaissance of the site and secures permission before the actual agreement is prepared and signed. The License Agreement is a standard format approved by National Ocean Service General Counsel and the NOAA Real Property Office that has delegated signature authority to a Coast Survey representative. 2. State-owned lands: Before installation of stations on land owned by a state, NOAA pursues agreements or permits with the appropriate state permitting agency, such as a state's department of environmental protection or similar state agency. Coast Survey can use the National Ocean Service-approved License Agreement or a state agency form. 3. Native American lands: Agreements or permits on Native American lands are prepared after consultation between NOAA representatives and the appropriate Native American tribe legal counsel. Coast Survey can use the National Ocean Service-approved License Agreement or a form used by the Native American tribe. 4. Federal lands: Before installation of stations located on federal lands, NOAA pursues agreement or permits with the appropriate federal agency, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, or Bureau of Land Management. Any agreements or permits for federal land use are negotiated between the legal counsels of each agency, and Coast Survey can use the National Ocean Service-approved License Agreement or a form used by the other federal agency."}, {"section_title": "COMMENTS ON DRAFT PEA", "text": "While the draft version of this PEA was available for public review, Coast Survey received one comment on July 22, 2012 from the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) supporting Coast Survey's efforts to provide nautical charts in Arctic Waters, yet stressed the importance for NOAA to assess the impacts of its activities on Alaska Native subsistence marine mammals. ASRC identifies two areas of concern: identification and mitigation of potential impacts and the effects of climate change. ASRC supports Coast Survey's current efforts to incorporate mitigation measures into vessel operations and outreach activities between the Alaska Navigation Manager and local communities; however, ASRC requests that Coast Survey explain how it will enforce specific measures. Since the draft PEA was available for public review, Coast Survey has worked closely with NMFS' Office of Protected Resources under the Marine Mammal Protection Act as it developed its application for a Letter of Authorization. Coast Survey anticipates a Letter of Authorization under the Marine Mammal Protection Act for limited incidental take on or around October 1, 2013. The final PEA and the Letter of Authorization application include much more detailed discussions of Coast Survey's actions in the Arctic, including mitigation measures and outreach activities, than what was provided in the draft of this PEA. The application also includes a Plan of Cooperation. ASRC expressed concern with take estimates from underwater sound harassment of marine mammals. In response, Coast Survey recalculated its take estimates for regions within Alaska rather than for the entire state, with the primary region for Arctic subsistence species in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas. Earlier take estimates also included a mathematical error that has been corrected. The revised take estimates are listed in Section 5.1.1.7. Coast Survey's principal mitigation measure is avoidance of areas used by Alaska Native communities for the bowhead whale, beluga whale, and Arctic seal hunts during each hunting season. As ASRC has requested, the Coast Survey Alaska navigation manager will continue to work with communities to avoid surveying in known subsistence hunting areas at the times of year when the hunt will occur. Coast Survey will make every attempt possible to avoid interfering with bowhead and beluga whale, and Arctic seal subsistence activities. ASRC also identified a concern with Coast Survey's discussion of potential climate change effects in the \"Cumulative Impacts\" Section 5.3 based on the uncertainty around climate change effects in general and the speculative nature of the discussion in this section. Coast Survey has noted ASRC's concern and reviewed this section; however, Coast Survey has decided that the cumulative impacts dicussion is inherently speculative and the language should be left unchanged to meet its requirements under NEPA. Humpback Whale Humpback whales are found in all oceans around the world, in coastal and oceanic waters. Animals prefer to feed on the shelf break and continental slope, and travel along specific migration routes in deep water along coasts or submarine mountains. North Pacific stocks of humpback whales feed along the entire Pacific and Alaska Coast into the Bering Sea in the summer and breed in the winter in Hawaii. The Gulf of Maine stock of whales feed in the Gulf of Maine in the summer.
