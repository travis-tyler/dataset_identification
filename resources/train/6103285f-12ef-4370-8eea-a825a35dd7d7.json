These events enhance the dispersion and concentration of natural and anthropogenic chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms that could adversely affect the health and resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems in coming years. The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a strategy to define baseline and post-event sediment-bound environmental health (EH) stressors (hereafter referred to as the Sediment-Bound Contaminant Resiliency and Response [SCoRR] strategy). A tiered, multimetric approach will be used to (1) identify and map contaminant sources and potential exposure pathways for human and ecological receptors, (2) define the baseline mixtures of EH stressors present in sediments and correlations of relevance, (3) document post-event changes in EH stressors present in sediments, and (4) establish and apply metrics to quantify changes in coastal resilience associated with sediment-bound contaminants. Integration of this information provides a means to improve assessment of the baseline status of a complex system and the significance of changes in contaminant hazards due to storm-induced (episodic) and SLR (incremental) disturbances. This report describes the purpose and design of the SCoRR strategy and the methods used to construct a decision support tool to identify candidate sampling stations vulnerable to contaminants that may be mobilized by coastal storms."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Hurricane Sandy Science Plan (Buxton and others, 2013) was designed and implemented in 2012 to supplement response activities that took place before and immediately after the storm struck the eastern coast of the United States. This plan was organized into five themes to characterize the forces and effects of Hurricane Sandy. The primary objective of the fourth theme (Impacts on Environmental Quality and Persisting Contaminant Exposures) was to determine the extent of potential longterm exposures of humans and ecosystems to contaminants in the nearshore marine and beach environments resulting from Hurricane Sandy (Buxton and others, 2013; Caskie, 2013) . Specific activities included-\n\u2022 Reconnaissance sampling of contaminants in sediments collected in nearshore environments. These samples underwent in vitro bioassay screening for toxicity and chemical activities, as well as a battery of legacy and emerging chemical contaminant analyses (Fischer and others, 2015) .\n\u2022 Comparison of contaminant occurrence before and after Hurricane Sandy.\n\u2022 Assessment of major contaminant sources from compromised infrastructure, such as wastewater-treatment plants and on-site septic systems.\n\u2022 Assessment of beach-dune replenishment activities that potentially present a hazard to humans through leaching of toxic metals or other contaminants from source materials such as previously anoxic back-bay sediments.\n\u2022 Evaluation of ecological receptors, including potentially harmful levels of contaminants in bluefish and mussel tissue, consumption of which can be a concern for humans and wildlife.\nSufficient data were collected during this study from key areas that had been evaluated as part of current and past monitoring programs such that mapping of baseline contamination sources and receptors along the northeast coast of the United States could be initiated. The data will be evaluated to identify processes controlling contaminant exposure and dispersal, and initial assessments of contaminant conditions throughout the northeast coast will be provided as part of ongoing work. However, the lack of an existing multimetric sediment-quality assessment of integrated environmental health (EH) stressors forced reliance on historical data collected by the USGS and other agencies (particularly the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] ) that lacked the density, extent, and analyses necessary to rigorously evaluate EH effects throughout the region.\nA major limitation in conducting contaminant analyses after a storm and evaluating the resiliency of the environment and mitigation efforts is the lack of prestorm contaminant concentrations for comparative purposes. This data gap underscores the need for conducting baseline sediment-quality assessments in both nearshore and aquatic environments at locations relevant to human and ecological health. Resource managers also require assessment of ecosystem benefits associated with sediment quality for which no established methods of quantification are available. To be successful, these assessments and accompanying metrics require method development and carefully designed data-collection strategies to be completed to facilitate implementation and application in order to evaluate mitigation efforts."}, {"section_title": "Study Objectives", "text": "In order to appropriately measure the resiliency of the coastal environment to contaminant threats, a strategy for assessing the relation of contaminant changes and EH receptor effects is needed. The Sediment-Bound Contaminant Resiliency and Response (SCoRR) strategy addresses this need by establishing metrics for quantifying environmental change and associated threats to ecosystems and humans from sedimentbound contaminants (which include chemical and biological constituents capable of causing adverse effects on humans or biota), either through episodic events such as hurricanes or through incremental changes such as sea-level rise (SLR), in order to provide information critical to adaptive management strategies employed by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and other Federal and State agencies. The objectives of this study are to:\n1. Develop a strategy to assess contaminant threats to humans and ecosystems induced by SLR and severe storms.\n2.

Coastal watershed counties are defined as counties in which at least 15 percent of the area drains to coastal watersheds as delineated by NOAA and the USGS, and represent areas where changes in land use and water quality most directly affect coastal ecosystems (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2015) . Once successfully demonstrated, this strategy can be implemented or integrated into existing USGS networks in the Northeast. The strategy could be extended to other regions by adapting protocols and metrics developed for the Northeast to address region-specific conditions and stressors."}, {"section_title": "Strategy Design", "text": "The SCoRR strategy has two operational modes, Resiliency Mode and Response Mode, each of which is defined by five key sequential tasks (prioritization, acquisition, analysis, reporting, and evaluation) ( fig. 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Resiliency Mode", "text": "Under normal (non-event-related) conditions, SCoRR operates in Resiliency Mode to provide baseline sedimentquality data to document incremental changes (for example, SLR) and define and apply EH metrics based on sediment quality. Sampling stations within the study area are prioritized for sampling on the basis of their receptor-based EH relevance and systematic criteria that are used to evaluate proximal contaminant sources and storm vulnerabilities (described in detail farther on in this report). Samples are acquired in coordination with local USGS Water Science Center (WSC) staff on an established schedule. Collected samples are evaluated with a battery of qualitative chemical and biological activity screening tools reflective of a tiered analytical and data integration strategy that will identify vulnerable human and environmental receptors, the sediment-bound contaminants present, and the biological activity and potential effects resulting from exposure to characterized sediments. A subset of samples is subjected to additional quantitative analyses to verify and assure the quality of the results and to compare them to analytical results for Response Mode (post-event) samples. Resiliency Mode results will be reported through a SCoRR Web site by using map-based visualization tools and an online database. Interpretations of these results will be accessible to, and their availability will be communicated to, stakeholders and the scientific community."}, {"section_title": "Response Mode", "text": "When a severe storm (anticipated to be damaging to human or ecological communities and multistate in scale) is forecast to affect the study area, Resiliency Mode activities are suspended and Response Mode is initiated to characterize the EH effects of the event. During the demonstration of the SCoRR strategy, the decision to activate Response Mode activities is made by the SCoRR team lead on the basis of input from personnel from other USGS programs and networks with hazard-response duties and the SCoRR staff.\nFormal criteria for Response Mode activation will need to be defined once the strategy has been proven successful and established as an ongoing operational capacity. Stations prioritized during Resiliency Mode will be evaluated to ensure that adequate pre-event data exist within the projected storm track. If data are insufficient, pre-event samples will be collected from priority locations. Crews will be deployed post-event to resample these stations, allowing direct evaluation of effects, as well as redefining baseline sediment-quality conditions for these areas. During the demonstration of this strategy, stations will be resampled once. All samples collected will be analyzed by using qualitative screening tools and confirmatory quantitative analyses (discussed in detail below). Response Mode results will be distributed and reviewed internally as rapidly as possible for dissemination to health officials, wildlife managers, and other key decision makers, and then released to the public on the SCoRR Web site.\nBoth Resiliency and Response Mode data will be evaluated by using a series of EH metrics developed to allow for the identification of potentially harmful EH effects from episodic stressors. A plan for developing these metrics is "}, {"section_title": "Analytical Approach and SiteSelection Criteria", "text": "A multimetric, tiered data integration and analytical approach ( fig. 3 ) has been developed as part of SCoRR. This approach will be used to identify vulnerable human and environmental receptors, the presence or absence of sedimentbound contaminants, and the biological activity of and potential effects of exposure to sediments from these settings. It will demonstrate the linkage between the geospatial analyses used to identify potential sources of contamination, historical sediment contaminant data, and associated biological effects data (Tier 1), and will then be applied to the design of the SCoRR strategy. Subsequent qualitative (Tier 2) and quantitative (Tier 3) analytics will be used to document baseline (Resiliency Mode) and event-based (Response Mode) EH stressors. Subsequent biological uptake, fate, transport, and exposure studies (Tier 4) can be designed and prioritized on the basis of SCoRR strategy findings.\nThousands of candidate locations will be characterized and prioritized in the Tier 1 phase of the study. The following criteria will be used to identify potential sampling stations: The vulnerability of these locations to coastal storms and contaminant threats will be assessed and attributed to each location by using a decision support tool described farther on in this report (see section called Decision Support Tool for Station Prioritization). The same criteria will be used during Response Mode, with each of the above criteria modified to consider storm track, intensity, and timing based on SWaTH network activity and National Weather Service (NWS) predictions."}, {"section_title": "Decision Support Tool for Station Prioritization Background", "text": "As a result of the scale of the study area and the number of potential sampling stations, a methodology was required to categorize and evaluate potential stations in order to prioritize a representative subset of stations for sampling during Resiliency and Response Modes. Furthermore, the methodology had to remain flexible and adaptable given the broad array of geologic, land-use, and climatic variables encompassed by the SCoRR study region.\nTo prioritize sampling stations, a decision support tool was developed that assigns a prioritization value to each station on the basis of proximal contaminant sources and storm vulnerabilities. The tool uses public, nationally available data sources provided by the EPA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the NWS to define contaminant sources and storm vulnerabilities. Contaminant point sources are assigned an initial potential contamination hazard rank ranging from 1 to 4 on the basis of the perceived toxicity, volatility, and environmental or human exposure potential of the contaminant present. Historical and probabilistic storm vulnerability data are then used to weight the potential hazard ranks wherever the contaminant source and storm vulnerability datasets intersect. Proximity analyses are then used to identify nearby contaminant sources for each sampling location, and a final sampling-station priority value is determined by summing proximal storm-weighted potential contamination hazard ranks by using a distance weighting equation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "Two EPA data sources were used to define potential contaminant point sources: the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2015b) and the Facility Registry Service (FRS) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2015a) databases. The TRI tracks the management of facilities with toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health and the environment. Each facility is required to report annually the quantities of each chemical stored, produced, and (or) released on-or offsite. The TRI includes facility coordinates, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, a list of the types and quantities of chemicals (contaminants) housed or released at each facility, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers, and unique facility identification numbers that can be used to access additional facility information online (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). The FRS database catalogs businesses, facilities, sites, or locations subject to environmental regulations or of interest to the EPA and the programs it administers and (or) enforces (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2015a). The FRS database provides similar facility information to the TRI database, but includes additional facilities that do not fall under the TRI designation (for example, facilities that are not permitted to release toxic substances). Unlike the TRI, the FRS does not provide information about the types and quantities of chemicals housed, produced, or released at each facility. Instead, the FRS details any regulations associated with each facility entry, providing a means to identify additional facilities outside the TRI that may release contaminants in the event of a disaster."}, {"section_title": "Data Preparation", "text": "Substantial quality assurance of the TRI and FRS data was required to remove duplicate and (or) incomplete facility records prior to analysis. Datasets were organized into a spreadsheet and erroneous or incomplete records were removed by using Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae. As a result of the large number of records and the self-reported nature of the data, however, it is likely that duplicate or erroneous records remain. While problematic, the inclusion of these records does not substantially affect the prioritization process because of the conservative (protective) assumptions (described below) used, and does not detract from the demonstration of the SCoRR strategy.\nAfter each dataset was quality assured, contaminant rankings were applied to each facility record by following the methodology outlined below. Data tables of ranked facilities were then converted into point shapefiles on the basis of each facility's latitude and longitude coordinates for geospatial analyses. In the event that a facility reported multiple constituents and (or) programs of interest to the EPA, the highest ranking constituent or program was selected to represent the facility, thereby ensuring that the highest potential contaminant hazard ranking attributable to that facility was used."}, {"section_title": "Ranking of Contaminant Source Data", "text": "TRI and FRS facilities were assigned potential contaminant hazard ranks ranging from 1 to 4 on the basis of the contaminant hazard(s) present at each facility. Different ranking methods were required for the TRI and FRS data because of inherent differences in the facility information available from the two data sources (that is, the TRI details the type and quantity of chemicals, whereas the FRS details only the regulations applicable to each facility).\nTo rank the TRI records, a prioritization scheme developed by Olsen and others (2013) was modified and applied to each recorded constituent in the TRI database by matching CAS numbers. Olsen and others (2013) evaluated and prioritized 2,541 constituents for national-and regional-scale monitoring of water and sediment as part of the USGS National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) National Target Analyte Strategy (NTAS) work group (see appendix A [at end of report] for additional information). Constituents were prioritized on the basis of available information detailing physical and chemical properties, observed or predicted environmental occurrence and fate, and observed or anticipated adverse effects on human or aquatic health (Olsen and others, 2013) . One of three prioritization tiers (hereafter referred to as Olsen tiers to distinguish them from the tiers associated with the SCoRR strategy) was assigned to each constituent (by CAS number) and separated into groups for sediment and water monitoring. Constituents listed in Olsen Tier 1 have the highest priority for monitoring because of the likelihood of their occurrence in the environment or the likelihood of potential adverse effects on human health or aquatic life. Constituents in Olsen Tier 2 have intermediate priority for monitoring because of lower environmental occurrence and (or) lesser effects on human health or aquatic life. Olsen Tier 3 is composed of constituents that have low or no priority for monitoring because of minimal to no environmental occurrence and (or) human or ecological health effects. Also included in Olsen Tier 3 are constituents for which evidence of occurrence or effects is insufficient to place them in Olsen Tier 2.\nCAS numbers were used to apply prioritization values from Olsen and others (2013) to each listed constituent record in the TRI database (see appendix B [at end of report] for more information). Tier ranks from both the water and sediment categories were considered and adjusted to conform to a four-tier SCoRR ranking system detailed in tables 1 and 2. A four-tier system was used to accommodate the alternative ranking methodology used for the FRS data described below. A total of 91 additional constituents listed in the TRI were not included in analysis. These additional constituents were Solubility, mobility, toxicity, bioaccumulation/absorption, and decomposition characteristics were compiled from the HSDB and used to rank each constituent according to methodology (see appendix B for more information). The methodology of Olsen and others (2013) could not be applied to the FRS records because the FRS lacks specific information about the constituents stored, released, or produced by a given facility. Therefore, three attribute fields were used to assess the potential contaminant hazard rank of a facility: Each question was answered with a yes (1) or no (0), and then answers were summed to obtain the potential contaminant hazard rank ranging from 1 (minimal potential contaminant threat) to 4 (high potential contaminant threat). The maximum rank obtained from the resulting ranks across each of the three attribute fields was selected to represent the overall potential contaminant hazard rank for each facility. For example, if a facility had a rank of 4 for its Program Type, 2 for its Interest Type, and 2 for its Site Type, the overall potential contaminant hazard rank for the facility would be 4. (Note that multiple entries are possible for one facility for both the Program Type and Interest Type attributes.)\nTo minimize ranking bias, the questionnaire was administered to a panel of five experts (four internal to the project and one external) for their assessment. The experts were instructed to answer the questions using only the definitions specified in the EPA FRS documentation for each Environmental Program, Interest, or Site Type. Answers from all of the experts were pooled and a consensus rank was assigned on the basis of the most frequently given rank. Appendix C (at end of report) details the attribute values for each of the three fields, the results of the expert panel ranking exercise, and the final consensus rank for each attribute variable."}, {"section_title": "Definition of Storm Vulnerability", "text": "Storm vulnerabilities were defined by using an additive weighting approach based on the intersections between the location of the facility and the presence or absence of the facility within three storm vulnerability datasets:\n1. FEMA 100-year flood zones derived from the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), representing areas with a 1-percent annual chance of being inundated during a flood event (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2015); 2. Historical storm-track data from the extended International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS), modified to represent return intervals for inland tropical storms (Kruk and others, 2010) ; and 3. Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) CAT 1-5 inundation zones (Jelesnianski and others, 1992) , simplified to polygons representing the inundation extent of a storm of each magnitude.\nThese datasets were selected because of their relative consistency across the SCoRR study region, and their specificity to coastal storm hazards. The inclusion of 100-year flood zones provides a means to extend the analysis inland, thereby capturing vulnerabilities to noncyclonic storm events such as \"Nor'easters.\" Overlay analyses were used to identify facilities within each storm vulnerability zone (fig. 4) . Initial potential contaminant hazard ranks for facilities within one or more storm vulnerability zones were then weighted using the following equation:\nwhere RF x is the storm vulnerability-weighted potential contaminant hazard rank of contaminant source x, RI x is the initial potential contaminant hazard rank, S is the binary \"in or out\" code for the 100-year flood zone, V i is the binary \"in or out\" code for each CAT zone i, and r i is the return interval of the magnitude storm associated with CAT zone V i .\nResulting ranks represent the contaminant hazard potential and associated storm vulnerabilities of each facility location, with higher values indicating a greater hazard and (or) vulnerability than lower values ( fig. 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Attribution of Contaminant and Storm Vulnerability to Stations", "text": "To prioritize sampling locations, proximity analyses were used to identify and accumulate nearby ranked TRI and FRS facilities. A 2-kilometer search radius was used to identify all facilities near each sampling location ( fig. 6 ). Storm vulnerability-weighted ranks were then pooled for each facility, and a distance-weighted average was calculated from the pooled ranks for each sampling location:\nwhere R x is the distance-weighted average rank for sampling location x, K is the search radius, RF i is the storm vulnerability-weighted potential contaminant hazard rank for facility i, and d i is the distance between sampling location x and facility i.\nThis method was used to minimize computational requirements and to maintain a generalized framework that could be easily implemented across a broad spatial extent. The resulting distance-weighted potential contaminant hazard ranks represent the contaminant and storm vulnerabilities associated with each sampling location. High prioritization values indicate an abundance of highly ranked contaminant sources near the sampling location that reside within one or more storm vulnerability zones. Low prioritization values represent sampling locations with few or no nearby contaminant sources that also may not reside within any storm vulnerability zones."}, {"section_title": "GREAT SOUTH BAY A T L A N T I C O C E A N ATLANTIC OCEAN L on g Is la nd So un d", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sampling Methods", "text": "Sediment-quality samples will be collected using established sampling techniques that will be modified as needed on the basis of station characteristics (including but not limited to open water, flood plains, and recreational fields) and documented in a SCoRR standard operating procedure (SOP).

In Response Mode, established sampling schedules throughout the network will be suspended and resources will be redirected to the portion of the network within the projected storm path. Available data for sampling stations in the projected storm path will be evaluated and pre-event samples will be collected if samples have not yet been collected at those stations during Resiliency Mode. Post-event samples will be collected to determine the EH and resiliency consequences of the event. Samples will be collected and shipped following protocols established for each analysis to USGS laboratories for further processing, analysis, and archiving. Additional sample volumes will be collected and archived to allow for re-analysis or subsequent research.\nOne round of Resiliency Mode samples will be collected from approximately 200 stations and approximately 50 stations will be sampled in Response Mode during at least one event in 2015 to demonstrate the SCoRR strategy. If this demonstration is successful and SCoRR is deployed as a longterm network, Resiliency Mode sampling ideally would be continued in a cyclical manner such that data will be refreshed on a time scale commensurate with the station's priority and dynamics (for example, a station located in an estuary experiencing SLR, containing sensitive/threatened species, and colocated with a SET-MH station may merit more frequent sampling than a station with similar EH relevance located outside the 100-year flood zone). This process will allow for evaluations of both incremental and episodic changes in EH stressors.

Well-established, published methods are available for all of these measurements in soil and marine sediment samples. These datasets will provide the necessary background information to identify where contaminants reside within the sample matrix (absorptive or reactive minerals and fine fractions). When appropriate, scanning electron microscopy will be used to characterize and verify contaminant residence and associations within the sediment matrix.\nMethod development associated with this strategy focuses on comparing laboratory (Tier 3) to field portable instrument data (Tier 2). The portable instrumentation includes radioisotope survey meters, portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and portable reflectance spectroscopy.

When chemical screening data strongly indicate a contaminant-adverse outcome linkage, targeted contaminant analysis becomes more useful (Doyle and others, 2014) . Two major objectives of the organic-chemistry component of this strategy focus on the assessment of severe-storm-derived change:\n1. Identification of unknown environmental contaminants through multiple lines of evidence, and 2. Evaluation of organic chemical contributions to adverse biological effects.\nTier 2 analysis for polar contaminants includes chemical screening approaches of whole sediment and sediment extracts (as appropriate), based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), liquid chromatography/ultraviolet-visible (LC/UV-Vis), and liquid chromatography fluorescence (LC/fluorescence) spectroscopies (Abbas and others, 2008; Denis and others, 2012; Ferretto and others, 2014) .

Sediment characteristics (for example, carbon content, mineralogy, pH, and salinity) can affect the availability of contaminants to biota and, therefore, affect their biological activity. Such mixtures of sediment characteristics may lead to vastly different biological effects in exposed biota that are not necessarily predictable by using chemical analyses alone. Bioassays offer a means to provide fast and relatively inexpensive determinations of the integrated biological effects of chemical mixtures and the specific activation of complex receptor signaling pathways. Endpoints such as acute and chronic toxicity are unambiguous outcomes of exposure and are of notable value for screening; however, subtle perturbations that do not lead to imminent death, but instead to other adverse outcomes, are likely to be more common in environmental matrices.\nSediments will be evaluated with a series of bioassays to test an array of endpoints and make use of commercially available and research-oriented assay platforms.

Metrics will be developed by spiking the standardized materials with selected contaminants and measuring the resulting biological activity. Results from sampled stations will be related to these metrics by principal component analysis on the basis of key traits (for example, mineralogy or organic carbon content)."}, {"section_title": "Data Delivery and Communication of Results", "text": "Use of screening-level analytical methods and biological assays (Tier 2) is critical to the success of the SCoRR strategy. Collectively, these methods provide rapid, interdisciplinary results capable of informing the later phase of event response and the early phases of recovery when applied in Response Mode. Tier 2 results are also vital to the prioritization of stations for subsequent analyses (Tiers 3 and 4) in Resiliency Mode. Although individually they are not new technologies, the Tier 2 analyses yield a new class of data for the conventional databases of the USGS. These data relate to existing USGS methods, but are intended to provide qualitative or semiquantitative assessment of the chemical and biological contaminants present. Where possible and appropriate, guidance for defining the data standards and the appropriate use of Tier 2 results and their relation to the established USGS methods with which they are associated will be made publicly available.\nResiliency and Response Mode results will be reported in an online relational database hosted and visualized on a mapbased SCoRR Web page. Each point location on the mapper will indicate corresponding assets (for example, tide gage, SET-MH, SWaTH deployments), sampling priority, and links to USGS provisional and approved data, as well as other siterelevant and regional information. The combined mapper and relational database will allow stakeholders to retrieve network data and ancillary information on demand and will serve as the primary data-reporting mechanism for the SCoRR network. The Web site will be designed to recognize users who employ mobile platforms and will allow station and (or) regional update alerts for subscribers. Links to the SCoRR work plan, SOPs, affiliated USGS and stakeholder networks, and any interpretive reports generated from the results obtained during Resiliency and Response Modes will be highlighted on the SCoRR Web page and in other public USGS forums.\nFor Response Mode, network response and interpreted results of analyses of the pre-and post-event samples will be described, and potential follow-up studies using Tier 3 analyses at existing stations and possible broader screening with Tier 2 analytics (if appropriate) will be presented. Results will give decision makers access to timely information, with interpretations geared toward anticipated EH concerns. This plan will ensure that critical information is available to stakeholders and the USGS to help guide their response to future events.\nThe following products will be made publicly available through the SCoRR Web page (http://health.usgs.gov/scorr/) and other USGS information dissemination mechanisms as appropriate: "}]
