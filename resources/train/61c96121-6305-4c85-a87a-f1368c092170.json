Surge obtained using the AWM more closely matched the observed water levels than that computed using H*Wind; however, this may be due to the neglect of the contribution of wave setup to the surge, especially in exposed areas. Several geographically distinct storm surge response regimes, some characterized by multisurge pulses, were identified and described."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the years since Hurricane Katrina (2005) , considerable effort has been invested into improving our ability to model coastal storm surge. The resulting advancements have included the development of more accurate and realistic meteorological forcing, the addition of more complete physics such as the contribution of short waves to surge, and the development of model grids with very high resolution and detail to capture bathymetric and topographic features in areas near and on shore (Resio and Westerink 2008) . One cost of these model enhancements has been a substantial escalation in the required computer time (Tanaka et al. 2010) . Consequently, their uses have been limited mostly to forensic hindcast studies (Ebersole et al. 2007) , design studies (USACE 2009), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program studies (FEMA 2008) , all of which allow flexible limits on model execution time. On the other hand, real-time forecasting applications have much more strict model execution time constraints and, therefore, have tended to favor simpler model implementations (e.g., coarse grid resolution) that are able to produce output more rapidly.\nWith the increased availability of high-performance computing systems containing many thousands of compute cores, (e.g., National Science Foundation TeraGrid supercomputing clusters), it is becoming possible to expeditiously run 3-5-day storm surge forecasts using a more computationally intensive modeling system. This raises the question of whether the additional computational effort is worthwhile, given the expected error in storm surge due to inaccuracies in the tropical cyclone forecast meteorology. The answer is not obvious because there have been no previous studies of how forecast meteorology error translates into storm surge error.\nThe evolution and convergence of modeled storm surge were examined using a high-resolution implementation of the Advanced Circulation Coastal Ocean and Storm Surge (ADCIRC) model. This is accomplished using the final 20 meteorological forecasts (covering the final 5 days) during which Hurricane Gustav (2008) made landfall west of the Mississippi River delta. The results provide a detailed perspective, for this specific storm, of the variability in the storm surge due to variability in the meteorological forecast and how this changes as the storm approaches landfall. The conclusions of this analysis depend on both the quality of the meteorological forecasts and on the landfall location and, therefore, cannot be generalized to all storms in all locations. Nevertheless, this first attempt to translate variability in forecast meteorology into storm surge variability provides useful insights for guiding the potential use of storm surge models for forecast purposes.\nThe 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was highly destructive, with many casualties and widespread devastation in the Caribbean, Central America, and the United States. For the first time in recorded history, six consecutive tropical cyclones (Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike) made landfall along the U.S. coastline, and three major hurricanes (Gustav, Ike, and Paloma) hit Cuba. Hanna, Ike, and Gustav, the deadliest hurricanes of the season, caused several hundred casualties in the Caribbean (WMO 2008) .\nThe state of Louisiana, bordered on the south by the warm Gulf of Mexico, is particularly prone to hurricane impact. More than 53 hurricanes (20 of them major, i.e., of category 3 strength or higher) have struck Louisiana since 1851 (Blake et al. 2007 ). The Mississippi River flows through the state, forming a delta that extends close to the continental shelf break. Tidal freshwater wetlands are formed at outlets of coastal rivers with low topographic relief at or near sea level (Doyle et al. 2007 ). However, dams, levees, and artificial channeling have reduced the amount of sediment transported down the Mississippi River, over its banks and into the delta, decreasing the rate of land accretion and increasing the net subsidence. Channelization, subsidence, and sea level rise have caused intrusions of saltwater, resulting in the widespread loss of wetlands and accelerated erosion. Thus, the southern part of the state is characterized by disappearing wetlands, swamps, cypress forest, freshwater marsh, and low-lying coastal plains that are highly susceptible to flooding from hurricane storm surge.\nHurricane Gustav was the seventh tropical storm and the third hurricane of the 2008 season. It began as a tropical wave in the Lesser Antilles, then rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a hurricane in 12 h (Beven and Kimberlain 2009) . The lowest central pressure reported by hurricane reconnaissance aircraft was 941 mb at 2154 UTC on 30 August. It struck Cuba as a category 4 storm. Hurricane Gustav reached its peak intensity, with 1-min maximum sustained winds of 69 m s 21 at 10 m reported as it made landfall in western Cuba. It was the most intense storm to hit Cuba in five decades. A peak wind gust of 95 m s 21 was recorded in Paso Real San Diego, the highest recorded wind speeds in Cuba's history (WMO 2008) . Hurricane Gustav decreased in strength in the Gulf of Mexico due to increased wind shear and intrusions of dry air. It grew in size as it crossed the Gulf, making landfall at 1500 UTC [1000 central daylight time (CDT)] on 1 September 2008 near Cocodrie, Louisiana. At landfall, Hurricane Gustav was a category 2 storm on the SaffirSimpson scale, with 1-min maximum sustained winds of 46 m s"}, {"section_title": "21", "text": ". Hurricane-force winds extended out 130 km and tropical-storm-force winds extended 370 km from the center in the northeast quadrant (Beven and Kimberlain 2009) . The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and its forward motion slowed as it crossed southern and western Louisiana later on 1 September. Its status was downgraded to a tropical depression on 2 September over northwestern Louisiana.\nThe hurricane caused widespread storm surge along the northern Gulf coast, with above-normal water levels reported from the Florida panhandle to the upper Texas coast, including Lake Pontchartrain. Surges of 3.6-4 m occurred along the Louisiana coast in the Mississippi River Delta southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana, with surges of 2.7-3 m in other portions of southeastern Louisiana. The storm surge minimally overtopped levees and floodwalls in parts of the New Orleans metropolitan area, but did not cause widespread inundation of the city and its suburbs (Beven and Kimberlain 2009) , as occurred during Katrina.\nGustav triggered one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history (more than 2 million people), as traffic streamed northbound along two contraflow (traffic lane reversal to aid in evacuation) routes out of Louisiana and into Mississippi. This included a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, ordered the morning of 31 August 2008. In addition to evacuation, numerous storm-instigated activities occurred throughout the predicted storm impact zone, including closing flood control gates, positioning and deploying first responders and maintenance/ repair crews, and developing initial damage assessments for federal aid requests. The success of these activities during Gustav and future tropical cyclones depends on the forecast accuracy of the storm and the ability to forecast the accompanying storm surge. While there have been extensive evaluations of hurricane forecast accuracy (Franklin 2008; Rogers 2009) , there have been few systematic evaluations of hurricane storm surge forecast accuracy, particularly using recently developed highresolution storm surge models.\nIn this paper, we analyze the variability and convergence of numerical model storm surge forecasts using a high-resolution implementation of the ADCIRC model forced by an asymmetric gradient wind model (AWM) that ingests track information issued from the final 20 forecast advisories provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for Hurricane Gustav (2008) . We also compare hindcast water levels forced by 1) the AWM using NHC best-track data, 2) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) HRD H*Wind analyses, and 3) gridded North American Mesoscale (NAM) model wind fields to evaluate the storm surge model skill. The storm surge and wind model are described in section 2. Forecast simulations, tracks, and storm surge predictions are described in sections 3 and 4. Hindcast water levels and wind results are reported in section 5. Comparisons of simulation results with observations are described in section 6."}, {"section_title": "Storm surge and wind models a. ADCIRC model", "text": "The Hurricane Gustav forecast and hindcast simulations were conducted with the ADCIRC model version 47_31.1 (Luettich et al. 1992; Luettich and Westerink 2006) using the high-resolution southern Louisiana grid (SL15v3r9a). ADCIRC has been used extensively to compute storm surge and inundation (Blain et al. 1994; Luettich et al. 1996; Blain and McManus 1998; Blain et al. 1998; Lynch et al. 2004; Graber et al. 2006; Dietsche et al. 2007; Mattocks and Forbes 2008; Fleming et al. 2008; Westerink et al. 2008; Dietrich et al. 2010; Bunya et al. 2010 ). SL15 grids have been employed in several recent storm surge studies in southern Louisiana (FEMA 2008; USACE 2009 ). The unstructured, triangular grid consists of more than 2 million computational nodes; includes all waters in the western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico that lie to the west of the 608W meridian; has its highest resolution (less than 30 m) in southern Louisiana (Figs. 1a and 1b) ; and is referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).\nThe ADCIRC model runs in a vertical reference frame that is based on mean sea level (MSL) plus a seasonal steric height correction. The relationship between MSL and NAVD88 was determined at 11 NOAA tide gauge stations using relationships provided by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and the NOAA Center for Operational and Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) plus a correction to account for recent relative sea level rise. Relationships at the NOAA tide stations are referenced to the National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001; see Table 1 , Fig. 2a ). They were averaged across the region to yield a single representative (Fig. 2a) , it can be seen that the differences between NAVD88 and MSL are greater in southern Louisiana and less in eastern Louisiana. Therefore, a constant adjustment would tend to slightly underpredict surge in southern Louisiana and overpredict it in eastern Louisiana. Sea level trends available for three stations in the region [Grand Isle, Louisiana, shown in Fig. 2b; Eugene Island, Louisiana; and Sabine Pass, Texas; NOAA (2009a,b) ] were used to estimate the relative sea level rise from 2001, when the vertical data were reconciled (Table 1; Shields 2003) , to 2008, when Hurricane Gustav made landfall in Louisiana. The average value for relative sea level rise at the three stations during this period is 0.057 m.\nSteric effects due to thermal expansion of the ocean water are prominent in the Gulf of Mexico. This signal is present in the harmonic constants computed by NOAA for the long-term solar annual (Sa) and semiannual (Ssa) tidal constituents. These harmonic constants were used to compute the amplitude of this effect during the same period of the year as Hurricane Gustav (Table 2 , Fig. 2c) .\nThe NOAA sea level record for the year 2008 was also extracted from stations in the area of interest to take into account the state of the ocean during that year. The mean was removed and a 30-day low-pass Gaussian filter was applied, then the average for all stations was calculated (Table 2 , Fig. 2c ). Both long-and short-term contributions (0.081 and 0.114 m, respectively) were averaged to provide an estimate of the seasonal fluctuation in sea level of 0.098 m.\nA total vertical reference level adjustment of 0.366 m was used and comprised the sum of the three individual components discussed above."}, {"section_title": "b. Asymmetric wind model", "text": "The asymmetric gradient wind model (AWM), described by Mattocks and Forbes (2008) , was used to generate wind fields for the storm surge forecasts and hindcast simulations of Hurricane Gustav. The AWM is based on the Holland (1980) gradient wind model with the added feature that the radius of maximum winds (R max ) varies azimuthally around the cyclone to capture the asymmetry in the shape of the storm. The tangential velocity is derived from the pressure field, assuming the winds are in gradient wind balance. Thus, when the tangential acceleration vanishes and the flow is parallel to the isobars, the equation that describes a three-way balance between the pressure gradient and the centrifugal and Coriolis forces can be inverted and solved to obtain the tangential 1-min wind velocity (V asym ) valid at the top of the boundary layer:\nwhere R max is a function of the azimuthal angle u, r a is the density of the air, f 5 2V sin(latitude) is the Coriolis force, V is the rotational frequency of the earth, r is the radial distance from the storm center, B is the Holland shape parameter, and P b and P c are the background and central pressures, respectively. Since the AWM model is extremely computationally efficient, the winds can be generated ''on the fly'' during the simulation-no precalculation or storage of large gridded wind fields is required. The winds are calculated exactly at ADCIRC grid node locations, directly coupled to the ocean model at every time step, thereby eliminating interpolation artifacts that can occur when gridded vortex wind fields are interpolated in space and time. Here, R max , which varies with quadrant and forecast time, is computed dynamically at each time step from the significant radii of the 1-min sustained 51.4, 32.9, 25.7, or 17.5 m s 21 (100, 64, 50, or 34 kt) isotachs in the four quadrants of the storm. The NHC forecast advisories provide wind speeds for the entire forecast period; however, wind radii are only provided for the first 72 h. Therefore, the radii after 72 h were persisted for the remainder of the forecast. The Holland shape parameter, B, which determines the steepness of the eyewall and the strength of the winds far from the center, is computed dynamically at each time step and is dependent \nupon the maximum wind speed, whose location is uncertain. We assume B to be constant in all quadrants. The winds were modified by the land surface characteristics through incorporation of a directionally dependent surface roughness length that takes into account the land cover upwind and sheltering due to forest canopy )."}, {"section_title": "Forecast simulations a. Hurricane Gustav", "text": "Hurricane Gustav forecast simulations were initiated at 1200 UTC on 28 August 2008, 5 days before the predicted landfall. The simulations were cold started using a hyperbolic tangent ramp function to prevent model initialization shock, to allow the spinup transients to dissipate, and to achieve full wind forcing after 6 h.\nInformation from the NHC forecast advisory/official (OFCL) tracks was used for the forecast period, while best-track data were used for the hindcast period. The forecasts use only information available from NHC forecast advisories, plus general assumptions that are used in real-time forecast systems. Pressure trends were derived from previous storms in the Gulf of Mexico for strengthening and weakening storm phases. These trends were used to calculate the central pressure in the forecasts, which is not available in the NHC forecast advisories. The best-track storm positions are issued at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC cycles while the forecast advisories are issued at 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100 UTC, staggered in time with respect to the best-track data. The hurricane eye locations are linearly interpolated in time in between NHC-issued track positions. Table 3 shows the days and times of the best-track data and forecast advisories and the duration of the forecast simulations. The best-track information was used only for the period before the advisory time. Thus, a simulation of a specific forecast advisory number is comprised of the NHC best track starting from 1200 UTC on 28 August up to the last time prior to the forecast advisory, followed by the specified forecast advisory track information. Figure 3a shows the 20 different tropical cyclone forecast tracks and the best track, with colors denoting the advisory number. The track predictions are quite consistent; all show the storm advancing toward the northwest across the Gulf of Mexico. Zooming in on southeastern Louisiana (Fig. 3b) , the 20 forecast tracks show a spread of approximately 60 km in the landfall location. This is well within the NHC 5-yr average forecast error in storm track used to define the ''cone of uncertainty'' (NHC 2008) . The smallest NHC official mean (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) ) cone of uncertainty is 62 km (34 n mi) for a 12-h forecast. The cones of uncertainty for all other forecast times are much larger. If one visually compares the forecast storm tracks of Hurricane Gustav with those of Hurricane Ike (Forbes et al. 2010) , the latter seems a more erratic, more difficult storm to forecast. However, the OFCL forecast track error computed by NHC is actually higher for Gustav (Beven and Kimberlain 2009) from forecast hours 12 to 96 than for Ike (Berg 2009 ). The forecast track error for 120 h is the only instance in which the track error for Hurricane Gustav is less than the track error for Hurricane Ike."}, {"section_title": "b. Forecast track locations", "text": "The distance between each of the advisory tracks and the best track at 298N was calculated (Fig. 4) . The forecast tracks from earlier advisories lie to the west of the best track while, beginning with track 26 (36 h before landfall), they lie mainly to the east of the best track.\nc. Forecast wind speeds and storm size Figure 5a shows the evolution of the maximum 1-min sustained wind speed (V max ) with latitude for the different forecast advisories. The values of V max for the intermediate advisories reach 72 m s 21 . During earlier and later advisories, the maximum wind speeds hover around 50-55 m s 21 . The V max of the best track is larger than earlier advisories for lower latitudes and substantially lower for latitudes greater than 268N. At landfall, V max decays abruptly. Figure 5b shows the evolution of the storm size [radius of maximum wind speed, R max , in the right-front quadrant (RFQ)] with latitude for the different advisories calculated by the AWM. As the storm approaches landfall (approximately 298N), all of the forecasts predict weakening (decreasing V max ) and growth in size (increasing R max ), which is typical for storms approaching land in this region (FEMA 2008) . The R max for the best track is larger than earlier advisories and remains larger for most advisories. It first decreases in size at landfall and then increases in size after landfall, though not as much as the forecast advisories predicted."}, {"section_title": "Forecast surge", "text": "The forecast surge response is evaluated by first determining the maximum event water surface elevation (also called the envelope of highest water or EOHW) at each node in the computational grid for each of the 20 forecast advisories. The average (section 4a), minimum and maximum of the maxima surface elevation (section 4b) provide a quantitative measure of the mean maximum surface elevation and the envelope or range of the possible inundation scenarios that could occur with the different advisories and, therefore, provide the mean and best-and worst-case scenarios for which a threatened coastal community should prepare. The EOHW values are compared for four selected advisories (section 4c) and between ensembles of advisories (section 4d) to characterize the surge variability over the 5 days of forecasts.\nAs a point of reference for the forecast advisory evaluation, the maximum surge generated using the best track is presented in Fig. 6a . Water driven across Chandeleur Sound and Lake Borgne produces a high surge in the funnel-shaped region to the east of New Orleans. High-water elevations are generated to the southwest of Breton Sound along the Mississippi River, with amplification southeast of New Orleans at English Turn. This is related to the fairly uniform easterly winds driving a steady state set up to the east of the river, which changes once the storm passes (Resio and Westerink 2008; Dietrich et al. 2010) . High elevations also occur to the west of Barataria Bay and penetrate inland in areas east of Highway 1. Figure 6b shows the wind swath produced by the AWM. Ten-minute wind speeds higher than 45 m s 21 extend approximately 60 km to the east of the storm track. Computations at exact ADCIRC node locations and at fine temporal resolution create smoothly varying wind fields over the ocean. The dark blue areas on land indicate areas where the model assumes the surface wind speed is zero due to the presence of sheltering from a substantial forest canopy .\nA more detailed discussion of the best-track results is presented in section 5.\na. 20-advisory, ensemble-averaged maximum surge Figure 7a shows the ensemble-averaged maximum event elevation over the full set of 20 forecast advisories. This ensemble-averaged surge exceeds 1.5 m throughout most of coastal Louisiana, with maximum surge occurring against land or engineered structures that face toward the southeast. East of the Mississippi River Delta, the ensemble average reaches approximately 3 m in the funnel-shaped region at the entrance to the Intracoastal Waterway (ICWW) to the east of New Orleans and in the Caernarvon marsh to the northwest of Breton Sound. Surge also accumulates against the land bridge-railroad bed that separates Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain, the western Mississippi coastline, and the western end of Lake Pontchartrain. Comparable ensemble-averaged surge also occurs west of the Mississippi delta seaward of Grand Isle and north of Timbalier and Terrebonne Bays.\nb. 20-advisory, ensemble minimum and maximum surge\nThe ensemble minimum of the maximum elevations (Fig. 7b) is spatially similar to, but about 1 m lower than, the ensemble-averaged surge throughout much of the region. These lowest maximum surge values also occur against southeastward-facing topography to the northwest of Breton Sound, seaward of Grand Isle, and in the sounds north of Grand Isle. Even for this most favorable set of responses, there is still significant inundation, with surge as high as 2.5 m.\nThe maximum of the maximum event elevations for the 20-forecast advisory ensemble (Fig. 7c) exhibits a spatial pattern similar to the ensemble-averaged surge, with highest surge along southeast-facing topography and values about 1 m greater than the ensemble-averaged surge. The ensemble maximum surge is greatest northwest of Terrebonne Bay, where it reaches approximately 5 m. The ensemble maximum surge indicates significant surge west of the actual storm track in the Atchafalaya Bay and Vermillion Bay regions (918-928W). Earlier advisories predicted storm tracks that were well to the west of the actual track (Fig. 4) , generating significant surge in these areas, while the later advisory tracks kept these areas generally on the west, low-surge side of the storm. This yielded high ensemble maximum surges but substantially lower ensemble-averaged surge.\nThe ensemble member (forecast advisory number) that contributes to the 20-advisory, ensemble maximum event elevation at each node in the computational grid was identified (Fig. 8) . In general, earlier advisories contribute to the maximum surge in western Louisiana, while later advisories produce maximum elevations in Lake Pontchartrain and along most of the eastern coastline. This is consistent with the general west-to-east progression of the predicted storm tracks (Fig. 4) . There is one notable exception in the southwest corner of Fig. 7 , where there is a contribution to the maximum surface water elevation by advisory 32 associated with a large R max (Fig. 5b) and higher wind intensity.\nOverall, for the 20-forecast advisory ensemble there is a range in surge of approximately 4 m in western Louisiana and 2 m throughout much of the rest of the region.\nc. Surge sensitivity to track location, storm intensity, and size\nComparisons of maximum surge produced by four selected forecast advisories are presented and compared to the surge computed using the best track to illustrate the sensitivity to variations in storm parameters. The storm tracks for advisories 21 and 28 are separated by about 60 km at landfall and bracket the best track (Fig. 9 ). Both had similar sizes and intensities but their tracks were to the left and to right of the best track, respectively. They are used as examples to demonstrate the impact of track location. The western track (advisory 21) generated substantial surge and inundation west of the Mississippi Delta, north and west of the Terrebonne Bay area, and along the western Louisiana coastline, reaching 4 m in magnitude (Fig. 10a) and overpredicting the surge associated with the best track by up to 3 m in this region (Fig. 11a) . The R max calculated by the AWM for this advisory ranges from 40-48 km in the RFQ to 27-31 km in the right-rear quadrant (RRQ) of the storm. Thus, the strongest onshore winds occur west of the delta and along the western Louisiana shoreline. The lateral extent of the storm is large enough that significant surge also occurs east of the delta in Breton Sound and in the funnel region, although this is up to 1 m less than that due to the best track.\nThe 60-km shift in track location of advisory 28 focuses much stronger onshore winds east of the Mississippi River and only creates onshore winds along the western Louisiana shoreline from the back side of the storm, after it had weakened considerably. Consequently, surge is greatest east of the Mississippi delta, in the area northwest of Breton Sound, in the funnel region, and between Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain (Fig. 10b) . The maximum elevations are much lower than those produced by advisory 21 in western Louisiana. These compare reasonably well with the best track, with typical differences of 1 m or less (Fig. 11b) . The R max calculated by the AWM ranges from 30-41 km in the RFQ to 18-30 km in the RRQ. Advisories 26 and 31 were selected to evaluate the impacts of wind intensity and storm size on the surge. The track locations are both close to, but to the right of, the best track. The maximum 1-min sustained wind speeds, V max , for advisories 26 and 31 are 67 and 51 m s 21 , respectively, while their radii of maximum winds R max in the RFQ are 35 and 54 km. The surge produced by advisory 31 (Fig. 10d) is lower in magnitude but extends more toward the eastern Louisiana coast than the surge generated by advisory 26 (Fig. 10c) due to the larger R max in the former. Advisory 26 produced a surge distribution similar to advisory 28 but it was higher closer to the storm track. The smaller, stronger storm produced by advisory 26 typically generates 0.5-1-mhigher surge than the best track immediately east of the storm track and approximately the same amount less than the best track farther to the east. Advisory 31 is comparable to the best track both in track location and storm parameters; thus, its surge is within 0.5 m of the best track.\nIn summary, when the sizes of the storm and wind speeds are comparable (Figs. 10a and 10b) , the maximum elevation is mostly driven by track orientation with surges deviating more than 3 m from the surge produced by the best-track data. Smaller and stronger storms produce higher maximum elevations close to the right side of the track, while weaker larger storms produce surges extending over larger areas on the right side of the storm (Figs. 10c and 10d )."}, {"section_title": "d. Forecast ensemble convergence", "text": "Differences between the maximum and minimum of the maximum elevations for ensembles consisting of the final 20, 15, 10, and 5 forecast advisories plus the best track were computed to examine the ensemble spread and the evolution of the forecast convergence (Fig. 12) . Even though advisories 33 and 34 were issued after landfall when the storm was inland, the trailing rearquadrant wraparound winds continued to create a significant amount of surge to the east of the storm. It is important to include them in the ensemble because they induced maxima in the surface water elevation in areas where the other advisories did not. Advisory 33 caused large maximum inundation areas to the west of the Chandeleur Islands, as seen in Fig. 8 . Advisory 34 caused smaller, more localized maxima.\nSurge differences in excess of 3 m occur in the 21-and 16-member ensembles west of 90.58W while surge differences up to 2 and 1 m, respectively, exist throughout much of the remainder of the domain. The surge variability is reduced significantly in the 11-and 6-member ensembles, typically to values under 1 and 0.3 m, respectively. The 11-member ensemble combines the final 2.5 days of forecast advisories. The root-mean-square (RMS) difference in maximum water elevation between each advisory and the best track ( Fig. 13) was calculated at each model node with depths less than 10 m for each forecast simulation over the area depicted in Fig. 1 . The RMS difference remains approximately constant with each forecast advisory until advisory 23, where it diminishes sharply and falls to a value of approximately 51 cm. Thereafter, it declines gradually (with the exception of advisory 25 when Gustav made landfall in western Cuba) with a downward trend of 218.6 cm day 21 . These analyses indicate continued systematic improvement in the surge convergence as the storm nears landfall.

Analyses are produced by compositing (cubic Bspline interpolating) all observations available in a given time window relative to the storm center onto an 88 3 88 grid. Observations include airborne sensors, offshore monitoring stations, land-based radar, and meteorological stations [U.S. Air Force and NOAA aircraft, ships, buoys, Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) platforms, and surface airways]. All data are quality controlled, then processed to conform to a common framework for height (10 m), exposure (marine or open terrain/overland), and averaging period (maximum sustained 1-min wind speed). Several hours of observations are usually required to provide sufficient data density and coverage for an analysis (Powell et al. 1998 ). In general, The H*Wind analyses provide the most accurate renditions of the winds at locations where wind measurements are available, but suffer from data sampling gaps when coverage is poor (e.g., lack of reconnaissance aircraft flights or dropwinsondes, anisotropic flight patterns, etc.). In addition, fluctuations in the size of storms (''breathing'' of the wind radii) in concurrent analyses have been noted by Moyer et al. (2007) due to the difficulties that wind scatterometers have in penetrating deep layers of precipitating clouds.\nThirty-six H*Wind gridded wind fields for Hurricane Gustav, spanning 1330 UTC 28 August to 0130 UTC 2 September 2008, were interpolated every 15 min using a Lagrangian interpolation technique to construct the wind forcing for the ADCIRC model. The pressure fields were interpolated from the best-track data to the times when the H*Wind analyses are available. A Holland model pressure profile was used to generate the pressure fields at model grid points at the same time interval as the wind speeds. The B parameter was specified using a regression curve fit from Vickery et al. (2000) . No background far-field winds were added beyond the 88 3 88 H*Wind grid domain."}, {"section_title": "e.

The NAM is based on the Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) core of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Janji\u0107 et al. 2010) . This is the same NMM dynamic core that is used in the Hurricane WRF (HWRF) model (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2010) ; however, no hurricane-specific initialization (vortex removal, bogus vortex insertion, vortex relocation), physics (drag saturation at high wind speeds, sea salt spray parameterization, flux coupling to an ocean model), or moving-nest vortex-tracking techniques are employed in the NAM."}, {"section_title": "f. Track comparison", "text": "The tracks corresponding to the different types of wind forcing are shown in Fig. 14. As the storm approaches the coastline, the H*Wind track is quite close to the best track but it later shifts farther to the west, while the NAM track drifts well to the east of the best track prior to landfall. An example of the wind distributions, in this case 1 h prior to landfall, is shown in Fig. 16 . Although the NAM model has the most sophisticated numerics and physics of the three wind generation systems, it does not resolve the inner-core structure or gradients of the hurricane and it substantially underpredicts the strength of the winds throughout the grid domain. The maximum 10-min, 10-m wind speeds in the H*Wind gridded wind analyses are 50% stronger (36 m s ). In general, the central pressure, maximum sustained wind speed, and, especially, the wind radii diagnosed by the H*Wind system can be quite different from those in the NHC forecast advisories and best-track files. However, in this instance, the central pressure and wind radii for the H*Wind and AWM wind fields are nearly identical. The major difference between the two products is due to the analyzed maximum 1-min sustained wind speeds of 41 m s 21 in the H*Wind analysis versus 47 m s 21 in the NHC best-track input data used to construct the AWM wind distribution. This causes much higher winds at the radius of maximum winds in the AWM forcing, a closed 30 m s 21 isotach surrounding the storm, and stronger winds that blow east-to-west across Lake Pontchartrain. Since the AWM produces an idealized representation of a hurricane, its winds are smooth and contain less structure than the H*Wind analyses of observed measurements from multiple data sources.

A high-amplitude secondary peak is also simulated that matches the observations. The higher amplitudes occur slightly earlier in the model simulations than in the observations. The H*Wind-forced elevations are below the observations but the maximum is better aligned in time. The observed maximum elevation at the IHNC station is slightly lower than the modeled AWM elevation.

The observed and modeled maximum elevations produced by AWM forcing are in general agreement, with values around 1.32-1.44 and 1.57-1.68 m, respectively, while those produced by the H*Wind and NAM wind forcing are approximately 0.49-0.81 m in magnitude. The first pulse appears when the winds blow from the northeast or east and pile up water on the west side of Lake Pontchartrain, creating a sharp elevation gradient from west to east. As the winds rotate clockwise from the east or southeast during the storm's passage, water is pushed toward the northwest side of the lake, and an evacuation of water occurs along the southern shore. Then, as the winds rotate further, the water starts piling up in the north-northwest side of the lake. Water from Lake Borgne is pushed through the Chef Menteur Pass and the Rigolets Strait into Lake Pontchartrain by the winds. This creates higher water elevations along the south shore of the lake, with water surface elevation differences larger than 3 m across these channels. As the winds turn toward the north-northwest, a sharp northwest-to-southeast gradient becomes noticeable and a drawdown is seen in the southern part of the lake. Later in the simulation, as the winds veer anticyclonically, begin blowing from the southsoutheast, and diminish in strength, the north-south elevation gradient relaxes, creating the highest elevations (larger than 1 m in amplitude) in the southern portions of the lake. The elevations produced by the H*Wind forcing generally follow this trend during the earlier pulses, but tend to underpredict the surge at the end of the simulation. The NAM wind forcing also reproduces the general pattern but it underestimates the magnitudes of the water-level fluctuations. The H*Wind-and NAM-forced model responses are directly related to the strength of the winds that blow across Lake Pontchartrain (see Fig. 16 ), which are smaller in magnitude than the AWM winds. This is consistent across the entire lake."}, {"section_title": "3) NORTH LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN RESPONSE", "text": "The north Lake Pontchartrain station time series of elevations are displayed in Figs. 18h and Table 4 and the map locations in Fig. 17.

On the other hand, the station to the south (SSS-LA-ORL14; Fig. 18j ) exhibits a triple pulse, as in the south Lake Pontchartrain regimes, with maximum observed elevations of 1.44 and 1.63 m forced by AWM winds. The distinct regimes are due to the evolution of the direction and magnitude of the winds with the passage of the hurricane with respect to the lake shoreline as explained in section 6b(2).

In general, the AWM-forced simulation results fall within the 20% error cone. Maximum elevations from the H*Windforced simulations are low, particularly at higher surges. NAM wind-forced ADCIRC simulations significantly underpredict the storm surge; amplitudes are typically 50% below the observed values.\nA summary of the errors in the hindcast of the maximum elevation is shown in Table 5 . The NAM winds produce a root-mean-square error (RMSE) in water elevation of 1.08 m, while H*Wind results in an RMSE of 0.69 m. The AWM yields an RMSE of 0.36 m.\nStorm surge predictions are clearly sensitive to the characteristics of the wind forcing applied. The wind fields from the NAM, H*Wind analysis, and AWM for Hurricane Gustav at 1 h before landfall are significantly different (Fig. 16) . It is therefore not surprising that these three disparate atmospheric forcings produce different water surface elevation responses. The underprediction of maximum water surface elevation in the H*Wind-forced simulations could be due to the exclusion of surface waves from the simulations.

Wind speed and direction", "text": "Time series of 10-min, 10-m wind speed and direction at eight NOAA meteorological stations and their counterparts from the AWM, H*Wind analyses, and the NAM model in Louisiana are presented in Figs. 21 and 22. In general, the NAM winds tend to follow the observations adequately during the earlier part of the simulations well before landfall, while the AWM starts generating winds 24-36 h prior to the passage of the storm (depending on R max ) and H*Wind analyses become available 12-24 h before landfall when the station falls into the 88 3 88 area covered by the moving H*Wind gridded analysis domain.\nWind speeds at stations along the Gulf of Mexico (Figs. 21a-d) show a decrease from stations east of the storm track (Figs. 21c and 21d ) to stations west of the track (Figs. 21a and 21b) . Observed wind speeds range from 13 m s 21 at Calcasieu Pass to 33 m s 21 at Pilots Station. The AWM reasonably captures the peaks at Calcasieu Pass and Amerada Pass, but overshoots those at Grand Isle and Pilots Station. The H*Wind and NAM wind speeds at Pilots Station (Fig. 21d) exhibit the signature of an outer eye traversal, but the observations do not support this. At Grand Isle (Fig. 21c) , the H*Wind analysis reproduces the eye of the storm, which is partially captured by the observations, but overpredicts the maximum wind speed, while the NAM model underpredicts it. At Amerada Pass (Fig. 21b) , west of the storm track, the H*Wind and NAM wind traces suggest that the eye of the storm passed over the station, but this is not corroborated by the observations. At Calcasieu Pass (Fig. 21a) , far to the west of the storm track, the NAM and observed wind speed time series are in close agreement, while the H*Wind peak overshoots the observed maximum wind speed.\nThe wind speeds at stations in south Lake Pontchartrain are shown in Figs. ). At Shell Beach (Fig. 21h) , the observed maximum wind speed of 24 m s 21 was well replicated by H*Wind (27 m s 21 ), while the AWM winds were much stronger (35 m s 21 ), and the NAM peak winds were much weaker (21 m s 21 ). Modeled wind directions are in reasonable agreement with the observations (Fig. 22) . The H*Wind analyses most faithfully replicate the observed wind directions, while there is a positive bias in the parameterized inflow angles in the AWM (which depend on the distance from the center of the storm) as the storm approaches the verification stations. This is particularly noticeable at stations to the west of the storm track, at Calcasieu Pass (Fig. 22a) and Amerada Pass (Fig. 22b) . The NAM wind directions generally shift too gradually, consistent with the simulated weak openeyewall structure (Fig. 16a) . In some cases, at Grand Isle (Fig. 22c) for example, the southerly wind shift is delayed by 4-6 h. Table 4 and the map locations in Fig. 17 . Table 4 and the map locations in Fig. 17 .\nIn summary, the AWM generates an idealized wind field based on NHC storm track parameters and seems to reproduce the hurricane's signal reasonably well albeit with a tendency to overpredict the maximum wind speed and to underestimate the cross-isobaric frictional inflow angle far from the center of the storm. While H*Winds are typically more accurate than the AWM, they are only available on an 88 3 88 grid. This limits their availability at the coast to about 1 day prior to landfall. Being observationally based, H*Wind is not available as a forecast product. The NAM winds follow the observed signal far ahead of the storm but tend to underpredict the storm's peak wind speeds, which is consistent with the known limitations of the model."}, {"section_title": "Summary and conclusions", "text": "In the years since Hurricane Katrina (2005), considerable effort has been invested into improving our ability to model coastal storm surge. Substantially greater computational requirements have accompanied the advancement in modeling capability. Typically, real-time forecasting applications have strict model execution time constraints and, therefore, have tended to favor simpler model implementations (e.g., coarse grid resolution) that are able to run quickly. With the increased availability of high-performance computing systems comprising thousands of compute cores, it is becoming possible to expeditiously run 3-5-day storm surge forecasts using a computationally intensive modeling system. The answer to the question of whether the additional computational effort is worthwhile, given the expected error in storm surge due to the inaccuracies in the tropical cyclone forecasts, is now within our grasp.\nThe evolution and convergence of modeled storm surge forecasts were examined using a high-resolution implementation of the ADCIRC coastal circulation and surge model. ADCIRC was forced using an asymmetric gradient wind model (AWM) that ingested NHC storm parameters for the final 20 meteorological forecasts (covering the final 5 days) for Hurricane Gustav (2008) . Hindcast simulations were also performed with ADCIRC using the AWM with the best track, H*Wind, and the NAM and compared to observational data to establish the basic model skill.\nCoupled directly to the ADCIRC coastal ocean model, the AWM can be used to generate hurricane wind distributions quickly, thereby maximizing the number of hours of forecast utility for operational storm surge prediction. The AWM model is sophisticated enough to produce a fairly realistic rendition of winds and storm surge, provided the NHC storm track parameters are reasonably accurate. When compared against meteorological measurements from NOAA and USGS stations, the AWM peak wind speeds tended to overpredict the observations close to the storm, but were quite reasonable over much of the storm's area of influence. In general, the AWM produced winds speeds stronger than H*Wind, while both the AWM and H*Wind winds were significantly stronger than NAM. The H*Wind system ingests all available meteorological observations to produce composite products; therefore, the H*Wind peak analyzed wind speeds at station locations are generally the closest to the anemometer measurements recorded by National Weather Service Forecast Offices. While extremely useful for hindcast studies, H*Wind provides analyses, not forecasts; so, it is not useful for storm surge prediction. Even though the NAM has been used successfully to drive coastal ocean models, it is not designed to resolve tropical cyclones and its winds are too weak to generate realistic magnitudes of storm surge. Therefore, it is not the preferred wind product for hurricane-forced storm surge simulations.\nComparisons of model water levels against observations from NOAA, USGS, and USACE stations show that the AWM-forced ADCIRC model generates greater surge for Hurricane Gustav than H*Wind and NAM wind forcing, which is consistent with higher AWM wind speeds. The AWM-forced ADCIRC model water levels best matched the observed maximum water levels at 40 stations in southern Louisiana, with an overall RMS error of 0.36 m. To increase the execution speed for forecasting purposes, ADCIRC was run without coupling to a wave model, although it is well known that waves provide additional surge due to wave setup. For Hurricane Katrina, this additional surge has been shown to exceed 0.5 m in areas that were exposed to deep water waves such as along the lower Mississippi River Delta, but was typically in the range of 0.1-0.3 m in more sheltered areas such as Mississippi Sound, Breton Sound, and Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain (Dietrich et al. 2010) . A comparable contribution due to wave setup is reasonable for Hurricane Gustav, as well. Thus, the slight overprediction of wind speed by the AWM to some extent compensated for the lack of explicit inclusion of waves in the surge computations. Further evaluation of the AWM model on additional storms should provide a better understanding of its error characteristics.\nOver the full 5 days of forecasts (NHC advisories 15-35) that were examined in this study, variability in the storm forecasts translated into surge variations of up to 4 m north and west of Terrebonne Bay and 2 m across much of the rest of the area. Throughout the entire region the RMS difference from the best-track hindcast exceeded 1 m. This was associated with the generally west to east migration of the predicted storm track, as well as the variability in the other storm parameters. The storm surge variability remained relatively constant during the first half of the analysis period; thereafter, it dropped significantly and converged steadily. The final 10-12 advisories, encompassing the last 2.5-3 days of the storm's lifetime, provide a reasonable estimate of the final storm surge and inundation.\nThis study provides a detailed perspective, for this specific storm, of the variability in the storm surge due to variability in the meteorological forecast and how this changes as the storm approaches landfall. The conclusions of this analysis depend on both the quality of the meteorological forecasts and on the landfall location and therefore cannot be generalized to all storms in all locations. Nevertheless, this first attempt to translate variability in forecast meteorology into storm surge variability provides useful insights for guiding the potential use of storm surge models for forecast purposes."}]
