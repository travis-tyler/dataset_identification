The pathologic hallmarks of AD include neuritic plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-b peptides (Ab) surrounded by dystrophic neurites, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, accompanied by neuronal and synaptic degeneration [1] . Currently, AD treatments only provide symptomatic benefit, but ongoing drug discovery efforts focus on developing disease-modifying drugs [2] . Diseasemodifying drugs will likely be most efficacious in early stages of AD; therefore, early and accurate AD diagnosis is essential for successful disease-modifying therapy development. However, in current clinical practice, a diagnosis of probable AD is made based on clinical symptoms, largely by the exclusion of other causes of dementia [3, 4] , with postmortem evidence of AD pathology required to confirm the diagnosis. It is well established, from combined clinical and neuropathologic studies [5, 6] , and clinical trials using amyloid-b PET scans [7] , that the accuracy of clinical criteria is suboptimal. Therefore, including biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of subjects could increase the accuracy of AD diagnosis, recognize earlier predementia disease stages, inform the dementia diagnosis when symptoms are atypical, and enrich clinical trial populations.\nThe use of Ab and tau protein biomarkers for AD diagnosis is recommended in recent research diagnostic guidelines for AD, the NIA-AA [8] [9] [10] , and IWG-2"}, {"section_title": "Q4", "text": "[11] criteria.

Tau PET tracers are also currently in development for AD evaluation [13] . However, PET imaging is expensive and requires specialist units and equipment and confers a radioactive burden on the patient. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have shown good, but not complete, concordance with amyloid-b PET classification [14] and may allow for robust, automated quantification of multiple pathologic markers of AD.\nThe Ab , phosphorylated tau (pTau), and total tau (tTau) CSF biomarkers are able to distinguish patients with AD versus controls as outlined in a recent meta-analysis [15] . These CSF biomarkers may also indicate an increased risk of future clinical progression to AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [16] [17] [18] [19] . Unfortunately, the currently available CSF assays for Ab , pTau, and tTau are limited by considerable variability between laboratories and assay batches [20, 21] . This has precluded the introduction of uniform, worldwide cutoff values and hindered the widespread introduction of CSF biomarkers into clinical practice. To improve the reliability of CSF biomarker measurement, Roche Diagnostics is developing fully automated Elecsys CSF immunoassays for Ab(1-42) [22] , as well as pTau and tTau (article in preparation) with high analytical performance and reduced variability across laboratories and batches. The Elecsys b-Amyloid CSF immunoassay has been assessed in the Alzheimer's Association Quality Control program since 2014 [23] , yielding mean between-laboratory CV"}, {"section_title": "Q6", "text": "of approximately 4% (compared with .15% for manual assays).\nPreanalytical procedures can influence the measured concentration of CSF biomarkers, preventing direct comparison of data between studies. In particular, Ab peptides are known to be prone to preanalytical influences such as tube type, freeze-thaw steps, transfer steps, and aliquot volume [24] [25] [26] [27] . Therefore, differences in preanalytical protocols need to be considered when directly comparing CSF measurements from different cohorts.\nIn the present study, we evaluated whether the newly developed Elecsys CSF immunoassays for the biomarkers Ab , pTau/Ab , and tTau/Ab(1-42) can be used to develop global cutoffs that can be transferred from one population to another, even when the CSF samples were analyzed in different laboratories.

Cutoffs for Ab , pTau/ Ab(1-42), and tTau/Ab(1-42) were specified at values that best separated the PET-positive and PET-negative groups and were robust to changes in measurement levels (see Section 2). For example, with respect to CSF Ab(1-42) levels, a lower cutoff would lead to a steep decline in PPA, without substantial increase in NPA (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Therefore, a compromise for the cutoff 1100 pg/mL was chosen [Ab(1-42) 1100 pg/mL: test positive; .1100 pg/mL: test negative] with high (91%) PPA and 72% NPA ( Table 2 ; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Based on similar considerations, the pTau/Ab(1-42) and tTau/Ab(1-42) ratio cutoffs were defined as follows: pTau/Ab(1-42) 5 0.022, tTau/ Ab(1-42) 5 0.26 ( Table 2) .\nThe distributions of CSF levels of pTau or tTau versus Ab(1-42) revealed two clusters that corresponded to the PET classification ( Fig. 2D and E) . A diagonal line reflecting the pTau/Ab(1-42) or tTau/Ab(1-42) cutoffs ( Fig. 2D and E) discriminated between a PET-positive and PET-negative classification better than a vertical line reflecting the Ab(1-42) single biomarker cutoff. This was consistent across clinical cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 3A-H ; Supplementary Table 5 ). Specifically, in the primary analysis population, CSF pTau/Ab(1-42) and tTau/Ab(1-42) cutoffs showed higher NPA (89%) than CSF Ab(1-42) alone (73%), at the same PPA (91%), resulting in OPA values of 90% (Table 2) . A strong correlation between pTau and tTau CSF measurements was seen ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).

Characteristics and demographics of the ADNI cohort are shown in Table 1 (see Supplementary  Table 1 for further details). It is worth noting that the median biomarker values were quite similar in the BioFINDER and ADNI cohorts (Table 1) and showed similar data distributions (Fig. 2) . Using the predefined transferred cutoffs, the CSF biomarkers Ab(1-42), pTau/Ab(1-42), and tTau/ Ab distinguished between the PET classifications ( Fig. 2F-H, respectively) with high PPA and NPA, OPA values of 84%-90%, and area under the curve values of 92%-96% (Table 2 ; Supplementary Fig. 1B) . The CSF pTau/Ab(1-42) ratio performed slightly better than the tTau/Ab(1-42) ratio; both ratios showed superior performance than Ab(1-42) alone, consistent with BioFINDER (part 1).\nThe distributions of pTau and tTau versus Ab(1-42) indicated that these CSF biomarkers were concordant with PET classification across clinical cohorts (including cognitively normal subjects) in ADNI ( Supplementary Fig. 3I-R) .

In part 1, we determined cutoffs for CSF Ab(1-42), pTau/Ab(1-42), and tTau/ Ab(1-42) for concordance with PET visual read in the Bio-FINDER cohort. Because of preanalytical protocol variations, in part 2, we calculated an adjustment factor to transfer the BioFINDER-determined cutoffs to the ADNI cohort. In part 3, we validated the predefined adjusted cutoffs in the ADNI cohort. Finally, we also showed that CSF biomarker status, established by prespecified cutoffs, had high agreement with SUVR PET classification and that the CSF biomarkers predicted future clinical progression in MCI patients.\nThese data showed that we could transfer CSF biomarker cutoffs from one independent cohort to another, although (1) the CSF samples were analyzed in different laboratories, (2) different preanalytical protocols were used, (3) the populations were different, and (4) different PET tracers were used. Furthermore, with the same predefined adjusted cutoffs, the biomarkers Ab(1-42), pTau/Ab(1-42), and tTau/ Ab(1-42) could clearly separate the MCI patients in the ADNI cohort who deteriorated clinically over 24 months from those who remained stable. The Q7 ability to accurately predict future disease progression using a fluid biomarker test is relevant for both routine clinical diagnosis and the selection of patients for clinical trials.\nTaking into account that postmortem pathology is the true gold standard for the detection of amyloid pathology, the interreader reliability of PET visual read was good (mean OPA 90.1% in BioFINDER and 94.0% in ADNI), but not \"perfect.\" This demonstrates the limitation of the visual PET method as it is partly subjective and reader dependent. However, because the amyloid-b PET visual read was used as a surrogate for amyloid pathology, the real gold standard, the OPA of the CSF assays to amyloid-b PET visual read, cannot be better than the average interreader OPA of amyloid-b PET (90.1%-93.4%), similar to the agreements between visual read-based and SUVR-based classifications of the same amyloid PET images (OPA 5 89.7%-91.8%). In this context, it is interesting to note the Elecsys CSF tau/Ab(1-42) ratios demonstrated high concordance with amyloid-b PET visual read-based (OPA 89.9% in BioFINDER and 89.2%-90.3% in ADNI) and SUVR-based PET (OPA 5 91.8% in BioFINDER and 86.5%-88.5% in ADNI). That is, the concordance between CSF tau/Ab(1-42) and amyloid PET was almost as strong as the concordance between SUVR-based and visual read-based classifications of the same PET images. The"}, {"section_title": "Q8", "text": "Elecsys immunoassays showed high precision in that CSF cutoffs could be transferred from one independent study to another using a cutoff adjustment factor, even when the CSF samples were handled using different protocols and analyzed in different laboratories, although, in principle, the need to adjust cutoffs between different studies would be eliminated if a universal preanalytical protocol for CSF handling were introduced. However, this study is a step toward identifying uniform, global cutoff values to enable the introduction of CSF biomarkers into clinical practice.\nThis study showed a high concordance of CSF Ab(1-42) with amyloid-b PET, which is supported by previous studies using other CSF assays. A previous analysis of the Bio-FINDER study demonstrated a 92.5% concordance between CSF Ab(1-42) and PET SUVR categorization [33] . Moreover, a recent study on patients with AD and healthy controls demonstrated 86.9% total agreement for PET visual read based on precalculated CSF biomarker cutoffs [34] .\nThe higher NPA of tau/Ab(1-42) ratios than Ab(1-42) alone seen in this study indicates that the CSF biomarker ratios may have greater diagnostic utility. This is supported by previous literature, as outlined in a recent review [35] . For example, in a recent study, the tTau/Ab(1-42) ratio increased concordance with PIB PET SUVR from 85.2% (k statistic 5 0.703, CI 0.51-0.89) with CSF Ab(1-42) to 92.5% (k statistic 5 0.849, CI 0.71-0.99) [36] . This has also been shown for the pTau/Ab(1-42) ratio, where in 103 mostly cognitively normal participants, CSF pTau/ Ab(1-42) showed greater sensitivity for detection of PIB1 compared with Ab(1-42) alone [37] . The superiority of tau/Ab(1-42) ratios over Ab alone may be due to a number of reasons. First, the tau/ Ab(1-42) ratios combine measures of two different pathologic processes into a single diagnostic biomarker. Second, the pTau or tTau ratios may reduce random error or variance in Ab(1-42) measurements. There are natural fluctuations or variations in the production, secretion, and degradation of CSF proteins [38] , and by normalizing the values of any protein to any other brain-derived protein, many of these natural variations in protein concentration may be compensated for. Third, tau and Ab(1-42) markers change at different points in the disease [39] , suggesting that Ab(1-42) is an earlier marker than tau. It has been speculated that CSF Ab(1-42) levels can be abnormal slightly earlier in the disease than amyloid-b PET visual read [40] . Theref Q9 ore, combining Ab(1-42) in a ratio with tau, a marker that is abnormal slightly later in the disease, may correspond better to amyloid-b PET visual read. A different line of research suggests an improved concordance with amyloid-b PET imaging when combining Ab(1-42) in a ratio with shorter Ab peptides [41, 42] . Future studies are needed to compare the performance of tau/Ab(1-42) ratios with, for example, a ratio Ab(1-42)/ Ab(1-40) using the Elecsys immunoassays.\nThe present study indicates that CSF biomarkers, established by predefined cutoffs, were able to separate clinically progressing from clinically stable patients; this is consistent with previous studies. For example, the tTau/ Ab(1-42) ratio was shown to predict MCI conversion to probable AD over 1 year [43] and the baseline tTau/ Ab(1-42) ratio indicated progression from MCI to dementia over 4-6 years, with a PPA of 95% and a NPA of 83% [16] . Furthermore, a \"CSF AD profile\" at baseline significantly increased the risk of patient progression from MCI to dementia [19] . These data suggest that the CSF biomarker profile could be used to support the diagnosis of early-stage AD. Further studies are warranted to examine whether greater rates of cognitive and functional decline are observed when both a tau protein and Ab are pathologic versus when either Ab(1-42) or a tau protein alone are pathologic [44, 45] .\nWe acknowledge the limitations of this study, which potentially impact the interpretation of these results. First, two prospective cohorts were used with two different predefined preanalytical protocols. Variations in preanalytical handling of CSF samples might influence the CSF AD biomarker levels [24] , especially Ab(1-42) [25] . However, these differences could be compensated for with the adjustment factor calculation in part 2, albeit using small sample sizes (n 5 17, n 5 20; under suspicion of hydrocephalus). The ADNI preanalytical protocol includes a large number of handling steps, which may not have been exactly replicated in our study. This may have introduced additional variability to the CSF biomarker quantification and may explain why the predefined, transferred cutoffs were not the same as the newly optimized cutoffs in ADNI (see Supplementary Results). There were also slight differences in the subjective impairment and MCI populations between cohorts and two different PET ligands ([  18 F]florbetapir and [ 18 F]flutemetamol) were used; despite these differences, the concordance was shown between CSF markers and PET classification in both cohorts. Such methodological differences are likely representative of the variability in current clinical practice. Second, the PET visual read analysis, used as the \"gold standard\" in this study, is a proxy for histopathology and partly subjective and reader dependent. Finally, the two methods compared here (PET and CSF) measure different species of Ab-amyloid-b PET ligands bind to aggregated forms of Ab, whereas soluble Ab is measured by CSF immunoassays. However, these two pools of Ab are thought to be closely related [46] , and this is supported by the high concordance seen in this study.\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates concordance of CSF Ab , pTau/Ab(1-42), and tTau/Ab(1-42) biomarkers with amyloid-b PET across two different cohorts with different populations, different amyloid-b PET tracers, and preanalytical protocols, which we believe may herald the potential for harmonized global cutoffs for CSF Ab(1-42), pTau/Ab(1-42), and tTau/Ab(1-42) biomarkers of AD. The cutoffs were validated with two different amyloid-b PET tracers against two methods of amyloid-b PET analysis-visual read and SUVR. In addition, CSF biomarkers identified patients who clinically progressed over the subsequent 2 years. However, before global Elecsys CSF AD biomarkers cutoffs can be implemented, a unified preanalytical protocol for CSF handling must be established. New, automated CSF biomarker assays have the potential to aid the clinical diagnosis of AD and provide a practical, reliable alternative to amyloid-b PET on a global level. 1182  1183  1184  1185  1186  1187  1188  1189  1190  1191  1192  1193  1194  1195  1196  1197  1198  1199  1200  1201  1202  1203  1204  1205  1206  1207  1208  1209  1210  1211  1212  1213  1214  1215  1216  1217  1218  1219  1220  1221  1222  1223  1224  1225  1226  1227  1228  1229  1230  1231  1232  1233  1234  1235  1236  1237  1238  1239  1240  1241  1242  1243  1244  1245  1246  1247  1248   1249  1250  1251  1252  1253  1254  1255  1256  1257  1258  1259  1260  1261  1262  1263  1264  1265  1266  1267  1268  1269  1270  1271  1272  1273  1274  1275  1276  1277  1278  1279  1280  1281  1282  1283  1284  1285  1286  1287  1288  1289  1290  1291  1292  1293  1294  1295  1296  1297  1298  1299  1300  1301  1302  1303  1304  1305  1306  1307  1308  1309  1310  1311  1312  1313 1316  1317  1318  1319  1320  1321  1322  1323  1324  1325  1326  1327  1328  1329  1330  1331  1332  1333  1334  1335  1336  1337  1338  1339  1340  1341  1342  1343  1344  1345  1346  1347  1348  1349  1350  1351  1352  1353  1354  1355  1356  1357  1358  1359  1360  1361  1362  1363  1364  1365  1366  1367  1368  1369  1370  1371  1372  1373  1374  1375  1376  1377  1378  1379  1380  1381  1382   1383  1384  1385  1386  1387  1388  1389  1390  1391  1392  1393  1394  1395  1396  1397  1398  1399  1400  1401  1402  1403  1404  1405  1406  1407  1408  1409  1410  1411  1412  1413  1414  1415  1416  1417  1418  1419  1420  1421  1422  1423  1424  1425  1426  1427  1428  1429  1430  1431  1432  1433  1434  1435  1436  1437  1438  1439  1440  1441  1442  1443  1444  1445  1446  1447  1448 "}]
