Fasting glucose and insulin resistance are risk factors for premature death and other adverse outcomes. We aimed to identifying plasma metabolites associated with altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in older community-dwelling adults.\nParticipants and Methods: A targeted metabolomics approach was used to identify plasma metabolites associated with impaired fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance testing, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 472 participants who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with a mean (SD) age of 70.7 (9.9) years.\nResults: We measured 143 plasma metabolites. In ordinal logistic regression analyses, using a false discovery rate of 5% and adjusting for potential confounders, we found that alanine, glutamic acid, and proline were significantly associated with increased odds of abnormal fasting plasma glucose. Phosphatidylcholine (diacyl C34:4, alkyl-acyl C32:1, C32:2, C34:2, C34:3, and C36:3) was associated with decreased odds of abnormal fasting plasma glucose. Glutamic and acid phosphatidylcholine alkyl-acyl C34:2 were associated with increased and decreased odds of 2-hour plasma glucose, respectively. Glutamic acid was associated with increased odds of higher tertiles of HOMA-IR.

In the United States, nearly one-third of adults older than 60 years have diabetes, of whom approximately half are undiagnosed (1) . The prevalence of diabetes in older adults is more than twice that in middle-aged adults (1) . The risk of altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance increases with age (2) and is associated with lower muscle strength (3), mobility disability (4), impaired cognition (5), frailty (4) , and increased mortality (6) . Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by hyperglycemia due to reduced biological response to insulin signaling, especially in skeletal muscle, and later on impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells (7) . Finding new lifestyle and pharmacological interventions that effectively prevent or delay the progression and consequences of diabetes is a public health priority. However, this research field is hampered by the little knowledge of the biological pathways and mechanisms leading to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in older persons.\nEpidemiological studies have implicated several metabolites, including branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, phosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylcholine with an increased risk of hyperglycemia and T2D (8) (9) (10) . As these studies have mainly focused on middle-aged adults, it is unclear whether the findings of these studies also apply to the older population. We used a targeted metabolomics approach to characterize the relationship of plasma metabolites with abnormal plasma fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose on oral glucose tolerance testing, and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in a cohort of older community-dwelling adults."}, {"section_title": "Participants and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Study participants were 472 adults, aged 50 to 97 years, who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and were seen between January 2006 and December 2008.

The BLSA is a prospective open cohort study of communitydwelling volunteers, largely from the Baltimore/Washington area. The study was established in 1958 and is described in detail elsewhere (11) . BLSA participants return to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical Research Unit at Medstar Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, at age-specific intervals for 2.5 days of medical, physiological, and psychological examinations. The BLSA has continuing approval from the Intramural Research Program of the NIA and the institutional review board of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The protocol for the current study was also approved by the institutional review board of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory methods", "text": "Blood was collected from participants who stayed overnight at the NIA Clinical Research Unit, Medstar Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein between 7:00 and 8:00 AM after an overnight fast. Participants were not allowed to smoke, engage in physical activity, or take medications before the blood sample was collected. Blood samples were immediately stored at 4\u00b0C, centrifuged within 4 hours, and then immediately aliquoted and frozen at 280\u00b0C. The collection of EDTA plasma in the studies is consistent with guidelines for biomarker studies (12) . Participants were sitting in a semi-reclining chair during glucose tolerance testing. Fasting plasma was collected at baseline, after which participants drank 75 g of glucose in a 300-mL solution (SunDex; Fisherbrand, Pittsburgh, PA), and blood samples were drawn 2 hours after oral administration. Plasma glucose concentration was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Plasma insulin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden) with inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation ,4%. Insulin resistance was estimated by HOMA-IR, calculated using fasting glucose and insulin measurements (13) . Concentrations of plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol were determined by an enzymatic method (ABA-200 ATC Biochromatic Analyzer; Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX). The concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was determined by a dextran sulfate-magnesium precipitation.\nPlasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography (LC)/tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and the AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria), a widely used metabolomics platform for clinical and epidemiological studies. Metabolites were extracted and concentrations measured using the manufacturer's protocol for a 5500 QTrap (Sciex, Framingham, MA) mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source, a Shimadzu CBM-20A command module and LC-20AD pump, and a Shimadzu SIL-20AC-HT autosampler (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a CTO-10AC column oven heater, running with Analyst 1.5.2 software, as described elsewhere (14) . Briefly, 10 mL of plasma was pipetted onto a 96-well kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG). The samples were dried at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, 50 mL of 5% PITC reagent was added and incubated for 20 minutes, and the plate was dried under nitrogen for 1 hour. Next, 300 mL of 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol was added and incubated at room temperature on a shaker (450 rpm) for 30 minutes. The plate was centrifuged at 500 3 g for 2 minutes and labeled; 50 mL of each sample was transferred to a deep 96-well LC plate, and 10 mL of each sample was transferred to the 96-well flowinjection analysis (FIA) plate. To the LC plate, 450 mL of 40% methanol (in HPLC-grade water) was added. To the FIA plate, 490 mL of FIA running solvent was added. Then, 10 mL was injected onto the Eclipse XDB C18, 3.5 mm, 3.0 3 100 mm, with a Phenomenex C18 Security Guard Cartridge, 3.0 mm ID. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (water containing 0.2% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.2% formic acid), with the following gradient: 0 to 0.5 minutes, 0% B; 5.5 minutes, 95% B; 6.5 minutes, 95% B; 7.0 minutes, 0% B; and 9.5 minutes, 0% B. LC plate evaluation of the samples was carried out using the MetIDQ software. The FIA plate was run with a 20-mL injection directly onto the mass spectrometer at a flow of 30 mL/min with water/acetonitrile (1:1) containing 0.2% formic acid as the mobile phase, with the following flow rate program: 0 to 1.6 min, 30 mL/min; 2.4 minutes, 200 mL/min; 2.80 minutes, 200 mL/min; and 3.00 minutes, 30 mL/min. Concentrations were calculated using the Analyst/ MetIDQ software and reported in mmol/L. The method measured 143 metabolites, including 25 amino acids, 11 biogenic amines, hexose, 10 sphingolipids, 7 acylcarnitines, and 89 glycerophospholipids (lyso-, diacyl-, and acyl-alkyl phosphatidylcholines). Glycerophospholipids are differentiated on the basis of ester and ether bonds in the glycerol moiety. Diacyl or \"aa\" indicates that fatty acids are bound with ester bonds at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions on the glycerol backbone. Acyl-alkyl or \"ae\" indicates that the fatty acid at the sn-1 position is bound with an ether bond. The total number of carbon atoms and double bonds in fatty acid chains is represented by \"C x:y,\" where x denotes the number of carbons and y denotes the number of double bonds. The MS spectra were evaluated using Analyst/MetIDQ (Biocrates Life Sciences AG) software. Human plasma samples spiked with standard metabolites were used to monitor the reproducibility of the assay. Plasma metabolites that were below the limit of quantification were excluded from the data analyses. The interand intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 5% to 15% for nearly all analytes."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods", "text": "The analysis presented here was based on a cross-sectional design.

Normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetic glucose tolerance were defined as 2-hour plasma glucose of #139 mg/dL, 140 to 199 mg/dL, and $200 mg/dL, respectively (13 (15) . Plasma metabolites and demographic, anthropometric, laboratory, and clinical characteristics were compared across the respective categories of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR using x 2 tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables. Ordinal multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between plasma metabolites and fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR, respectively, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.\nThe linear relationship of the data across glucose metabolism categories in the ordinal logistic regression models was verified using the proportional odds assumption. To determine how much the results could be influenced by participants with established diabetes, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted in which participants with established diabetes were excluded from the analysis. A false discovery rate (FDR) approach was used to correct for multiple testing (16, 17) . All associations reported as significant passed the FDR cutoff of 5%. The q value is the proportion of false discoveries and the minimum FDR at which a result can be called significant. An FDR-adjusted q value of 0.05 implies that 5% of significant tests will result in false positives.

Metabolomics has been increasingly applied to identify new plasma biomarkers for abnormal glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and risk of T2D mellitus (18) . There is considerable heterogeneity in plasma metabolites that have been implicated with prediabetes and T2D mellitus due to differences in analytical technique, study design, and geographical location, lifestyle, diet, and age in various study populations (18) . The potential role of plasma metabolites implicated in abnormal glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in the current study, consistencies, and differences with previous studies are discussed below.\nAlanine plays a key role in gluconeogenesis by the liver as part of the glucose-alanine cycle (19, 20) . Alanine is the primary amino acid that is released by skeletal muscle in the circulation, where it is taken up by the splanchnic bed for conversion to glucose (19, 20) . The sources of alanine in skeletal muscle include branched-chain amino acids that are oxidized to produce alanine and glutamine (21) . To complete the glucose-alanine cycle, glucose is taken up from plasma and can be converted to pyruvate and subsequently to alanine in a variety of tissues, including skeletal muscle (22) . A previous study showed that elevated plasma alanine concentrations predicted incident T2D mellitus in a cohort of 9369 Finnish men (9). b Adjusted by age, sex, BMI, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.\nIn the current study, elevated glutamic acid was associated with abnormal fasting glucose, abnormal 2-hour glucose, and insulin resistance. A previous study of 45 specific metabolites measured using LC/tandem MS in the Framingham Heart Study and the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study showed that elevated plasma glutamic acid was associated with insulin resistance (23) . In 182 nondiabetic adults, plasma glutamic acid was positively correlated with insulin resistance (24) . Glutamic acid stimulates glucagon release from human pancreatic a-cells via ionotropic glutamate receptors (25) . Glutamic acid also increases the transamination of pyruvate to alanine (26) , which plays a role in gluconeogenesis as noted above. Elevated plasma proline was also associated with abnormal fasting glucose. Proline can be synthesized from either glutamic acid or ornithine.\nThe current study corroborates the association between low serum glycine and HOMA-IR, which has been previously described in a study of 73 functionally limited older adults, aged 70 to 85 years (27) , and 83 healthy adults, aged 20 to 80 years, with normal glucose tolerance (28) . Plasma glycine concentrations are reduced in patients with obesity (29) and T2D mellitus (30) . Prospective studies show that plasma glycine is an independent predictor of incident T2D (10). Glycine participates in several different metabolic pathways. In humans, glycine is synthesized predominantly from glucose (via serine) and from dietary betaine. Glycine can also be synthesized from glyoxylate and threonine (31) . There is no evidence for reduced glycine synthesis in patients with diabetes; thus, it has been hypothesized that glycine utilization is increased in diabetes, because patients with diabetes undergo excessive fatty acyl group formation. Glycine is an acceptor of acyl groups and buffers excess acyl groups by generating acylglycine derivatives (31) .\nIt is notable that five of the six phosphatidylcholine species associated with fasting plasma glucose appeared to contain polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups (i.e., had two or more double bonds). The single plasma phosphatidylcholine associated with 2-hour plasma glucose was also a diene. Ten of the 17 glycerophospholipids associated with HOMA-IR appeared to contain a polyunsaturated fatty acid (i.e., contained at least two double bonds). Although there are several possible isomers for each lipid annotation, it is likely that in the phosphatidylcholines, the most dominant unsaturated fatty acyls are linoleic acid (C18:2) and oleic acid (C18:1) and saturated fatty acyl is palmitic acid (C16:0) because these three fatty acids are found in the highest concentrations in human plasma (32, 33) . These findings suggest that phosphatidylcholine species with long chain length and unsaturated fatty acyls are protective against diabetes risk and insulin resistance. Lysophosphatidylcholine C18:1, which was associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance, is generated in human plasma via three pathways: (1) by phospholipase A 2 on phosphatidylcholine that is membrane bound or on the polar surface of lipoproteins; (2) by the activity of endothelial lipase, including phospholipase A 1 , on HDLs (34); and (3) from phosphatidylcholine during the formation of cholesteryl esters. Lysophosphatidylcholine C18:1 can serve as a ligand for specific G protein-coupled signaling receptors and can also be converted to lysophosphatidic acid by autotaxin, an adipokine. Lysophosphatidic acid has specific receptors involved in growth, differentiation, and glucose metabolism (35) . A previous study in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam Study showed that alkyl-acyl phosphatidylcholines (C34:3, C40:6) and sphingomyelin C16:0 were independent predictors of incident T2D mellitus (9) . Acylcarnitines have been hypothesized to play a role in insulin resistance (36) , and elevated plasma acylcarnitines have been associated with insulin sensitivity in obese adults with T2D (37). In the current study, we found no significant association between plasma acylcarnitines and fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR. These findings are consistent with a study in which plasma acylcarnitine concentrations were not associated with HOMA-IR in 60 obese adults before or after a weight loss intervention (38) .\nThe fasting glucose testing and oral glucose tolerance testing revealed that there was a considerable portion of adults in the BLSA who had undiagnosed diabetes. These results are consistent with national estimates that show that approximately one-fourth of adults in the United States have undiagnosed diabetes (39) .\nThe strengths of this study are a well-characterized aging cohort with standardized collection of fasting plasma samples and measurements of plasma fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance testing, and insulin measurements. The BLSA is a convenience sample of adults who tend to be healthier, with higher educational attainment and socioeconomic status than the general population. The findings from this study cannot necessarily be generalized to other study populations. It is possible that there may be residual confounding factors present after adjusting for the available covariates. A limitation of the study is that no data were collected on the dietary intake of the participants in this analysis. Although the study was focused on abnormal glucose metabolism in older adults, the cohort included a small number of participants who were younger than 65 years. The study may have been limited in power to detect associations between plasma metabolites with lower effect size with abnormal glucose metabolism. The crosssectional design of the current study limits causal inferences about the relationship of plasma metabolites with altered glucose metabolism.\nIn conclusion, older adults with altered glucose metabolism have alterations in specific plasma amino acids and lipids. Future work is needed to gain insight into the relationship of these specific amino acid and lipid alterations with altered glucose metabolism over time, as well as how these metabolites could be related to aging phenotypes associated with altered glucose metabolism such as sarcopenia."}]
