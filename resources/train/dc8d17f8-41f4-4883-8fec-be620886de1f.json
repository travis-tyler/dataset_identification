OLICY FOREWORD How many earned doctorates are awarded annually in the United States in each discipline? How does the time lapse between the baccalaureate and the doctorate vary by field and by mode of support? Can graduates of four-year colleges compete as doctoral candidates on equal terms with those who received their baccalaureates from doctorate-granting institutions? In what order can universities be ranked as producers of doctorates? Where do recent recipients of the doctorate go for their first postdoctoral employment? Is postdoctoral educationthat vigorous infant of the educational worldclaiming an ever greater share of doctorate recipients? What percentage of foreign nationals receiving the doctorate in the United States return to their countries of origin? To what extent are the social sciences and the humanities attracting highly talented young people at the doctoral level to the solution of pressing social problems and the elevation of the quality of our national life? Questions such as these abound in every discussion of the strengthening of graduate education and of the contributions that graduate education makes to the national well-being. They require ever more precise answers, the approximations and folklore of the past no longer sufficing as a basis for national, regional, and institutional planning. This book, the sixth in a series of reports published by the Office of Scientific Personnel of the National Research Council, addresses itself to these and m: ny other questions related to doctoral education. No efforts have been spared to make the graphical presentation of data as complete and helpful to the reader as possible. We hope that the busy policy-maker will find here in good graphs and well-organized diagrams succinct presentation of relations and perhaps some new insights into old problems. The publication of Doctorate Recipients and the development of the Doctorate Records File are among the many activities conducted by the Office of Scientific Personnel of the National Research Council in its concern for the strengthening of higher education and the development of better understanding of the educational process. Included among these activities currently are a study of postdoctoral education in the United States, a study of training programs in the general medical sciences, a study of career patterns of doctorate recipients in the general medical sciences, a study of career patterns of doctorate recipients in the sciences and engineering, and an extensive program of fellowships and research associateships. Inquiries about these projects, suggestions and criticisms of the present volume, and communications concerning the availability of additional information about doctorate recipients are invited. Dr. Fred D. Boercker, Assistant Director of Research within the Office of Scientific Personnel, working under the direction of Dr. Lindsey R. Harmon, Director of Research, has been responsible for the production of this volume. To Dr. Boercker and his assistant, Miss Clarebeth Maguire, must go most of the credit for making \"Book Six\" in the Doctorate Production Series a more complete and, we hope, more interesting and more useful book than its pioneering predecessors. The National Science Foundation provided funds for the preparation of this book and, in cooperation with the U.S. Office of Education, supports the work of maintaining and extending the important Doctorate Records File. The continuing assistance of these agencies is gratefully acknowledged."}, {"section_title": "William C. Kelly", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Director", "text": "Office of Scientific Personnel PREFACE This is a statistical handbook about doctoral education in the United States during the past nine years. More specifically, the book describes the growth in numbers of doctorates granted in various fields and the corresponding growth in numbers of colleges and universities; it delineates some patterns of doctoral education in the United States and shows changes that occur in transition from academic to professional work; it describes two special groupsthe United States doctorate recipients of foreign origin and women doctorate recipients; and finally, the book provides extensive institutional data in its appendixes. The source of the data is the Doctorate Records File, a repository of information from the Survey of Earned Doctorates. The Survey is conducted annually by the Office of Scientific Personnel (OSP) of the National Research Council and gathers information by means of a questionnaire form. The form is distributed with the cooperation of the Graduate Deans and filled out by the graduates just as they complete all requirements for their doctoral degrees. Research doctorates in all fields are recorded, but professional degrees such as the MD, DDS, and DVM are not included. The File goes back to 1920 and includes information about almost a quarter of a million persons. The time period covered in this report is fiscal year 1958 through fiscal year 1966. The previous volume in the series, Doctorate Production in United States Universities, 1920-1962 (NAS-NRC Publication 1142), presented a longrange historical review of doctoral education in the United States. The present volume provides more detailed information for the last nine years and serves as a complement to the preceding book. Frequent references will be made to Publication 1142. The primary purpose of this report is to present useful data describing recent trends in doctoral education in the United States. Very little interpretative comment is included. A great deal of care has been taken to make the tables and figures as clear and self-explanatory as possible. Most of the text is intended to define any unusual terms used in tables, point out uniformities or anomalies in patterns, warn of data limitations if such exist, and generally help the reader to understand the information presented. It is especially important for the reader to realize that the data refer only to those persons who have completed doctoral programs. The statistics may not be generalized to describe all graduate education in the United States. It is hoped that professional societies and educational researchers will use these data as bases for interpretation as this may be required. More detailed analysis of the Doctorate Records File data than is presented here is possible, and OSP invites inquiries from qualified professional, educational, or governmental agencies concerning such analysis. The planning, compilation of information, and the writing and publication of this book have involved many persons, and we wish to acknowledge the assistance of some who have been especially helpful. We wish also to thank each graduate dean and each recipient of the doctorate who cooperated with us by providing data. Their generous response to our appeals has been most encouraging. We trust that they will feel repaid to some extent by the knowledge that they have contributed to the development of a unique national resource of information, one that has made possible not only this report but also many other reports and studies. There has been an increasingly rapid growth in the number of doctorates granted by United States universities during the past half century. The universities granted 560 research doctorates in 1920. This number grew to 3,245 in 1940; totaled 9,734 in 1960; and reached 17,865 in 1966. Accompanying the growth in the number of persons receiving doctorates has been an increasing need for more information about this pool of highly trained manpower. Universities have become more concerned with the process of graduate education leading to the doctorate; baccalaureate institutions have had to plan for a greater percentage of their graduates to continue through graduate work; and society in general has become more aware of the critical role these persons play in determining the standard and quality of living for the nation. As a result, more information about the doctorate recipients was needed, and the Office of Scientific Personnel (OSP) broadened the scope of its Survey of Earned Doctorates in the 1957-1958 academic year to collect the information. Figure 1 shows the growth in numbers of doctorate recipients and in the information collected from them since 1920. Harmon and Soldzi presented an extensive analysis of the growth curve in Figure 1 for the years 1920- 1962. They showed that the average long-term growth rate was 7 percent per year, but they also pointed out the rather large year-by-year fluctuations from the average. This book concentrates primarily on the period from fiscal year (FY) 1958 through fiscal year 1966. 2 The average rate of growth in numbers of doctorate recipients for this period was 9.3 percent per year. Since there were 17,865 doctorate recipients in FY 1966, one may project the number to FY 1970 as follows: At 9 percent per year growth rate, there would be 25,000 doctorate recipients by FY 1970.  At 10 percent per year growth rate, there would be 26,000 doctorate recipients by FY 1970. In the period 1920 -1966, more than 241,000 doctorates were granted in United States universities, and almost three fourths of these (72 percent) were granted after 1950. By FY 1970, the projected number of doctorate recipients would be 333,000. No attempt is made in this publication to compare the supply with projected demand. OSP systematically collects information about doctorate recipients and compiles the Doctorate Records File upon which the facts presented in this book are based. The survey is conducted annually, with the cooperation of the Graduate Deans and with financial support from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Office of Education (USOE), by means of a questionnaire distributed to all graduate schools. (See Appendix H for a copy of the survey form.) The forms are filled out by the students after they have completed all requirements for the doctorate and are returned to OSP where they are checked against the graduation list from each institution. Rosters are compiled and mailed to each graduate institution, to be rechecked for accuracy. The accumulated records for all these individuals are referred to as the Doctorate Records File, which is a virtually complete listing of all research doctorate recipients since 1920. However, not all respondents answer every question on the questionnaire, so the response rate on a given item will not 100 percent. The typical response rate is about 95-98 percent. Figure 1 indicates that the information collected from the doctorate recipients before FY 1958 was meagre, but since that time a very substantial amount of data has been collected each year. Agencies other than OSP collect data about degrees granted, especially USOE, but the Doctorate Records File includes the academic history of every individual receiving the doctorate. The File therefore permits studies to be made of the path and progress of each individual through higher education and into his first postdoctoral employment. Data presented in this book may be compared with USOE counts of doctoral degrees granted if the following precautions are kept in mind: 1. OSP data are counts of individuals, and USOE data are counts of degrees. A person receiving two research doctorates would be counted once by OSP (the first time) and twice by USOE. 2. OSP data include only research-level doctorates. Performance doctorates not requiring a research dissertation are not included. (Professional degrees such as MD, DDS, and DVM are excluded by both OSP and USOE in counts of third-level research degrees.) 3. Certain groupings of fields (such as history, economics, etc.) into larger aggregates (such as Social Sciences) differ between OSP and USOE. Figure 2 shows the relative sizes and growth rates of seven major fields between FY 1958 andFY 1966. During this period the number of persons receiving doctorates each year increased from 8,770 to 17,865, corresponding to an average growth rate of 9.3 percent per year. The summary fields (containing fields and subfields as described in Table 1 DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS IN 1 FIELDS, FY 1958, 1962, AND 1966. Engineering experienced spectacular growth during the nine-year period, almost quadrupling its annual doctoral production. The professional fields, especially business administration, also grew rapidly. Within the sciences, mathematics displayed above-average growth. Within the arts, modern foreign languages grew rapidly, but the fine arts and music were slow-growing. The biological and social sciences grew relatively slowly, and this was particularly true of psychology, the largest discipline in the social science group. Table 1 provides a detailed analysis of trends in numbers of persons receiving doctorates in each of 188 subfields between FY 1958 andFY 1966. This is the only table in the book giving such fine-field analysis, since the detail would make most tables too lengthy and complex. Consolidation of fields is necessary, and Table 1 indicates the groupings of subfields into major fields.3 Doctorate recipients show many similarities in terms of such characteristics as sex, citizenship, marital status, and age at receipt of doctorate. The majority in all fields are men, United States citizens, married, and about 25-35 years old upon completion of their formal education. However, field differences do exist, and Table 2 (p. 10) compares these individual characteristics for persons in the various fields. The physical scientists and engineers are almost all men, but one fifth of the group in the arts and humanities are women; one third of the researel doctors in modern foreign languages are women. (Chapter V provides data describing women doctorate recipients.) Mathematics, Other    More than 70 percent of these people were married by the time they received the doctorate. The biological scientists had the highest percentage of non-United States citizens; one third of the doctorate recipients in agriculture were foreigners. Arts and humanities and education had the lowest percentage of non-United States citizens. (Chapter IV describes the United States doctorates of foreign origin.) Age at receipt of the doctorate varies appreciably by field. Physical scientists, especially chemists, complete their formal education earliest; three fourths have the doctorate by age 33. In contrast, not until age 44 do three fourths of the education and fine arts majors receive the doctorate. These statistics may be misleading and require some interpretation. By custom, natural scientists attempt to complete all their formal education in one uninterrupted sequence. Certain arts and humanities, professional, and education fields encourage their students to obtain professional experience before entering upon doctoral work. More detailed data on time lapse from baccalaureate to doctorate is presented in Chapter II. The number of doctorate-granting institutions4 in the United States has been increasing for the past 45 years, doubling about every years. The number of doctoral degrees granted by these institutions has increased at a more rapid rate, doubling every 8-10 years. As a consequence, the average number of doctorates granted per institution has increased from 12 in 1920 to 85 in 1966. Figure 3 depicts these relations. The averages plotted in Figure 3 obscure a great deal of variability among institutions. For instance, four universities granted over 500 doctorates in FY 1966 while twenty universities granted 2 or fewer doctorates during that year. Does the average increase in doctorates per institution reflect an enormous increase in the doctoral production of a few large institutions, or has the number of \"high producer\" institutions been increasing? Figure 4 supplies data on this question. During the post-World-War-II era (1950)(1951)(1952)(1953)(1954)(1955)(1956)(1957)(1958)(1959)(1960)(1961)(1962)(1963)(1964)(1965)(1966) the number of doctoral institutions almost doubled, increasing from 118 to 212. Concurrently, the number of institutions supplying a given percentage of doctorates (25, 50, or 75 percent) also doubled. As a result, the percentage of institutions supplying a given percentage of doctorates has remained almost constant. Four to five percent of the institutions supplied 25 percent of the doctorates during the entire period; eleven percent of the institutions supplied 50 percent of the doctorates; and twenty-four to twenty-six percent supplied 75 percent of the doctorates. As the number of doctorate-granting institutions grows, there is a proportionate increase in the number of inner-core high producers. The large Even the very large universities specialize to a certain degree. Their doctoral programs have larger outputs in certain fields than in others. As a result, institutions that are leading over-all doctoral sources are not leaders in every field. Table 3 illustrates this point. The table lists in rank order the leading 100 doctorate-granting institutions based on total doctorates granted between FY 1958 and FY 1966. The body of the table shows the rank of each institution as a doctoral source in various fields for three time periods. Four of the institutions listed in the top twenty-five ranked below 100 in some field during the FY 1964-1966 period. Conversely, some institutions with over-all ranks below 100, and not listed in Table 3, have relatively high ranks in one or two fields. For instance, the University of Miami ranks 2nd in ecology, and Montana State University ranks 19th in that field; Drew University ranks 6th in religion and theology; and the University of Mississippi is 17th in health sciences."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 3", "text": "Ranks, by Doctorate Output, of One Hundred Leading Doctorate-Granting Institutions, by Field, FY 19581966 Rank, by Doctorate Output, of Institution by Field of Doctorate  ..t         Year of Doctorate Rank, by Doctorate Output, of institution by Field of Doctorate     Rank, by Doctorate Output, of institution by Field of Doctorate  "}, {"section_title": "Baccalaureate-Source institutions", "text": "Appendix A of this report lists each United States institution that has granted a research doctorate since 1920 and shows the doctoral production of that institution by field for the over-all time period 1920-1966 and for the recent period 1960-1966. In addition to quantitative measures of doctoral output, there has developed a growing demand for some \"quality\" rating of graduate departments. No universally accepted quality metric has yet been devised, but some studies have been made to develop rating scales. One of the best known was recently reported by Allan Car\" ,r.6 One part of the Cartter report ranks institutions in each of 29 academic fields on \"rated effectiveness of graduate program.\" The two highest rating groups are titled \"Extremely Attractive\" and \"Attractive.\" Ten of the Cartter fields were identical in title with the field titles of Table 3 above. The ranks in Table 3 have been compared with the Cartter ranks to determine the degree to which they coincide. From The Cartter report rated 11 graduate departments of anthropology as Extremely Attractive or Attractive out of a total of 39 doctorate-granting departments. When compared with the 11 highest-output anthropology institutions from Table 3, 10 appeared on both lists for a 91 percent overlap. In all, 171 institutions were compared in this manner; 116 (68 percent) appeared on both the Cartter list and the selection of top-ranked institutions from Table 3. Of those that were on the Cartter list, but were not rated as highly in Table 3, 71 percent were private institutions; conversely, 62 percent of those in Table 3, but not on Cartter's list, were public institutions. A \"baccalaureate-source institution\" is one that granted a baccalaureate to one or more persons who later received a research doctorate at either that same institution or a different one. Figure 5 shows that the number of baccalaureate-source institution's has been increasing rapidly between 1950 and 1966. The trends for the barealaureate-source institutions ( Figure 5) are very similar to those for the doctoral institutions ( Figure 4). The total number of source institutions increased about 50 percent during the period, and the number of such institutions that supplied a given percent (25, 50, 75 percent) of all baccalaureates who later achieved doctorates also increased about 50 percent. As a result, the percentage of in-  "}, {"section_title": ";", "text": "., .1. ,. stitutions supplying a given percentage of these baccalaureates has remained almost constant. Two percent of the institutions supply 25 percent of the baccalaureates who later receive doctorates; eight percent of the institutions supply 50 percent of the baccalaureates; and twenty-three to twenty-four percent supply '75 percent. As the total number of baccalaureate. source institutions increases, there is a corresponding increase in the nt.mber of high-producer centers. Table 4 lists the leading 100 baccalaureate-source institutions for those persons who received doctorates between FY 1958 and FY 1966. Comparison of Table 4 with Table 3 reveals great overlap. Of the top 30 baccalaureatesource institutions, 24 are also among the top 30 doctorate-granting institutions."}, {"section_title": "SOURCES OF 75% OF DOCTORATES", "text": "The listing in Table 4 may be compared with a similar listing in the preceding book of this series.?

However, the 100 institutions in Table 4 accounted for only 56 percent of the 1958-1966 eventual doctorate recipients; the leading 100 institutions of 1920 -1929 were the baccalaureate sources of '71 percent of the doctorates of that period.  "}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Appendix B of this report lists each United States college or university that has been a baccalaureate source for at least one doctorate recipient since 1920 and shows the production of the institution by doctoral field for the periods 1920 -1966 and 1960 -1966. Appendix C shows the relation between the baccalaureate institutions and doctoral institutions. It lists the 300 leading baccalaureate-source institutions for the leading 40 doctorate-granting institutions. Figure 6 shows the number of persons receiving doctoral degrees from universities in each state of the United States during FY 1966. The figure indicates also each state's rank in numbers of doctorates granted during that year. Similar data for 1950 and 1958 were analyzed, but because most of the states' ranks were remarkably stable for 1950, 1958, and 1966, only the 1966 statistics are displayed in Figure 6. However, three states did show marked gains in relative rank from 1950 to 1966, and two suffered marked declines. (Arizona climbed from 38 to 29; Florida from 31 to 18; Texas from 18 to 8. The District of Columbia fell from 14 to 22 and Virginia from 22 to 30.) Five statesNew York, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvaniahave maintained leadership in numbers of doctorates granted. In 1950, these five accounted for 52 percent of all doctorates: in 1958 they accounted for 48 percent; and in 1966 for 41 percent. Per capita doctoral production data (doctorates granted in state/population of same state) are not included in this book because they tend to be misleading. Only a minority of the persons receiving doctorates in a state are natives of that state in the sense that they went to high school there. Therefore, a ratio of 2:10,000 would not mean necessarily that 2 persons per 10,000 of that state's population received doctorates. Details on this point will be presented shortly with Table 6. There is a strong relation between the amount of money spent on all higher education in a state and the number of doctorates that are granted in that state. Figure 7 (p. 32) shows this relation. The money spent per state includes funds from state, federal, and other sources. As a rough approximation, a state produces one doctorate for each $300,000 it devotes to its higher education operation. The state, of course, receives many returns from this investment in addition to the doctorate."}, {"section_title": "Doctorates by Field, by", "text": "Not only do states vary in the total number of doctorates granted in the state, State but they vary considerably in the doctoral fields of the graduates. Table 5 shows the number of doctorate recipients by field for FY 1966 for each state. A percentage distribution by field for each state is included. In general, states that are high producers of doctorates tend to have a field distribution similar to the national average. (Compare statistics for the five highest-ranked states with the national totals.)

Figure 8 and Most institutions do not offer doctoral programs in all fields, so many states with one or two institutions find themselves with no viable doctoral programs in certain fields. Table 6 shows that 17 states did not grant doctorates in ten or more fields during the period, and only 21 states had granted degrees in all but one or two fields. If Table 6 is analyzed by field, it shows that doctorates were granted in chemistry and biochemistry and phySiology in almost all states, but that doctorates in anthropology, classic languages and literature, speech and dramatic arts, and religion were granted in fewer than half the states. The people of the United States are mobile, and those who receive doctorates are no exception. They move from state to state and region to region as they progress from high school to undergraduate school to graduate school. Most persons receiving doctorates in a state are not natives of that state .or even of the same general geographic region. Table 7 shows the geographic migration between high school and doctorate. The migration data have been analyzed for the periods FY 1958-1960and FY 1961-1963 as well as for FY 1964-1966, but the percentages were quite stable, so only the latter period is displayed in Table 7 (p. 40).  .:  If one defines a \"native\" of a state as one who graduated from high school in that state, then only 27 percent of the doctorate recipients took doctorates in their native states. This percentage varies widely, from 50 percent for Texas to 10 percent for Arizona, but in general three fourths of a state's doctorates are immigrants. Looked at in terms of the Census Bureau's nine geographic areas, a similar analysis shows that only 39 percent of these persons received doctorates in the same geographic region as the one in which they west to high school. Again, the variation is large, ranging from 53 percent for the West South Central region to 21 percent for New Engiaiid. Appendix D tabulates the state of doctoral institution by state of baccalaureate institution for 80,978 United States natives who received doctorates between FY 1960 and 1966. Only 29,229 (36 percent) of these took their doctorate in the same state as the state of their baccalaureate.

Uniformities that characterize high-school and undergraduate patternscontinuous, full-time attendance at one institution for four yearsdisappear at the graduate level. Some doctoral candidates begin graduate work immediately upon receipt of the baccalaureate, and some postpone entrance for many years; some take a master's degree as part of the doctoral program, and some do not; some take all their graduate work at one institution, and some transfer; some take their baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees in the same field, and some shift fields. Because the Doctorate Records File contains the academic histories of the doctorate recipients, it is possible to trace in some detail the varied paths followed by students and to investigate the relations among such variables as field choice, type of undergraduate institution, type of graduate institution, and time lapse from baccalaureate to doctorate. This chapter presents data that describe some aspects of the doctoral education process. A summary of the academic history of the 17,865 doctorate recipients of FY 1966 is presented graphically in Figure 9. One out of nine had received the baccalaureate during or after 1962 and had completed all doctoral requirements in four or fewer years. In contrast, one out of seven received the baccalaureate prior to 1950, attended graduate school after some years of nonacademic experience, and completed doctoral requirements in 16 or more years. Half of the group received baccalaureates during or after FY 1958: The median time lapse from baccalaureate to doctorate was 8.2 years. Eighty percent of the 1966 doctorate recipients took master's degrees during their graduate programs. One in eight received the master's degree during or after 1964, and about one in seven received the master's degree prior to 1955. The median time lapse from master's to doctorate was 5.2 years. The baccalaureate-to-doctorate and master's-to-doctorate time-lapse distributions are shown to scale in the bottom part of Figure 9. The vertical bars in the upper part of the figure represent graphically certain reference statistics of the United States educational system from high school to doctorate. The 17,865 doctorate recipients are shown at year 1966.  "}, {"section_title": "Institutional Transfer Patterns 43", "text": "Then, going back the median number of years (5) from doctorate to master's, the total master's degree population of 1961 is shown. In like manner, the median baccalaureate-to-doctorate time lapse was 8 years, so the total United States baccalaureate population of 1958 is represented. The beginning collegefreshman enrollment and high-school graduating class are f-then 3 and 4 years respectively prior to the baccalaureate year. The data in Figure 9 represent cross sections If the educational. stream at different levels and at different points in time. The classes represented are somewhat arbitrarily chosen, because criteria other than median time lapse could hay.: been employed in selection. Also, it should be noted that only a few of the 1966 doctorate recipients were members of these particular classes. Nevertheless, the general pattern and the associated ratios are probably of good accuracy. The percentage of the doctorate recipients who shifted fields as they progressed up the educational ladder and their tendency to omit the master's degree are strongly related to doctoral field. Figure 10 and the associated Table 8 illustrate these points. Appendix F shows the detailed pattern of baccalaureateto-doctorate field shifting. The physical sciences and engineering fields are highly selfcontained. Only 7 percent of the doctorate recipients in these fields took baccalaureates in a non-physical-science field, and only 2 percent had master's degrees from outside fields. Table 8 shows that 70 -89 percent remained within a specific subfield of the physical sciences. The biological sciences drew 25 percent of their doctoral students from other broad fields. Physiology and biochemistry recruited almost half of their doctorate iscipients from the physical sciences. Table 8 data show very low retention rates from the baccalaureate to the doctorate within specific subfields of the biological sciences. This may indicate less precise field differentiation at the baccalaureate level in those fields than in the physical sciences. The social sciences recruit one third of their doctoral students from other fields and have about 50 percent retention within subfield between the baccalaureate and doctorate. The arts and humanities resemble the physical sciences in that they recruit very few from other fields at either the baccalaureate or master's levels, and they show high retention rates within subfields. The professional fields and education obtain over half_ of their doctoral students from otner fields, and almost one fourth of the education doctorates received master's degrees from outside fields. The above data suggest that the Gtudent in certain fields must decide upon a graduate major in the field as an undergraduate whereas other fields permit extensive inflow during the graduate program. Figure 10 and Table 8 indicate also the field variation in the percentage of doctorate recipients who take master's degrees, and they show the average time lapse from baccalaureate to doctorate for the fields. In general, those fields, such as the physical sciences, that have little field transfer between baccalaureate and doctorate have the largest percentages of students bypassing the master's degree.  Table  9 were analyze;.i for the years 1958 -1960 and 1961 -1963 as well as for 1964 -1966, but the only signifh ant trend was an increase in the percentage coming from foreign baccalaureate institutions (11.0-13.5), so only the FY 1964FY -1966 data are shown in the table. The United States baccalaureate-source institutions are classified by the use of three variables: (1) highest degree granted (bachelor's, master's, doctorate); (2) control (public, private); (3) size (large, small). Enrollments used to classify institutions as large or small were chosen so as to divide the institutions within a \"degree control\" category into two approximately equal groups. All foreign baccalaureate institutions were grouped into a 13th category.      The totals by type of control divide almost evenly between public and private (43.2 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively); the remainder are foreign institutions. However, Table 9 reveals some marked field variations from the over-all pattern. Only 2 percent of the religion and theology majors received baccalaureates at large public master's-granting institutions, but 19 percent of the education majors came from these institutions. One third of the elementary particle physicists came from large private institutions, but fewer than one in thirty of the agriculture majors attended such institutions. Foreign institutions were major baccalaureate sources for many, but not all, fields; 31 percent of the majors in agriculture were foreign, but, in contrast, only 2 percent of the doctorate recipients in speech and dramatic arts were from foreign baccalaureate institutions. Trends and patterns that occur in the shift from baccalaureate to doctoral institution are displayed in Table 10. Increasing percenti is of predoctoral students take graduate work at the smaller public doctorate-granting institutions, and a corresponding drop is occurring in the percentage receiving doctorates at large private institutions. The transition from baccalaureate to doctoral institution results in a net gain for the public institutions. About two thirds of the students remain in the same general type of institution, going from public to public or private to private. The remaining one third shift from one type to another, but the majority of these go from private to public institution. Thus, 51 percent of the United States doctorate recipients attended public undergraduate institutions, and 59 percent attended public doctoral institutions. There were no strong sex differences in the patterns of transfer. Women were a little more likely to attend private institutionsonly 45 percent came from public undergraduate schools, and 48 percent went to public graduate schools.    There has been considerable stability in the patterns from 1950 until 1966, the most popular being C. About 20 percent of the science and 10 percent of the nonscience doctorate recipients omit the master's degree (B and D). Approximately one seventh of the students receive all degrees from the same institution (A and B). Table 12 reveals the characteristically large field variations from the average pattern. Figures 12 and 13 indicate the relation between the educational level of the parents of the doctorate recipient and his choice of undergraduate institution and doctoral field. The bottom line on each bar represents the first quartile (one fourth of the parents had less than this amount of education); the middle line represents the median or second quartile (one half had less than this amount of education); the top line shows the third quartile (one fourth had more than this amount of formal education). Figure 12 shows a marked relation between parental education and the type of undergraduate institution attended by the doctorate recipient. Parents of those who attended public undergraduate institutions had less formal education than parents whose children attended private institutions. These differences occur in comparisons between mothers as well as fathers. In contrast, there is little apparent relation between parents' education and the doctoral student's choice of field ( Figure 13). The one notable exception is education, in which the fathers' years of formal schooling were significantly lower. In both figures the over-all median education for fathers and for mothers was about 12th grade, but the education of the fathers shows greater variability than that cf the mothers. This variability is displayed graphically by the length of the bar between the first and third quartiles.    . ,t,...

The parents of the doctorate recipients have more formal education, and they show less sex difference in education than the total. United States group. When filling out the Survey of Earned Doctorates questionnaire, the doctorate recipient supplies the name of his major adviser. This information is used to compile an index of advisees per major adviser. The data in Table 13 show the number of doctoral advisees completing doctoral requirements per year per major adviser. The tabulations are broken by field. The ratios were compiled by counting the average number of doctorates granted per year in each field from FY 1964 -1966 and dividing by the number of different advisers in each field who were named during the three-year period. The ratio varies from 0.53 for the biological sciences to 0.99 for education. The average for all fields is 2 doctorates in three years for each person who served as a major adviser. Many factors interact to determine the number and variety of graduate programs offered at an institution, t:.a number of graduate students enrolled at the institution, and the number of doctorates granted. Institution size is not a perfect predictor of any of the above, but it does have some interesting correlations. The following pages present data showing some of the correlates of institution size. The relation between total institution enrollment and total graduate enrollment in United States doctorate-granting institutions is shown in Figure 14. The graduate enrollments used comprised all graduate studentsfull-and part-time including those who intended to terminate with a master's degree as well as those planning to obtain a doctorate. Figure 14 shows a scattergram of black dots, each dot representing one doctorate-granting institution. Each axis of the figure consists of a three-cycle logarithmic scale indicating total enrollment (horizontal) or graduate enrollment (vertical). The three black vertical lines (Q1, Q2, Q3) divide the institutions into four groups by total enrollment, each group having the same number of institutions. Likewise, the three black horizontal lines (Q1, Q2, Q3) divide the institutions into four equal groups by graduate enrollment. The data indicate that the larger institutions have a higher percentage of graduate students among their enrollment. Doctorate-granting institutions with total enrollments less than 3,000 classify about 10 percent of their total student population as graduate students; institutions with enrollment between 3,000 and 12,000 have about 15 percent graduate students; and those with enrollments over 12,000 have about 20 percent graduate enrollment. Figure 15 shows the relation between the number of academic fields in which doctorates are granted at an institution and the total graduate enrollment of the institution. The horizontal axis shows total graduate enrollment on a logarithmic scale, and the vertical axis indicates the number of doctoral fields on a linear scale. The maximum number of fields possible was 26. Each dot of the scattergram represents one institution. The overlay grid of Q1, Q2, Q3 lines is interpreted as in Figure 14. As a rough approximation, it appears there are about 100 graduate students per doctoral field at an institution. The data in Figure 15 show that the median number of doctoral fields for institutions with graduate enrollment greater than 2,000 is 21. Institutions with graduate enrollments between 1,000 and 2,000 have a median of thirteen doctoral fields; those with 300 -1,000 have a median of seven fields; and those with fewer than 300 graduate. students have a median of three doctoral fields. Graduate enrollment places an obvious top limit on numbers of doctoral fields offered in an institution, and most of the largest institutions (more than 2,000 graduate students) have a minimum of seventeen doctoral fields. Figure 16 shows the United States doctoral institutions distributed by first-year graduate enrollrrient in FY 1961 and numbers of doctorates granted five years later in FY 1966. Both axes are logarithmic scales, and the Q1, Q2, Q3 grid overlay is interpreted as in Figures 14 and 15. The data indicate an output of about 1 doctorate per 10 first-year graduate enrollments five years before. The largest institutions, with first-year enrollments greater than 900, grant about 250 doctorates per year. Those with enrollments between 400 and 900 grant about 60 doctorates per year; institutions with 200 -400 enrollments grant about 40 per year; and those with fewer than 200 grant about 7 doctorates per year. The variation from these averages is large. Total institution enrollment relates also to the science -nonscience ratio in doctoral programs in the institution. Small universities, offering few doctoral programs, do not provide the balance between humanities and science that characterize the larger universities. Figure 17 shows the relation. Fifty percent of the institutions with total enrollment less than 6,000 granted over 90 percent of their doctorates in science fields and twenty-one percent of the group granted less than 10 percent of their doctorates in science. The small institution tends to be \"all or nothing at all\" in its science -nonscience balance. In contrast, 82 percent of the institutions with enrollments greater than 6,000 (and all institutions of 17,000 or more) had a ratio of science doctorates to all doctorates falling between 0.30 and 0.79.    ,_2_-_-__.,. "}, {"section_title": "CORRELATES OF BACCALAUREATE-TO-DOCTORATE TIME LAPSE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field Effects", "text": "One very important aspect of the doctoral education process is the time required to complete the job or the time lapse from receipt of baccalaureate to completion of doctorate. Most fellowship programs have as a major goal the reduction of the baccalaureate-to-doctorate time span. A number of factors are often assumed to be related to time lapse, such as the doctoral field, the type of undergraduate institution, and the amount of institutional transfer. This section displays data showing the relation of the above factors to time lapse. The data report two kinds of \"time\"the total calendar time elapsed between year of baccalaureate and year of doctorate and the total time registered in a university. The latter does not distinguish between full time and part time, but it measures the total time the student was officially registered and working ou his graduate program. Figure 18 and Table 14 show baccalaureate4o-doctorate time lapse by field for three 3-year periods. Both Total Time and Total Registered Time are tabulated. Most of the broad fields show decreases of about one-half year in Total Time to the doctorate when the medians of FY 1958-1960and FY 1964-1966 are compared. The exceptions are physical sciences, which show no change, and education, which shows an increase in time lapse. The data reveal no corresponding decreases in Registered Tinie. This has remained about constant for all broad fields. The data show large field differences in total baccalaureate-to-doctorate time. The physical sciences have the shortest median time of 6.3 years in 1964 -1966, and education has the longest with 13.8 years. However, these differences are reduced sharply when using total registered time to 5.1 years for physical sciences and 6.8 years for education.  FY 19584960, 1961FY 19584960, .1963.

The sharp peaks of the science curves at 5 years reflect the fact that most of these students start graduate work almost immediately after the baccalaureate and obtain the doctorate in about 5 years. The broad, less well-defined, distributions of the other fields indicate longer breaks in the formal education pattern and perhaps more part-time study. Time lapse varies by sex. Comparisons of the baccalaureate-to-doctorate time for men with that for women are presented in Chapter V. With the exception of the modest trend noted in total time, the majority of the patterns seem reasonably stable over the past nine years. The remaining tables in this section concentrate on the FY 1964 -1966 data. Figure 19 and the associated Table 15 break the total baccalaureate-todoctorate time lapse into its components: receipt of the baccalaureate to the beginning of graduate work, the beginning of graduate work to the master's degree, and the master's degree to the doctorate. It is important to recall that these statistics apply to persons who have successfully completed doctoral work, and they may not be applicable to the general graduate-school population. Type Of Uncier),),ractuate"}, {"section_title": "Institution", "text": "At least two thirds of the students in fields other than the professions and education started graduate work immediately upon completion of the baccalaureate (time lapse = 0). The modal time from beginning graduate work to the master's degree was 2 years for all but professional fields and education; and the modal master's-to-doctorate time was 3 years in the sciences and more than this for the other fields. The sum of the modal times can be compared with the modal baccalaureate-to-doctorate time lapse of 5 or 6 years. The field differences, which are especially evident in professional fields and education, are largely erased if one uses registered time instead of total time (see the last diagram in Figure 19). Table 15 shows the median times for each field. The substitution of one descriptive statistic (a median) for a total distribution sacrifices much detail, but this procedure is necessary to provide information for 26 fields. It is sometimes assumed in academic circles that time lapse is affected by type of undergraduate institutionthat the person coming from the nondoctoral undergraduate institution who achieves the doctorate will take longer to complete the doctoral program. Extensive analysis of the time-lapse data fails to support this belief. Figure 20 and Table 16 summarize the analysis. Inspection of the figure and the medians shows that the time-lapse patterns, when equated for broad field, do not reveal marked advantages for any type of baccalaureate institution. It should be emphasized that these data refer only to those who were successful in the doctoral program. Perhaps the type of undergraduate institution affects success rates or other aspects of the doctoral program, but it has no great effect on time lapse for those who succeed in achieving the doctorate. In addition to the data presented above, each of the broad field distributions was analyzed to see if some aspect of the distribution other than the median was related to the type of undergraduate institution. For instance, an analysis was made for each baccalaureate type and each broad field to check the percentage of those who completed the doctorate within 5 years, on the assumption that the undergraduate effect, if it existed, would be more visible for those who went through quickly. The following data show in summary form the general results of the analysis: The professional fields and education show some advantage for the doctorategranting institutions, but the sciences and humanities show no effect. A similar analysis was made based on registered time, and it likewise failed to show any marked advantage for a particular type of baccalaureate source. The preceding analyses were based on the 1,294 United States institutions that had been baccalaureate sources to at least one doctorate. The USOE Education Directory lists 1,543 institutions in the United States that granted bachelor's or higher degrees during the academic year 1965-1966, so the baccalaureate source institutions constitute 84 percent of all baccalaureate institutions. It should be noted that in Table 16 the longer time lapse of students from foreign baccalaureate institutions does not occur if one uses registered time instead of total time. Apparently many foreign students take longer to begin graduate school than do the United States students.        Time lapse is affected by the amount of institutional transfer during graduate work and by the decision to take a master's degree. Table 17 shows the relations. Students who omit the master's degree finish their doctoral work sooner, whether the time lapse is measured by total time or registered time. This is true for both United States and foreign students and holds for almost all broad fields (see patterns B, D, and H)."}, {"section_title": "St", "text": "Students who receive each ur.sgree at a different institution take the longest time to complete their work.

This section focuses on the transition between formal education and professional employment. The data derive primarily from three questions on the Survey of Earned Doctorates questionnaire. One question asks the new doctorate recipient to indicate his expected type of postdoctoral employer (university, industry, etc.); a second question asks him to list his expected primary work activity on the job (teaching, research, etc.); and a third asks him in what state or country he expects to work. The data deal with the doctorate recipients' intentions. How accurate are the statements? A follow-up study has been conducted to determine the validity of the answers. Over 2,500 records were selected from the 1962 Doctorate Records File and matched name for name with records of the 1964 National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel maintained by the National Science Foundation. For each person, a comparison was made of his intended type of employer and work activity as reported on the 1962 Doctorate questionnaire with his reported employer and work activity on the 1964 National Register questionnaire. Even allowing for the two-year lag, the results show good validity for the Doctorate Records File data. When the reports of individuals are compared, 85 percent of the respondents were working for the type of employer and engaged in the kind of work activity they had anticipated. When category totals are compared (i.e., the percents e in research or the percentage employed by industry), the correspondence _s very close, the average agreement being 95 percent or better. (Those who thought they would be employed by, say industry, and were not, are partially balanced by those who were employed by industry but had not expected to be.) Therefore, while the following data strictly must be labeled \"intended employer\" or \"intended work activity,\" they are reliable statements about future employment status.  Figure 21 and Table 18 show the type of postdoctoral employer for the doctorate recipients of FX 1958FX -1960FX , 1961FX -1963FX , and 1964FX -1966. Colleges and universities are the major employers of new doctorate recipients, and they have been attracting !greater percentages in each time period.

However, the percentage of physical science doctorate recipients entering industry has fallen off rapidly from 44 percent in 1958-1960 to 30 percent in 1964-1966. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry show especially sharp declines in industrial employment. Government employs sizeable numbers of biological and social scientists, but the percentages are declining. Relatively few graduates from other fields enter government service. Fewer than 10 percent of the new doctorate recipients accepted employment in foreign countries.

The first column, Fellowship, refers to those who expect to be working on postdoctoral research fellowships, and for some purposes the column might reasonably be combined with the second one, Research, to give an over-all research percentage. Also, the data refer only to primary work activity. Many persons work in several kinds of activities, but the questionnaire asked for only the primary function. And finally, it is important to remember that the data refer to the work activity of the doctorate recipients on their first postdoctoral Job. As their years of experience increase, their functions tend to change. ty;  Table 19 shows that research is the most common primary work activity of the natural scientists and engineers. About two thirds of this group are engaged in either staff research or postdoctoral fellowship research. The combination of research and research fellowships accounts for only one fourth of the social scientists and about one in twenty in other fields. For all fields combined, research or research fellowships were the primary work activities for about one third of the new \"research doctorates.\" Most fields show some increase in the percentage of persons choosing teaching as a postdoctoral work activity. Graduates in arts and humanities fields are engaged almost exclusively in this activity. In contrast, fewer than one third of the natural scientists teach as a primary work activity. Education is the only field having appreciable numbers who enter administration immediately after receipt of the doctorate. Many of these were principals, superintendents, or curriculum supervisors before they had completed the doctoral requirements. Table 20 (p. 89) shows the relations between the type of postdoctoral employer and the kind of work activity performed for these employers. The relations are what one would expect. Most persons hired by colleges and universities report teaching as a primary work activity; doctorate recipients in elementary or secondary schools are administrators; the majority of those employed by governmental, nonprofit, or industrial agencies engage in research. About 40 percent of those accepting a job in a foreign country plan to teach, and the remainder expect to do research or have a postdoctoral research fellowship.        It is generally recognized that many students shift majorsand hence profes-FICATION sional goalsas they proceed from baccalaureate to doctoral degrees. However, a considerable amount of field shifting occurs also in the transition between doctorate and job. Table 21 shows the percentage, of persons whose baccalaureate was in the same field as the doctorate and whose jub was in the same field as the doctorate. In all, 60 percent of the !958 -1966 doctorate recipients received a baccalaureate in the same field as that of their doctorate, and 77 percent of the 1955-1960 doctorate recipients were found in 1962 to be working in the same field as that of their doctorate. The table 'shows that some fields are much more stable than others in this respect. A more specific illustration of the flexibility of the education -employment match is shown in Figure 23. The top diagram shows the varied fields of employment of 86 persons from the 1964 National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel who had received their doctoral degrees in solid state physics. A little more than half (46) were employed as solid state physicists and another 11 in ether physics specialties. The remaining one third were employed in the non-physics categories shown. The bottom diagram illustrates the reverse process. It shows t'le great range of doctoral fields for 1,894 persons in the National Register who were employed as solid state physicists. The 46 who had a doctorate in solid state represent 'only 2 percent of the total. Another 1,388 (73 percent) had a doctorate in other physics subfields, and the remaining 25 percent had a doctorate in the many fields listed."}, {"section_title": "90", "text": "The data in Figure 23 are meant to illustrate a point and should not be overgeneralized. Other fields might have very different characteristics from this relatively new and fast-growing field, and another sample of solid state physicists might snow a somewhat different distribution.  Table 7, p. 40). The data in Table 22 provide a more detailed analysis of the results of the doctoral population migration by showing the varying percentages of doctorate recipients in a given state or geographic region at four career stages: high-school graduation, receipt of baccalaureate, receipt of doctorate, and first job. The rank order of the nine geographic regions by number of doctorate recipients shows reasonable stability for all four career stages. The Middle Atlantic and East North Central regions lead for each stage, accounting for 35 -44 percent of the doctoral students. In contrast, the Mountain and East South. Central regions rank last for each career stage, accounting for about 8 percent of the students. In the high -school -to -baccalaureate transition, the percentages in each region as well as the relative rank orders show only small changes. In the transition from baccalaureate to doctorate, the East North Central and Pacific regions were baccalaureate sources of 27 percent but doctoral sources of 38 percent. Between doctorate and first job, New England and East North Central regions granted 34 percent of the doctorates but hired only 24 percent of the graduates. Appendixes D and E show the state-by-state migration from baccalaureate to doctorate and from doctorate to first job. In summary, the data in this section show that doctorate recipients from United States universities perform a variety of work activities for different kinds of employers; they shift fields frequently both during and after their doctoral work; and they are geographically mobile. They must be flexible, and perhaps the best doctoral programs should take this need for flexibility into account.  The Doctorate Records File provides useful information describing the migration of predoctoral students to this country, their education while here, and their subsequent patterns of postdoctoral employment. Specifically, the following data show which foreign countries and foreign institutions were the major sources of students coming to this country. They show to what states the foreign students car.,e, the fields of their doctoral work, the time required to complete the work, and, finally, the postdoctoral migration and employment patterns. 1966. The table indicates also the summary field of doctorate for the students from each region. Appendix G shows a more detailed tabulation of the field of doctorate, and it lists the countries included in each of the world regions."}, {"section_title": "92", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SOURCE COUNTRIES", "text": "The right-hand margin totals show that the number of foreign students receiving doctorates in the United States for the period 1960-1966 almost equaled the total for the preceding years, but the distribution by source country changed noticeably between 1920-1959 and 1960-1966. Before 1960, Canada supplied one third of the foreign doctoral students and was by far the major source country; China ranked second and supplied about one seventh; these two accounted for one half of the foreign doctoral students. Since 1960, Canada and China together have supplied only one fourth of the'foreign doctoral students, and India has taken over the lead from both. Countries of the Near East plus Japan and Korea, which in aggregate supplied 11 percent of the pre-1960 total, accounted for 19 percent of the recent total.  The bottom horizontal rows of Table 23 compare the field of doctorate of foreign and United States students. The foreign students are concentrated more heavily in the natural sciences (67 percent compared with 47 percent for United States students), and the foreign students are less well represented in arts and humanities and education (14 percent of the foreign to 33 percent of the United States students). The concentration in natural sciences is particularly evident with the Indian and Chinese students who have 79 percent and 85 percent, respectively, in these fields.  Once established in graduate school, the foreign student progressed rapidly through his doctoral program. Information from a previous section ( Figure 20 and Table 16, pp. 73-76) showed that even though the total time elapsed from baccalaureate to doctorate was a little longer for foreign students, the registered time was about equal to that of United States students. This suggests that the foreign student might take more time from baccalaureate to entering graduate school, but that once started he proceeded at a good pace. Table 25 data confirm this pattern. The table compares foreign and United States students for the time elapsed (total and registered) from beginning of graduate school until receipt of doctorate."}, {"section_title": "94", "text": "In the science fieldsboth natural and socialthe united States and the foreign students' time lapse were about equal for both total time and registered time. In the nonscience fields, the foreign students completed their doctoral work faster than the United states students, whether measured by total or registered time. The preceding data of this section have indicated the time lapses and the geographic and institutional sources of foreign students who came to the United States for graduate work and achieved the doctorate. The following section deals with the immediate postdoctoral migrations and work activities of the foreign students. As a prelimina!y to discussing postdoctoral employment patterns of United States doctorate recipients from foreign countries, it is of interest to investigate their employment status the year preceding receipt of the doctorate. Table 26 compares the predoctoral employment of the United States and the foreign students, equated for summary field. Foreign students have higher percentages in all areas except Full-Time Employed. Having less full-time employment, receiving more fellowships (in all fields but natural sciences), and having more part-time employment (which includes assistantships), the foreign students are apparently better able to be on campus and devote more time to doctoral work than the United States students. Postdoctoral migration of the United States doctorate recipients from foreign countries is described in Tables 27 and 28 and in Figure 24. This migration has been of critical concern during recent years because foreign students who do not return to their home countries after receipt of the doctorate form one important part of the brain drain. The data reported in Tables 27 and 28 and in Figure 24 (p. 104) are based on the reports of all United States doctorate recipients of foreign citizenship who indicated the geographic location of their first postdoctoral job.8 Do some of these reports indicate hopes or vague plans rather than realities? In order to check this possibility, an additional analysis of the data was made. From the foreign doctorate recipients of 1964 -1966, a group was selected who had indicated in the questionnaire that they had \"signed a contract or made a definite commitment.\" Members of this group were not simply seeking employment or negotiating but were contracted to a specific employer. Presumably they were certain of their country of postdoctoral employment. The responses of this group were compared with the responses of the 1964-1966 total foreign citizenship group listed in the right-hand column of Table 27. The two sets of percentages agreed very well. For example, 39 percent of the Canadians said they were remaining in the United States compared with 40 percent reported in Table 27; 93 percent of the Chinese said they were remaining compared with 90 percent from Table 27; and 55 percent of the total said they were remaining 8. The data from this part of the Survey questionnaire have the lowest response rate (about 80 percent) of any reported in this book. The percentages listed in the tables are calculated on the basis of known cases. To the extent that the postdoctoral plans of the nonrespondents (20 percent of the total) differ from the known cases, the patterns reported would be in error.   Table 27. The data appear to be reliable. Table 27 shows trends for three 3-year periods in the percentage of United States doctorate recipients of !oreign citizenship who intend to remain in the United States for postdoctoral employment. The total number intending to remain almost tripled between FY 1958-1960and FY 1964-1966, and the corresponding percentages increased from 46 to 51 percent. Canada, India, Africa (excluding Egypt), Korea, the Philippines, and Australia show definitely increasing percentages of the foreign doctorate recipients intending to remain. Pakistan and Japan show marked decreases, and the remaining regions reveal either no changes or erratic changes."}, {"section_title": "1;13", "text": "Within a, given time period-1964 -1966, for instance there are large regional variations of the percentages intending to remain. For example, 90 percent of the Nationalist Chinese intend to remain as contrasted wit 14 percent of the Paskistani doctorate recipients.      Of all the foreign citizens, one half remained in the United States and the other half returned to their own or some other foreign country. But it should be noted that 24 percent of those who remained were on postdoctoral fellowships and so were continuing their education. Students of Africa, the Americas, and Australasia have the highest \"return home\" rates; Eastern Asians and the foreign students who received baccalaureates in the United States have the lowest return rates. Table 28 provides more detailed migration data. It should be remembered that these data refer to the intended first postdoctoral job, and the above patterns may or may not correspond well to the distribution of the foreign doctoral students five or more years later. The data do show, however, that the foreign students from most regions are in no great hurry to leave the United States. Table 29 shows the intended postdoctoral work activity of the 6,746 foreign students distributed by world region of employment. Three fourths of the group reported research or teaching as their major work activity, and postdoctoral fellowships accounted for most of the remainder. Higher percentages of the foreign doctorate recipients enter research and postdoctoral fellowships than their United States counterparts; lower percentages enter teaching and administration. Most of the fellowships for the foreign students were granted to those remaining in the United States. The proportion of the foreign doctorate recipients entering research as opposed to teaching reveals large variations depending on the geographic region to which they return. Those returning to Europe and South America and those remaining in the United States are more heavily engaged in research; those returning to other foreign countries have larger numbers entering teaching. In summary, the preceding data show the following patterns characteristic of foreign students who receive doctorates at United States universities: The number of foreign students coming to the United States for doctoral education is growing rapidly. They form an increasing percentage of the total United States doctorate recipients. The \"source countries\" have changed in recent yearsIndia, the Near East, Japan, and Korea showing strong gains. A relatively small percentage of foreign institutions furnishes most of the students who come to the United States. Foreign students who receive the doctorate concentrated heavily in the natural sciences, and they completed their doctoral work as fast as, or faster than, the United States students. Increasing percentages intend to remain in the United States for their first job, the recent totals approaching one half. In their first postdoctoral work activities, the foreign doctorate recipients are primarily engaged in teaching (38 percent), research (37 percent), and postdoctoral fellowship research (15 percent).   Women receive 40 percent of the baccalaureate degrees granted in the United States, and the percentage is increasing. They receive 32 percent of the master's degrees, but this proportion has remained constant for many years. The percentage of women among United States doctorate recipients dropped from 15 to 9 percent between 1920 and 1950, but a gradual increase restored the value to 11 percent by 1960.9 Since 1960, the proportion of women among all doctorate recipients has remained constant, not only for the total, but for each summary field (see Table 30). Academic fields vary greatly in ability to attract women. Only 10 percent of the women received doctorates in the physical sciences, and women accounted for a mere 3 percent of all physical science doctorate recipients. In contrast, 29 percent and 23 percent received degrees in education and the arts and humanities, and they comprised almost one fifth of the doctorate recipients in these fields. Figure 25 shows the distribution of women and men among the various fields. These data indicate that the efforts since World War TI to interest larger percentages of able women in continuing their education to the doctorate, and especially to consider careers in the physical sciences, have had little effect. However, it should be noted that the total number of women doctorate recipients has been increasing. In 1950, 613 women received the doctorate. From 1960 to 1966, the period in which the percentage of women receiving the doctorate remained unchanged (11 percent of the total), the number doubledfrom 1,042 to 2,073. A comparison of the geographic distribution of women and men doctorate recipients at the times of their receiving the baccalaureate and the doctorate is shown in Figure 26 (p. 110). Considering the large amount of migration that occurs at various career stages (Table 22, p. 92), the distributions show remarkable correspondences between the percentages of men and women in a given region at a given educational level. The Middle Atlantic region does have a somewhat higher proportion of women than men at both baccalaureate and doctoral levels, and the West North Central and Mountain regions have slightly lower percentages of women, but these are relatively small deviations from the over-all pattern of approximately equal distributions.  Women Doctorate Recipients by Field, FY 1958-1966 Women Doctorate Recipients Field of Doctorate 1958-1960 1961-1963 1964-1966 "}, {"section_title": "111", "text": "The data in Figure 26 refer to United States women, but an additional 9 percent of the doctorate recipients from foreign countries were women (compared with 11 percent for the United States group). The percentage varied greatly from region to region, as illustrated in the following examples:  Figure 27 shows distributions of age at the doctorate for men and women, all fields combined. The modal ages are about the same-27 for men and 28 for womenbut a smaller percentage of women complete graduate work to the doctorate with minimal interruption. As a result, larger percentages of women receive doctorates after age 40 (30 percent compared with 10 percent for men), and the median age at the doctorate for women is 35 compared with 31 for men. The median age at the doctorate for men and women in the natural sciences differs by less than one yearwomen being slightly younger; in the social sciences and arts and humanities women are older than men by about two years; and in professional fields and education the women are three to five years older. These age differences reflect differences in graduate-school-attendance patterns and field mores rather than academic aptitude. Women are more concentrated in fields with long total-time lapse (arts and humanities and education), and they have more breaks in their graduate-school attendance (see Table 31). Women have longer total-time lapse than men in almost every field, but when registered times are compared, the time lapses are almost identical.   After completing formal education, the first employment pattern for women is generally similar to that of men, but some differences do exist. Figure 28 compares the type of first postdoctoral employer for men and for women, all fields combined. For both sexes, educational institutions are by far the major employers, accounting for four out of five women and two out of three men. The most noticeable difference in pattern is in the percentage choosing industry (13 percent of the men compared to 2 percent of the women). Table 32 provides more detailed data on postdoctoral employment practices in various fields. The physical sciences and engineering show the greatest differences in employment of men and of women but even here the rank order is the same. Smaller percentages of men enter education, and larger percentages go into industry and government. The biological sciences and professic.nal fields show the same general pattern as the physical sciences, but the employment patterns of men and of women differ less than in the physical sciences. The social sciences, arts and humanities, and education show little difference in employment pattern between men and women even though the fieldsdiffer considerably from each other in other respects. The type of employer determines to some extent the kind of work activity performed, so the patterns exhibited in Figure 29 and Teaching is the major postdoctoral work activity for both sexes, but women are more concentrated in this activity than men. This is consistent with the previous findings that a greater percentage of women doctorate recipients receive their degree in the fields of education and the arts and humanities and that graduates of these fields are largely employed by colleges and universities. Men are more likely than women to continue in research, but, even so, fewer than one third of the men and one sixth of the women do research as a primary postdoctoral work activity. If fellowship activities are regarded primarily as research, then two fifths of the men and one fourth of the women are primarily engaged in research in their first postdoctoral employment.
