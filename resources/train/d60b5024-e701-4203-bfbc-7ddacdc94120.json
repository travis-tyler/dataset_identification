Information obtained through the survey is intended to meet the following objectives: to assist in describing the learning environment and experiences of twelfth-grade students, and to assist in distinguishing among different characteristics of schools and the effects of such characteristics on the transitions of students from tenth grade to twelfth grade and beyond. A self-administered, forty-five minute, school administrator questionnaire was completed by the school administrators of eligible schools.'

A school questionnaire was obtained from 97.1 percent of the participating schools in which at least one student completed a questionnaire. The school file has been structured with respect to the NELS:88 student component; thus, frequencies appearing in the codebook are keyed to second follow-up student respondents (N=16,311). No school identification (ID) numbers are provided on second follow-up school public use data file. However, on the school restricted use data file, a school identification number is provided as well as a student-level flag which indicates whether the student was enrolled at the same school at the time of first follow-up and second follow-up data collection. Data users should exercise caution in creating school-level measures from NELS:88 student data. In-school NELS:88 twelfth-grade samples are not necessarily representative of all twelfth graders in the school, and the number of sampled students clustered in a NELS:88 school is often quite small. The forthcoming NELS:88 school effectiveness study data will provide a probability sample of schools and 1 13 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual a much larger sample (typically thirty or more observations per school) of students who are indeed representative of twelfth-grade students in their schools. In view of the importance of school-level data for student-level analyses, a number of key classification variables were created from the school data and attached to student records on both the school and student component data files. Some schocl-level data, such as school control, enrollment, Census region, and urbanicity, are available even for students who were enrolled in schools in which the school administrator did not complete a school questionnaire. For the 2.9 percent nonresponding school administrators, this information was obtained from the Quality Education Data (QED) files.

This study of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort collects data about educational processes and outcomes pertaining to student learning, predictors of dropping out, and the effects of schools on students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn. The first follow-up in 1990 provided the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provided a comparison point to high school sophomores ten years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captured the population of early dropouts (those who leave school between the end of eighth grade and the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. Freshening the IIELS :88 sample to represent the tenth-grade class of 1990 makes trend comparisons with the HS&B sophomore cohort possible.' The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample members entered the second term of their senior year. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school, and also collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Freshening the NELS :88 sample to represent the twelfth-grade class of 1992 makes trend comparisons with the senior cohorts that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B possible. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990, and identified and surveyed those additional students who left school after the first follow-up. The third follow-up is occurring in 1994, when most sample members will be in postsecondary education or in the labor market. The goals of the 1994 round are to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B, and to continue cross-wave comparisons with previous NELS:88 rounds. The third follow-up will permit researchers to assess the effect of eighth-grade and high school curricular experiences on postsecondary education choice. The third follow-up will provide the means by which access of individuals with different backgrounds to quality educational institutions can be examined. The third follow-up will facilitate study of the influences of high school education experiences on postsecondary education and employment opportunities and choices. Labor force participation, postsecondary persistence, curricular progress, and family formation are further research topics which 2 Note, however, that the HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort in 1982 does not strictly constitute a representative sample of the nation's 1982 seniors, but rather a representative sample of 1980 sophomores two years later. Because of the sample freshening that took place in NELS:88 (but not in HS&B), the subset of NELS:88 sample members who were high school seniors in the spring of 1992 are nationally representative of seniors and are comparable to the NLS-72 and HS&B 1980 probability samples of twelfth graders. The process referred to here as \"freshening\" added students who were not in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the country or because they were not in eighth grade in the spring term of 1988. The 1990 freshening process provided a representative sample of students enrolled in tenth grade in the spring of 1990. The 1992 freshening process provided a representative sample of students enrolled in twelfth grade in tht: spring of 1992. 6 2 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual will be explored by the third follow-up. Additionally, the third follow-up will provide a basis for assessing how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route, and will measure the access of dropouts to vocational training programs and to other postsecondary institutions. A fourth follow-up will take place in 1997 or 1998."}, {"section_title": "NELS:38 Study Objectives", "text": "NELS:88's major features include the integration of student, dropout, school, parent, and teacher studies; the initial concentration on an eighth-grade student cohort with follow-ups at two year intervals; the inclusion of supplementary components to support analyses of geographically or demographically distinct subgroups; and the design linkages to previous longitudinal studies and other current studies. Multiple research and policy objectives are addressed through the NELS:88 design. The study is intended to produce a general purpose data set for the development and evaluation of federal educational policy. Part of its aim is to inform decision makers, education practitioners, and parents about the changes in the operation of the educational system over time, and the effects of various elements of the system on the lives of the individuals who pass through it. Specifically, NELS:88 focuses on a number of interrelated policy issues including: identification of school attributes associated with achievement; the transition of different types of students from eighth grade to secondary school; the transition of secondary students to postsecondary education or the work force; the influence of ability grouping and program type on future educational experiences and achievements; determinants of dropping out of the educational system; and changes in educational practices over time. One of the defining features of NELS:88 is the extensive attention it gives to the role of parents. The second follow-up parent survey (the parent survey was also conducted in 1988) gathered data on the effect of parents' attitudes and behaviors on educational or career choices, financial preparation for postsecondary education, the correlates of active parental involvement in the school, and the parent's role in the educational success of their children. Appendix C provides an overview of some of the key policy issues of education ref. arch and the second follow-up student, dropout, and school administrator items which are related to them. The NELS:88 design enables researchers to conduct analyses on three principal levels: crosswave, cross-sectional at a single time point, and cross-cohort by comparing NELS:88 findings to those of HS&B and NLS-72. The first of these levels provides NELS:88 with its primary objective: to serve the purposes of longitudinal measurement. The sampling and data collection designs give priority to maintaining and surveying a substantial number of base year sample members, as well as to sustaining overlapping but analytically distinct cohorts of sophomores and seniors.' Users of NELS:88 data will be able to study the effect of a wide variety of factors on students' educational and professional attainment. The longitudinal data gathered from students, and augmented through parent, teacher, school administrator, and school record (for example, academic transcripts) accounts of students' progression and development, will facilitate scrutiny of various facets of students' lives--their problems and concerns, their relationships with parents, peers, and teachers, and the characteristics of their schools--and permit examination of the impact of these factors on social, behavioral, and educational development. The second analytic level within NELS:88 is cross-sectional. By beginning with a cross-section of 1988 eighth graders, following a substantial subsample of these students at two-year intervals, and freshening the 1990 and 1992 samples to obtain representative national cross-sections of tenth and twelfth 3 Sample freshening in the first follow-up ensured the existence of a nationally representative sophomore cohort as well. All 1990 tenth graders have been retained in the 1992 sample."}, {"section_title": "0l", "text": "12: School Component Data File User's Manual graders, the study also provides a statistical profile of America's eighth graders, high school sophomores, and high school seniors. Finally, NELS:88 has been designed to provide researchers with data for drawing comparisons with previous NCES longitudinal studies. After the release of NELS:88 first follow-up data, researchers were able to conduct trend analyses with the 1980 sophomore cohort of HS&B. With completion of the NELS:88 second follow-up, comparisons may be made among NELS:88, HS&B, and NLS-72 senior cohorts. To facilitate cross-cohort comparisons, many of the content areas contained in the HS&B base year survey were repeated in each wave of NELS:88, and data processing and file conventions have been kept consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with HS&B and NLS-72. For users specifically interested in conducting trend analyses of NLS-72, HS&B and NELS :88 data, further information on content and design similarities and differences between these three studies is presented in Appendix D of the NELS :88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual. Figure 1-3 lists the NELS:88 survey components, instruments, and modal grades for tne base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up. Figure 1-4 illustrates the longitudinal design of NELS :88."}, {"section_title": "Base Year Study and Sample Design", "text": "The base year study design comprised four components: surveys and tests of students, and surveys of school administrators, parents, and teachers. A student questionnaire gathered information about basic background variables and a range of other topics including school work, educational and occupational aspirations, and social relationships. Students also completed a series of curriculum-sensitive cognitive tests to measure educational achievement and cognitive growth between eighth and twelfth grades in four subject areas--reading, mathematics, science, and social studies (history/government). A school administrator questionnaire was completed by school principals or headmasters. It gathered descriptive information about the school's teaching staff, the school climate, characteristics of the student body, and school policies and programs. One parent of each student was asked to respond to a parent survey intended to measure parental aspirations for children, family willingness to commit resources to children's education, the home educational support system, and other family characteristics relevant to achievement. Finally, selected teachers in two of the four subject areas completed a teacher questionnaire designed to collect data about school and teacher characteristics, evaluations of the selected students, course content, and classroom teaching practices. In the NELS:88 base year, a two-stage stratified probability design was used to select a nationally representative sample of eighth-grade schools and students. Schools constituted the primary sampling unit; the target sample size for scheMs was 1,032. A pool of 1,032 schools was selected through stratified sampling with probability of ;lection proportional to eighth-grade size and with oversampling of private schools. A pool of 1,032 replacement schools was selected by the same method. Of the 1,032 initial selections, 30 proved to be ineligible. Of the 1,002 eligible selections, 698 participated. An additional 359 schools (supplied by alternative selections available from the replacement pool) also participated, for a total school sample of 1,057 cooperating schools, of which 1,052 schools (815 public schools and 237 private schools) contributed usable student data. For 1,035 of these 1,052 schools, both student and school administrator data were received. In the NELS:88 base year design, students were the secondary sampling unit. The second stage--student sampling--produced a random selection of 26,4324 students among participating sampled schools, resulting in participation by 24,599 spring term 1988 eighth graders. On average, each of the participating schools was represented by 23 student Figure 1- The selection of students in the first follow-up was implemented in two stages. The first stage of sampling 'nvolved the selection ,:f 21,474 students in the eighth-grade NELS:88 sample in 1988.6 Because some sophomores were not in the country, or were not in the eighth grade in the spring term of 1988, the representative subsample of the eighth-grade cohort was augmented through a process called \"freshening.\" The goal was to provide a representative sample of students enrolled in the tenth grade in the 1989-90 school year. Freshening added 1,229 tenth graders (of whom 1,043 were found to be eligible and retained after final subsampling) who were not contained in the base year sampling frame. Several components were added to the first follow-up to increase its analytic power. One of these enhancements, the base year ineligible (BYI) study, was added to the first follow-up in order to ascertain the 1990 school enrollment status and the 1990 NELS:88 eligibility status of students who were excluded from the base year survey due to a language barrier or physical or mental disability which precluded them from completing a questionnaire and cognitive test. Any eligible students were included in both the first and second follow-up. In addition to the BYI study, the school effectiveness study, designed to sustain analyses of school effectiveness issues, was conducted in conjunction with the first follow-up. The within-school student sample of 251 participating first follow-up high schools in the thirty largest metropolitan statistical As in the previous waves, students were asked to complete a questionnaire and cognitive test. The cognitive test was designed to measure twelfth-grade achievement and cognitive growth between 1988 and 1992 in the subject areas of mathematics, science, reading, and social studies (history/citizenship/ geography). The student questionnaire asked students about such topics as academic achievement; student perceptions and feelings about their curriculum and school; family structure and environment; social relations; and aspirations, attitudes, and values, especially as they relate to high school and occupational or postsecondary educational plans. The student questionnaire also gathered data about the family decision-making structure during the critical transition from secondary school to postsecondary education or the work environment. The student questionnaire contained a supplement for early graduates, the intent of which was to document the reasons for and circumstances of early graduation. If a student was a first-time participant in NELS:88, he or she also completed a new student supplement, containing basic demographic items which were asked in the base year but not repeated in the second follow-up. A school administrator questionnaire, as in the first follow-up, was completed by school principals or headmasters. In a departure from the base year and first follow-up teacher surveys, only one teacher, . either a mathema.p:s or science teacher, was asked to complete a questionnaire for each sampled student enrolled in these subject areas in a NELS:88 sampled school."}, {"section_title": "F2: School Component Data File User's Manual", "text": "The second follow-up, in addition to surveying students who were enrolled in school, surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school at some point between the spring term of the 198i-88 school year and the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. The dropout questionnaire collected information on a wide range of subjects, including reasons for leaving school, school experiences, absenteeism, plans for the future, employment, attitudes and self-concept, and home environment.  Two new components, the transcript and the course offerings components, were added to the NELS:88 second follow-up. These .components provide archival data which describe the academic experience of high school students and the curricula offered by their schools. The complete high school transcript record was collected for 1) the contextual samplestudents attending sampled schools in the spring of 1992; 2) all dropouts, dropouts in alternative programs, and early graduates, regardless of school affiliation; and 3) triple ineligibles enrolled in the twelfth grade in the spring of 1992, regardless of school affiliation. Triple ineligibles are sample members who were ineligible for the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up surveys due to mental or physical disability, or language barrier. NELS:88 course-taking data will provide not only a baseline against which future student outcome measures can be compared, but will illuminate trends when contrasted to the 1982 HS&B high school transcript study, the 1987 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) transcript study, and the 1990 NAEP transcript study. The course offerings component provides curriculum data from second follow-up school effectiveness study schools through which school effects on student outcomes can be studied. The school effectiveness study (SES) was added to the first follow-up to provide a probability sample of tenth-grade schools, with a sizable and representative within-school sample of students, through which longitudinal school-level analysis (comparable to 1980-82 HS&B sophomore cohort analysis) could be conducted. In the first follow-up school effectiveness study, permission to conduct the study was gained from 251 schools and 248 of those schools were final SES participants. The second follow-up school effectiveness study returned to 247 of the 251 cooperating first follow-up SES schools, conducting freshening on both longitudinal and SES sample members, and selecting additional students from the pool including students who transferred into the school since the 1989 selection of SES students. The second follow-up school effectiveness study was enhanced by the addition of archival data collected by the new course offerings component, and was further augmented by the administration of free response science and mathematics cognitive test items in SES schools. 1.7\nThe timing of the second follow-up parent survey was different from the timing of the base year parent survey due to differences in the content of the questionnaires. Because the second follow-up parent questionnaire included questions on financial aid for postsecondary education and this information is not available to most families until late in the spring of teenagers' twelfth grade, the parent survey was not conducted at the same time as the student and dropout surveys. However, parent respondents were asked to refer to the spring of 1992 when completing the questionnaire. The base year parent survey was conducted concurrently with the student data collection. Two weeks after the questionnaires were mailed, a postcard reminder was mailed to all parents. For parents who had already completed the questionnaire, the postcard thanked them for their participation. For parents who had not yet returned their questionnaire, the postcard asked them to complete and mail the questionnaire to NORC at their earliest convenience. Starting two weeks after the postcard reminder was mailed to parents, telephone interviewers began prompting nonresponding parents over the telephone for their completed questionnaire. Telephone interviews were attempted with a subsample of parents who did not respond to the postcard and telephone prompts. To minimize mode effects between self-administration and telephone administration of the instrument, interviewers were trained to adapt the questions to make sense when read over the telephone. Additionally, parents were asked to read along in the questionnaire during the telephone interview if they had the copy of the questionnaire mailed to them. Special steps were taken to ensure comparable completion rates for the parents of OBEMLA (Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander) oversampled students and dropouts. In the initial mailing of questionnaires to parents, both English and Spanish questionnaires were mailed to parents of Hispanic students and dropouts so that an Hispanic parent could complete the questionnaire in the language with which the parent was more comfortable. Spanish speaking interviewers were trained to administer the questionnaire over the telephone in Spanish when necessary. Similar to the base year parent survey when 575 Spanish-language questionnaires (2.5% of all parents and 23.0% of Hispanic parents) were completed, 373 Spanish-language parent questionnaires (2.1% of all parents and 21.6% of Hispanic parents) were completed during the second follow-up. While a native language questionnaire was not available to Asian and Pacific Islander parents, parents who spoke the most common Asian languages were prompted over the telephone for the return of the questionnaire by a native speaker. The languages in which these parents were prompted included Chinese, Japanese, Tagalog, Korean, and Vietnamese. In the respondent's native language, Asian telephone interviewers explained why the parent's participation in the study was important and encouraged them to seek the assistance of another adult for completing the English version of the questionnaire; however, no translation of the questionnaire into these languages was conducted over the telephone.\nThe student ID code consists of a five-digit base year school ID followed by a two-digit student code. Though both sets of numbers were randomly assigned to maintain confidentiality, the ID numbers contain embedded linking, stratum and PSU information.' Students added to the first or second followup through freshening were linked to a core sample member. The base year school ID of the linked student was used as the root of the added student's ID. Thus, in all cases, the student ID links students and dropouts to a base year school. First Follow-Up and Second Follow-Up School Links. Unlike the base year school ID, the first and second follow-up school identification codes are not embedded in the student ID. In the first followup, a public release school ID, \"F1SCHID\" was created and added to both the student and the school component files for that round. In the second follow-up, the school public release ID number is excluded from all public release files to maintain confidentiality. However, the public release school ID number and a special indicator, F2F1SCFL, are included on the restricted use school file. Although the public release school ID on the restricted use school file allows researchers to investigate the size of student clusters within second follow-up schools, users are cautioned that the NELS:88 secondary schools are not a representative sample and cannot legitimately be analyzed apart from the student sample."}, {"section_title": "NELS:88 Sponsors", "text": "The NELS:88 sponsor, the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), provided federal agencies, states, and educational institutions with an opportunity to expand the scope of the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up studies and enrich them through a variety of means. Enhancements sponsored by various groups included: sample supplements for states to provide representative state samples, oversamples of specific student groups, supplemental questions for various data collection instruments, and supplemental questionnaires."}, {"section_title": "Sample Supplements and Augmentations", "text": "Sample supplements and augmentations for the second follow-up were sponsored by various sources.

While this manual is specifically designed for use with the public release files, it is also appropriate for use with the restricted data. Because multilevel microdata (that is, individual-level data from multiple, linkable sources) carries with it some risk of statistical disclosure of institutional or individual identities, the NELS:88 data have been extensively analyzed to determine which items of information, used alone, in conjunction with other key variables, or in conjunction with public external sources such as school universe files, have significant disclosure potential. Variables that were found to pose significant disclosure risks were suppressed or altered to remove or substantially reduce such risks. For example, in some cases, continuous variables have been recast as categorical variables, or fine-grained categorical variables have been more grossly recategorized. In a few instances, data elements have been suppressed or changed. Because of this, a particular school or individual student might be characterized in terms of a certain variable on the restricted use version of the NELS:88 data, but be coded to missing on the public files, coded to an adjacent response category, or included in a code which collapsed two or more response categories. These suppressions and recodes have been clearly labelled in the codebooks included in each data file user's manual. While the extremely high value that is placed on confidentiality--not only by federal statute, but also by NCES and contractor standards--justifies these alterations of the data, it is recognized that some of these protections against disclosure may at times reduce the analysis potential of certain variables in the data set. For example, when only ranges of percentages are given for a variable, threshold points that may be important for some analyses may be obscured, or nonlinearities in relationships hidden. No matter how thoughtfully continuous variables are transformed into categorical form, different cut points F2: School Component Data File User's Manual for the categories may be desirable, depenuing on one's particular analytic purposes. While most suppressed data will have only a negligible effect on most analyses, there are times when the suppressed information is critical. For this reason, NCES also makes restricted use data files available to qualified researchers with a proven need for the data in its restricted use form. To obtain the restricted use data, it is necessary for an organization to obtain a licensure agreement from NCES. The agreement must be signed by the principal investigator and by someone authorized to commit the organization to the legal requirements.

The geography questions touched on patterns of settlement and food production shared by other societies as well as our own. NORC's subcontractor, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), developed the cognitive test *battery for the second follow-up. Six forms of the cognitive test battery were produced in the second follow-up, each comprising a different combination of mathematics and reading difficulty levels. Each sample member's test form was determined by his or her scores on the base year and/or first follow-up mathematics and reading tests; freshened students and first follow-up nonrespondents received the intermediate version of the second follow-up cognitive test battery. The purpose of the multilevel design of the second follow-up cognitive test battery was to guard against ceiling and floor effects which may occur when testing must span four years of sci:ooling. This adaptive approach tailors the difficulty of the reading and mathematics tests to the ability of the respondent, thereby leading, given limitations in testing time, to a more accurate measurement than a single level design.

The dropout questionnaire collected data about the last school attended by the sample member and the school's climate, reasons for leaving school, and actions school personnel, parents, and friends took when the respondent stopped going to school. Respondents also reported on their likelihood of returning to and graduating from high school, and described their current activities, employment history, and future plans. The hour-long, self-administered questionnaire was normally completed with an NORC interviewer present, at either a group or single survey session and was available in both English and Spanish. However, in some cases the dropout questionnaire was administered as a telephone interview. In addition to the dropout questionnaire, an 85-minute cognitive test battery was also administered to dropouts when possible. Because of the difficulty in collecting test data from dropouts, and because data from many dropouts was collected in telephone interviews which preclude testing, the NELS:88 second follow-up achieved a comparatively low (41 percent) cognitive test completion rate for dropouts.

Within each stratum, schools were selected with probabilities proportional to their estimated eighth-grade enrollment to achieve virtual self-weighting. In addition, schools were oversampled in certain special strata so that policy-relevant subgroups would be adequately represented in the sample. Within each school approximately 26 students were to be randomly selected (typically, 24 regularly sampled students and two, on average, OBEMLA-supplement Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander oversampled students). In schools with fewer than 24 eighth graders, all eligible students were selected. Because of the incidence of small schools in the NELS:88 sample, the average--within school sample size for the base year--was 25 students (or 23 participating students). From a national frame of about 39,000 schools with eighth grades, a target sample size of 1,032 schools was set. Some 1,052 schools--815 public and 237 private--participated and provided usable eighth-grade student data. NORC's sampling frame was the school database compiled by Quality Education Data, Inc.

First, the sample was to include approximately 21,500 students who were in the eighth-grade sample in 1988 (including base year nonrespondents). This longitudinal cohort was to be distributed across 1,500 schools. Second, the sample was to constitute a valid probability sample of all students currently enrolled F2: School Component Data File User's Manual in the tenth grade in the 1989-1990 school year. This entailed freshening the sample with students who were tenth graders in 1990 but not in the eighth grade during the 1987-1988 school year. Third, the first follow-up was to include a sample of students who had been deemed ineligible for base year data collection (because physical, mental, or linguistic barriers prevented them from participating) so that those able to take part could be added to the first follow-up student sample, and demographic and school enrollment information could be obtained for them. Longitudinal Cohort. The general sample design strategy for this component of the sample involved subsampling students selected for the base year with non-zero probabilities related to characteristics of their 1990 schools. Base year students who had dropped out of school between 1988 and 1990 were subsampled with certainty (their probabilities of selection were set equal to one). Base year students attending school in 1990 were subsampled with probabilities related to the number of other base year students attending the same school. Base year students who were reported to be attending a school with at least 10 other base year students were sampled with certainty. All other students were sampled with probabilities greater than zero, but less than one. Including nonrespondents, the NELS:88 base year sample comprised 26,432 students. Of these, 96 were deemed out of scope for the 1990 first follow-up (including students who had died or moved out of the U.S.). Among the remaining 26,336 students, 348 were found to have dropped out of school; all of these students were selected into the first follow-up with certainty (probability of selection equal to one).' Distribution of Students in Schools. It was determined that the remaining pool of 25,988 students were distributed among 3,967 schools.' As had been anticipated, the distribution of these students among schools was highly skewed. It was found that approximately 75 percent of the students (19,568 of 25,988) were attending approximately 23 percent (908 of 3,967) of the schools; each of these schools included at least 11 base year students. All of these 19,568 students were included in the first follow-up with certainty. The remaining 6,420 students were distributed among 3,059 schools with 10 or fewer members of the base year sample. Their sampling probabilities for the first follow-up depended on the number of base year students the school contained. The efficiency of this design relative to one with no subsampling at all was 66.5 percent.' These school--or, more precisely, clusters of base year students--were subsampled to achieve the final NELS:88 first follow-up school sample, after the conclusion of the 1989 spring term. There were 1,468 schools (1,506 student clusters) selected. However, for purposes of the first follow-up school administrator survey, the school sample was defined as a specific subset of the NELS:88 schools. This subset was the schools selected via their The 348 dropouts comprise 250 dropouts whose status was confirmed by the student's home, 58 sample members whom the school reported to have dropped out but field interviewers could not locate, and 40 students who were institutionalized. The latter group are not necessarily dropouts in strict sense of the first follow-up dropout definition because in some cases they were receiving academic instruction. However, they were grouped with the dropouts to ensure that they would remain in the first follow-up sample with certainty. When the school a student was attending could not be identified, a separate \"school\" of size one was created. This was the case for 221 students who could not be located and ten students who were in home study. Hence, the number of actual schools was 3,736. The measure of efficiency was computed as 1/(1 + RV) * 100%, where RV is the relative variance of the weights required to compensate for the different rates of subsampling.

The second sampling objective was to create a valid probability sample of students enrolled in tenth grade in the 1989-1990 school year; this goal was achieved by a process we have termed \"freshening.\" The freshening procedure was carried out so that students who were not enrolled in the eighth grade in the U.S. in 1988 had a chance of being selected for the sample. The freshening process could yield zero, one, or more than one new sample member in a given school. A total of 1,229 new students were added to the tenth-grade sample--on average, just less than one student per school. Some of these freshened students were dropped in the subsampling process described below either because they themselves were not included in the subsample or because the base year student to whom they were linked was not included. Some 1,043 students selected through the freshening procedure remained in the final first-follow-up sample. Subsampling the Eighth-Grade Cohort and Freshened Sophomore Samples. After the initial selection of the longitudinal cohort, the combined longitudinal-freshened sample was further subsampled. The students dropped from the first follow-up as a result of subsampling were also excluded in the second follow-up. Two categories of sample members were subsampled: 1) students who had transferred out of the school from which they had initially been selected for the first follow-up sample; and 2) first follow-up nonrespondents who were classified as potential dropouts. NORC selected a 20 percent subsample of transfer students and a 50 percent sample of \"potential dropouts.\" Table 3.1.3-1 lists the first follow-up sample by race and means of entry into the sample. Sample of Base Year Ineligibles. The NELS:88 base year sample excluded students for whom the NELS:88 survey instruments would be unsuitable (i.e., students with a mental disability and students who are not proficient in English) and students whose physical or emotional problems would have made participation in the survey unduly difficult. A final sample of 653 of these students were selected for a followback study of these students. The eligibility status of these students was reassessed, their school enrollment status and basic demographic characteristics were determined, and student questionnaire data were obtained from those deemed able to complete a questionnaire. Further detail on sample eligibility in the base year is provided in the NELS:88 Base Year Sample Design Report and in the NELS:88 First Follow-Up Final Technical Report.

First, the sample was to constitute a valid probability sample of all students enrolled in the twelfth grade in the 1991-1992 school year. This entailed freshening the sample with students who were twelfth graders in 1992 but were not in the eighth grade in the U.S. in the 1987-88 school year, just as the first follow-up sample had been freshened in 1989 to achieve a 1990-91 representative sample of sophomores. Additionally, it was necessary to reassess the eligibility status of selected students found in previous waves to be ineligible, and to include them in the cohort if they were determined to be eligible for the 43 27 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual Figures in this table represent the first follow-up constructed variable frequencies.

Second, to continue the examination of the dropping out phenomenon, dropouts were to be retained with certainty. Third, it was highly desirable for policy analysis purposes to retain the maximum number of Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians from the first follow-up sample. Fourth, to minimize nonresponse bias first follow-up nonrespondents were to be retained with certainty. Fifth, the sample was to be clustered in 1,500 schools from which contextual data --including school administrator, teacher, and transcript data--would be collected. It was hoped that these goals could be acLieved with minimal loss to both sample efficiency and effective sample size. Longitudinal Cohort. When second follow-up tracing of cohort members was completed, it was found that the first follow-up sample (that is, the sum of base year respondents and nonrespondents retained after first follow-up subsampling and first follow-up freshened students) was much more widely dispersed than had been anticipated. After eliminating the locations of the \"known\" dropouts' (N=1,564) 4 In the second follow-up, dropouts were defined differently for sampling purposes than for data collection purposes. (See the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Dropout Component Data File User's Manual, section 4.3.1 for further details regarding the definition of dropouts for data collection and assignment of questionnaire.) For sampling purposes, dropouts comprised all individuals who were classified in the first follow-up as ever having dropped out--that is, dropouts (individuals who were not enrolled in school in the spring term of 1990) and stopouts (spring term 1990 students with a recorded 1988-1990 dropout episode), regardless of their school enrollment status as of the second follow-up spring term 1991 tracing F2: School Component Data File User's Manual from consideration (dropouts were sampled with certainty), the remaining eligible sample of students (N=18,726) was dispersed among 3,224 schools/locations. Including dropouts, there were 4,788 locations. Once non-school locations associated with dropouts, early graduates, institutionalized sample members, home study students, and unlocatable sample members were subtracted from the total, there were 2,258 school sites. It was clear that even if no attempt were made to satisfy the second goal retention with near certainty of Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians from the first follow-up sample--that the fifth goal of achieving a cluster of students in 1,500 schools could not be met without significant losses in sample efficiency, effective sample size, or both. Table 3.1.4-1 shows the distribution of students eligible for second follow-up sampling (excluding dropouts) by school size, as well as the number of schools with at least one sample member who was either Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian. The data in the table indicated that to achieve disproportionate retention of minority students most of the schools containing these students would have to be selected, leaving few additional sample selections to distribute among the remaining school sites and contradicting the initial sampling plan to include with certainty any school with at least five NELS:88 sample members enrolled at the school. After consideration of several alternative allocationstaking into account the negative effects of subsampling on sample efficiency, the strong desire to retain as many Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians as possible, and the substantial investment made in two prior rounds in obtaii student, parent, teacher, and school data for those students who would have been subsampled out--it was decided to include all first follow-up\" sample members in the second follow-up sample. Initial Selection of the Second Follow-Up School Sample. All first follow-up sample members remaining after subsampling were included in the second follow-up (all sample members dropped from the first follow-up due to subsampling were also excluded from the second follow -up). Additionally, the school administrator, teacher, and transcript components were limited to a maximum of 1,500 schools. For this reason it was still necessary to select a sample of schools, although the students falling outside that sample would not be excluded from the study. For students in the 1,500 schools selected, the full range of data--student, school administrator, parent, teacher, and transcript data--were collected; for the students in a school not among those selected, only student and parent data were collected. A total of 2,258 schools were identified in the second follow-up tracing of the NELS:88 first follow-up sample; 1,500 of these were targeted for contextual data collection. In the spring of 1991, interviewers traced students to schools, and all 1,030 schools identified as having four or more first follow -up sample members enrolled were included in the school-level. sample with certainty (i.e., probability of 1.0). Prior to the fall of 1991 the contextual school sample was finalized through the following sampling process. A random sample of 45 of the 60 (probability=0.75) schools containing three sample members was selected. A random sample of 104 of the 160 (probability=0.65) schools containing two first follow-up sample members was selected for retention. Finally, a random sample of 321 of the 1,008 (probability =0.31845) schools identified as containing one first follow-up sample member was selected for retention in the sample. In the fall of 1991 interviewers confirmed the enrollment of students at schools previously identified as enrolling three or fewer NELS:88 students. effort. In other words, dropouts who had since returned to school and stopouts who remained in school were still counted as dropouts for sampling purposes, along with institutionalized individuals and the additional dropouts identified during second follow-up tracing.   31  9   32  27   5    22   21   1   13  12   1   6  6  0    6   5   1    5   3   2   7  6   1    4  2  2    5  5  0    2   1   1   1  1   0    1   1   0   2  2  0    3   3   0   37   1  1   0  38   1   0   1   40   1   1   0   41   2   1   1   44   1   0   1   30   46 re F2: School Component Data File User's Manual Note: known school-leavers are not included in the numbers above. School Sample for Freshening Purposes. Like the first follow-up student and school samples, the movement of students among schools resulted in a somewhat amorphous base from which to select schools and collect data. Students could have transferred any time between the time they were traced to a specific school in the spring of 1991 to the fall of 1991, when they were freshened in the fall of 1991, and when student and school administrator data were collected during the spring of 1992. It was possible for students to transfer to either a school that had been identified as a NELS:88 second follow-up sampled school or to a non-NELS:88 school. Because students may have transferred between schools at any time during the spring or fall of 1991, freshening did not necessarily occur at each of the 1,500 sampled schools in the second follow-up. Freshening occurred only at those schools enrolling NELS:88 sample members as of the first day of the 1991-1992 school year.' School Sample for Purposes of the School Administrator Survey. The school sample for the purposes of collecting contextual data from school administrators and teachefs included a subset of the 1,500 contextual schools at which NELS:88 sample members were still enrolled at the beginning of student data collection in January 1992. Data were sought from school administrators at 1,387 schools at which at least one student was enrolled at the beginning of phase 3 data collection and which yielded at least one completed student questionnaire. However, by the end of second follow-up data collection, there were only 1,374 contextual schools at which at least one student was enrolled. Figure 3-1 provides an illustration of the longitudinal sample design of the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up cohorts and their inclusion in the second follow-up contextual sample. Only those freshened sample members who remained in school through the spring term became members of the HS&B-comparable NELS:88 sophomore cohort. However, autumn sophomores who had dropped out by spring were surveyed in both first and second follow-up. While these \"freshened dropouts\" were included on the original first follow-up public release, in the current re-release these cases appear only on the privileged use files. Users should note that school-level data from this sample of schools, to be used in analysis with second follow-up student data, must be adjusted with a weight, F2CXTWT, calculated separately for the students included in the contextual components sample. If that weight is not applied, there will be a potential for systematic bias with respect to those factors associated with attendance at schools with fewer NELS:88 students. For example, students who are more likely to transfer to different schools will be under-represented if the weight is not applied."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Weights", "text": "The general purpose of weighting survey data is to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection and to adjust for the effects of nonresponse. Weights are often calculated in two main steps. In the first step, unadjusted weights are calculated as the inverse of the probabilities of selection, taking into account all stages of the sample selection process. In the second step, these initial weights are adjusted to compensate for nonresponse; such nonresponse adjustments are typically carried out separately within multiple weighting cells. This is the process that was applied to weighting NELS:88 data in all rounds."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Base Year Sample Weights", "text": "The base year weights were based on the inverse of the probabilities of selection into the sample and on nonresponse adjustment factors computed within weighting cells. Two different weights were calculated to adjust for the fact that not all sample members have data for all instruments. The weight BYQWT applies to 24,599 student questionnaires (and is also used in conjunction with base year parent data), while BYADMWT applies to the 1,035 completed school administrator questionnaires. These weights project to the population of approximately 3,008,080 eligible eighth graders in public, Catholic, and other private schools in 1988. The base year weighting procedures consisted of two basic stages: Stage 1. Calculation of a preliminary base year weight based on the inverse of the product of the probabilities of selection for the base year sample. Stage 2. Adjustment of this preliminary weight to compensate for \"unit\" nonresponse, that is, for noncompletion of an entire school questionnaire or student questionnaire. The unit varied depending upon the weight being adjusted. The nonresponse-adjusted school weight was derived as the product of the school's preliminary weight times a nonresponse adjustment factor intended to adjust for the fact that 17 sampled schools did not return a completed questionnaire. The preliminary weight for students was based upon the inverse of the probability that the student's school was selected into the sample multiplied by the inverse of the probability that the student was sampled within the school. The nonresponse-adjusted student weight was derived as the product of the student's preliminary weight times a nonresponse adjustment factor intended to adjust for the fact that some of the sampled students did not participate, that is, did not return a completed questionnaire. Statistical properties of the base year weights are presented in Table 3.2.1-1. Each school appearing on the NELS:88 base year school file, and each student appearing on the NELS:88 student file, has a value for the final weight variable. The weight represents the probability of selection into the sample, in addition to a factor that adjusts for nonresponse. Thus, the weight serves 33 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual the purpose of allowing a particular case to represent other nonsampled cases within its sampling stratum,and to represent nonresponding cases similar to it in various respects. Because separate final student and school weights have been provided, the construction of each will be considered separately in the following discussion. Base Year School Weights. The final school weight, BYADMWT, was derived using a multistage process. First, an initial weight--which represented the inverse of the school's selection probability--was attached to each school record in a file containing records for all eligible schools in the NELS:88 sample. A logistic regression procedure was used to estimate in terms of a probability of nonresponding the degree to which each of the responding schools resembled a nonresponding school. This estimated probability of nonresponse was the first adjustment factor applied to a school's weight. Next, a polishing procedure--multi-dimensional raking--further adjusted the weights to sum to known population totals within strata. Estimating the nonresponse probability for each of the responding schools was possible because key background information on almost all of the nonresponding schools was available. The final result of these procedures was a weight for each of the responding schools adjusted to compensate for nonresponse. For the purpose of adjusting the school weight, a nonresponding school was defined as a school for which both school administrator questionnaire data and student questionnaire data were unavailable. Base Year Student Weights. The final student weight, BYQWT, was also derived using a multistage process. A design weight for each eligible student on a participating school's sample roster represented the student's probability of selection within the school. A student-level nonresponse adjustment factor was calculated by forming weighting cells based upon the combination of certain levels of variables representing school type, region, ethnicity, and gender. For each student, the product of a preliminary school weight and the student's design weight was formed. (The preliminary school weight F2: School Component Data File User's Manual was slightly different from BYADMWT. BYADMWT was adjusted to accommodate the 17 schools for which school administrator questionnaire data were unavailable though student questionnaire data had been obtained. The preliminary school weight eliminated this step in the adjustment process. Thus, it is appropriate for application to the 1,052 schools with student questionnaire data available.) This product was summed for participating and nonparticipating students within weighting cells. The ratio of the sums for all sampled students to participating students was used as the nonresponse adjustment factor for each student's design weight."}, {"section_title": "Calculation of First Follow-Up Sample Weights", "text": "Two weights were developed for the overall NELS:88 first follow-up sample. The first, or basic, weight applies to all members of the first follow-up sample who completed a first follow-up questionnaire, regardless of their participation status in the base year. The basic weight (F1QWT) allows projections to the population consisting of all persons who were either in the eighth grade during the 1987-88 school year or in the tenth grade during the 1989-90 school year. Thus, this population encompasses both populations of prime analytic interest--the population of 1990 tenth graders (including those who were not eighth graders in 1988) and the 1988 eighth-grade population (excluding any additional 1990 tenth graders). By selecting the appropriate sample members, analysts can use this basic weight to make unbiased projections to the first of these populations (i.e., 1990 tenth graders). The second, or panel, weight applies to all members of the first follow-up sample with complete data from both rounds of the study. The panel weight (F1PNLWT) can be used to make projections to the other key analytic population--1988 eighth graders (excluding those ineligible for base year data collection).

Analysts who are interested in performing analyses of first follow-up student data in conjunction with the first follow-up school administrator data should use the first follow-up basic student weight, F1QWT. In the second follow-up, students were not subsampled, but only a subset of schools attended by the NELS:88 cohort was included in the school administrator sample, and a special contextual weight, F2CXTWT, was developed for cross-sectional analysis with second follow-up school data.

Table 7.1-2 summarizes the weights, sample numbers, and sample indicators necessary for student-level analyses performed in conjunction with base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up school administrator data. Process for Calculation of Second Follow-Up Weights. A basic four-step process was defined for the calculation of all eight questionnaire weights. The first step, developing a classification scheme, was done at the beginning of the weighting process for all students in the sample. The values remained static and were used for all weights. Steps 2 through 4 were followed for all weights, but the results of each were tailored according to the characteristics of each weight's specific population. Step 1. Develop a classification scheme. All sample members were divided into sample groups depending on their status during data collection for each round of NELS:88. Freshened students were assigned the status of their linked student. Students whose status was unknown had their status imputed based upon the distribution of status across others in their base year, first, or second follow-up categories and, where group size permitted, race and gender were also considered. The basic classifications for a single round are: In this classification scheme, \"dropout\" (following the High School and Beyond definition) refers to a student who has left a diploma-granting high school program. This included members who were not pursuing an education at all, home study students, members who were continuing their education in a non-traditional setting (e.g., preparing for the GED examination), and institutionalized sample members. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, early graduates were included in the \"in school\" category. Second, because sample members in non-traditional schools during the first follow-up were classified as students then, they were treated as such during the calculation of their first follow-up status. \"Ineligible\" refers to members who were not surveyed due to a language barrier or a mental or physical incapacity. \"Expected grade\" means tenth grade in the first follow-up and twelfth grade or early graduate in the second follow-up. Step 2. Establish second follow-up design weight. The design weight reflects the selection probabilities for each case for a given population. Sample members may have multiple design weights that vary depending upon the weight that is being calculated. For the weights unaffected by school sampling (F2QWT, F2PNLWT, F2F1PNWT) and for the dropouts, early graduates, and ineligible twelfth graders in F2TRSCWT,7 the design weight used is equal to the first follow-up design weight. Second follow-up freshened students take on the first follow-up design weight of the student they were linked to in the freshening process. When sample members are included due to their association with a sampled school in F2TRSCWT and for all members in the F2CXTWT population, it is equal to the first follow-up design weight divided by their school's second follow-up selection probability. For students represented in the parent sample, the calculation of F2PAQWT uses the first follow-up design weight divided by the parent's second follow-up selection probability. Step 3. Adjust for second follow-up nonresponse. Nonresponse adjustment cells were based upon combinations of the classification values from step 1 as well as race (Hispanic, API, other, unknown), and gender for the members of that weight's population. The second follow-up design weight for each responding sample member was inflated by a Included in the transcript data files are approximately 90 students who were ineligible in all three rounds of NELS:88 and were seniors in 1992."}, {"section_title": "54", "text": "F2: School Component Data File User's Manual factor equal to the inverse of the weighted response rate for thoil cell. This yielded their nonresponse adjusted weight. This step wag perfortazd independently for each weight calculated. For second followup freshened students the nonresponse adjusted weight serves as their final weight. Step 4. Perform multidimensional raking. Sample members who were not freshened in the second follow-up had their second follow-up nonresponse adjusted weight further adjusted through a raking step. The total sum of the weights and percentage distributions that were used in raking were developed as follows: a) Targets were developed that used the second follow-up expanded sample weight. The second follow-up expanded weight is a weight that was calculated for every sample member in order to estimate national dropout rates! It was used in developing total sum of weights targets to ensure consistency in dropout rates derived when using questionnaire weights. These targets were calculated separately for each of the eight questionnaire weights and reflected the characteristics of each weight's inference population. Two types of target numbers were developed. The sum of expanded weights for a given questionnaire weight's inference population was used as the target total population for that questionnaire weight. Weighted frequency distributions using the expanded weights associated with a questionnaire weight's inference population were calculated for the following: dropout rates between base year and first follow-up; dropout rates between first follow-up and second follow-up; and first follow-up status (from step 1) and second follow-up status (from step 1). b) Additional percentage targets were developed for raking using first follow-up weights. Calculated independently for each of the eight weights according to the characteristics of each inference population, these targets used F1QWT for sample members who had been eligible for the first follow-up questionnaire or the first follow-up design weight for those who were not. Weighted frequencies calculated using these weights were used as target distributions. These target categories included race (white, black, Hispanic, API, American Indian, unknown), gender, base year school region, base year school type, and base year school urbanicity. Results of Weighting. Io check the second follow-up contextual weight, its statistical properties were analyzed. Table 3.2.3-2 displays the mean, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum, maximum, skewness, and kurtosis for the weight.

Target margins for the expanded weight were calculated using the first follow-up expanded sample weight (a similar weight developed in the first follow-up for estimating the 1988-90 dropout rate) for students for whom one was calculated and first follow-up design weights for the first follow-up sample members who did not receive a first follow-up expanded weight (such as the freshened). Second follow-up freshened students have their second follow-up design weight as their expanded sample weight. This step was performed for the sample as a whole.

Because the NELS :88 sample design involved stratification, disproportionate sampling of certain strata, and clustered (i.e. multi-stage) probability sampling, the resulting statistics are more variable than they would have been had they been based on data from a simple random sample of the same size. The calculation of exact standard errors for survey estimates can be difficult and expensive. Popular statistical analysis packages such as SPSS (Statistical Program for the Social Sciences) or SAS (Statistical Analysis System) do not calculate standard errors by taking into account complex sample designs. Several procedures are available for calculating precise estimates of sampling errors for complex samples. Procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR) produce similar results.' Consequently, it is largely a matter of convenience which approach is taken. For NELS:88, NORC used the Taylor Series procedure to calculate the standard errors. Design Effects. The impact of departures from simple random sampling on the precision of sample estimates is often measured by the design effect (designated as DEFF). For any statistical estimator such as a mean or a proportion, the design effect is the ratio of the estimate of the variance of a statistic derived from consideration of the sample design to that obtained from the formula for simple random samples. The square root of the design effect (also called the root design effect, and designated as DEFT) is also useful. The following formulas define the design effects and root design effect: where DESIGN-SE designates the standard error of an estimate calculated by taking into account the complex nature of the survey design, and SRS-SE designates the standard error of the same estimate calculated as if the survey design was a simple random sample."}, {"section_title": "Base Year Standard Errors and Design Effects", "text": "Selection of Base Year Items.

The remaining variables from the student questionnaire and from the parent and school questionnaires were selected randomly from each topical section of each questionnaire. Standard errors and design effects were calculated for each statistic both for the sample as a whole and for selected subgroups. For both the student and parent analyses, the subgroups were based on the student's sex, race and ethnicity, school type (public, Catholic, and other private), and socioeconomic status (lowest quartile, middle two quartiles, and highest quartile).

The same selection criteria were used for all components in selecting the items for standard error and design effect analysis. The first criterion was whether a question had been used in the NELS:88 base year analyses of standard errors and design effects. Because some items included in the base year standard error and design effect analysis were not repeated in the second follow-up, it was necessary to select new items for the analysis. Policy relevance was the criterion for selecting the remaining items. This criterion was applied in order to ensure that variables that are important to analysts, thus likely to have a higher frequency of use, were represented. These remaining items consisted primarily of critical items in the student questionnaire. For the contextual sample, standard errors and design effects were calculated using the contextual weight for the same 30 variables employed for the student component standard error and design effect analysis discussed in Chapter III of the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual. Results. Standard errors and design effects were calculated for each of the items for the sample as a whole and for selected subgroups. The subgroups were based on the respondent's sex, race/ethnicity, school type (public, Catholic, and other private), socioeconomic status (lowest quartile, middle two quartiles, and highest quartile), and urbanicity (urban, suburban, and rural. The standard errors and design effects were calculated using the second follow-up contextual weight, F2CXTWT. (A description of the contextual weight is presented in section 3.2.3.) Results for the student questionnaire items are shown in Table 3.3.3-1. For the same items, design effects for the contextual weight are higher than for those calculated using the questionnaire weight (see Table 3.3.1-9 in the NELS :88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual). This increase may reflect greater clustering introduced through the subsampling of schools for the school and teacher data collection. The greater clustering of cases results in larger intraclass correlations, and subsequently a larger design corrected standard error. The pattern of larger design effects compared to those calculated using the questionnaire weight holds for subgroups as well (see Table 3.3.3-2 compared with Table 3.3.1-12 in the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual) with the exception of groups defined by Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native ethnicity. In general, the average subgroup design effects are smaller than the overall average design effect, probably because of the dispersion of subgroup members across clusters defined by base year schools. Although standard errors and design effects may also be calculated for the school administrator questionnaire items using the contextual sample weight, F2CXTWT, researchers should be aware that school -level design effect calculations are quite large compared to those typically found for the NELS :88 data. School-level design effects are large for the following reasons: 1) since students who attend the same school receive the same response given by their school administrator for the school questionnaire items, there is a clustering effect on the school items that are coded at the student level. Because of this clustering effect, the design effect for school items is greater than that for student items; and 2) F2CXTWT may correlate with school response for items in the school questionnaire. Due to this possible correlation, the variances of the estimates for the school items are greater than that for the student items. The large design effects which a researcher would encounter with school data using F2CXTWT underscores the recommendation that school-level information be used as a context within which to understand student level characteristics. NELS:88 second follow-up school characteristics should be used as independent variables, and not as dependent variables in any analysis. The large design effects that a researcher would find associated with school-level information demonstrates that school data would be comparatively inefficient as dependent variables in analytic models.

Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population. Sampling error analyses for NELS:88 (documenting standard errors of measurement and design effects for key variables) were presented earlier in this chapter (see section 3.3). In this section, other sources of nonobservational error are discussed. Nonobservational error results from measurements not being taken from a portion of the population.12 Several factors comprise nonobservational error, including nonresponse biases caused by unit and item nonresponse and undercoverage. Nonresponse is readily quantified. While many data quality factors are difficult to measure in the non-experimental context of large-scale survey administration, NELS:S8 offers the possibility of comparing reports from multiple sources, thereby permitting some approximate but useful validity parameters. Following is a discussion of nonobservational error in the school component in terms of nonresponse. A detailed discussion of student undercoverage appears in the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual."}, {"section_title": "Second Follow-Up Unit and Item Nonresponse", "text": "Unit Nonresponse. Unit nonresponse occurs when an individual respondent (such as a teacher, student, or school administrator) declines to participate, or when the cooperation of a school cannot be secured. In the base year, an analysis of school-level nonresponse suggested that, to the extent that schools can be characterized by size, control, organizational structure, student composition, and so on, the impact of nonresponding schools on the quality of the student sample is small (for details, see the NELS:88 Base Year Sample Design Report, pp. 33-39). School nonresponse has not been assessed in the second follow-up for two reasons. First, there was very little school-level nonresponse--the school administrator questionnaire completion rate exceeded 98 percent. Second, the second follow-up sample was student-driven, unlike the base year sample. Hence, even if a school refused, the individual student was pursued outside of school. The effect of student-level nonresponse within the responding schools was not assessed in the base year, although males, blacks, and Hispanics tended to be nonparticipants more often than females, whites or Asians. The effects of individual nonparticipation in the base year, first and second follow-ups will be systematically examined, and reported in future NELS :88 documentation. Item Nonresponse. Analysis of survey error is important for understanding potential bias in making inferences from an obtained sample to a population. Sampling and nonsampling errors are the key constituents of total survey error. Sampling error is quantified through the standard errors and design effects for key variables. There are various sources and types of nonsampling measurement error, including estimate error or bias associated with unit (individual) nonresponse and item nonresponse. This section reports specifically on nonsampling error as a function of item nonresponse. In addition to its role as a potential source of bias, item nonresponse also has the effect of diminishing the number of observations that can be used in calculating statistics from affected data elements and thus increases sampling variances. Since item nonresponse is an important potential and uncorrected source of data bias, it is necessary to measure its impact so that analysts can properly take potential response biases into account. 12 Groves, R. M., Survey Errors and Survey Costs. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1989, page 11. 45 61 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent fails to complete certain items on the survey instrument. While bias associated with unit nonresponse has been controlled by making adjustments to case weights, item nonresponse has generally not been compensated for in the NELS:88 school administrator component data set. There is one exception to this generalization. The exception is machine editing, through which, occasionally, certain nonresponse problems are rectified by imposing inter-item consistency, particularly by forcing logical agreement between filter and dependent questions. Thus, for example, the missing response to a filter question can often be inferred if the dependent question has been answered. Because the edited files were used in the nonresponse analysis reported below, this adjustment to item nonresponse is reflected in the results of the analysis. A further point to note is that there may be some hidden nonresponse in the NELS:88 questionnaires that is impossible to quantify. This is the case because for a few questions, a \"mark all that apply\" format was used. While such a format results in slightly less burden to the respondent, it also makes it impossible to distinguish between a negative response and nonresponse. This conflation of negative response and nonresponse creates the potential for nonresponse biases that cannot be measured and thus cannot become the basis for precise warnings to users about the limitations of data. A final point to note is that, implicitly, unit nonresponse is a further source of missing item data-that is, nonparticipating schools or students complete no questionnaire items. Weights accommodate student level nonresponse by projecting questionnaire data to the full population, with appropriate adjustments for defined subgroups. However, they cannot compensate for the bias that arises if nonrespondents would have answered the questionnaire differently than respondents. For this reason, \"total response\" should be thought of as the survey (unit) response rate times the item response rate. For example, given a weighted 1992 student-level response rate of 98 percent, and an item response rate of 85 percent, total response would be 83 percent. Two main objectives inform this item nonresponse analysis. One objective is to quantify mean questionnaire nonresponse overall. A second objective is to describe nonresponse patterns in terms of questionnaire item characteristics. In order to realize the first objective, average nonresponse rates were calculated for each item. In order to fulfill the second objective, nonresponse was measured as a function of three item characteristics: 1) position in the questionnaire, 2) topic, and 3) whether the item was contingent on a filter.

Twenty-six percent of the item nonresponse occurs in three vocational education questions.\" These questions were added to the instrument after the completion of field testing. The vocational education questions would have benefitted from testing prior to administration. The second factor which contributed to item nonresponse was the administration of abbreviated school questionnaires. One hundred eight abbreviated school questionnaires were administered in the second follow-up, while 250 abbreviated instruments were administered in the first follow-up. The second follow-up abbreviated questionnaire consisted of 14 questions' selected from the original questionnaire's 63 questions. For the purposes of this analysis abbreviated questionnaires have been treated as if they were full instruments. Item Nonresponse by Position in the Questionnaire. One response pattern in self-administered questionnaires is for item nonresponse to increase as one progresses through the questionnaire. Initially, this pattern does not appear to apply to the school administrator questionnaire. However, when the vocational education questions discussed above are excluded from analysis, the familiar trend emerges. Excluding the vocational education questions, item nonresponse for the first third of the questionnaire decreases to 7.2 percent. In the second and last thirds of the instrument, item nonresponse rates increase to 15.4 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively. While length may have contributed to higher mean rates of item nonresponse in the second and last thirds of the school questionnaire, one should approach this conclusion with caution. The last third of the school questionnaire corresponds to section five, \"School Governance and Climate.\" Section five was completed only by the school principal, while sections one through four could have been completed by a designate of the school principal. When one views the second follow-up school administrator questionnaire as two instruments with--in many cases--two respondents, the assertion that length accounts for a large portion of the mean item nonresponse rate becomes tenuous. Item Nonresponse by Topic. Three school administrator questionnaire topics exhibit unexpectedly high item nonresponse rates. The first topic, found in the instrument's \"School Characteristics\" section, is vocational. education. Item nonresponse for these untested items ranges from 16.7 percent to 89.2 percent. During telephone administration of the school questionnaire many respondents complained that they should not be made to answer question 8B if they answered \"00\" or \"01\" for question 8A. Project staff decided, based on the large volume of respondent feedback, to implement this skip (if 8A = \"00\"  or \"01\" skip 8B). Unfortunately item nonresponse for question 8B remains prodigious even after implementation of this skip. It can be suggested that the use of vague and unfamiliar terms reduced response rates for the vocational education questions. In addition, the complex matrix structure of question 8B may have placed excessive burden on respondents. The vocational education items may have benefitted from a preceding filter question which allowed respondents, if their school did not have a vocational education program, to skip the topic area. Whatever the flaws in these questions may be, the data collected by these questions are of dubious quality. Due to potential nonresponse bias data users should use caution when selecting the vocational education items for analysis. A second problematic topic is the number of part-time teachers. Found in the \"Teaching Staff Characteristics\" section of the school instrument, questions 36A2-L2 exhibit nonresponse rates which range from 22.7 percent to 45.7 percent. Like the vocational education items, these items were not field tested. The formidable structure which contained these items may have imposed excessive burden on school administrators. When considering the part-time teacher items for analysis, users should exercise caution due to potential nonresponse bias."}, {"section_title": "EJ", "text": "Minimum competency testing is another topic in the school questionnaire subject to high item nonresponse. Unlike the vocational education and part-time teacher items, questions 43 through 47 were field tested. Found in the \"School Policies and Programs\" section, the most problematic of these items (questions 43C-F) have nonresponse rates between 28.2 and 37.7 percent. By changing question 43 after the field test from a \"Circle All That Apply\" format to a \"Yes No\" format, item nonresponse rates (52 percent to 78 percent in the field test) were lowered considerably. Questionnaire position, near the end of the portion of the instrument eligible for completion by school personnel other than the school administrator, may account for a portion of the nonresponse to the minimum competency items. A lack of respondent knowledge about minimum competency testing, and minimum competency testing's sensitivity may have also contributed to item nonresponse. Due to potential nonresponse bias data users should exercise caution when choosing questions 43C-F for analysis. Item Nonresponse by Dependence on a Filter Question. Second follow-up school questionnaire nonresponse is three times higher in items dependent on a filter question (see table 3.4.1-1). Even when the vocational education questions discussed above are excluded, nonresponse rates are nearly twice as great in dependent items (19.2 percent) when compared with filter items (10.3 percent). The minimum competency testing questions of section four are dependent on a preceding filter question, as is still another vocational education item, question 17. Dependent items carry with them missing data from the corresponding filter item. School questionnaire filter items would probably have benefitted from the High School & Beyond practice of making nearly all filter items critical and thus subject to retrieval. The nonresponse rates reported here for items dependent on a filter question are inflated to the extent that the rates contain \"hidden skips.\" Hidden skips are those missing responses that would have been skips had the respondent answered the appropriate filter item. Unfortunately it is not possible to quantify hidden skips. Item-Level Nonresponse by Critical Items. The nonresponse rate for school survey critical items is 6.7 percent, well above the rate found in the second follow-up student questionnaire (3.3 percent) or the second follow-up dropout questionnaire (4.2 percent). Of the school instrument's 125 critical items, 64 are located in last section, \"School Governance and Climate.\" Nonresponse rates for the primary critical items in section five (questions 52 and 56) range from 9.7 percent to 13.5 percent. Questions 52 and 56 are thought-provoking, full-page matrix structure questions. These question formats may have placed too much burden on school principals. In addition, the high critical item nonresponse rates found in section five may reflect the difficulty of retrieving data from the school principal, as opposed to other school personnel. Finally, placing over half of the school questionnaire's critical items in the last section may have left those 64 items vulnerable to respondent fatigue. Table  3.4.1-2 lists the nonresponse for critical items in the school administrator questionnaire."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions.", "text": "Second follow-up school administrator questionnaire item nonresponse rates suffered from the inclusion of untested questions. The administration of 124 abbreviated instruments also increased school questionnaire item nonresponse rates. In spite of these and other difficulties mean weighted school questionnaire total response, 83.1 percent, is well within the NCES standard. NCES's standard asserts that total weighted response (unit nonresponse multiplied by item nonresponse) should be at least 70 percent. When the untested vocational education questions are excluded, school questionnaire total response is 87.1 percent. Individual items which exceed the NCES standard are annotated as such in the codebook.    "}, {"section_title": "IV. Data Collection", "text": "This chapter describes the data collection procedures for all components of the NELS:88 second follow-up: school administrator, student and dropout, parent, teacher, and academic transcript and course offerings. The design of the second follow-up closely resembled that of the first follow-up and was executed in three phases which spanned two years. Self-administration and telephone administration were the primary modes of data collection for the components of the second follow-up. Although data collectioh did not occur for the school administrator component until the third phase of the study in 1992, pre-data collection activities related to the school component were conducted in the first and second phases of the study in 1991. Phase three was conducted in 1992 and constituted the data collection effort. Figure 4-1 summarizes the activities conducted during the three phases of the second follow-up."}, {"section_title": "4.1", "text": "Second Follow-Up Pre-Data Collection Activities Phase 1. Conducted from January through June 1991, phase 1 involved securing state, district, and school-level cooperation for the study as well as tracing sample members. State cooperation with NELS:88 was secured for all fifty states and the District of Columbia. District and school-level cooperation were secured for first follow-up schools with four or more sample members still in attendance in the spring of 1991. Tracing sample members served two purposes: defining the schools to be included in the second follow-up sampling process and locating sample members for data collection. As in the first follow-up, the second follow-up study was designed such that only students attending a school included in the second follow-up school sample would receive the full complement of contextual data including school administrator and teacher reports. To maximize the number of students to receive the full complement of contextual data, interviewers attempted to trace all sample members to either their first follow-up school of attendance or to a new school. Once students were traced to a school, the second follow-up school sample was drawn such that the greatest number of students would be included in the school sample and receive the full complement of contextual data. The second purpose of tracing related to data collection. Interviewers attempted to trace students to their first follow-up or new school of attendance, and prior to the beginning of phase 2 the sample of second follow-up schools was finalized. If an interviewer was unable to confirm school enrollment for a cohort member through the first follow-up school or a new school, the interviewer traced the sample member to a home address to confirm that the student was enrolled in a school or that the student had left school. Through tracing students to a first follow-up school, a new school, or a home address, and through the selection of the schools to be included in the second follow-up school sample, interviewers were able to forecast whether a student's data would be collected through a second follow-up school or if a sample member would need to be contacted separately during data collection. Confirmation of a sample member's enrollment status determined which type of questionnaire--student or dropout--the sample member would be administered during the data collection period. Phase 2. From September to December 1991, phase 2 pre-data collection activities occurred for all components of the study, and some phase 1 activities continued. District and school-level cooperation was gained for any schools selected for the second follow-up sample for which cooperation was not gained in phase 1. Tracing continued for sample members who were not located during phase 1, and enrollment was verified again for students who were traced to a school which was selected for the second follow-up school sample. Students attending a school not included in the second follow-up school sample and sample members who had left school were also traced again to their school of attendance or to a 54  Table 4.1-1 summarizes the results of district and school contacting and student tracing in phases 1 and 2. Interviewers visited each of the second follow-up schools to conduct activities in preparation for data collection for all components of the study. For student data collection, they scheduled in-school data collection sessions and worked with school personnel to identify how parental permission for surveying students would be gained for an individual school. Using school rosters, interviewers freshened the student sample to allow a random sample of twelfth graders who were previously excluded from the study because, for example, they were not in the U.S. or in the eighth grade in 1988, and did not have a chance to be selected for the base year.

Data collection for the second follow-up was conducted from January through December 1992.

Figure 4-3 shows the field periods of each component of the study. Most of the components of the survey utilized more than one mode of data collection, usually self-administration and telephone administration of the survey instruments. In some cases abbreviated versions of the instruments were implemented as discussed in Chapter II of this manual."}, {"section_title": "School Administrator Survey", "text": "In February 1992, school administrator questionnaires were mailed to the principal or headmaster of selected NELS:88 schools with second follow-up sample members still in attendance. Completed selfadministered questionnaires and telephone interviews were collected from February through June 1992. For any interviews conducted after the end of the 1991-1992 academic year, school principals were asked to refer to the previous academic year. As in the first follow-up the school principal or headmaster could delegate all but one of the sections to another knowledgeable school official. The school principal was specifically required to complete the fifth section of the questionnaire on school governance and school climate. Two weeks after the school administrator questionnaire was mailed to principals and headmasters, a postcard was mailed to all principals asking them to return the questionnaire if they had not already completed and returned it. Two weeks after the postcard reminder was mailed, interviewers began prompting nonresponding principals over the telephone for the return of the questionnaire. About three weeks after each principal was prompted for the return of the questionnaire over the telephone, interviewers began calling nonresponding school administrators to attempt to collect the questionnaire over the telephone. As discussed in Chapter II an abbreviated version of the school administrator questionnaire was administered to nonresponding principals near the end of the data collection period. Figure 4-4 shows the number and percentage of the 1,366 school principals who completed a selfadministered questionnaire, a telephone-administered questionnaire, and a telephone-administered abbreviated questionnaire for the 15,695 student contextual sample members for whom student data are also available. Figure 4-5 illustrates the mode of completion of the school administrator instrument for the 15,695 students on the school component public use file for whom student data are also available. While use of an abbreviated questionnaire minimized overall unit nonresponse, the fewer number of questions in this instrument resulted in higher item nonresponse for the school administrators who Because questionnaires from school principals were completed in two different modes of data collection, by self-administration and telephone administration, a number of steps were taken to minimize any mode effects. Telephone interviewers were trained to adapt the questions in a way which made sense when asked over the telephone. If a school administrator had a copy of the questionnaire, he or she was encouraged to read along in the questionnaire as the interviewer asked the questions over the telephone."}, {"section_title": "Second Follow-Up Student Survey and Cognitive Tests", "text": "In-school Survey Sessions. From January to June 1992, in-school survey sessions were held in all cooperating NELS:88 schools still enrolling second follow-up sample members. Second follow-up data collection procedures were very similar to those used in the first follow-up. Student questionnaires and cognitive tests in math, science, reading, and social studies were administered at in-school,, group data collection sessions of approximately nine students. Survey administration was usually conducted in a school classroom or library and consisted of several steps. Students first completed the student questionnaire, and, if applicable, the new student supplement or the early graduate supplement. Students who had transferred into or out of a school within the two weeks prior to the survey session were asked to report on their previous school of attendance. Transfer students who had been at the surveyed school for two weeks or longer were asked to report on their current school. After the students completed the student questionnaires, an 85 minute battery of cognitive tests was administered. The tests consisted of four timed sections devoted to mathematics, reading, science, and social studies (history/citizenship/geography). Once the test battery was completed, an attempt was made to retrieve missing (or inappropriately marked) questionnaire items before the student left the classroom. Interviewers reviewed the questionnaires to ensure that all critical items were completed. An oval indicating \"no retrieval\" was marked whenever the missing data could not be retrieved due to respondent refusal or inability to clarify a vague response. At the end of the survey session, arrangements were made to conduct make-up sessions for students who were scheduled but unable to attend the initial survey session or whose schedules required that they leave before completing both instruments. If fewer than five students were scheduled for a make-up session, school staff were asked to handle the arrangements and oversee its administration; however, to ensure respondent confidentiality, school staff were prohibited from reviewing the student questionnaire for completeness. When five or more students were scheduled for a make-up session or when school staff were unavailable to conduct a make-up session, interviewers arranged a return visit to the school. The second follow-up study attempted to collect a complete questionnaire and cognitive test from students and dropouts; however, for some student sample members only an abbreviated version of the student or dropout questionnaire was collected, or the cognitive test was not collected at all. Off -campus Survey Sessions. Off -campus survey sessions, typically attended by one to three students, were conducted primarily from March to July 1992. Students who were not enrolled in sampled schools, who had missed in-school data collection sessions, or who were enrolled in schools that had refused to participate in the study were invited to off -campus sessions and administered the student questionnaire and cognitive tests. Dropouts were also asked to attend these sessions and were surveyed alongside sample members who were currently enrolled in school. As with in-school survey sessions, 83 63 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual off -campus survey sessions in the second follow-up were nearly identical to those in the first follow-up. If a sample member was unable to attend an off -campus group survey session, he or she was surveyed either over the telephone or in-person. When the student questionnaire was administered over the telephone, cognitive test data were not collected."}, {"section_title": "Dropout Survey", "text": "The NELS:88 second follow-up dropout survey sought to interview all sample members who had left school prior to graduation, including both first follow-up dropouts who had not returned to school and sample members who dropped out after the first follow-up. All sample members appear on the student data file regardless of their spring 1992 enrollment status. Basic classification variables and test data appear for both students and dropouts, though dropout questionnaire data appear separately on the dropout component data file. School Enrollment Classification and Data Collection. In order to determine which sample members should complete a dropout questionnaire, school enrollment status was classified for all sample members during the spring of 1992. Four types of enrollment classifications were identified as illustrated by Figure 4-6. The first were high school students who were enrolled in a school which offered programs ending in the granting of a diploma. These students were administered the student questionnaire and the cognitive test battery. Early graduates were included in this classification, and were asked to report retrospectively on the school from which they graduated and to complete supplemental questions about their reasons for graduating early. The second type were sample members who dropped out of high school but later returned to a high school program to obtain a high school diploma. These sample members were administered the student questionnaire and, when possible, the cognitive test battery. The third type were sample members who dropped out of high school but went on to seek an equivalent to a high school diploma such as the General Educational Development test (GED). If an alternative completer had finished the requirements of his or her alternative program, a student questionnaire was collected from the student. if the alternative completer had not yet fulfilled the requirements for certification, the sample member was administered a dropout questionnaire. In both cases, the cognitive test battery was also administered when possible. The fourth type were dropouts. These sample members had left their high school by the spring of 1992 and were not working toward an alternative certification. Dropouts were administered a dropout questionnaire and, when possible, the cognitive test battery. Regardless of whether a dropout completed a student or dropout questionnaire, data collection efforts for the dropout component of the second follow-up were similar to those in the first follow-up survey. Interviewers attempted to survey most dropouts in off -campus survey sessions with testing conditions similar to in-school sessions. For analytical purposes, sample members classified as alternative completers can be included or compared with either high school completers or dropouts. Additionally, alternative completers can be examined separately, depending on the needs of the analyst. For a complete description of the dropout component, see the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Dropout Component Data File User's Manual. Note: A within-round dropout-returnee is, in NELS:88 parlance, a \"stopout.\" During the second followup, a stopout was defined as a sample member who had dropped out of school at some point in the 1990-1991 or 1991-1992 school years, but had returned to school by the spring of 1992. A similar definition was employed in the NELS:88 first follow-up. In the above diagram the term \"dropin\" refers to a sample member who dropped out of high school, then returned to high school (making the sample member a stopout as described above), and then dropped out of high school again for a final time.

Unlike student cohort sample members, most SES students received an additional forty minute free-response cognitive test after they completed the eighty-five minute test battery. The subject area of the free-response test was randomly selected for each school in either mathematics or science. In the 247 participating SES schools, SES sample members were administered the student questionnaire and cognitive tests.

Of the 618 base year ineligible sample members (BYIs), 580 were located and 312 were reclassified as eligible during the first follow-up. (Table 4.2.4-1 in the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up Student Component Data File User's Manual contains additional completion rate data for the BYI study.) In the second follow-up, the remaining ineligible students--BYIs who were ineligible in the first follow-up or more rarely, students who were eligible in the base year but who became ineligible in the first follow-up through the occurrence of some sort of incapacitation--were pursued as a part of the Followback Study of Excluded Students. The Followback Study of Excluded Students (FSES) of the NELS:88 second follow-up attempted to reassess the eligibility status and ascertain the enrollment Status of students who: 1) had been excluded because of linguistic, mental, or physical obstacles to participation when the baseline sample of eighth graders was drawn in the 1987-88 school year, and were subsampled into the Base Year In^ligible Study in the first follow-up; 2) were eligible in the base year but became ineligible in the first follow-up; or, 3) were identified as ineligible when selected through the freshening process in the first follow-up. If the students had since become eligible for NELS:88, the followback study attempted to survey them. The followback study continued the first follow-up base year ineligible study for several purposes. First, if the 5.3 percent of the potential base year sample declared ineligible differed in key characteristics or outcomes from the sample of students included in NELS:88, this difference could bias baseline results and subsequent longitudinal measurements. By learning more about these excluded students and their current school enrollment status, one might correct for potential uLidercoverage bias that could affect key national estimates, such as dropping out between eighth and twelfth grade. Second, an individual's eligibility status could potentially change. A student excluded on language grout: s in 1988 or 1990 could have gained sufficient proficiency in English by 1992 to 66 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual complete the student questionnaire. Like the complementary activity of sample freshening, the followback study of excluded students helped to generate a nationally representative sample of twelfth-grade students. Third, eligibility rules were modified in the first follow-up and retained in the second follow-up to allow for completion of the student questionnaire in Spanish in addition to English. By giving 1988 and/or 1990 excluded students who could complete a questionnaire only in Spanish the opportunity to do so in 1992, the revised eligibility rules of the first follow-up were successfully carried back to the base year cohort. Data Collection Procedures. Data collection for the followback study of base year excluded students took place during the main study data collection effort between April and October 1992. Interviewers attempted to identify excluded students who were eligible to be added to the longitudinal sample in the second follow-up. They obtained the following information about the excluded student from the student's current school, school last attended, or the student's home: Sex (if unknown): male or female; Rzce/ethn:city (if unknown): white, black, Hispanic, Asian/PI, American Indian, other; School enrollment status: student, dropout, or dropout in alternative program; and, Eligibility: English/Spanish language proficiency, lack of mental or physical disability (i.e., ability to complete a questionnaire), reading ability level of at least eighth grade. After collecting the -above information about the students, interviewers attempted to identify whether or not the student was capable of meaningful participation in the survey under normal conditions. To make this assessment, interviewers were instructed to obtain reports from persons with first-hand knowledge of the students, such as a special education teacher, a bilingual teacher, a language arts teacher. or a guidance counselor. Interviewers often spoke with several staff members to identify the staff member who was most qualified to assess whether or not the student could participate. Unless there were severe mental or physical disabilities or lack of facility with written English or Spanish and the member was unable to complete the survey instruments under normal circumstances, the student was considered eligible to participate in the study. Eligibility information was gathered for 94.7 percent of th,) excluded sample members. For excluded students who were identified as eligible, student or dropout questionnaires were administered either in-person or over the telephone. Cognitive tests were administered to a small percentage of these students. For students who remained ineligible, schoc. enrollment status and other key characteristics were obtained."}, {"section_title": "4.8", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Parent Survey", "text": "In May 1992, parent questionnaires were mailed to all parents and guardians of students and dropouts who had completed a student or drop-ut questionnaire.

Accordingly, the parent sample was selfselected."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Survey", "text": "In the second follow-up teacher survey, one teacher report was collected for each student attending a NELS:88 school if the student was enrolled in a mathematics or science class. For students enrolled in both a mathematics and a science class, only one teacher report was collected. The subject area of the teacher report collected for students enrolled in both a mathematics and science class was the same subject area of the teacher surveyed for the student in the base year teacher survey. Some students who were enrolled in both a mathematics and a science class were added to the first follow-up or second follow-up through freshening. For these freshened students, the subject area of the teacher surveyed was the base year selected subject of the student's linked partner in the freshening procedure. 68 88 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual The teacher survey was designed to articulate with the student cognitive tests and to minimize the amount of time between the collection of the student and teacher reports. Because students were surveyed at NELS:88 schools from January' 1992, through the end of the 1991-1992 academic year, selfadministered questionnaires were mailed to teachers in two mailings depending on when the students at the school were surveyed. Teachers at schools at which the students were surveyed before April 1, 1992, were mailed a questionnaire in early February 1997 Teachers at schools at which the students were surveyed on or after April 1, 1992, were mailed a questionnaire in early March 1992. For most students a teacher report was collected fron, the fall term teacher in the selected subject. However, if the students at a school were surveyed on or after April 1, 1992, then the teacher questionnaire was mailed to the spring term teacher of the selected subject for the student. This design was based on the assumption that early in the spring term, the fall term teacher was the most familiar and could most fully assess the student. After April 1, a teacher report was collected from the spring term teacher because at that time the spring term teacher w,..s more likely to have had sufficient interaction with the student to make a complete assessment of the student in the teacher questionnaire, and the fall term teacher might have difficulty recalling a student he or she had not instructed in several months. Interviewing the spring term teacher for students who attended schools with in-school data collection sessions after April 1 also provided better articulation with the student cognitive tests than interviewing the fall term teacher in late spring. Two weeks after the teacher questionnaires were mailed, nonresponding teachers were prompted for the return of the questionnaire with a postcard reminder. Two weeks after the postcard reminder was mailed to teachers, nonresponding teachers were prompted for the return ot ale questionnaire over the telephone. Interviewers attempted to interview over the telephone any teachers who did not respond within two weeks after the postcard and telephone prompts.

A computer-assisted data entry (CADE) system was used for data capture in the school administrator, dropout, and transcript components of the second follow-up survey. The CADE system performed complete checking of all entries so that each conformed to valid ranges or codes defined for the particular data item, including legitimate missing codes. Only those items in which open-ended responses were collected were not subjected to these constraints. Additionally, CADE was programmed to provide automatic paths through the survey instrument to enforce skip patterns and impose those interitem consistency checks that were appropriate for the data conversion phase of the study. CADE was also linked to a keystroke verification program that provided statistical quality control. The CADE system, once specified for the school administrator questionnaire, stored all information about the questionnaire in a database that was used to generate control statements for both SAS and SFS& This same information, when combined with the actual response data collected during data capture, was used to produce documentation for the final data files described in detail in Chapter VII. After the school data were converted to machine-readable form, sequences of logical machine edits and visual inspection of the output began. The tasks performed included: resolving any inconsistencies between filter and dependent questions, supplying the appropriate missing data codes for questions left blank, detecting illegal codes and converting them to missing data codes and investigating inconsistencies or contradictions in the data. Variable frequencies and crosstabulations were inspected before and after these steps to verify the correctness and appropriateness of the automated machine editing processes. Inconsistencies between filter and dependent questions were resolved in the machine editing process. In most instances, dependent questions that conflicted with the skip instructions of a filter question contained data that, although possibly valid, were superfluous. For instance, respondents sometimes indicated \"no\" to a filter question and then continued to answer \"no\" to subsequent dependent items. When a filter question indicated that subsequent questions(s) should have been skipped, the subsequent dependent questions were set to a value of legitimate skip, except for one situation. In the exception, if the dependent questions were answered in a manner that was inconsistent with the filter but consistent within the dependent items, the filter was back edited (changed) and made consistent with the dependent responses. If a multiple response, or if no answer was given to a filter question, the question was assigned the appropriate reserved code (\"6\" or \"8\" see below) and all subsequent questions that might have been skipped were processed as if the respondent should have answered them. The frequency with which responses were recoded to a legitimate skip for each skip pattern was closely monitored. Frequency distributions of responses before and after editing were inspected. All filter questions and their respective dependent items were displayed in crosstabulations for verification of the accuracy of the recoding. After improperly answered questions were converted to blanks, the school data were passed through a second step in the editing program that supplied the appropriate reserved codes to fill blank fields. The reserved codes and their meanings are: If the field is longer than one column, the right-hand column contains one of the above codes and the rest of the columns are filled with \"9\"s. Detection of out-of-range codes was completed during scanning or data entry for all questions except those permitting an open-ended response.

In those two surveys, variable names were assigned according to the survey wave and the question number. A similar system was developed for NELS:88. For example, F2C30A is from the second follow-up school survey, question 30, part A. A number of composites, specially constructed variables, are added to the files in order to promote high caliber analyses of the NELS:88 data. Some items add information from study sources that would otherwise be unavailable to users, some reference respondent properties to external standards that would be expensive for individual analysts to create, while still others are recodes or combinations of internal questionnaire sources. Some will be used by all, or nearly all, analysts while others will be appropriate to those seeking insights into distinctive populations, relationships or events. Moreover, some items will appear only on restricted use files rather than on the public use files in order to cloak the identity of our respondents and some will have appeared in earlier rounds and represent a convenient way to organize, rather than wholly new, information. The nomenclature of composite variables on the school files distinguishes between grade-specific and school-level characteristics. For example, G12ENRL supplies student enrollment in the twelfth grade of a second follow-up school, while F2SCENRL contains the student count for the entire school during the second follow-up wave of NELS:88.

Magnetic tape and CD-ROM releases of the NELS:88 data contain files that are specific to one survey wave and one component, such as the second follow-up student component data. Table 7-1 displays these NELS:88 products, by study component and by survey year. The student and dropout data sets are the central units of analysis in NELS:88. Each of the student data files may be examined as an independent entity or may be combined for obse-vation of the maturation of the original student cohort over time. The student and dropout data files ,...leased in the second follow-up of NELS:88 may be combined with data from second follow-up surveys of school administrators, teachers, and parents. The most powerful analyses are possible when students are viewed in the context of these fundamental influences across the four-year time frame that is now available. The NELS:88 files are designed to be merged and used to exami.._ how different student and dropout outcomes relate to various structural patterns, as measured by school, parent, teacher influences, and/or the ways in which these change over time. The contextual data files are dependent upon and subsidiary to the student and dropout files in NELS:88. The contextual data files cannot stand alone.' The only exception is the base year school file, which is representative of eighth-grade American schools and their principals in 1988. The first and second follow-up school components reflect characteristics of the secondary schools to which students in the contextual sample migrated after eighth grade. Since these secondary schools were not selected as a representative sample, but on the contrary appear instead as the product of student options and high school plans, the first and second follow-up school data must be used only in conjunction with student data. Inferences from the first follow-up and second follow-up school data files cannot be legitimately made if these data are viewed in isolation from the student files. In the second follow-up school component data file, the school administrator questionnaire items and a number of additional pertinent constructs have been copied to the records of all students who are members of the contextual sample, i.e., the group of students eligible for collection of the school and teacher questionnaires. Note that these student records appear on the school file even if the school did not return an adrr'nistrator questionnaire and/or if the contextual sample member did not complete a student questionnaire. Several types of student sample members are included in the files; therefore, the user must take care to select the correct set. Among the types of sample members in the student data set are: 1) students who were added in the first or second follow-ups to freshen the sample; 2) sample members who have participated in one, two or all three waves of the survey; and 3) Base Year Ineligible sample members who were found to be eligible and subsequently included in the first and second follow-Even for thR base year and second follow-up parent surveys--which closely resemble probability samples of parents of the relevant student and dropout populations--there are some departures from the requirements of a stand-alone probability sample. In particular, some unknown number of base year and second follow-up parents had more than one sampled eighth grader, hence more than one chance of selection into the sample. In addition, in both the base year and second follow-up, only one parent was surveyed, and that parent was self-selected. F2: School Component Data File User's Manual up surveys of NELS:88.2 Eight analytic populations, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, are now represented in the NELS:88 student sample. Different research questions apply to different student populations. In order to choose the correct NELS:88 student sample and produce accurate results, analysts must use the proper sample identification and questionnaire availability indicators as well as the correct statistical weight. Section 7.1 provides an overview of the sample indicators and weights necessary for using the school data. Section 7.2 includes a complete description of the content and organization of the second follow-up school data files. Finally, section 7.3 offers an explanation of the hardcopy codebook and an introduction to the electronic codebooks."}, {"section_title": "7.1", "text": "Basics for Analyses: Second Follow-Up Questionnaire and Sample Indicators, and"}, {"section_title": "Contextual Sample Statistical Weight", "text": "The method for naming variables follows a simple pattern. \"F2\" refers to the second follow-up, \"Fl\" refers to the first follow-up, and \"BY\" refers to the base year. An \"F2\" in the prefix means that the variable has been created in the second follow-up for second follow-up sample members. This is an important distinction since some variables that measure the same concept have been created for data sets in more than one round of the survey. In addition, if new information becomes available--for example for students who have not heretofore participated in NELS:88--certain classification variables are revised to reflect this new information. The more recent the creation of a composite, the more likely that it contains the most accurate values. Questionnaire Indicators and Statistical Weights. One of the first steps to take in carrying out a plan for research involves selection of the proper questionnaire availability indicators. Even tentative investigations that are not statistically weighted must utilize the appropriate indicators for cases with the specified items on the data file. F2ADMFLG Indicates whether or not a school administrator questionnaire is available for all sample members on the school file. 0 = The sample member is a member of the contextual components sample and the school administrator did not complete a second follow-up school questionnaire."}, {"section_title": "=", "text": "The sample member is a member of the contextual components sample and the school administrator completed a second follow-up school questionnaire. 2 = Not applicable--the sample member is not a member of the contextual components sample. In order to accommodate contextual analyses, a flag F2CXTFLG has been constructed and added to the records on the second follow-up school component magnetic tape and final CD-ROM releases. F2CXTFLG is to be used to select cases in the NELS:88 contextual sample. It is the partner to the statistical weight to be used in contextual analyses, F2CXTWT, and the two variables should be used together. F2: School Component Data File User's Manual F2CXTFLG Identifies sample members enrolled in an eligible contextual school (eligible for collection of school administrator data and completed a second follow-up student questionnaire). 0 = Sample member is not a member of the contextual sample. 1 = Sample member is a member of the contextual sample and completed a second follow-up student questionnaire. 2 = Sample member is a member of the contextual sample but did not complete a second follow-up student questionnaire. Note that the school component data files only contain contextual sample members. Values 1 and 2 distinguish between the contextual sample members who completed a second follow-up student questionnaire and those who did not. This indicator is analogous to F2QFLG on the student files, but for the contextual sample. Like F2QFLG, if users are interested in conducting twelfth-grade crosssectional analyses of students with contextual data, users will need to invoke this flag F2CXTFLG> 0in conjunction with either the grade sequence flag, F2SEQFLG, or the twelfth-grade cohort flag, G12COHRT. The NELS:88 data files are designed to be used as weighted data sets in all analyses. Due to the complexity of the NELS:88 sample design, estimation and inference will most likely be inaccurate if the data are analyzed on an unweighted basis. Clustering, multistage selection, and disproportionate sampling all contribute potential bias and ,various degrees of unreliability, which can only be avoided by using the weights provided to analyze specific subsets of the sample. In the variable name for statistical weights, the suffix \"WT\" is used to distinguish these from the special sample indicators that accompany each weight. Thus, the common stem \"F2CXT\" signals that F2CXTFLG is the accomplice of F2CXTWT. When the user combines a sample indicator with the appropriate weight, population estimates are produced."}, {"section_title": "F2CXTWT", "text": "use for producing weighted student contextual component statistics, in conjunction with either cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses that also involve school administrator and/or teacher data. No contextual panel weight has been calculated for analyses that use school administrator and/or teacher data from the NELS:88 base year or first follow-up in conjunction with second follow-up data. Because of factors such as nonresponse in the base year and first follow-up, using other weights for panel analyses is not as precise as using a contextual panel weight would be, but can provide serviceable, close Three other student-level weights have been constructed for the second follow-up and are available on the student files.: F2QWT is used for producing weighted twelfth-grade student statistics in cross-sectional analyses. F2F1 PNWT is used for producing weighted student panel statistics when both the first follow-up and second follow-up data are employed in analyses. F2PNLWT is used for producing weighted student panel statistics when all three rounds, the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up, are included in the analyses. A companion variable has been constructed for each of these statistical weights in order to select the appropriated cases, as is explained Refer to Chapter III for a complete discussion of F2CXTWT and the other NELS:88 second follow-up weights.

Table 7.1-2 summarizes the weights, sample numbers, and sample indicators necessary for student-level analyses performed in conjunction with base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up school administrator data. Universe Variables. As in every longitudinal survey, the complexity of NELS:88 has increased with each successive survey wave. The changing numbers of cases delivered in each round may be one of several perplexing anomalies to users. The \"universe variables\" are designed to explain how the status of sample members has changed from one round to another. The first of these, F2UNIV1, is a set of over one hundred mutually-exclusive categories that was designed to encompass each and every sample member ever in the study. It describes how and when the sample member entered NELS:88 and the situation of the sample member in the base year, the first follow-up, and in the second follow-up. Abbreviations for the SAS and SPSS-X value label cards provide this information in the character lengths allowed by those programs. These abbreviations are: For each valid category of this variable, the status of the sample member is indicated for the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up. Examination of the categories of this variable in Appendix L reveals that the status of sample members did change over time. For example, students ineligible for the base year were subsequently re-surveyed and some were discovered to be capable of completing the survey in the first and/or second follow-ups. Other sample members moved out of the country in a later round and were defined as out-of-scope for that round. Some of these sample members had returned to the U.S.A. by the second follow-up and were once again in-scope for data collection. Similarly, students who were freshened in the first or second follow-up did not participate in the base year survey.\nuse for producing weighted student contextual component statistics, in conjunction with either cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses that also involve school administrator and/or teacher data.' Chapter III of this manual contains a comprehensive description of this statistical weight. The following indicator, F2CXTFLG, is intended for use with F2CXTWT (note that the stem of the variable names for each is the same). F2CXTFLG Indicates that a sample member belongs to the contextual components sample. (The school component data files only contain such sample members--codes 1 and 2 distinguish between those who completed a second follow-up student questionnaire and those who did not). Use this variable for identifying sample members enrolled in an eligible contextual school (eligible for collection of school administrator and teacher data) and who completed a second follow-up student questionnaire. This indicator is analogous to F2QFLG but for the contextual sample. And, as with the F2QFLG, if users are interested in conducting twelfth-grade cross-sectional analyses of students with contextual data, users will need to invoke this flag (F2CXTFLG> 0) in conjunction with either the grade sequence flag, F2SEQFLG, or the twelfth-grade cohort flag, G12COHRT). 0 = Sample member is not a member of the contextual components sample. 1 = Sample member is a member of the contextual components sample and completed a second follow-up student questionnaire 2 = Sample member is a member of the contextual components sample but did not complete a second follow-up student questionnaire Three other second follow-up statistical weights are on the student data sets: F2QWT (for student crosssectional analyses), F2PNLWT (for panel analyses across all three waves of NELS:88), F2F1PNWT (for panel analyses of first follow-up and second follow-up student data), F2TRSCWT (for cross-sectional analyses using transcript data), and F2TRP1WT and F2TRP2WT (for panel analyses with transcript data).

This section introduces the composites that have been constructed for the school component file of the second follow-up of NELS:88. Most composite variables are constructed from two or more sources. These may be combinations of questionnaire items from the same or different NELS:88 data files, in the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up.

Some values should change over time; for example, if a student transfers from one school to another, then school control type, urbanicity, region and so on may change as well. Some variables, such as school enrollment or grade span, are quite stable over time for an individual school yet the values reported in the NELS:88 files may change if new information improves upon the old. For example, the second follow-up report on school characteristics is enhanced when an eligible institution that did not return a first follow-up school administrator questionnaire does complete a second follow-up instrument. Because sources for composite construction and quality control checking tend to multiply as additional rounds of data are collected, the validity of certain classification variables is strengthened over time. The most recent round in which such a variable appears contains the best classification information for sample members. Composites of School-level Characteristics. The composites of school-level characteristics provide information on key characteristics of students' second follow-up school. \"G12\" in the prefix of the variable name indicates a characteristic of the twelfth-grade school the student attended, even if a particular student was actually attending a different grade in the school during the 1992 data collection. School-level composites are also included on the student component data file for dropouts, and the identification number of the last school attended by the dropout is included on the restricted use dropout component data file. G12CTRL1 classifies the student's second follow-up school by type of control: public, Catholic or other private, with private schools divided into other religious, no religious affiliation, or affiliation unknown. G12CTRL1 is primarily reported from the school administrator questionnaire and is checked against the QED sampling file for consistency. G12CTRL2 classifies the student's second follow-up school type into public, Catholic, private NAIS, and other private--not NAIS. The values for this variable were compiled from both QED and NAIS membership lists. This variable appears only on the restricted use version of the NELS:88 data files. G12URBN3 is a three-category composite that reflects the type of place in which the student's public school district, Catholic diocese; or, for other private schools, county is located. The categories are urban, suburban and rural.

The codebooks summarize all key information for each data element, including: the variable name, question number and content; the tape position and format on the file for each variable; valid and/or missing responses to each item; and, for each response category, the unweighted frequency counts, percents, and weighted percents are displayed. Two related types of codebooks are provided for NELS:88--a hardcopy and an electronic codebook (ECB). Both forms of the codebook chronicle the details analysts need to interpret properly the results of each item: the exact wording of the question that was presented to the respondent, the distribution of all legitimate answers among survey participants, the location and type of data element for each variable on the file, as well as names and labels provided for use with statistical software. For some items this basic presentation is supplemented with additional notes about using the data. The first type of codebook is the hardcopy codebook included in the NELS:88 second follow-up data file user manuals. Hardcopy codebook displays are described and illustrated in section 7.3.1 below. The second type of codebook is the NELS:88 second follow-up electronic codebook (ECB). The electronic print files that are produced by the hardcopy codebook software are used as the foundaion (the 118 91 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual input files) for the ECB software. ECBs provide several advantages. First, the NELS:88 ECBs reside on CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) and, given the right equipment and software, can be accessed by and copied to a user's personal computer. The NELS:88 data sets have also been released on CD-ROMs, a far more concentrated medium for archiving information than magnetic tapes. The PC mode is both more convenient and far less expensive than mainframe operations for most users. Second, ECBs permit users to scroll through the same variables and survey results found in all versions of the codebooks electronically. In addition, analysts interact with the ECB software to select only those data elements that will be needed for the user's specific analyses. The result is a user-controlled subset of the variables that is fully equipped with the tools required for statistical analysis. The labor-intensive steps that were formerly required to accomplish these preliminary steps to analysis, such as typing in exact variable names, have been rendered obsolete by the ECB system.

For example, sample members found to have been sampled into the study in error have been deleted, and base year ineligible students found to be eligible in the first or second follow-up have been added. A few of the first follow-up variables have also been updated for the second follow-up release of the first follow-up data.

Schools in different districts and locations have different ideas about how to conduct education in the middle grades. Your participation is needed to assure a complete picture of the diversity of educational approaches and practices in schools today. It is important that you respond to each question as objectively as possible. There are no \"right\" answers. Select the responses that most closely reflect the current conditions in your school. Only with this added information, can we make the best use of the valuable information that you, your teachers, and students provided in NELS:88 to address questions about the variety of school practices in the middle grades. Joining us in requesting your cooperation in this survey is the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP). These organizations recognize the need for up-to-date information on middle level education, and will help disseminate the results to educators across the country.

CD-ROM: Compact Disc Read-Only Memory. A computer storage disk in the same physical form as an audio CD. A CD-ROM can store approximately 650 megabytes of digital data. NELS:88 data are available both in magnetic media, such as tapes, as well as in optical laser disc media, such as CD-ROM. Ceiling effect: The result of a cognitive test having insufficient numbers of the more difficult items. In a longitudinal study, ceiling effects in the follow-up testings can cause change scores to be artificially constrained for high ability examinees. More information (that is, smaller error of measurement) is obtained with respect to ability level if high ability individuals receive relatively harder items (and if low ability individuals receive proportionately easier items). The matching of item difficulty to a person's ability level yields increased reliability at the extremes of the score distribution where it is most needed for studies of longitudinal change. That is, the measurement problems related to floor and ceiling effects in combination with regression effects found at the extreme score ranges seriously hamper the accuracy of change measures in longitudinal studies. Hence one strategy employed in NELS:88 to minimize ceiling effects was to develop test forms that are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the examinee. The multilevel tests used in the first and second follow-ups of NELS:88--with test assignment based on prior test performance--work to minimize the possibility of ceiling effects biasing the estimates of the score gains. (See entry for \"Floor effect.\") Certainty school: A first or second follow-up school attended by four or more NELS:88 sample members, as determined by tracing and data collection efforts. These schools are included in the sample with certainty (probability = 1). All NELS:88 first follow-up sample members in the school at the time of data collection were included in the second follow-up. Closed-ended: A type of question in which the data provider's responses are limited to given alternatives as opposed to an open-ended question. (See entry for \"Open-ended.\") Cluster size: The number of NELS:88 sample members attending a particular high school. Codebook: A record of each variable being measured, including variable name, columns occupied by each variable in the data matrix, values used to define each variable, unweighted frequencies, unweighted percents, and weighted valid percents. (See entry for \"electronic codebook.\") Cognitive test battery: One of the two parts of the Student Survey (the second part being the student questionnaire). Four achievement areas (mathematics, reading, science, and social studies [history/ citizenship/geography]) were measured. Cohort: A group of individuals who have a statistical factor in common, for example, year of birth or grade in school or year of high school graduation. NELS:88 embraces three overlapping but distinct nationally-representative grade cohorts: 1987-88 eighth graders, 1989-90 high school sophomores, and 1991-92 high school seniors. Composite variables: A composite variable is one that is constructed through either the combination of two or more variables (socioeconomic status, for example) or calculated through the application of a mathematical function to a variable. Also called a \"derived variable\" or \"constructed variable.\" Confidence interval: A sample-based estimate expressed as an interval or range of values within which the true population value is expected to be located (with a specified degree of confidence). Contextual data: In NELS:88, the primary unit of analysis is the student (or dropout), and information from the other study components, referred to as the contextual data, should be viewed as extensions of the student data--for example, as school administrator, teacher, and parent reports on the student's school learning environment or home situation. Core school: School that was selected between Phases 1 and 2 of the second follow-up to receive the full complement (School Administrator, Teacher, Transcript) of study components, and for in-school data collection sessions. Core student: Students who are part of the primary cohort of NELS:88, in contrast to state augmentation or School Effectiveness Study studwits. The core students include those chosen as eighth graders in the 1988 Base Year Study and those added to the sample through freshening procedures during the first or second follow-up. Core study: The original NELS:88 study, in contrast to the study with additions and follow-up additions like the state augmentation studies and the School Effectiveness Study. Course offerings: School-level summaries of courses offered and of course enrollment levels; while in HS&B course offerings data were collected for all schools, in NELS:88 such data have been collected only for schools in the School Effectiveness Study. Cross-sectional survey: A cross-sectional design represents events and statuses at a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional survey may measure the cumulative educational attainment (achievements, attitudes, statuses) of students at a particular stage of schooling (for example, eighth grade, tenth grade, or twelfth grade). In contrast, a longitudinal (or repeated measurement of the same sample units) survey measures the change or growth in educational attainments that occurs over a particular period of schooling. The longitudinal design of NELS:88 generates--by means of sample \"freshening\"--three representative cross-sections (eighth graders in 1988, high school sophomores in 1990, seniors in 1992) and permits analysis of individual level change over time through longitudinal analysis and of group level and intercohort change through the cross-sectional comparisons. (See entry for \"Longitudinal or Panel Survey.\") Data element: The most basic unit of information. In data processing it is the fundamental data structure. It is defined by its size (in characters) and data type (e.g. alphanumeric, numeric only, true/false, date) and may include a specific set of values or range of values. Design effect: A measure of sample efficiency. The design effect (DEFF) is the variance of an estimate divided by the variance of the estimate that would have occurred if a sample of the same size had been selected using simple random sampling. Sometimes it is more useful to work with standard errors than with variances. The root design effect (DEFT) expresses the relation between the actual standard error of an estimate and the standard error of the corresponding estimates from a simple random sample. Dropout: The term is used both to describe an event--leaving school before graduating--and a status--an individual who is not in school and is not a graduate at a defined point in time. The \"cohort droput rate\" in NELS:88 is based on measurement of enrollment status of 1988 eighth graders two and four years later (that is, in the spring term of 1990 and the spring term of 1992) and of 1990 sophomores two years later. A respondent who has not graduated from high school or attained an equivalency certificate and who has not attended high school for 20 consecutive days (not counting any excused absences) is considered to be a dropout. In contrast, transferring schools--for example, from a public to a private school--is not 360 N-3 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual regarded as a dropout event, nor is delayed graduatiort (as when a student is continuously enrolled but takes an additional year to complete school). A person who drops out of school may later return and graduate: at the time the person left school initially, he or she is called a \"dropout,\" and at the time the person returns to school, he or she is called a \"stopout.\" Early graduate: A student who graduated from high school in less than the typical amount of time. For example, if a student graduated in December of his/her senior year (when the majority of his/her classmates graduate the following May or June), the student is categorized as an early graduate. In the main study data collection, early graduates were administered a special supplement in the student questionnaire along with the cognitive test battery. Electronic codebook (ECB): While hardcopy codebooks with item stems, response categories, associated response frequency distributions, unweighted percents, and weighted valid percents are contained within the NELS:88 user's manuals, NELS:88 data are also available on CD-ROM in an electronic codebook (ECB) format. For example, the electronic codebook created for the combined base year first follow-up NELS:88 data is a menu-driven system that allows users to perform functions such as the following: (a) search a list of NELS:88 BY-Fl database variables based upon key words or variable names/labels; (b) display weighted and unweighted percentages for each variable in the database; (c) display question text for each variable in the database; (d) select or tag variables for subsequent analysis; (e) generate SAS-PC or SPSS-PC+ program code/command statements for subsequently constructing a system file of the selected variables; and (t) generate a codebook of the selected variables. An electronic codebook is also being prepared for the NELS:88 second follow-up data, and will again be housed on a CD-ROM. ETS: Educational Testing Service. NORC s subcontractor for NELS:88 cognitive test development and evaluation. Fl: The NELS:88 first follow-up, conducted in 1990. F2: The NELS:88 second follow-up, conducted in 1992. File: Refers to a data file containing a set of related computerized records. Floor effect: The result of a cognitive test being too difficult for a large number of the examinees, causing the low ability examinees to receive chance scores on the first testing, and on subsequent testings if the test remains too difficult. Floor effects result in an inability to discriminate among low ability individuals at time one or time two, and there will be no reliable discrimination among examinees with respect to amounts of change. A possible solution, utilized in NELS:88, is to develop test forms that are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the examinee, which tends to minimize the possibility of floor effects biasing the estimates of the score gains. Followback study of excluded students: A continuation in the NELS:88 second follow-up of a special substudy begun in the first follow-up as (see entry for) the base year ineligibles study. Freshening: A NELS:88 sampling procedure by which high school sophomores were added in the first follow-up who were not in the eighth grade in the U.S. two years before. This process was repeated in the second follow-up, adding high school seniors who were not in the eighth grade in the U.S. four years before, and not in the tenth grade in the U.S. two years before. This process ensured that the sample would be representative of the 1992 senior class by allowing 1992 seniors who did not have a chance for selection into the base year (or the first follow-up) sample to have some probability of 1992 selection."}, {"section_title": "(15", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Note", "text": "however that not all cases are delivered on the public PER-WCTD files, so there will be gaps in the range of codes.

The second in the series of longitudinal education studies sponsored by NCES. The HS&B Base Year study surveyed sophomore and senior students in 1980. IEP: Individualized Education Program in special education for students with a mental or physical disability. IRT: Item Response Theory. A method of estimating achievement level by considering the pattern of right, wrong, and omitted responses on all items administered to an individual student. Rather than merely counting right and wrong responses, the IRT procedure also considers characteristics of each of the test items, such as their difficulty, and the likelihood that they could be guessed correctly by lowability individuals. IRT scores are less likely than simple number-right or formula scores to be distorted by correct guesses on difficult items if a student's response vector also contains incorrect answers to easier questions. Another attribute of IRT that makes it useful for NELS:88 is the calibration of item parameters for all items administered to all students. This makes it possible to obtain scores on the same scale for students who took harder or easier forms of the test. IRT also permits vertical scaling of the three grade levels (grade 8 in 1988, grade 10 in 1990, grade 12 in 1992). Item nonresponse: The amount of missing information when a valid response to an item or variable was expected. (See entry for \"Unit-nonresponse.\") LEP: Limited English Proficient. A concept developed to assist in identifying those language-minority students (individuals from non-English language backgrounds) who need language assistance services, in their own language or in English, in the schools. (See entries for \"NEP\" and \"LM.\") The Bilingual Education Act, reauthorized in 1988 (PL 100-297), describes a limited English proficient student as one who: 1) meets one or more of the following conditions: a) the student was born outside of the United States or the student's native language is not English; b) the student comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant; Or c) the studet:t is American Indian or Alaskan Native and comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on his/her level of English language proficiency; and 2) has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language to deny him or her the opportunity to learn successfully in English-only classrooms. LM: Language Minority. A fully English proficient student in whose home a non-English language is typically spoken. This groups includes students whose English is fluent enough to benefit from instruction in academic subjects offered in English. Longitudinal or panel survey: In a longitudinal design, similar measurementsof the same sample of individuals, institutions, households or of some other defined unit--are taken at multiple time points. NELS:88 employs a longitudinal design that follows the same individuals over time, and permits the analysis of individual-level change. (See entry for \"Cross-sectional survey.\") Machine editing: Also called forced data cleaning or logical editing. Uses computerized instructions in the data cleaning program that ensure common sense consistency within and across the responses from a data provider. Microdata (microrecords): Observations of individual sample members, such as those contained on the NELS:88 data files. MSA: Metropolitan statistical area. A large population nucleus and the nearby communities which have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Each MSA consists of one or more entire counties (or county equivalents) that meet specified standards pertaining to population, commuting ties, and metropolitan character. (However, in New England, towns and cities, rather than counties, are the basic units.) MSAs are designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). An MSA includes a city and, generally, its entire urban area and the remainder of the county or counties in which the urban area is located. A MSA also includes such additional outlying counties which meet specified criteria relating to metropolitan character and level of community of workers into the central city or counties. Multidimensional raking: An adjustment procedure in weighting whereby the sum of the weights for each marginal category of respondents in the follow-up rounds of NELS :88 was made equal to the corresponding sum of the final prior round weights for that group.

NELS:88: The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. Third in the series of longitudinal education studies sponsored by NCES. The study began in 1988 with the eighth-grade class of that year. The study has collected data in 1988, 1990, and 1992 on student's school experiences, as well as background information from school administrators, teachers and parents (in the base year and second follow-up only). The study seeks to learn about students' educational experiences and outcomes from eighth grade through high school and beyond. NEP: No English Proficiency. A student who does not speak English. (See entry for \"LEP.\") NLS-72: The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. This project was the first in the series of longitudinal education studies sponsored by NCES. Noncertainty schools: Schools in which fewer than four (three, two or one) NELS:88 students attended. These schools were not subsampled for participation in the School Administrator, Teacher, and Transcript components. Additionally, the survey instruments were not administered in group sessions in the schools, as was done in the certainly schools. Nonresponse: (See entry for \"Item nonresponse\" and \"Unit nonresponse.\") Nonsampling error: An error in sample estimates that cannot be attributed to sampling fluctuations. Such errors may arise from many sources including imperfect implementation of sampling procedures, differential unit or item nonresponse across subgroups, bias in estimation, or errors in observation and recording. NORC: The National Opinion Research Center at The University of Chicago. NORC conducts NELS:88 for the National Center for Education Statistics. NSF: The National Science Foundation, which is one of the sponsors of NELS:88. The National Science Foundation awards grants and contracts to individuals and organizations to conduct research. NSF sponsored two components of the second follow-up: 1) additions to the student questionnaire to learn about students' experiences and their exposure to mathematics and science curricula, and 2) a teacher survey of mathematics and science teachers to obtain evaluations of their NELS:88 student(s) and to learn about their classroom practices and background preparation for teaching. OBEMLA: The Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs, U.S. Department of Education. OBEMLA funded a NELS:88 supplement that inquired into the education experiences of students whose native language is other than English. OMB: The Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Executive Branch. OMB is a federal agency with the responsibility for reviewing all studies funded by executive branch agencies. OMB reviewed, commented on, and approved the NELS:88 questionnaires, as indicated by their approval number and its expiration date in the top right corner of the questionnaire covers. Open-ended: A type of question in which the data provider's responses are not limited to given alternatives. Optical disk: A disk that is read optically (e.g., by laser technology), rather than magnetically. (See entry for \"CD-ROM.\") Optical scanning: A system of recording responses that transfers responses into machine-readable data through optical mark reading. This method of data capture was used for the NELS:88 student questionnaires and cognitive tests, as well as for the parent and teacher questionnaires. (In contrast, responses to certain other questionnaires, such as the school administrator questionnaire, were keyed by using conventional data entry methods.) Out-of-sequence: This term means that a student is not in the grade that he/she would be in if progressing with the majority of the cohort through school. For example, most NELS:88 sample members were in the tenth grade in the 1989-90 school year; one would be described as out-of-sequence if found to be in the eleventh grade in the 1989-90 school year. N-7 F2: School Component Data File User's Manual Sampling variance: A measure of dispersion of values of a statistic that would occur if the survey were repeated a large number of times using the same sample design, instrument and data collection methodology. The square root of the sampling variance is the standard error. School administrator questionnaire: This questionnaire was to be completed by the principal and/or someone designated by the principal. The questionnaire sought basic information about school policies, number of students in each class, curriculum offered, programs for disadvantaged and disabled students, and other school characteristics. School climate: The social system and culture of the school, including the organizational structure of the school and values and expectations within it. School Coordinator: A person designated in each school to act as a contact person between the school and NORC. This person assisted with establishing a survey day in the school, and in some cases where the school cluster size was very small, the School Coordinator administered the student instruments. School Effectiveness Study: A component of NELS:88 added to the first follow-up to permit the study of school effects. The supplement substantially increased cluster sizes and provided in-school representative student samples at approximately 250 urban and suburban schools in the thirty largest MSAs in order to permit researchers to assess the impact of various school characteristics (such as structural and management characteristics and school climate) on student outcomes (such as student achievement and educational experience). This component was continued in the second follow-up, and included student, school administrator, teacher, and parent questionnaires, transcript surveys, as well as a course offerings component."}, {"section_title": "Standard deviation:", "text": "The most widely used measure of dispersion of a frequency distribution. It is equal to the positive square root of the population variance. Standard error: The positive square root of the sampling variance. It is a measure of the dispersion of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Standard errors are used to establish confidence intervals for the statistics being analyzed. State augmentation students: In the base year, certain states funded a sample of additional schools in the state to produce a representative sample of schools in the state. In this sense, the state's sample was \"augmented\" to maximize the utility of the NELS:88 data for those states. The students from those base year schools were designated as \"augmentation\" students, and were followed and surveyed in the first follow-up, though the students had dispersed to many tenth-grade schools. In the second follow-up these students were surveyed again. Stopout: A student who had one or more occurrences of school non-attendance for 20 or more days (not including any excused absences) who subsequently returned to school. In NELS:88, this term was used for temporary dropouts within a round (e.g., out of school in fall 1989 but back spring 1990, as contrasted to 1990 dropouts who were back in school in spring term of 1992). Student questionnaire: One of the two parts of the student survey (the other part is the cognitive test battery). This instrument contained a locator section for tracing sample members for future waves of NELS:88 and a series of questions about courses taken, hours spent on homework, and perceptions of the school and the home environment.
