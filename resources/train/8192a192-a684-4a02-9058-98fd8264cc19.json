Carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), carotid artery compliance (CAC), and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) are markers of arterial health that can be measured noninvasively by ultrasound. Increased cIMT correlates with vascular risk factors, 6, 7 relates to coronary artery disease, 8 and predicts cardiovascular events. 9 Similarly, decreased carotid artery compliance is associated with risk factors, 10 and has been implicated as a predictor for cardiovascular events. 11 Brachial FMD is a marker of endothelial function that reflects nitric oxide release from vascular endothelial cells. 12 Impaired brachial FMD has been shown to predict cardiovascular events in patients with coronary disease. 13 Furthermore, brachial FMD status may modify the relations between risk factors and atherosclerosis. 14, 15 We examined the relations of MS to cIMT, CAC, and brachial FMD in young adults and used 3 recently published guidelines to diagnose MS: the International Diabetes Federation guideline (msIDF), 16 the National Institute of Health Adult Treatment\nPanel III guideline (msNCEP), 17 and the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance guideline (msEGIR). 18 "}, {"section_title": "Methods Subjects", "text": "The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study is a multi-centre study of atherosclerotic risk factors of children and young adults.

Mean cIMT, CAC, and FMD for each MS definition was compared between groups using ANOVA. Values for fasting insulin and triglycerides were log transformed due to skewed distribution. Linear regression models were used to examine the association of MS and its components to ultrasound variables. The three definitions of MS were intercorrelated: r \u00bc 0.760 between IDF and NCEP, r \u00bc 0.594 between NCEP and EGIR, r \u00bc 0.619 between IDF and EGIR. These associations were considered not to be high enough to cause multicollinearity in regression analysis. There was no interaction between sexes in MS definitions and ultrasound variables, indicating that the effects of MS definitions on ultrasound markers were similar between sexes. Therefore, analyses were performed sexes combined by including sex as a covariate in regression models. For the linear regression models, the model assumptions of constant variance were assessed by drawing absolute and predicted values of residuals into the co-ordinates. The normality assumptions of the residuals were assessed by examining histograms of the residuals and normal probability plots. All analyses were repeated after excluding subjects taking lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, with essentially similar results.

MS was associated with higher cIMT in both sexes using all three definitions. Figure 1A shows the age-and sex-adjusted mean values of cIMT in various groups. Lowest cIMT values were observed in subjects without MS by any criteria (0.576 + 0.088 mm). Higher cIMT values were measured in individuals with msIDF (0.615 + 0.102 mm), msNCEP (0.617 + 0.104 mm), or msEGIR (0.607 + 0.097 mm). Similarly, subjects having MS by any criteria had lower CAC and higher FMD than subjects without MS ( Figure 1B and C) . All three definitions were significantly associated with cIMT and CAC in regression models adjusted for age and sex ( Table 2) . When msEGIR was included in the same model with msIDF or msNCEP criteria, the effect of the msEGIR definition became nonsignificant. All the definitions correlated equally well with CAC. MS explained CAC more strongly than cIMT by all three criteria (R 2 \u00bc 0.16 vs. 0.11-0.12). Table 3 shows the age-and sex-adjusted regression coefficients between each of the components of MS and cIMT, CAC, and FMD. In the msIDF and msNCEP definitions, all the individual components, except low HDL-cholesterol, correlated significantly with cIMT. In addition, hyperinsulinaemia, which is the key component of msEGIR, did not correlate with cIMT. All components correlated significantly with CAC. Obesity and hyperinsulinaemia correlated directly with FMD. Table 4 shows the multiple regression models for the three criteria, exploring the independent effects of the individual components on cIMT, CAC and FMD. Hypertension and obesity were associated significantly with cIMT in all models. Obesity, hypertension and hyperinsulinemia were inversely correlated with CAC in multivariable models. Obesity correlated directly with FMD, and hypertension defined by the EGIR criteria correlated inversely with FMD. Figure 2 shows the mean cIMT, CAC and FMD (age-and sexadjusted) values for subjects with various number of MS components (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) by the IDF criteria. There was an increasing trend in cIMT and a decreasing trend in CAC across the groups with increasing number of MS components. There was also a direct trend between the number of MS components and FMD (Figure 2c) .\nWe have previously shown in this population that brachial FMD response may modify the association between conventional risk factors and cIMT. 15 Therefore, we analysed whether the relations between MS and cIMT are modified by the magnitude of the FMD response. Figure 3) . Similar results were seen with msNCEP and msEGIR (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We found that young adults with MS had increased cIMT and decreased CAC. All recently proposed diagnostic criteria for MS worked equally well to identify subsets of individuals at risk for increased cIMT and decreased CAC, despite the overlap in their target populations. The relations between MS definitions and subclinical atherosclerosis in young adults have been previously studied in the Bogalusa Heart Study. Tzou et al. 4 performed carotid intimamedia measurements in 507 young adults. They reported that MS, defined by either NCEP or WHO guidelines, was associated with increased cIMT. Urbina et al. 24 and Li et al. 5 reported that MS and its components were associated with increased arterial stiffness in young adults. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Scuteri et al. 25 studied the association between MS and cIMT and stiffness (evaluated by the stiffness index) in 471 subjects and reported that cIMT was 16% higher and stiffness 32% higher in subjects with the msNCEP compared with controls. Our data from a population of over 2000 subjects confirm these findings. The components of msIDF and msNCEP are easily ascertainable, as the diagnoses do not require the measurement of insulin or oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin resistance is generally considered as the primary underlying abnormality in MS. 1, 26 Thus intuitively, the inclusion of a marker of insulin resistance to the diagnostic criteria of MS should increase the power to predict increased cardiovascular risk. However, hyperinsulinemia, which is a required diagnostic component in EGIR definition, did not correlate with cIMT in our study population. Moreover, the correlation between cIMT and msEGIR lost its significance in a multivariable model adjusted for msIDF or msNCEP. Inclusion of a marker of insulin resistance to MS definition may increase the predictive value for diabetes but not necessarily cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, analysis of the NHANES data have suggested that the NCEP criteria may fail to detect a proportion of subjects with insulin resistance. 27 According to the studies by Laaksonen et Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in women to a greater extent than in men. 30 Iglseder et al. 31 recently\nreported that the effects of MS on cIMT were more pronounced in women than in men. However, we found no evidence of interaction by sex on the effects of MS definitions on markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. Conventional risk factors do not correlate very strongly with brachial FMD in our population. 15 FMD is directly related with HDL-cholesterol and BMI, and inversely with systolic blood pressure when these risk markers are considered as continuous variables. 15 Previously, Yan et al. 32 found an inverse correlation between FMD and blood pressure, but no correlations between FMD and other individual risk factors in 1578 healthy middle-aged firefighters in the FATE study. In the present analysis, we found no evidence of impaired FMD response in the individuals with MS. In fact, subjects with MS had slightly higher average FMD responses due to the unexpected direct relation between FMD and body size. 15 We have no plausible explanation for this observation, but it suggests that an increase in body size within the non-obese range in a population of healthy young adults is associated with physiological changes that lead to enhanced FMD responses, and overcome the opposite influences of larger vessel size and increased oxidative stress associated with higher BMI's. One possibility is that the relationship between body size and endothelial function is not linear. 33 In line with this, we have previously shown that the relationship between body size and endothelial function is curvilinear, and that we are observing the upward slope of this relationship in our population of healthy adults. 15 Although subjects with MS did not have impaired endothelial function, the FMD response modified the relations between MS and subclinical atherosclerosis. MS was associated with higher cIMT in subjects with impaired FMD, whereas subjects with MS and enhanced FMD had normal cIMT values, comparable with the population average. These findings indicate that systemic endothelial function may reflect the propensity of arteries to develop atherosclerotic changes in response to exposure to metabolic risk factors. Arterial endothelial damage or activation may be "}]
