The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) whole genome sequence (WGS) data offers new power to investigate mechanisms of AD by combining entire genome sequences with neuroimaging and clinical data. Here we explore the ADNI WGS SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data in depth and extract approximately six million valid SNP features. We investigate imaging genetics associations using Lasso regression-a widely used sparse learning technique. To solve the large-scale Lasso problem more efficiently, we employ a highly efficient screening rule for Lasso-called dual polytope projections (DPP)-to remove irrelevant features from the optimization problem. Experiments demonstrate that the DPP can effectively identify irrelevant features and leads to a 400\u00d7 speedup. This allows us for the first time to run the compute-intensive model selection procedure called stability selection to rank SNPs that may affect the brain and AD risk."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia; it affects more than five million Americans and is the sixth leading cause of death in United States [1] . AD is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder typically beginning with mild memory loss; later it can seriously impair an individual's ability to carry out daily activities. It has been widely recognized and emphasized that early detection of AD is beneficial. Recently, neuroimaging techniques-such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography and positron emission tomography-have shown great promise for evaluating AD and tracking its progression [2] .\nFactors that influence AD progression are not yet fully understood, but common genetic variants are among the major risk factors [3] . Novel sequencing techniques have greatly advanced genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies. Now, entire genomes can be combined with brain imaging and clinical data to facilitate the investigation of the mechanisms of AD.\nBesides the well-known APOE genotype, recent studies [4] of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) GWAS data have related known AD risk genes to differences in rates of brain atrophy and biomarkers of AD in the cerebrospinal fluid. More recently, full genetic sequences have been collected for over 800 ADNI participants. The ENIGMA Consortium recently discovered six common genetic variants associated with subcortical brain volumes in a worldwide screen of over 30,000 brain MRI scans [5] . Another study-the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (I-GAP) study [6] , with over 74,000 participantsidentified genetic risk factors with statistical methods, is the largest study of AD to date. However, these studies still have limitations. First of all, GWAS studies focus on a set of selected common genetic variants rather than the entire sequence of the genome. Loci showing strongest associations with the disease, or a brain measure, are not generally the causal SNPs, as the causal loci have typically not been sequenced directly. Secondly, studies such as I-GAP are based on simple statistical models that only test associations of each SNP, one at a time, with AD-related phenotypes. In other words, these methods typically ignore potential interlocus interactions.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect genetic risk factors in the ADNI WGS data via Lasso regression, along with screening rules. We investigate the imaging genetics associations between AD imaging phenotypes (e.g., volumes of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus) and SNPs in the whole genome sequences of ADNI participants. The WGS data set includes approximately 5.9 million loci and may ultimately implicate rare genetic causal variants. Rather than performing a univariate test for each SNP and phenotype individually, we use Lasso-a widely used sparse model (e.g., [7, 8] )-to identify the most relevant SNPs. To make it more efficient to solve large-scale Lasso problems, we employ state-of-the-art Lasso screening rules (DPP) that quickly identify irrelevant features. Experiments on the WGS data show the speed and effectiveness of the proposed method. In association with the AD imaging phenotypes, we also present potential risk SNPs via stability selection."}, {"section_title": "DATA PROCESSING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI WGS SNP data", "text": "The ADNI WGS data contains the entire genome sequences for 818 ADNI participants, including 128 AD patients, 415 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, 267 elderly controls, and 8 participants of uncertain diagnosis. To store statistically relevant SNPs called using Illumina's CASAVA SNP Caller, the ADNI WGS SNP data is stored in variant call format (VCF) [9, 10] . The VCF is a specific text file format used in bioinformatics for storing gene sequence variations. SNPs at approximately 3.7 million specific loci are recorded for each participant. The genotype information is mainly documented into two columns: MAXGT and POLY, respectively [11] . Specifically, the MAXGT column refers to the commonest genotype, while the POLY column refers to genotyping assuming the site is polymorphic. Both columns are coded according to allele values and the conditional genotype quality scores. The allele value is 0 for the reference allele, 1 for the first allele listed among the alternative alleles (ALT), 2 for the second, and so on."}, {"section_title": "SNP genotype coding", "text": "A single nucleotide polymorphism is a DNA sequence variation occurring when a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) in the genome differs among members of a biological species or across paired chromosomes. Based on the original ADNI WGS SNP data, in this study, we encode SNPs using the additive coding scheme [12] as follows: \uf0b7 0/0 refers to reference homozygote, coded as 0; \uf0b7 1/1 refers to alternative homozygote, coded as 2; \uf0b7 0/1, 1/0, etc., refer to heterozygote, coded as 1; \uf0b7 All missing entries are treated as reference homozygotes."}, {"section_title": "Quality control", "text": "To extract high quality informative SNP features, we first apply two major quality control criteria: Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) < 0.05 and Genotype Quality (GQ) < 45.\nAllele frequency is the proportion of a particular allele among all allele copies being considered. For a specific locus, the minor allele frequency is the frequency of the least frequent allele in the population [13] . After genotype coding, SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 5% or greater are targeted in our research. Approximate MAFs for all loci are shown in Fig. 1 .\nA GQ score is recorded for each locus by its \"Phred\" quality. The Phred quality score = \u221210 log 10 is logarithmically related to the base-calling error probability [14] . We extract GQ scores of all SNPs from all subjects. A histogram of the GQ scores is shown in Fig. 2 . We then fit the GQ score distribution using a Gaussian model ( , ). Generally, SNPs detected via GQ scores that are less than a threshold = \u2212 may be considered as inaccurate. Based on the fitted result, we choose = 45 as the threshold to use. We then encode those SNPs with GQ < 45 as '-1', and remove the corresponding loci if the tag '-1' appears more than 80 times in all participants."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "In this paper, we investigate Alzheimer's disease genetic risk factors on the whole genome sequence data via Lasso and associated screening methods."}, {"section_title": "Lasso", "text": "Lasso is widely used linear regression technique in machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics etc. to find sparse representations [15] .

Therefore, Lasso is potentially useful to locate important SNPs that are most relevant to predicting the specific phenotype. We employ the SLEP package [16] to solve the Lasso problem.\nThe dual problem of Lasso is equivalent to the following:\nwhere is a dual variable. Let * ( ) and * ( ) be the optimal solution of problems (1) and (2), respectively. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are: \nThose inactive features have 0 components in * and thus can be removed from the optimization problem. Inspired by the SAFE rules [17] , (5) can be relaxed as follows:\nwhere is a region that contains * ( ). We can see that the smaller the region is, the more accurate the estimation of * ( )-and thus more inactive features can be identified."}, {"section_title": "Enhanced DPP screening rules for Lasso", "text": "The idea of \"screening\" has been shown to be very promising in improving the efficiency of large-scale Lasso. Briefly speaking, screening rules aim to quickly identify the inactive features, which have 0 components in the solution. Inactive features can be removed from the optimization leading to substantial savings in computational cost and memory usage.\nMotivated by the idea of [17] and [18] , we develop the following sequential version of screening rules for Lasso problem via the enhanced dual polytope projections (EDPP) [19] . Suppose that we are given a sequence of parameter values 1 > 2 > \u22ef > . We first apply EDPP to discard inactive features for the Lasso problem at 1 . We compute the optimal solution * ( 1 ) by solving Lasso on the reduced data matrix. Then, by Eq. (3), we can find * ( 1 ). In view of (6), if we know the dual optimal dual solution * ( 1 ), we obtain a new screening rule for problem (1) at 2 . By repeating the above procedure, we have the sequential version of EDPP. Let = \u2016 \u2016 \u221e , and let * = argmax | |, \nThe sequential version of the EDPP has several appealing features. First, in a real application, the optimal parameter value of is typically unknown and needs to be estimated. Second, it can help accelerate the process of stability selection. In our study, we use the DPC package [19] ."}, {"section_title": "EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We evaluate the proposed the EDPP rules for Lasso on the ADNI WGS data. Specifically, we first report the efficiency of EDPP and then investigate the potential risk SNPs related to AD imaging phenotypes by stability selection."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Lasso with and without EDPP rule", "text": "In this experiment, we compare the performance of Lasso with and without the EDPP screening rule. We choose the baseline hippocampal volume to be the response vector, so the trials contain 717 subjects. We vary the number of features from 0.1 million to 1 million SNPs-that are randomly selected-with a step size of 0.1 million. For each , we solve the Lasso problems at a sequence of 100 parameter values equally spaced in the logarithmic scale of \u03bb/\u03bb max from 1.0 to 0.05. The run times are reported in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 shows that the solver equipped with EDPP (EDPP+Solver) gains a speedup about 406\u00d7 compared to the solver without screening. Moreover, if we double the dimension of the features, the run time of the solver without screening also doubles, while the run time of the solver with EDPP screening rule only increases slightly-which is mainly due to the screening part. Thus, the experiments demonstrate that the EDPP rule is a promising approach to facilitate the Lasso solver in dealing with extremely high dimensional data."}, {"section_title": "Stability selection on WGS data", "text": "In this experiment, we explore the imaging genetics association between imaging phenotypes and SNPs from the entire ADNI WGS SNP data with 5,906,152 features. For two brain regions, the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HIPP), we chose the volume at baseline, and volume changes over a 24-month interval (for which there are 329 subjects with valid data) as outcomes. We employ stability selection [20] -introduced by B\u00fchlmann et al.-to obtain the risk SNPs. For each outcome, we perform 100 simulations. In each simulation, we first subsample half of the samples from the original data, and then we incorporate EDPP with the solver for Lasso, to solve the Lasso problems at a sequence of 100 parameter values equally spaced on the logarithmic scale of \u03bb/\u03bb max from 1.0 to 0.05. The selection probabilities for each SNP are recorded and we present the top 10 selected SNPs for each outcome in Table 1 & Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we investigate Alzheimer's disease genetic risk factors associated with imaging phenotypes using the ADNI whole genome sequence data. Because of the sheer scale of the genomic data, we employ Lasso regression to identify the most relevant SNPs and use the enhanced DPP screening rule to identify and remove irrelevant features from the optimization. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Among the top SNPs, that survive stability selection, in Table 1 , are several genes already implicated in AD risk or risk for other neuropsychiatric disorders. APOE is a top AD risk gene, and also ranks among the top predictors of baseline entorhinal and hippocampal volumes, in line with much prior work showing APOE effects on temporal lobe structures not just in old age but also in children and adolescents [21] .\nAPOE4 carriers have a roughly 3-fold increase in AD risk per adverse copy of the gene carried, and the selection of APOE4 among the genes associated with brain measures offers strong a priori evidence of validity. APOE does not feature among the top genes that predict rates of brain tissue loss over time, although baseline data reflect the lifetime accumulation of tissue loss, which is perhaps more affected by APOE than measures over a short interval.\nThe 4 th ranked gene related to hippocampal volume change is CACNA1C, a gene involved in calcium channel function that has already been associated with DTI measures in the hippocampus, and is among the top genes associated with anxiety, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder [22, 23] . Intriguingly, another of the top genes related to hippocampal volume change is the beta-secretase gene, BACE2, is a close homolog of BACE1, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the cellular pathways of AD.\nRather than interpret the associations as plausible or not post hoc, the next step in this work is to see if the associations with regional volumes replicate in independent samples. Very little WGS data is publicly available, especially from cohorts assessed with brain imaging. Recent genome-wide association studies by the ENIGMA and CHARGE consortia identified SNPs consistently associated with hippocampal volumes in over 30,000 people worldwide [5, 24] . As such a screen for enrichment would be valuable between the WGS SNPs selected here and SNP sets that predict regional volumes in ENIGMA."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This research was supported in part by NIH 'Big Data to Knowledge' (BD2K) Center of Excellence grant U54 EB020403, funded by a cross-NIH consortium including NIBIB and NCI.
