Negative binomial models were used with year and county-level fixed effects. Interactions were tested and stratified analyses were conducted by metropolitan counties, rural counties adjacent to metropolitan counties, and rural remote counties.\nEXPOSURES County-level 10-year unemployment rate and mental health and primary care clinician supply obtained from the Health Resources and Services Administration Area Health Resources Files.\nRates of NAS, excluding iatrogenic withdrawal, obtained from state inpatient databases.\nThe sample included observations from 580 counties over 7 years (1803 county-years from metropolitan counties, 1268 county-years from rural counties adjacent to metropolitan counties, and 927 county-years from rural remote counties). During the study period, there were 6 302 497 births and 47 224 diagnoses of NAS. The median rate of NAS was 7.1 per 1000 hospital births (interquartile range [IQR], 2.2-15.8), the 10-year unemployment rate was 7.6% (IQR, 6.4%-9.0%), and 83.9% of county-years were partial or complete mental health shortage areas. In the adjusted analyses, mental health shortage areas had higher NAS rates (unadjusted rate in shortage areas of 14.0 per 1000 births vs unadjusted rate in nonshortage areas of 10.6 per 1000 births; adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07-1.27]), occurring primarily in metropolitan counties (adjusted IRR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.16-1.40]; P = .02 for test of equivalence between metropolitan counties and rural counties adjacent to metropolitan counties). There was no significant association between primary care shortage areas and rates of NAS. The 10-year unemployment rate was associated with higher rates of NAS (unadjusted rate in highest unemployment quartile of 20.1 per 1000 births vs 7.8 per 1000 births in lowest unemployment quartile; adjusted IRR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00-1.23]) occurring primarily in rural remote counties (adjusted IRR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.05-1.70]; P = .04 for test of equivalence between metropolitan counties and rural remote counties).\nIn this ecological analysis of counties in 8 US states, there was a significant association among higher long-term unemployment, higher mental health clinician shortage areas, and higher county-level rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "F rom 1999 to 2014, there was an increase in opioid use in the United States. [1] [2] [3] [4] Increased use of opioid analgesics, heroin, and fentanyl was associated with increased rates of opioid overdose deaths. 5 Although the crisis affects communities throughout the United States, opioid use disproportionately affects impoverished rural counties. 6, 7 Rural counties may be particularly at risk for opioid-related complications because residents often have poor access to health care, lack economic opportunity, and have diminished social capital, which are all factors associated with opioidrelated mortality. 8, 9 The effects of the opioid crisis on pregnant women and infants are of increasing concern. Chronic opioid use during pregnancy can result in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is a type of neonatal drug withdrawal syndrome. Neonatal abstinence syndrome can occur after illicit opioid use (eg, heroin) or as an expected outcome from opioid agonist treatment (eg, methadone and buprenorphine). 10 From 2000 to 2014, the US rate of NAS increased from 1.2 to 8.0 per 1000 hospital births. [11] [12] [13] Similar to overdose deaths, the increases in NAS rates disproportionately occurred in rural, impoverished counties. 6 Even though some adult opioid-related outcomes have been associated with adverse economic conditions, 14 this association has not been evaluated for opioid-related complications in infants. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the association between NAS rates and county-level health care infrastructure such as clinician supply. A better understanding of the association among community characteristics such as health care infrastructure and macroeconomic conditions and NAS is needed to inform community-level interventions aimed at improving opioid-related outcomes for these vulnerable populations.\nTo address this gap in the literature, data were used from 580 diverse counties in 8 states to examine the association among long-term unemployment, clinician supply (measured by primary care and mental health clinician shortage areas and number of obstetricians per population), and rates of NAS and evaluate how these associations may differ based on rurality."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "This retrospective time-series analysis of counties in Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington used a longitudinal data set created from repeated cross-sectional data for 2009 to 2015 from multiple public sources.

We then created multivariable negative binomial models of the county-level number of NAS births as a function of countylevel characteristics and economic conditions using the county-level number of all births as the exposure.

We first sought to identify the enduring association of adverse economic conditions by evaluating unemployment changes during the prior decade (ie, 2000-2009) . Variables that are in the causal pathway (eg, income) were excluded from the estimation for the full association between unemployment and rates of NAS. Our primary analysis included clinician supply (primary care and mental health HPSAs, obstetrician density), 10-year moving average unemployment rate (referred throughout as 10-year unemployment rate), proportion of manufacturing jobs, number of births per county, year, and county fixed effects. Second, because county fixed effects account for county-level characteristics that do not vary from year to year (eg, rurality), we tested interaction terms and conducted a stratified analysis by rurality (metropolitan counties, rural counties adjacent to metropolitan counties, and rural remote counties). The adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) are reported and are based on a 1-unit change for dichotomous variables and a 1-SD change for continuous variables.\nA series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to confirm the robustness of the results. First, we added poverty to the primary analysis, and then replaced the 10-year unemployment rate with a 10-year poverty rate. Poverty is correlated both with rates of unemployment and NAS and is on the causal pathway from unemployment to NAS; therefore, we excluded it from the primary analysis. Second, because 2015 New York data were unavailable, an analysis was conducted first excluding New York from the sample, and then another analysis was conducted limiting the study years to 2009-2014.\nWe also conducted tests for trend analyses on NAS rates, employment characteristics, income, clinician supply, and HPSAs.

In this study, higher long-term unemployment rates were associated with higher rates of NAS, suggesting that both past and present economic conditions contribute to NAS rates.\nCase and Deaton 9 suggest that recent observed increases in morbidity and mortality, particularly among rural populations, may represent cumulative disadvantage, social isolation, and decline of marriage, resulting in a poor labor market and poor health outcomes. A recent federal report also found that higher county unemployment rates were associated with higher rates of opioid overdose deaths. 27 In the adjusted analyses, the current study found that a higher 10-year unemployment rate was associated with a higher county NAS rate; however, this association was not observed in metropolitan counties. These findings are consistent with the thesis of Case and Deaton 9 that lack of economic opportunity, particularly in rural counties, is associated with opioid-related complications. A higher proportion of manufacturing jobs in rural counties was associated with higher rates of NAS, which is consistent with prior research finding higher opioid use in counties with more manufacturing. 24 This could be the result of higher rates of injury, chronic pain, and disability experienced by many individuals working in manufacturing, factors that may contribute to greater opioid analgesic use, 28,29 coupled with a relative lack of nonmanufacturing employment opportunities in those rural counties compared with less rural counties. In this study, mental health HPSAs were associated with higher rates of NAS, particularly in metropolitan counties. Mental health disorders are a risk factor for opioid misuse, and opioid use disorder and mental health disorders are frequently comorbid, with a 2-fold increase in the odds of opioid use during pregnancy among women with depressive or anxiety disorders compared with those without these types of diagnoses. 30 Untreated and undertreated mental health disorders increase the risk of opioid misuse and abuse 16 and potentially help explain the finding of an association between mental health HPSAs and NAS rates.

Furthermore, the use of mental health HPSAs as a measurement may be too crude a division to fully capture such workforce issues. Future research could explore additional relationships between mental health workforce (eg, number of clinicians waivered from the Drug Addiction Treatment Act and the number of psychiatrists) and NAS rates.

This analysis did not attempt to examine the complex relationship and pathways among economic conditions (eg, loss of social capital, food insecurity, housing), use and misuse of different types of opioids (eg, heroin), and NAS rates. Furthermore, clinician supply is complex and may experience endogeneity due to omitted variables that characterize demand for their services (ie, clinicians may move to areas of high demand), potentially biasing the results toward the null.\nFourth, even though this study examined a diverse cohort of counties across 8 states and over 7 years, the findings may not generalize to other communities or periods.\nFifth, this analysis does not capture factors potentially influencing maternal access to care in local communities, including the availability of hospital-based obstetric services, federally qualified health centers, midwives, and family physicians that provide obstetric services.\nSixth, the study design allows an examination of the associations among the exposures of interest (eg, unemployment, clinician workforce) and NAS rates but cannot prove causation.\nSeventh, given some studies suggest that a small proportion of clinicians write a large volume of opioid prescriptions, 31 primary care HPSAs may not accurately reflect opioid prescribing. Eighth, the proportion of counties designated as mental health HPSAs was high for all locations examined (metropolitan counties, rural counties adjacent to metropolitan counties, and rural remote counties), and the limited variability among counties may have affected the estimation of an association with NAS rates."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this ecological analysis of counties in 8 US states, there was a significant association among higher long-term unemployment, higher mental health clinician shortage areas, and higher county-level rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome.
