[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The geographical distribution of a species is determined by a large number of complex processes operating over spatial scales spanning 10 orders of magnitude. Patterns in population processes have been described at numerous scales. We show that two patterns, measured at different scales, jointly allow us to infer heretofore unknown patterns in the distribution of demographic patterns across the geographical range of a species. The resulting model describes three fundamentally different modes of geographical variation in vital rates of populations. One mode is characterized by a positive nonlinear relationship between the maximum rate of population growth and the intensity of intraspecific competition across a geographical range. That is, populations that grow rapidly are also those where individuals experience the greatest per capita negative effect of the presence of other individuals. The second mode of behaviour is described by a negative nonlinear relationship between maximum growth rate and density dependence. Under this scenario, populations with low capacity to grow rapidly have highest intensities of intraspecific competitive effects. A third mode of behaviour is characterized by a weak positive relationship between growth rate and intraspecific competition, with very little geographical variation in maximum growth rate. A survey of studies relating temporal means and variances in population abundance for a variety of species indicate that the second mode of geographical variation in population dynamics across species ranges is the most common, though a few species appear to be characterized by the third mode. The problem of understanding the nature of the geographical distribution of a species across a continent is an inherently multiscale problem. At the smallest scale, which typically will be measured in m 2 or smaller units, the success that individual organisms have in securing their nutritional, physiological, and behavioural needs within local habitats determines where the species can and cannot be found. At the largest scale, across spans of 10 6 km 2 or greater, geographical variation in climate and topography determines the kinds and amounts of resources and physical extremes that individuals will encounter, and hence constrains the distribution of appropriate habitat.

We then present a statistic that describes the general features of this complex pattern of abundance. This statistic, often referred to as Taylor's power law, has been widely used in ecology for four decades. Our model provides a new synthetic interpretation of its meaning when applied to variation in abundance across a geographical range.

Generally, there are clusters of high abundance within a species range surrounded by larger regions where abundance declines until it reaches zero (Brown et al. 1995) . Often the pattern is unimodal (Hengeveld & Haeck 1981 , 1982 Brown 1984; Emlen et al. 1986 ), although this is by no means universal (Root 1998c; Price et al. 1995) .\nDespite the fact that high-abundance sites tend to be clustered together in the central portion of the range, abundance does not necessarily vary smoothly from these regions to the range boundary (Maurer & Villard 1994; Brown et al. 1995) . Rather, there are many regions within the range of a species that are unsuitable, making the actual distribution of abundance highly discontinuous and patchy (Lawton 1993; Maurer 1994; Maurer & Villard 1994) . Aspects of the patterns in the distribution of abundance are measurable using the spatial autocorrelation of abundance from one site to the next. The higher the degree of spatial autocorrelation among sites, the smoother the changes are from place to place within the geographical range (Maurer 1994) . That is, the patterns of spatial autocorrelation in abundance correspond to the specific spatial pattern in abundance across the entire geographical range of a species."}, {"section_title": "COMPLEMENTARY MODELS O F THE G EO G R APH I C A L RA NG E", "text": "The macroscopic scale\nIn a macroscopic sense, how does the geographical range of a species arise? It arises by the aggregation of individual organisms at different scales. That is, certain local habitats attract and support individual organisms, and these local habitats tend to cluster together spatially (Brown 1984) . Discontinuities in the distribution of organisms arise because habitats themselves are discontinuously distributed within landscapes (Morse et al. 1985; Milne 1992; Williamson & Lawton 1991; Milne et al. 1996; Ritchie 1997; Turner et al. 1997) . These discontinuities lead to patchy distributions of populations of organisms within landscapes (Ritchie 1997) . Landscapes are clustered together geographically due to prevailing edaphic, climatic and topographic conditions across continents. Generally, landscapes that are within the same geographical region will have similar combinations of climatic and edaphic conditions, while those separated by large geographical distances will be dissimilar. Thus, the geographical distribution of a species depends on a variety of processes that limit the use of habitat and dispersal of organisms across geographical space. Each of these processes operate at different spatial scales.\nSince their introduction by Taylor (1961) , variance-mean power relationships have been used to summarize empirically complex geographical patterns of population dynamics (Taylor & Taylor 1977; Anderson et al. 1982; Hanski 1982; Taylor 1986; Hanski & Woiwod 1993; Maurer 1994; Curnutt et al. 1996) . Such relationships take the form of s 2 \u00bc a m b , where s 2 is the temporal variance in population abundance at a given geographical location and m is the temporal mean abundance of the population. The parameters a and b are not properties of individual local populations, rather, they describe patterns over a much larger spatial scale. They imply the existence of constraints on the temporal variation in abundance of local populations. Typically, these parameters are estimated by taking a collection of local populations, each of which have been censused over a number of years. Let n be the number of such local populations, m i be the mean of the ith population (i \u00bc 1, 2, \u2026 n), and s i 2 be the variance of the ith population. A linear regression is then performed on the log transformed means and variances, and the slope of the regression line taken as an estimate of b, and the exponentiated intercept as an estimate of a. Therefore, the power law is a macroscopic law that is assumed to be a property of an entire collection of populations. Taylor (1961) suggested that the power law is the result of organismal aggregation, an interpretation which he developed fully in a series of publications (Taylor 1986 ). Hanski 1982 and Anderson et al. (1982) questioned this interpretation, and later Hanski & Woiwod (1993) suggested that variance-mean relationships emerge from constraints that abundance puts on the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in population growth rate. In what follows, we use the variance to mean power relationship as an empirically derived law with wide applicability. We discuss later several possible ways such power laws might be generated in geographical populations."}, {"section_title": "The microscopic scale", "text": "A mechanistic understanding of the geographical distribution of a species should incorporate patterns of habitatspecific demography across a species' geographical range (Pulliam 2000) . From the perspective of each individual population, the question is 'What population mechanisms determine the ability of that population to persist, given its position within the geographical range of the species?' From this perspective, the geographical range can be defined as an ensemble of different populations, each of which persist over time in a specific set of ecological conditions at a given location within the range. At any given time, a particular population may go locally extinct, but if it is considered to be part of the geographical range, it will be recolonized relatively rapidly. This is a somewhat simplified view of what is likely to be a more complex colonization-extinction process (Holt & Keitt 2000) . Nevertheless, for our purposes, we will not consider geographical locations that do not retain a persistent population over time to be part of the range of a species.\nA population that persists over time does so in the face of stochastic fluctuations in the environment. Population persistence implies that population abundance is regulated, at least partially, by internal feedbacks so that when abundance is too low, the population increases rapidly, whereas if it is too high, abundance decreases. The simplest model that incorporates both population regulation and stochasticity is a stochastic version of logistic population dynamics. That is\nwhere N is population abundance, r is the maximum per capita rate of increase of the population, u is the negative acceleration on population growth due to intraspecific competition, z is a white (Gaussian) noise random variable with mean zero and variance 1, and r is a scale factor that represents the size of random fluctuations in the per capita rate of change (Dennis & Patil 1984; Dennis & Costantino 1988; Dennis 1989 ). This equation can be considered a first order approximation of a more complicated model in the vicinity of an equilibrium (Bartlett 1960; Pielou 1977; Dennis & Patil 1984; Dennis & Costantino 1988; Dennis 1989) or long-term average (Maurer 1999) . We consider the stochastic component in eqn 1 to be additive to the per capita growth rate and independent of population abundance. There may be more complicated forms of stochasticity that are not additive with respect to abundance. Equation 1 assumes that such effects are of minor\nimportance. In what follows, we use this equation as an approximation of the habitat-specific population dynamics for each population located within the geographical range of a species. A local population governed by eqn 1 persists and shows no long-term trends. The interpretation of eqn 1 is not straightforward, however, and depends on the form of the stochastic process used to model additions and losses to the population (Bartlett 1960; Roughgarden 1979; Dennis & Patil 1984; Dennis 1989) . There are two ways of translating stochastic differential equations into diffusion equations, namely the Ito and Stratonovich methods (Goel & Richter 1974; Roughgarden 1979) . Although they result in the same qualitative form for the probability distribution of states occupied over time, they differ in the expected value of that distribution (Dennis & Patil 1984) . We use the Ito formulation that Dennis (1989) suggested, because it corresponds to the method used to simulate numerically the population dynamics governed by eqn 1. Furthermore, most data collected on population dynamics adhere more closely to the underlying assumptions used by Dennis (1989) . Most ecologists interested in stochastic dynamics have concluded that the Ito method is more appropriate if the population process operates in discrete time (see Roughgarden 1979 for further discussion). Given these considerations, the stationary distribution describing abundances over time for a large family of models that show persistent populations in fluctuating environments is a gamma distribution (Dennis & Patil 1984) . The mean (m) of this distribution is\nand its variance (s 2 ) is\nThus, for a stationary population, if the mean and variance in abundance over time and the size of random fluctuations (r) are known, estimates of the maximum per capita rate of increase (r) and the effect of abundance on per capita growth rate (u) can be obtained. The 'carrying capacity', or abundance about which fluctuations in population size occur, can also be calculated as k \u00bc r/u. Note that the mean population abundance given by eqn 2 is less than k. Since a gamma distribution generally has a positive skew, the modal abundance is also less than k. The habitat-specific demographic parameters r, u, and k will vary from one population to the next across the geographical range. There is no explicit term in eqn 1 for diffusion of individuals among populations. Hence, the model assumes that net dispersal among sites is a negligible component of population dynamics. The interpretation of these parameters offered below must be understood to be limited to the perspective of a single population at a certain point in the geographical range. The model does not allow inferences about the effects of the diffusion of individuals among populations on the geographical range boundary."}, {"section_title": "The relationship between macro and micro scale descriptions", "text": "The major point we wish to emphasize is that a more mechanistic understanding of the nature of a geographical range emerges when the perspectives from the large and small scales are merged into a single description of the geographical range. The macro scale pattern is described by the scaling of the temporal means and variances of population abundances across the geographical range, given by\nRecall that every local population in the geographical range has the same values for a and b; they differ in their values for s and m. From the perspective of a single population then, the mean and variance in population size given by eqns 2 and 3 must obey the scaling law. Combing the macroscopic scaling law with eqns 2 and 3 for a local population gives\nFor each local population in a geographical range, a unique set of stochastic factors, defined by a particular value for r, will lead to a single relationship between r and u. \nEquation 5 implies that because spatial variation in local population dynamics ultimately determines the nature of the large-scale pattern, the maximum per capita rate of increase and the effect of intraspecific competition are not independent within a local population, but instead vary together across geographical space. The nature of this relationship between r s and u s is expressed by the fractal scaling parameter b (Fig. 1) . The value of this parameter defines three domains of spatial behaviour, each with different biological implications. This can be seen more clearly by considering the derivative of r s with respect to u s in eqn 5:\nIf b < 1, then there is a positive relationship between intraspecific competition and maximum rate of increase (i.e. dr s / du s > 0). That is, in populations that are capable of increasing very rapidly at low densities, the per capita effect of density on slowing further population increases is the greatest (Fig. 1 ). If 1 < b < 2, then the opposite is true. Populations that are the slowest to increase at low densities are also those where the per capita effect of density on slowing further increases is the greatest (Fig. 1) . When b \u00bc 2, the scaled maximum rate of growth is independent of the strength of intraspecific competition. Finally, when b > 2, there is a weak positive relationship between scaled maximum growth and per capita effect of intraspecific competition (Fig. 1B) . Note that when b \u00bc 1, there is a 'singularity', that is, the relationship between scaled maximum growth rate and intraspecific competition is undefined. The domains of spatial behaviour implied by the macroscopic parameter b in our model have an interesting congruence with Taylor's (1961) original interpretation of the power law. Taylor (1961) interpreted the power law as arising from patterns of spatial aggregation. He pointed out that when b < 1, the implied spatial distribution of population abundance was uniform, since all populations would have similar abundances. The condition b \u00bc 1 was reminiscent of a Poisson, or 'random' spatial process. When b > 1, the implication was that populations were clumped, with large differences among samples, depending on whether they were obtained within or outside an aggregated population. Furthermore, the magnitude of b was thought to measure the degree of aggregation, with higher values of b representing more highly aggregated populations.\nThe model we have presented suggests an interesting demographic interpretation to Taylor's (1961) original idea. Our model under Taylor's (1961) interpretation implies that geographical populations that are more uniform spatially have a positive relationship between maximum growth and density dependence. In such populations, regions with high abundance have local populations that are more resilient, but have higher intensities of intraspecific competition. Conversely, regions with low abundance have populations with low resiliency and low intraspecific competition. In geographical populations that show relatively moderate degrees of aggregation (1 < b < 2), intraspecific competition is lowest in the most resilient local populations and highest in the least resilient local populations. In highly aggregated geographical populations (b \u00bc 2 and b > 2), differences in resiliency among local populations are minor. Local populations vary primarily in the intensity of intraspecific competition."}, {"section_title": "E M P I R I C A L A S S E S S M E N T O F T H E M O D E L", "text": "The critical parameter in the analysis described above is the exponent of the mean-variance scaling relationship. What values does this parameter take on in most populations of organisms? To answer this question, we examined a large compilation of mean-variance scaling relationships for birds, moths, and aphids carried out in England under the direction of L.R. Taylor (Taylor 1961; Taylor & Woiwod 1982) . We plotted histograms of these data to examine variation in the scaling exponent. We refer the reader to Taylor & Woiwod 1982 , for details on the methods used to collect population data and calculate exponents.\nIn addition, data on populations of 42 passerine bird species were obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). The BBS is a data base consisting of yearly censuses of bird populations conducted during June at approximately 4000 routes across North America. Each route consists of a 40-km transect that follows minor paved and unpaved roads. An observer travels by car along each transect and stops every 0.8 km to count all birds detected within a 0.4-km radius during a 3 minute period. There is a significant amount of observer variability in the BBS (Link et al. 1994; Maurer 1994; Link & Sauer 1997 as well as other potential sources of error. We subsume these errors in our analyses under a single, general error term.\nFor each of the 42 species, we calculated averages and variances on all BBS routes that had been censused at least 20 times between 1966 and 1994. A number of species that were randomly selected were rejected because the number of sites censused a sufficient number of times was deemed too small (< 25). Number of censuses of appropriate length varied among species from 58 to 889 (median \u00bc 319). It is unclear whether a zero count on a BBS route means that there were no populations of the species along that route or that the species was simply too rare along the route to detect (McArdle et al. 1990; Curnutt et al. 1996) . We used four methods to estimate means and variances to account for this. First, we assigned a zero count a value of zero in our calculations of means and variances using standard estimators. Second, we included only nonzero counts in standard estimators. Third, we used a maximum likelihood estimator assuming data came from a censored lognormal distribution with a detection threshold of one individual. Lastly, we used the same maximum likelihood estimator assuming a censored gamma distribution for counts. The first, third and fourth estimators gave similar results, and we report analyses using the first method because it had fewer numerical problems in test simulations of data generated by known distributions. Estimates of the scaling exponent (b) were obtained by simple linear regression of the natural logarithm of variance in abundance against the natural logarithm of average abundance for each census for each of the 42 species. R 2 values for these regressions varied from 0.63 to 0.90 with a median of 0.81. Simulations show that measurement error in population size can lead to an underestimate of b (MLT unpublished data), but in general the effect is minor.\nScaling exponents for aphids and moths obtained from Taylor's work suggest that in general the value for b exceeds 1.0 for these taxa (Fig. 2) . Taylor & Woiwod's (1982) data on birds of Britain indicated that some species had exponents below 1.0 (Fig. 3) , but some of these may have been distorted by a systematic bias added by counts of species that regularly had low abundances (Taylor & Woiwod 1982) . In samples taken across the geographical ranges of species in North America, there were no instances where b < 1.0 (Fig. 3) , agreeing with the data on insects from Britain.\nThese data suggest that in general, spatial variation in population regulation across a geographical range follows Population ecology of distributions 227 one of two possible patterns. The first, and most common, pattern is for populations with low maximum growth to have more severe intraspecific competition, whereas populations with high maximum growth have relaxed intraspecific competition. Where in the geographical range are populations with low resiliency and high intraspecific competition located? Such populations tend to be those with low average abundance (i.e. small values of r/u). Low-abundance populations tend to be located closer to the range boundary on average than high-abundance populations (see review above). Conversely, high-abundance, more centrally located populations will also be more resilient and less constrained by intraspecific competition. The second pattern, shown by fewer populations in the samples we looked at, is one in which local populations have similar resiliences, but vary primarily in the intensity of intraspecific competition. Highabundance populations will have relaxed intraspecific competition, but low-abundance, more peripherally located populations will experience more intense intraspecific competition."}, {"section_title": "M E C H A N I S M S D E T E R M I N I N G T H E R A N G E B O U N D A R Y", "text": "The model outlined above provides a theoretical description of the population mechanisms that determine the location of the geographical range boundary. These mechanisms appear to involve a combination of low potential to recovery from disturbances (low maximum growth rate) and/or more severe density effects. Note that eqn 5 implies that the magnitude of maximum growth rates and density effects must be considered relative to the size of the random fluctuations experienced by a local population. For example, a population with high maximum growth rate may still be near the range boundary if it exists in a habitat that is highly variable.\nNote that low growth rates and high intraspecific competition imply that a population has a low carrying capacity (recall that k \u00bc r/u). Most models of stochastic extinction predict that populations with low resiliency (low r) and low carrying capacities (high u) that experience high degrees of environmental stochasticity (high r 2 ) are more likely to go extinct than those that are resilient, have high carrying capacity, and experience low environmental stochasticity (MacArthur & Wilson 1967; Leigh 1981; Goodman 1987 ). This suggests that populations near the edge of a species' geographical range boundary are more likely to go extinct than populations further from the edge.\nThe proximate mechanisms that determine the edge of a range may vary from one place to the next. For example, at one location along the range boundary, population stability may be low because of high variability in resources, resulting in a high degree of stochastic variation experienced by the population. In another part of the range, resources may be more stable, but very scarce, leading to either low resiliency (low per capita maximum growth rate), high intraspecific competition (intense density dependence), or some combination of both. The important point here is to realize that even though researchers may not be able to identify specific mechanisms that determine the existence of the range boundary at all locations, the myriad of specific factors determining range boundaries result in relatively few population processes, which can be empirically described by r, u, and r 2 . These parameters can be estimated without knowledge regarding the particular causes that determine their values."}, {"section_title": "D I S C U S S I O N", "text": "We have shown that a reasonable theory can be constructed to describe spatial variation in abundance across the Moths -Britain Aphids -Britain Figure 2 Frequency distributions of Taylor exponents for two arthropod taxa in Great Britain (Taylor & Woiwod 1982) .\ngeographical range of a species by developing complementary descriptions of the geographical range obtained from different spatial scales. This theory predicts that spatial variation in mechanisms of population change can be inferred from the scaling relationship between the temporal means and variances of local populations. The scaling relationship defines three distinct modes of spatial variation in population mechanisms. The first mode postulates a positive relationship between resiliency and the intensity of intraspecific competition. The second mode postulates a negative relationship between these mechanisms. The third mode postulates that populations vary primarily in the intensity of intraspecific competition. A survey of scaling relationships obtained across the geographical ranges of moths, aphids, and birds in Great Britain and the United States suggests that the second mode is by far the most common pattern of spatial variation in population mechanisms.\nThe theory outlined here predicts that habitat-specific patterns of demography across the geographical range result in a stochastically fluctuating geographical range boundary determined by local extinctions and recolonizations. These predictions should be empirically testable by studying geographical variation in demography across a species' geographical range. The proximate mechanisms that determine the local pattern of temporal fluctuations in abundance of individual populations may vary considerably from one geographical location to the next. Thus, examining demographic responses to single environmental factors (say, temperature) may provide only a partial explanation for locations of geographical range boundaries. For example, Root (1988a,b; 1989) showed that the northern boundaries of wintering ranges of some species of North American birds were correlated with winter isotherms. Her explanation, however, does not apply to the southern range boundaries for those species. Likewise, with the exception of cases where a species is so specialized that it indeed reacts to a single environmental factor across its entire geographical range, the ranges of most species will be determined by a complicated set of relationships between spatial variation in the environment and habitat-specific demographics. Thus, it may be inappropriate to test the model described above using a series of populations arrayed along a single environmental gradient.\nGiven the widespread existence of a variance-mean scaling relationship among very different taxa, it is unclear whether or not there is a general mechanism, common among all biological populations, that might generate such relationships. Kendal (1992) suggested that the tendency of organisms to form aggregations could be thought of as a special case of diffusion-limited aggregation. In such processes, aggregations are formed by cohesive interactions among randomly moving entities. The signature of such aggregations is a characteristic variance to mean scaling law. That is, the variance in the size of aggregations is a power function of the mean. The parameter b is a fractal dimension that describes the spatial complexity that results from the aggregation process. Kendal (1992 : 67) concluded that ''if a fractal geometry exists in the geographical distribution of a population then the variance to mean power law should be expected to apply''.\nThe question is, then, is there a stochastic process similar to diffusion-limited aggregation that might give rise to a fractal pattern in abundance of a species across its geographical range? The answer is that at present, we have no formal diffusion-based, spatially explicit population models that predict such a fractal pattern (Maurer 1994) . Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to expect that such models might exist Kendal 1992; Ritchie 1997; Pulliam 2000) . Organisms may be aggregated across several spatial scales by a combination of the need to aggregate to reproduce, the ecological limitations inherent in their fundamental niches, and by the nonrandom distribution of ecological conditions imposed by a heterogeneous environment. Realistic models of the spatially explicit population processes underlying geographical distributions may be unwieldy, but not unimaginable. Another perspective is that the mean-variance scaling law is implicit in local stochastic density-dependent population dynamics. From this viewpoint, the geographical pattern emerges because of spatial variation in habitat quality. Preliminary simulations indicate that mean-variance scaling can indeed be generated by local stochastic population dynamics coupled with spatial variation in population parameters in the absence of demographically significant migration (G. M. Nesslage, personal communication).\nThe model outlined above has important implications for conservation. Recent documentation of the location of relic populations of threatened and endangered species typically show that remaining populations tend to be at the periphery of the former geographical range (Lomolino & Channell 1995; Channell & Lomolino 2000a,b) . Our model suggests two important insights about the demographic processes that may have lead to range collapse: (1) the location of relic populations at the periphery of the range implies that the parts of the geographical range of the species where population abundance was highest (i.e. high resiliency and high carrying capacity) were somehow compromised by land cover changes induced by human activities, leading to a general collapse of populations across the range; and (2) our model predicts that many relic populations may be particularly sensitive to further environmental changes, since they are likely to have relatively low resilience and low carrying capacity.\nAnother important conservation application of our model is in understanding the population dynamics that underlie range expansion. Invasive species appear to spread at different rates in different parts of the continent they are invading. Those regions that provide the best habitat for the invasive species after the invasion is complete are the same regions where the spread was most rapid (Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997; Maurer et al. 2001) . Our model suggests that during an invasion, in regions where ecological conditions exist that will lead to high maximum per capita rates of increase and low density dependence, population growth will be rapid and available habitat will saturate quickly, leading to rapid colonization of nearby sites. When the invasion stalls, populations will have low per capita growth rates and high intensities intraspecific competition."}, {"section_title": "C O N C L U S I O N S", "text": "Geographical ranges of species are complex phenomena that cannot be completely described. However, using the principle of complementarity, where different descriptions of the same complex phenomenon are assumed to be equivalent, a simplified description of the population mechanics underlying geographical range dynamics is obtained that provides insight into why a geographical range is structured the way it is. This description generates testable predictions about spatial variation in population processes than can be investigated by intensive studies of local populations in different locations across the range.\nComplementarity is an underused principle in ecological theory. Processes that are thought to operate on multiple spatial or temporal scales can be viewed from different perspectives. If models can be developed that produce descriptions of the same process, but from different perspectives, the resulting equivalence between perspectives can generate new theoretical models. Future development of ecological theory for complex systems like geographical ranges may be profitably developed from appropriately scaled models."}]
