Therefore, even when existing studies were not sufficient to precisely estimate values for the five products selected, additional investigations or analyses were beyond the scope of our study."}, {"section_title": "Product quality versus value:", "text": "The study team assumed a direct correspondence between product quality and value. For example, if the loss of data from the NOAA fleet was expected to reduce the quality of a product by 5 percent, a corresponding 5 percent decline in value to users was assumed. In some use cases, however, the impact of a 5 percent degradation in product quality might be negligible whereas, in other cases, the product might be rendered useless. The simplifying assumption used in this study is reasonable but has not been verified by independent studies. Comparability of product value estimates: The summary value estimates presented in the Societal Benefit report are all reported in 2016 dollars. However, because different methods were used to derive these estimates, combining the results may present challenges. For example, a value estimate derived from market values (sea level rise viewer) is perhaps not comparable to a value estimate derived via contingent valuation (corals). Readers of the final report are advised to consider these factors before using or referencing the study results."}, {"section_title": "Comparable recent value estimates", "text": "In 2012, NOAA conducted an internal, preliminary assessment of the economic benefits of the NOAA fleet. Although the 2012 study remains unpublished, there are some interesting and useful intersections with the Societal Benefit Study that highlight the challenges of estimating economic value. This is most usefully revealed by contrasting the methods and results for two products or themes where the studies overlapped -Nautical Charting Products and National Marine Sanctuaries Condition Reports. Nautical Chart Products . NOAA's 2012 study estimated that the NOAA fleet accounts for $12 million annually to the overall value of nautical charts, compared to a lower-bound estimate of $17 million annually in the Societal Benefit Study. Although the results are similar, the methods used to generate these two estimates vary significantly. The 2012 study is based on estimates of the increased loadings of commercial vessels, reduced number of groundings of commercial and recreational vessels, and reduced loss of life associated with the use of nautical charts. The Societal Benefit Study estimate is based on surveys that assessed the willingness of nautical chart users to pay for improved nautical charting. While the Societal Benefit Study estimate is larger, it also likely understates the full value of nautical charts because, as stated above, (a) it assesses the only the marginal value of improved nautical charts and not their full value, and (b) some users were not included in the results, notably commercial fishermen and military users. National Marine Sanctuaries Conditions Reports. NOAA's 2012 study estimates that the NOAA fleet contributes $10 million annually to the value of products and services developed by the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries that manages the sanctuary sites (though not specifically the Conditions Reports), compared to a lower-bound estimate of $605 million annually in the Societal Benefit Study for the Conditions Reports. There are several probable reasons why these findings are so different. First, the 2012 study reflects an older estimate of the total value of the economic impact of the National Marine Sanctuaries sites ($4 billion annually) while the Societal Benefit Study reflects the more recent and more commonly cited figure of $8 billion annually. However, the most important factors may be that (a) differences in estimates of the degree to which economic values from the National Marine Sanctuaries sites are likely to be eroded without the products and services provided by ONMS, and (b) the degree to which these products and services depend on the NOAA fleet. The value estimates could certainly be improved by a closer investigation of these two factors. Interestingly, NOAA's 2012 study also recommended that future studies of the economic value of the NOAA Fleet should employ a value or logic chain relationship between products and users -the method used to underpin the Societal Benefit Study -to ensure more accurate value estimates."}, {"section_title": "In Summary", "text": "The table below contrasts the analysis methods and underlying basis of the value estimates for each of the products evaluated in the Societal Benefit Study.

Table 3 in main report for descriptions of the value chains) vi There may, however, be opportunities for NOAA to make greater use of contract vessels during periods when those vessels have greater availability (i.e., outside of the summer months).\nThis section contains a summary of the value chain descriptions that the project team developed for 12 NOAA products and services that depend on data collected from NOAA ships and/or observing networks that the ships maintain. For each value chain, we describe: \uf0b7 How data from the fleet feed into the product \uf0b7 Segments of society that use the product \uf0b7 How users make decisions based on the information the product provides \uf0b7 The outcomes or values resulting from those decisions. These decision outcomes or values ultimately represent the benefits that these products provide to society. To develop the value chains, we conducted in-depth interviews with NOAA subject matter experts, who provided information on how data from the NOAA Fleet informs the product, the users of the product, and the product's value to society. We also used information from TPIO's NOSIA-II Value Tree to better understand how data from the fleet supports each product. NOSIA-II is a hierarchical model that documents the relationship between data sources, mission requirements, and respective mission service impacts. Based on a survey of more than 500 NOAA subject matter experts, NOSIA-II allows NOAA to understand the impact of single or multiple observing systems on the key products and services it supports. The model is organized based on NOAA's Strategic Plan Goals and 26 associated mission service areas. The following sections provide a summary of the value chains for each of the 12 products, including a brief description of the product, key users, and the societal benefits associated with the product (summarized in Table 3). Appendix A contains more detailed value chain descriptions, as well as diagrams that trace the flow of data from the NOAA Fleet through to the product's value. Dependency on NOAA Fleet: The Report Cards and underlying indicators require the collection of data by multiple observation systems over a wide geographic region. The stratified random sampling design that NCRMP uses to collect data for the Status and Trends Report Cards is heavily reliant on benthic and other habitat mapping surveys, performed in part by NOAA projects. Ocean profile data collected during NOAA ship marine biological surveys also feed into the report card's climate indicators."}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned", "text": "This study provides NOAA with a systematic process for assessing the value of individual observing systems and data streams through the development of value chains for the products and services that depend on them. NOAA can use the general approach to assess the value of Fleet-dependent products and/or additional observing systems (e.g., OMAO aircraft). While this study represents a significant first step in demonstrating the value of the NOAA Fleet, it is limited in scope. Under this contract the project team was only able to develop value chains for 12 Fleet-dependent products, and quantify the value of 5 products. In addition, we were not able to conduct original valuation analyses; our monetary estimates of value therefore depend on existing studies and estimates from the literature, which are also subject to limitations and caveats. We were also only able to conduct a limited number of interviews, which we conducted with product experts from within NOAA. In addition, throughout the study we learned that it is difficult to isolate the effect of individual data streams on the performance of a given product, given the interdependency of data that most products rely on. Thus, it is difficult to attribute an exact percentage of product value to the NOAA Fleet. We have attempted to reflect this uncertainty by providing a reasonable range of values using Fleet data-dependency estimates provided by TPIO and the subject matter experts. The data used as inputs to this analysis represent the best available information. However, the studies upon which the quantifications are based were often few in number and, as with any study, limited in their accuracy, completeness, and broader applicability. Estimates of the contribution of the NOAA fleet to final products and services are based on extensive research and analysis by NOAA's Technology, Planning, and Integration for Observation office (TPIO) but this work has its own limitations and the results have not been independently verified (as with a \"denial of data\" analysis). In short, the resulting values represent an empirical first step in the direction of developing more accurate and complete estimates of the value of NOAA products and services and the share of that value attributable to the NOAA fleet. A more scientifically rigorous analysis would require additional primary data collection and analysis which, if performed comprehensively, would be cost-prohibitive. This study does establish a scientifically sound process for assessing the societal benefits of the NOAA fleet and identifies critical information requirements that should be used to inform future research agendas. Despite these challenges, which are inherent in most economic analyses, our use of published studies and extensive interviews with subject matter experts established a highly credible range of value estimates. We are confident that these estimates establish the significant value of the fleet's contributions and provide materially relevant data to support future decisions at NOAA regarding the fleet. We also learned that a number of factors complicate comparing the cost-effectiveness of contract vessels to NOAA's fleet. When using contract vessels, contract costs alone may not account for the full cost to NOAA of completing a given mission. Furthermore, a day at sea aboard a contract vessel is not necessarily equal to a day at sea aboard a NOAA vessel. NOAA ships often collect multiple data streams and/or conduct multiple missions simultaneously. Although some contract vessels have similar multi-data stream/multi-mission capabilities, many such vessels are better suited for individual projects and a more limited set of data. These \"economies of scope\" mean that multiple contract vessels can sometimes be required to replace the output of a NOAA vessel. NOAA ships also have greater endurance than many smaller contract vessels. Therefore, they can remain at sea for the duration of long projects without returning to port. In addition, NOAA ships often can be scheduled and positioned to transition directly from one project to the next without significant travel time. Therefore, the use of contract vessels can entail more transit days (i.e., at the start and finish of the discrete projects for which they are hired and, in some cases, to resupply during longer projects). vii Given these factors, it is not appropriate to compare aggregate data on the cost of contract vessels to the cost of using the NOAA fleet. Instead, the comparison must account for mission-specific details. The case study approach we used here attempts to account for these factors and provide a one-to-one comparison of contract vessel costs to NOAA fleet costs."}, {"section_title": "Recommended Next Steps", "text": "There are several ways that NOAA could further refine the value chain and monetary value estimates from this study.

To maintain these important societal benefits, and meet growing demands for environmental data collection, NOAA will need to make significant investments in its fleet resources. To inform its investment decisions, NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) initiated the NOAA Fleet Societal Benefit Study. The purpose of this study is to identify and monetize the benefits associated with a subset of key NOAA products and services that are dependent on the NOAA Fleet, and assess the cost-effectiveness of using contract vessels as a substitute for NOAA's ships for some data collection efforts. This report provides an overview and summary of key findings from the NOAA Fleet Societal Benefit Study, which Abt Associates and Corona Environmental Consulting (Corona) conducted under Abt Associate's prime contract with NOAA's Office for Coastal Management (BPA EA-133C-14-BA-0039), Task Order C-007."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "NOAA is responsible for collecting, sharing, and utilizing scientific information to help the U.S. understand, manage, and protect the 3.4 million square nautical miles of ocean in our Exclusive Economic Zone, as well as to understand and predict changes in weather, climate, oceans, and coasts. This mission requires extensive data collection capabilities, which OMAO supports. OMAO maintains and operates a fleet of vessels and aircraft that serve as the mobile platforms for NOAA's data collection infrastructure. NOAA also commissions contract vessels and aircraft for some types data collection, when availability coincides with data collection needs. The NOAA Fleet, managed by OMAO and operated by NOAA Corps, includes 16 research and survey ships, ranging from large oceanographic research vessels capable of exploring the world's deepest oceans to smaller ships responsible for charting the nation's coastal waters (Table 1). 1 NOAA ships are stationed in homeports around the U.S. and operate across the Exclusive Economic Zone and internationally; they are specially equipped and designed to support the agency's programs. Many of the ships fulfill multiple missions, enabling the collection of a wide variety of atmospheric, fisheries, hydrographic, and oceanographic data in support of NOAA's long-term goals and mission service areas ( Figure  1). NOAA line offices, other U.S. government agencies, communities, and businesses around the nation rely on this information to keep U.S. ports open to maritime commerce, understand changes to the planet, monitor the health of fish stocks, and make important economic and policy decisions. 2 Per NOAA's Office of Technology Planning and Integration for Observation (TPIO), data collected from NOAA ships, and/or the operational platforms that the ships maintain, support the development of 638 NOAA products and services across NOAA's 26 mission service areas. As described in the 2016 NOAA Fleet Plan, these products and services are vital to the economy and health of the nation. For example, the National Ocean Service relies on fleet charting and hydrographic survey activities to map and develop nautical charts, which in turn facilitate safe and efficient marine navigation and support the $4.6 trillion in economic activity generated by U.S. seaports each year. Accurate mapping of coastal areas also informs tsunami inundation modeling and storm surge predictions, which are critical for urban planning and emergency management. Physical, chemical, and biological observations from fleet vessels allow NOAA to effectively manage and protect key species and resources, including National Marine Sanctuaries, which generate nearly $8 billion in local economies each year. 3 These types of observations also serve as the basis for fisheries stock assessments, which allow fishery managers to set accurate catch limits for the $54 billion domestic fish harvest, 5 directly affecting the $153 billion U.S. commercial fishing industry. 6 In addition, NOAA ships and buoy systems collect oceanographic monitoring data that directly feed weather models, forecasts, and oceanographic circulation models. Without this data, weather and climate forecasts would be less accurate, resulting in adverse impacts related to severe storm and emergency planning, coastal management, and planning for the U.S. agricultural industry, which supported $992 billion of economic activity in 2015. 7 The NOAA Fleet also serve as an important component of the nation's ocean-related emergency and disaster response network. Fleet emergency response services include surveying commercial ports following hurricanes and major storms to ensure their channels are free from debris and other navigational hazards. These surveys must be conducted before affected ports can be re-opened. The ability of NOAA vessels to immediately provide these surveys can significantly reduce the amount of time ports remain closed, allowing 4 NOAA Ship Reuben Lasker did not start operations until 2014 5   for the delivery of emergency supplies and important economic activity to resume. Additional emergency response activities include locating and mapping debris fields in the ocean for aviation disasters, conducting scientific surveys in response to major oil and chemical spills, and surveying our nation's ports and waterways in response to national security threats. NOAA ships are also often called upon to provide routine search, rescue, and evacuation services. While the NOAA Fleet and associated data collection activities provide important benefits to society and across economic sectors, OMAO faces several challenges in managing the fleet, including expanding/changing mission requirements, aging ships, evolving technologies, and limited resources available for maintenance and recapitalization. 8 To address these challenges, NOAA desires to understand how to optimize the value of its marine fleet by maximizing the socioeconomic benefits derived from fleet data collection activities and leveraging the use of contract vessels, when appropriate. Accordingly, NOAA retained Abt Associates to 1) estimate the societal benefits of a subset of fleet-dependent NOAA products and services, and 2) assess the cost-effectiveness of using contract vessels to complement the NOAA Fleet's data collection efforts."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Research Approach", "text": "To demonstrate the societal benefits associated with fleet data collection activities, the project team focused on 12 of the 638 NOAA products and services that the NOAA Fleet supports.

For example, NOAA vessels are the only ships that can cover the long distances and access the remote locations associated with the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program.\nMonetary Value of the Coral Reefs in the U.S.: Coral reefs provide the U.S. with valuable goods and services including food, coastal protection, and opportunity for recreational activities. These goods and services in turn provide different types of economic benefits, including: recreational use values and associated tourism benefits; nonuse values, such as willingness-to-pay for the existence of coral reefs; and amenity values, which can be measured by increases in value of properties located near coral reefs. 36,37 Brander and van Beukering (2013) summarized studies of the benefits of coral reefs for U.S. states and territories with coral reef areas, including American Samoa, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the North Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 38 Across all locations and benefit categories, the authors estimated the total economic value of coral reefs in the U.S. to be approximately $3.954 billion per year (2016 USD, Table 5).

Low-lying coastal areas are especially vulnerable to flooding, erosion, habitat loss, and seawater intrusion. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer (SLR Viewer) is a web-based map viewing tool that provides coastal managers, community planners, and other users with visuals, corresponding data, and explanatory information concerning sea level rise inundation, flood frequency, marsh impacts, and socioeconomics. This information allows users to identify potential community vulnerabilities and assess appropriate adaptation options and strategies. As of 2015, the SLR viewer covers all coastal territory in the U.S. except Alaska. NOAA's Office for Coastal Management (OCM) develops and updates/maintains the SLR Viewer. Dependency on NOAA Fleet: NOAA ships contribute to the SLR Viewer through the collection of hydrographic and geospatial data for US coastal areas (note that the Nautical Charts product described in Section 2.3 and the Tsunami Inundation Forecast Model product described in Section 2.7 also depend on hydrographic survey data provided by the NOAA Fleet). VDatum, a separate software tool developed by multiple NOAA line offices, combines the data that the NOAA Fleet collects into bathymetric-topographic Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for specific areas. OCM incorporates these DEMs, as well as LIDAR 12 and Conditioned DEMs (DEMs conditioned to a higher specification), tide gauge observations, coastal flooding thresholds, and other jointly developed inputs, into the SLR Viewer. OCM updates the SLR Viewer as new data inputs as become available. Several other federal agencies and educational institutions contribute data to the SLR viewer. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey provides base elevation data for Louisiana, and the NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services conduct analyses that support tool's flood frequency capabilities. The University of Hawaii performed mapping for several outlying coastal territories, and the University of South Carolina Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute provides Social Vulnerability Index data. Users: Primary users of the SLR viewer include coastal planners, floodplain managers, municipal representatives, and scientists and engineers interested in assessing community-level vulnerability and planning for sea level rise and coastal flooding. Several U.S. communities have already incorporated the SLR Viewer or underlying data into their adaptation planning. For example, beginning in 2013, the City of Charleston, South Carolina, analyzed sea level rise impacts on the city. As part of this process, OCM demonstrated sea level rise effects on streets, landmarks, and infrastructure to city planners and engineers using the SLR viewer. The City subsequently developed a Sea Level Rise strategy, and has received a coastal resilience grant to implement the strategy. In another case, the City of New York incorporated data from the SLR viewer into a post-Hurricane Sandy comprehensive resilience plan. Other users include universities, scientific and engineering groups, private entities, and NGOs who use the viewer and data for research.\nValue of Potential Damages in the U.S. From Sea Level Rise: Global sea levels have risen by 8 inches since 1880, and are projected to rise 2 to 6 or more feet by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario modeled. 39 A 2014 study by the U.S. EPA estimates that sea level rise impacts from inundation of coastal property and from storm surge that is amplified by sea level rise will total $5 trillion for the coterminous U.S. by the year 2100 (2014 USD). Adaptation measures can reduce this impact. For example, the study estimates that protective coastal measures such as armoring shorelines could reduce the impacts associated with sea level rise to $810 billion through 2100. This includes the value of abandoned property, residual storm damages, and costs of protective adaptation measures. Results of the study also indicate that mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could further reduce total costs to approximately $790 billion, if these measures are adopted. 40 The Value of the Sea Level Rise Viewer and NOAA Fleet Contribution. The EPA study of sea level rise impacts estimates that implementing effective adaptation options will reduce the impacts/costs of sea level rise from $5 trillion to $810 billion by 2100 (2014 USD), 41 a savings of $4.19 trillion, including the cost of adaptation measures. We divide this value over 86 years from 2014 to 2100 to get an annual value of $48.7 billion (2014 USD). Escalating this to 2016 USD, total annual avoided costs associated with adaptation measures amounts to $49.4 billion. To estimate the value of the SLR Viewer, we need to account for how it contributes to the reduction in avoided costs associated with adaptation planning and implementation. The SLR viewer is a mapping product that decision makers can use as a first step in assessing vulnerability and deciding on actions to mitigate impacts. Based on input from subject matter experts and our understanding of the product, we use 3% as a rough value representing the SLR Viewer's contribution to the overall value of adaptation and associated avoided sea level rise impacts. 42 In addition, data from the NOSIA-II model indicates that approximately 2% of the benefits associated with the SLR Viewer can be attributed to the NOAA Fleet. On the other hand, NOAA subject matter experts estimate that 50% of the data used in the viewer comes from Vertical Datum Transformation (VDATUM), and that approximately 75% of the data in VDATUM comes from NOAA ships. Therefore, 37.5% of the value of the SLR Viewer can be attributed to NOAA ships (50% of total data from VDATUM * 75% ships share of VDATUM). For estimation purposes, we use the 2% TPIO estimate as the low end of the range and 37.5% as the upper end of the range of the percent of value from the SLR Viewer attributable to NOAA ships. This yields an annual benefit estimate for the NOAA Fleet of approximately $30.0 million to $556 million (2016 USD, Table 7).

Zillow, using its property value database and NOAA's SLR maps, estimates that approximately 1.9 million homes worth $882 billion are at risk of being lost due to flooding nationally by 2100. 13 And, the U.S. EPA estimates that national costs of property abandonment and protective adaptation actions (plus some additional costs) associated with sea level rise and storm surge will amount to $5 trillion cumulatively over time through 2100 (discounted at 3%). 14\nSeveral studies have shown that predicting the life cycle and strength of a Pacific warm or cold episode is critical in helping farmers and other types of businesses plan for, avoid or mitigate potential losses. For example, Adams et al. (1995) found that improving ENSO forecasts by 33% would result in $151 million (2016 USD) per year in economic benefits for the agricultural sector in the southeast U.S., while a 100% accurate forecast would yield $228 million (2016 USD). At the time the study was conducted, these estimates represented about 2 to 3 percent of farmgate value of total crop production for the southeast region. 16 ENSO-related forecasts of the potential for extreme climate episodes like floods and droughts can also save the U.S. billions of dollars in damage costs. For example, national and state emergency managers can use CPC forecasts to better prepare for predicted events, which can reduce response costs. Individual households and businesses can also use CPC Outlooks to make appropriate preparatory decisions, resulting in avoided damage costs.\nThe National Marine Sanctuaries Condition Reports directly contribute to regulations, policies, and education programs related to marine sanctuaries, which in turn helps to protect the important benefits the sanctuaries provide. National Marine Sanctuaries provide a range of benefits, including on-site user benefits (e.g., through recreational activities such as fishing and snorkeling) and benefits accruing to individuals who do not use the marine ecosystem directly but who value their existence. Further, many on-site activities generate income directly to participants and indirectly to coastal economies that service the activities. For example, NOAA research indicates that together, national marine sanctuaries generate approximately $8 billion annually (2015 USD) in local coastal and ocean dependent economies from diverse activities like commercial fishing, research and recreation/tourism-related activities. 17\nReducing the impacts of man-made ocean noise can protect species by allowing natural defense and mating sound cues to operate normally and by permitting normal migratory patterns. Economists and scientists have conducted numerous studies over the past several decades to estimate economic values for similar species protection and rehabilitation. These studies use established survey methods to determine how much people are willing-to-pay for programs that protect specific species. While these programs are not specifically tied to man-made ocean noise, the overall benefits can be similar. These studies 28 have shown that households are willing to pay up to $82 (2016 USD) per household per year or more to benefit charismatic mammal species in US waters (such as right whales), which can add up to a significant value for species preservation and habitat improvement. Society's willingness-to-pay to protect these species represent the value that society places on them.  30   estimated the value of improved hurricane forecast information to oil and natural gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico. They found that existing hurricane forecast information helped to avoid $10 million (2016 USD) per year in unnecessary evacuation costs, and that this value would increase to more than $19 million (2016 USD) per year with a 50% improvement in forecast accuracy. 31 Emmanuel et al. (2012) also found potentially significant savings for the insurance industry associated with improvements in seasonal hurricane forecasts. 32 "}, {"section_title": "Bathymetry/Hydrographic Surveys: Nautical Chart Products", "text": "Product Background: NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Coast Survey (OCS) produces over 1,000 nautical chart products that cover the coasts of U.S. states and territories, as well as the Great Lakes. NOAA is authorized to provide nautical charts and related hydrographic information by the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act of 1947 and the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (and amendments). The charts serve as navigational aids, supporting safe and efficient maritime transportation and commerce. They also provide important information for at-sea engineering, scientific, and commercial activities, coastal zone management and planning, and homeland security efforts along our nations' coasts. Nautical Charts come in two forms, paper and digital. Digital charts are more popular, particularly among commercial mariners. There are two digital formats for electronic charts, Raster Nautical Charts (RNC) and Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC). The RNC is a simple digital image of the paper chart, while the ENC includes much more information that can help warn mariners of dangers ahead and provide other information critical to a safe passage. Dependency on NOAA Fleet: Four ships in the NOAA Fleet are dedicated to hydrographic surveys that provide bathymetry data NOAA uses to develop nautical charts (see Table 1 for a listing of each NOAA vessel and its primary mission). These ship's officers and crew use special technologies to acquire and process data on board. They send the processed data to NOAA hydrographers and cartographers, who compile it into the nation's nautical charts (note that the Sea Level Rise Viewer product described in Section 2.2 and the Tsunami Inundation Forecast Model product described in Section 2.7 also depend on hydrographic survey data provided by the NOAA Fleet). Crew members immediately report any hazardous features found during these surveys that might endanger vessels to NOAA cartographers, who update the corresponding nautical chart right away. The U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center also publishes this information in the appropriate Local Notice to Mariners to ensure that the public is made aware of the change. NOAA also purchases hydrographic survey data and other information for nautical charts from several other sources. In general, it is the intent of NOAA to contract for hydrographic services when qualified commercial sources exist, and when such contracts are the most appropriate and cost effective method of conducting these functions. NOAA procures hydrographic data and services from qualified sources in accordance with its legal authorities, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 541 et seq.), including Title IX where appropriate. Commonly known as the \"Brooks Act\" for Architect/Engineering (A/E) contracts, Title IX is a contract mechanism for use in situations where the professional nature of the services to be procured requires that potential contractors have specialized technical expertise. NOAA obtains approximately half of its hydrographic survey data from hydrographic surveys services contractors and from OCS's Navigation Response Teams. Other significant sources of information include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) surveys of Federal channels and anchorages, and the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Power Squadrons. Users: Federal and international regulations require many vessels to carry nautical charts and related NOAA products. For example, The U.S. Coast Guard requires commercial and light commercial sector vessels that transit the same U.S. waters on each trip (e.g., cruise lines, ferries, tug boats) to carry large-scale, detailed paper charts of the waters in which they operate. Larger vessels regulated under the Safety of Life at Sea convention are required by federal law to use ENCs. Recreational boaters are not required to use NOAA nautical charts; however, they often use mobile chart plotters or GPS mapping applications from third-party software companies that are based on NOAA's nautical charts. Nautical charts are also mandatory for the international shipping industry. As new cargo ships continue to increase in size, they need additional navigational support. Nautical charts are essential to helping ship crews understand water depths and shoreline infrastructure as they enter ports with which they are unfamiliar. NOAA's nautical charts are also the authoritative source for maritime regulation (including accident disputes) and political boundaries (e.g., EEZ). The information contained in NOAA's nautical charts also directly informs several NOAA products and services, as well as products/planning efforts developed by other government agencies and the private sector. This includes products and information related to protected species habitat, placement of marine infrastructure, tsunami inundation modeling, and more. Benefits to Society: By providing the most up to date nautical information, NOAA helps ensure that ships do not navigate blindly and can chart out the safest and most efficient route to their destination. They can also avoid navigational hazards with confidence, which in turn allows them to avoid unnecessary slow-downs. Thus, much of the value of this product can be estimated based on avoided losses from collisions and grounding, injury and possibly death. Because ship time is expensive, nautical charts also provide value in terms of savings in the amount of time spent at sea. Because of unique use of nautical charts in the national and international shipping industry, one way to understand their value is to examine the value of U.S. ports to the national economy. According the American Association of Port Authorities, U.S. seaports support nearly $4.6 trillion in total economic activity, and provide $1.2 billion in personal income and local consumption (2014 USD). 15 This would be significantly lower without up-to-date nautical chart information. In addition, by collecting hydrographic data using NOAA ships, NOAA develops and maintains its hydrographic expertise, which ensures that it remains an informed consumer of the hydrographic data that it purchases. This helps maintain overall data quality and provides benefit to all products that depend on hydrographic data for which NOAA is responsible.\nValue Estimates for Nautical Chart Products: NOAA's nautical charts support safe and efficient navigation at our nation's ports and throughout U.S. waterways. Nautical charts also support improved environmental/ecological planning and analysis, including hazardous material spill response, as well as efforts related to homeland security, protection of the marine environment, and coastal zone management. In 2007, Kite-Powell conducted a study for the NOAA Office of the Coast Survey to estimate the benefits of nautical charts for recreational and commercial vessels, based on a survey asking users what they would be willing-to-pay for 'ideal' nautical charts (i.e., nautical charts containing specific characteristics identified by users). 43 Assuming a minimal difference between the nautical charts that were available at the time and ideal charts, the author estimated that the combined benefits of nautical charts amounted to $47.5 million (2007 USD), 44 including $15.3 million/year in consumer surplus for recreational users, $27.5 million/year in consumer surplus for commercial users, and $2 million/year in producer surplus. We estimate that today, this value amounts to approximately $57.9 million/per year (2016 USD), accounting for the increase in foreign flag ships visiting U.S. ports between 2007 and 2016. 45 While this study provides an order of magnitude estimate of the value of nautical charts, the authors acknowledge that it serves as a lower bound estimate, largely because the study did not include military and other federal users, commercial fishing vessels, or marine resource managers, among others. In addition, since the study was conducted in 2007, digital nautical charts have become even more popular, now allowing for weekly updates that provide additional value to users. 46 In a more recent study, NOAA (2013) evaluated the benefits associated with the Physical Oceanographic Real Time System (PORTS), a decision support tool that combines nautical charts and other data critical for navigation (e.g., information on water levels, currents, waves, water temperature, bridge heights, winds, visibility, atmospheric pressure, and air temperature) to provide mariners with accurate and reliable real-time information about environmental conditions in seaports. This \"coastal intelligence\" helps mariners make better safety and economic decisions. PORTS was first introduced in Tampa Bay in 1991 and as of 2013, was available at 58 of the nation's 175 major seaports (which account for 75% of the total tonnage that passes through U.S. seaports). NOAA estimates that the value of PORTS amounts to more than $238 million per year at the 58 major seaports where it is available, in terms of reduced marine accidents, increased marine transportation efficiency (including increased cargo capacity and reduced transit delays), and oil spill reduction and containment benefits ( Table 8). Value of Nautical Chart Products and NOAA Fleet Contribution. While the NOAA PORTS 2013 study included benefits associated with the entire PORTS system and associated data inputs, PORTS is heavily reliant on nautical charts. For this analysis, we assumed that 50%, or $119.4 million (2016 USD), of the $238.6 million value of PORTS can be attributed nautical charts; we used this estimate as an upper bound value for the benefits of nautical charts for marine transportation. As a lower end of the range, we used the willingness-to-pay estimate of $57.9 million per year. Based on information from TPIO and NOAA subject matter experts, approximately 30% (TPIO estimate) to 40% (subject matter expert estimate) of the value of nautical charts can be attributed to the NOAA Fleet. Thus, the annual value of the NOAA Fleet contribution to nautical charts amounts to between $17.4 million and $47.8 million per year (Table 9). While we provide a range of estimates, we believe they both represent a lower bound for several reasons. First, they reflect benefits associated with marine transportation only; they do not reflect the other benefits and uses of nautical charts, such as those related to coastal zone management, homeland security, and ecological management. In 29 addition, the value of PORTS focuses on 58 of the nation's major seaportsit does not capture benefits associated with nautical charts at the remaining 117 major ports, or elsewhere within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.

El Nino describes a year in which sea-surface temperatures are above the long-term average, while La Nina describes a year in which sea-surface temperatures are cooler than average. During El Nino and La Nina years, changes in Pacific Ocean temperatures affect seasonal tropical rainfall patterns from Indonesia to the west coast of South America. These changes in tropical rainfall affect weather patterns throughout the world, including the frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other weather-related events, as well as temperature and precipitation. To help the public and private sector better prepare for ENSO-related conditions in each season, NOAA National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) creates and disseminates the ENSO Outlook. The ENSO Outlook describes the status of El Nino and La Nina conditions. CPC uses the ENSO Outlook and other tools to inform seasonal temperature and precipitation predictions for the U.S."}, {"section_title": "Dependency on NOAA Fleet:", "text": "One of the main inputs to the ENSO Outlook is data from the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) array. The TAO array consists of 70 buoys moored in the Pacific Ocean that collect oceanographic and meteorological data. The NOAA Fleet maintains the TAO array including the solar panels and radios needed for the TAO buoys to transmit the data from these moorings electronically through satellites. Basic measurements on TAO moorings include wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, salinity profiles, sea surface temperature, and subsurface temperatures. Ocean profile information, which is collected directly from NOAA vessels, is assimilated into NWS models that are also used to inform the ENSO Outlook. The ENSO Outlook also depends on data from the ARGO array, a global array of 3,800 free-drifting profiling floats that provides data on ocean subsurface temperatures, salinity, and velocity. These floats are deployed by the NOAA Fleet (the Hurricane Outlook product is also dependent on the TAO and ARGO arrayssee Section 2.11) In addition to fleetdependent data, the ENSO Outlook relies on a variety of in-situ and satellite data to develop prediction products. There are also many private sector users of CPC outlooks that use the ENSO outlook as a prediction tool. These include agriculture, retail, energy, fisheries, and outdoor recreation/tourism. For example, CPC outlooks can inform farmers' decisions on which crops to plant and when to plant them. Private retailers or grocery chains can use the data make decisions about quantities of seasonal items to stock. Individual households also use CPC products to make appropriate preparatory decisions (e.g., undertake maintenance to prepare for anticipated winter storms)."}, {"section_title": "Ecosystem Management: National Marine Sanctuary Conditions Reports", "text": "Product Background: NOAA manages 13 National Marine Sanctuaries and two national marine monuments. Together, these protected marine ecosystems encompass more than 600,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters. The sanctuaries support endangered species and a variety of habitats ranging from coral reefs, to deep-sea canyons, to underwater archeological sites. National Marine Sanctuary Condition Reports serve as an important tool for managing and protecting the resources within marine sanctuaries from outside pressures. The Condition Reports help managers determine if they are achieving their resource protection and improvement goals, and inform future management plans for the sanctuary. The reports are updated every five years to examine trends, identify how the status of various resources has changed, and establish management responses. Dependency on NOAA Fleet: The NOAA Fleet provides key data that supports many conclusions in the Condition Reports. For example, NOAA vessels collect data through seafloor mapping surveys that characterize sanctuary habitat. They also collect data through observation stations and acoustic surveys on fish and marine mammal species diversity, abundance, and distribution. NOAA weather buoys, many of which are serviced by the NOAA Fleet, also serve as a source of oceanographic data for the Condition Reports of each sanctuary. While most sanctuaries have access to on-site vessels, they serve different roles than the NOAA Fleet. NOAA vessels can be critical for gathering data in seasons and locations where conditions are too harsh for the operation of smaller vessels (i.e. they can handle weather and sea states during which small craft would be limited under a small craft advisory). NOAA vessels also have sufficient crew to be able to conduct operations 24 hours per day, and can maintain operations for longer periods. This allows sanctuary staff to spend more days at sea, and reach deeper parts of the sanctuary that are not accessible using the sanctuary vessel because of the distance from ports."}, {"section_title": "Fisheries Management: Fisheries Stock Assessment", "text": "Product Background: NOAA conducts stock assessments to help manage commercial and recreational fish species. A stock assessment involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting population information to determine changes in the abundance of fishery stocks and, to the extent possible, predict future trends in stock abundance. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) manages roughly 475 fish stocks (the number has varied as new stocks are added), with data and resources to assess approximately 200 stocks each year. NOAA fisheries managers primarily use NOAA stock assessments to set catch limits and to set and enforce other regulations that prevent overfishing and provide optimal yield for commercial fishermen. This includes eight Regional Fishery Management Councils in the U.S., which are required by mandate of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act to set annual catch limits for their region based on best available scientific data. Coastal, state and international organizations also rely on NOAA's stock assessments for non-federal and joint jurisdictional management of fish stocks. Dependency on NOAA Fleet: NOAA uses three primary types of data to develop standard fish stock assessments: abundance, catch, and biological. NMFS uses NOAA Fleet vessels and contract vessels to conduct abundance surveys, and to collect biological data that inform stock the assessments. Catch data typically comes from dockside monitoring, fishermen's logbooks, observations from fishing vessels, and telephone interviews. Collecting abundance and biological fish stock data is a primary purpose for 10 of the 16 ships in NOAA's fleet (see Table 1 for a listing of each NOAA vessel and its primary mission). These ships are equipped with special technologies and experienced crew to support data collection. Users: Fish stock assessments support sustainable fisheries by providing fisheries managers with the information necessary to maximize the long-term sustainable yield of the fishery. For example, by providing historical and current data, stock assessments allow scientists and regional fisheries management councils to compare the status of stocks to established targets, and adjust catch limits and stock targets accordingly. The data allows managers to determine how much catch is sustainable in general. In addition to fisheries management councils, states use stock assessments to manage non-Federal fish stocks. International management entities similarly use the assessments to oversee jointlymanaged stocks that straddle international boundaries. Fish stock assessments also enable regional management councils to develop short-, medium-, and long-term projections of fish population and catch trends. This in turn helps the management councils develop appropriate management plans, and scientists and public agencies to develop research priorities. Stock assessments are also used in other NOAA products such as the Living Oceans report, which informs the public of the status of fish stocks, and FishWatch, a national database that helps inform consumers of the sustainability of seafood. This information allows users to see which fish species are under pressure and adjust their consumption or recreational fishing habits accordingly. Benefits to Society: Effective management of fisheries is essential for the commercial fishing industry as well as the populations that rely on them for food consumption and recreation. U.S. commercial fisheries contribute $153 billion ($54 billion without imports) and 1.4 million jobs to the U.S. economy each year (0.81 million jobs without imports). Recreational saltwater fishing generates $61 billion in sales. 18 NOAA's fish stock assessments provide Regional Fishery Management Councils and other fisheries managers with stock status information so that they can more accurately set catch limits, thereby allowing commercial fisherman to catch more than would otherwise be permitted. As an example, 3.1 billion pounds of Walleye Pollock were landed in 2014, worth $400 million dollars. NOAA estimates that without the accurate stock assessments, regional fishery managers would have to reduce their catch quotas by approximately 10%, a $40 million annual impact. 19 In addition, several studies have shown that U.S. residents are willing to pay to protect many different types of fish species, reflecting the value that society places on them. Fish stock assessments contribute to this value by ensuring sustainable catch limits and preventing overfishing of key species. States and individual communities also use SIMs and TIMS to develop tsunami mitigation plans. For example, planners use information from SIMs and TIMs to assess inundation risks and to make decisions about the location of critical infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, water and wastewater infrastructure, and hospitals, and implement other preparatory actions. There is also a large demand for the data from SIMs and TIMs from U.S. universities. Academics use this data to conduct further research on tsunamis, including examining ways to better predict tsunami threats."}, {"section_title": "Tsunamis: Tsunami Inundation Forecast Models", "text": "Benefit to Society: The Inundation Forecast Models help communities better plan for and respond to potential tsunami events, thereby decreasing the impacts of these events, including number of lives lost, property damage, and other economic losses, such as unnecessary response and evacuation costs avoided by more accurate forecasts. The value of tsunami mitigation and response practices is still relatively unknown. While some studies have calculated the amount of damage caused by tsunamis, it is difficult to quantify the damages that would have occurred if effective evacuations and/or mitigation actions had not been implemented. In addition, the extent of damages depends on the magnitude and location of the tsunami, the amount of time available to implement response actions, the accuracy of the forecast, and the effectiveness of the warning system. However, well-planned response actions and mitigation efforts can significantly reduce the impacts of tsunamis. For example, experts often cite the difference in damages associated with two tsunami events that impacted Crescent City, CA in 1964 and 2011. A tsunami produced by the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake caused over $50 billion in damage and 11 deaths in Crescent City, while a tsunami produced by the 2011 Great Tohoku, Japan, earthquake resulted in $5 billion in damage and no deaths in the same location. These events produced waves with similar amplitudes and duration. The 1964 event did not benefit from having a response plan in place, but the 2011 event did. 20 While this significant decrease in impacts cannot all be attributed to tsunami response, it does speak to the potential benefits associated with tsunami response and mitigation planning, as well as the value of information in models such as SIMs and TIMs. An additional value of the inundation forecast is the information it provides to academic researchers, who are using this data to improve forecasting abilities. The results of this research will improve the effectiveness of response/mitigation actions, further reducing losses and injuries or deaths associated with tsunami events. Aside from data collected by the NOAA Fleet, the HAB-OFS also relies on satellite imagery, other remote sensing data, atmospheric data, field observations, models, public health reports and buoy data to provide large spatial scale and a high frequency of observations required for these forecasts. Much of this data comes from NOAA or other federal sources. However, institutions outside of government are also involved in research that supports HAB forecasts. In the Gulf of Maine, three universities help gather and analyze data. Canadian scientists have also been involved in research for HAB Forecasts in the Bay of Fundy, which borders both Maine and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia."}, {"section_title": "Harmful Algal Blooms: Forecasts and Mitigation Capability, Gulf of Maine", "text": "Users: Local authorities use HAB forecasts to guide management decisions and protect public health. In the Gulf of Maine, state shellfish managers are responsible for sampling and testing different areas of the coast to assess the toxicity levels of the water and the shellfish. These managers use the HAB forecasts to determine where they should sample and perform these tests. If toxic levels of shellfish poison are detected, state shellfish managers must determine how much of the beach or the intertidal and submerged lands will be closed to shell fishing until subsequent tests show that the HAB has dissipated. In Maine, weekly forecasts also help managers carve out exception areas where shell harvesters can work even when much of the coast is closed. The aquaculture industry also uses HAB forecasts to make management decisions. In the event of a HAB, states may monitor the area more frequently and companies may try to harvest their shellfish early.

Dependency on NOAA Fleet: NOAA vessels have unique technologies and experienced crew members that, when combined with their availability across an expansive geographic area, can provide superior, timely, and cost-effective response services in many emergency situations. NOAA Fleet emergency response activities most commonly include hydrographic surveys/data collection and mapping. For example, after hurricanes and large storm eventsat the request of the U.S. Coast Guard, crewmembers on NOAA vessels conduct hydrographic surveys to ensure safe navigation and re-opening of affected ports. NOAA also uses ship hydrographic survey technologies, which include complete seafloor mapping systems, to map debris fields from aviation disasters. This enables the quick recovery of victims and flight recorders. In addition, many of fleet's vessels are equipped with biological, chemical, and acoustic data collection equipment necessary for toxicity and water quality testing. NOAA is frequently called upon to employ these capabilities in response efforts for major oil and chemical spills and hurricanes, where a range of immediate testing is often required. The vast geographic area across which the fleet operates also contributes to NOAA's response capabilities, because it typically means that at least one NOAA vessel can respond to an emergency location in a timely manner. Fleet vessels can also enter areas that require military or security clearance (e.g., military ports), whereas most contract vessels cannot. Finally, as the administrator of all NOAA Fleet activities, OMAO can easily coordinate across line offices to ensure that NOAA's other critical needs are being met throughout the emergency response period. Together, these factors often make it much more feasible and cost-effective to utilize NOAA fleet vessels for emergency response activities, rather than having to pay contract vessels, which will likely charge premium prices (e.g., through time and materials contracts) for emergency situations, or other potential responders. Benefits to Society: NOAA ships' disaster response capabilities are often essential to subsequent efforts in each emergency scenario. For example, pre-and post-event hydrographic surveying allows major ports and harbors to reopen to commercial shipping after hurricanes and other disasters, as well as following national security threats. The ability of NOAA ships to immediately survey ports allows important economic activity to resume. In 2015 alone, 1.39 billion short tons accounting for $1.56 trillion worth of U.S. goods moved through U.S. ports. Imports and exports via water represented 71% of U.S. imports and exports by weight and almost 42 percent of cargo value in 2015. 33 Debris field location and mapping helps other federal, state, and local groups tailor search and rescue operations for air disasters. Ships already designed for scientific data collection can easily be redeployed to help with critical sampling after major oil spills. These efforts save lives, allow for the continuation of commercial activities and the assessment of natural resource damages. In addition, crew members on NOAA Fleet vessels often perform relatively routine search and rescue activities as required by International Maritime law and provide relief supplies to affected populations during emergencies. These activities have saved many lives over the course of the fleet's history. The ability of NOAA's fleet to respond to emergencies also can result in cost savings relative to other potential responders. As noted above, NOAA Fleet vessels have unique technologies and are staffed with scientists and engineers with expertise in hydrographic and scientific data collection, which accounts for a large majority of response activities, thus gaining significant efficiencies compared to finding vessels and forming crews specifically to respond to emergencies. In addition, NOAA ships are typically relatively easy to reroute with minimal impact to normal program activities. Thus, NOAA vessels can often provide superior, more cost-effective and timely response capabilities compared with other potential responders that may first need formal contractual authorization from the government."}, {"section_title": "Monetized Benefits of Select Products and Services", "text": "As detailed in Section 1, we worked with the NOAA/OMAO project team, TPIO, and the National Observing Systems Council, to select five NOAA products for further evaluation and quantification: For these five products, we estimated the monetary value or benefits that the product provides to society, and the percentage of this value that can be attributed to the NOAA Fleet. To estimate the benefits associated with each product, we relied on estimates from existing studies and literature, and applied these estimates (or range of estimates) to the relevant product. Collecting primary data to support an original valuation analysis was beyond the scope of this contract. To estimate the percentage of the products' value that can be attributed to the NOAA Fleet, we relied on data provided by TPIO from the NOSIA-II model, as well as input from NOAA subject matter experts. Our estimates for the contribution of the NOAA Fleet are based on \"denial of service,\" which is intended to capture the percentage decrease in performance that the product would experience if the NOAA Fleet was not available to provide necessary data inputs. Section 3.1 provides additional detail on the methodology we used to assess the contribution of NOAA ships to the value of individual products. Our analysis indicates that the anticipated benefits associated with the five NOAA products amount to between $5.1 to $9.3 billion per year (Table 4). The NOAA Fleet accounts for approximately $0.77 to $3.39 billion (15% -37%) of this total. "}, {"section_title": "Methodology for Estimating Value of NOAA Fleet", "text": "As noted above, we relied on two sources of data to estimate the percentage of total product benefits that can be attributed to the fleet: the NOSIA-II model and input from NOAA subject matter experts. The NOSIA-II model contains information on how individual data sources and observing systems contribute to the performance of specific products. To develop this data, TPIO surveyed more than 500 NOAA subject matter experts with knowledge of specific products, asking them to rate how well their products meet users' and stakeholders' needs and expectations. Based on a scale of 1 to 100, the average rating across subject matter experts represents the product's \"status quo score.\" A score of 1 indicates that the product provides no value, while a score of 100 means that the product meets all expectations and exceeds some. TPIO also asked the subject matter experts to consider the impact of removing individual data sources (such as the NOAA Fleet) from production of the product, and how that would affect the status quo score. For a given data source contributing to a given product, the \"product delta\" is the difference between the product's status quo score and the reduced product score corresponding to removal of the data source. Characterization of data source impacts to products is known as \"swing weighting\" in NOSIA-II. The product deltas are also referred to as \"swing scores.\" 34 TPIO adjusted the swing scores provided by the subject matter experts to better reflect the impact of various data streams on NOAA's mission service areas, rather than individual products. 35 This resulted in \"weighted\" swing scores. For this study, we were interested in using the unadjusted scores from NOAA subject matter experts because these scores provide a better assessment of the ship's full impact on product performance. Therefore, TPIO provided us with raw \"unweighted\" swing scores for NOAA ships and the observing systems they support (e.g., buoy systems). We used the unweighted swing scores to help us determine the contribution of the NOAA Fleet to the value of individual products. In addition to the unweighted swing scores, we also relied on input gathered directly from NOAA subject matter experts. When interviewing experts at the product level, some expressed concerns that the TPIO swing scores did not fully reflect the impact or value of NOAA ships on their individual products We therefore asked the NOAA product experts to estimate the percentage of their product's total data inputs that comes from the NOAA Fleet and/or the buoy systems it supports. We also asked the subject matter experts to estimate the percentage decrease in product performance that would occur if data from the fleet was not available. The unweighted swing scores and information from subject matter experts allowed us to develop a reasonable range of estimates for assessing the contribution of the NOAA Fleet as a percentage of the product's overall value to society. The data used as inputs to this analysis represent the best available information. However, the studies upon which the quantifications are based were often few in number and, as with any study, limited in their accuracy, completeness, and broader applicability. Estimates of the contribution of the NOAA fleet to final products and services are based on extensive research and analysis by NOAA's Technology, Planning and Integration for Observation office (TPIO) but this work has its own limitations and the results have not been independently verified (as with a \"denial of data\" analysis). In short, the resulting values represent an empirical first step in the direction of developing more accurate and complete estimates of the value of NOAA products and services and the share of that value attributable to the NOAA fleet. A more scientifically rigorous analysis would require additional primary data collection and analysis 34 NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. 2015.

To address excessive total product deltas, TPIO adjusted the swing scores for individual products. This adjustment resulted in \"weighted\" swing scores, which provided a better assessment of the data streams on NOAA's mission service areas. which, if performed comprehensively, would be cost-prohibitive. This study does establish a scientifically sound process for assessing the societal benefits of the NOAA fleet and identifies critical information requirements that should be used to inform future research agendas."}, {"section_title": "Value of Report Cards and NOAA Fleet Contribution:", "text": "The Status and Trends Report Cards will inform decisions by U.S. Congress and NOAA leadership regarding the allocation of resources to protect coral reefs, while the associated jurisdictional-level reports will play a significant role in the direct management of these resources. For purposes of this report, we estimate that between 15% and 30% of the $3.954 billion coral reef value for the U.S. can be attributed to these products. Thus, the value of the Coral Reef Status and Trends Report Cards amounts to approximately $0.593 to $1.185 billion per year. Based on TPIO's unweighted swing scores from NOSIA-II, 15% of the value of Coral Reefs Status and Trends Report Cards can be attributed to the NOAA Fleet. On the other hand, NOAA subject matter experts in coral reefs estimate that 60% of the data used in the report cards comes from NOAA ships. Therefore, the percent of valuable attributable to the NOAA Fleet is estimated to be 15% at the lower end and 60% at the upper end. Thus, $90 million to $711 million (2016 USD) of the value of the Report Cards can be directly attributed to the NOAA Fleet (Table 6). "}, {"section_title": "Seasonal Forecasts: ENSO Outlook", "text": "Value of ENSO Information: Over the last 40 years, NOAA and others have drastically improved the accuracy of ENSO forecasts, and can now predict these events, and their expected impacts on different regions, with 70% to 80% accuracy a year before they occur. 47 Seasonal outlooks of temperature and precipitation make use of ENSO information and other tools. ENSO is the largest driver of climate variability on the seasonal timescale. Decisionmakers in sectors affected by seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation to help turn climate events to their advantage (Table 10). For example, farmers can use seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature to make decisions about what crops to plant. Similarly, energy distribution companies can increase stockpiles of heating oil and gas if the coming winter is forecast to be colder than usual, thereby avoiding shortfalls that are costly to both distributors and consumers. 48 Private retailers or grocery chains can use seasonal climate forecasts to rearrange merchandise to anticipate shifts in seasonal needs. In addition to private industry sectors, decision-makers working in the public interest can use seasonal climate forecasts to make decisions that result in significant societal benefits. For example, a 2016 study analyzed the potential benefits of using ENSO forecasts to manage water resources in small to mid-sized communities of the southeastern U.S. Using Auburn, Alabama as a case study, the researchers found that the city could have saved $1.2 million and $490,000 in avoided water purchases during 1999-2000 and 2007-2008, respectively, if they would have developed a drought management plan based on seasonal forecast information. Study results also showed that higher savings were associated with more severe drought conditions. 49 In addition, ENSO can result in a range of natural disasters, including severe droughts, floods, wildfires, and disease outbreaks. In the absence of any forewarning of near future climate conditions, mitigation options tend to be reactive in nature. Emergency managers and other decision makers can use seasonal climate forecast information to develop proactive mitigation strategies and allocate resources accordingly, which can result in significant cost savings.  51 estimated the value of ENSO forecasts for both U.S. agricultural producers and consumers, accounting for changes in supply and demand, and the associated impact on prices for agricultural goods. Assuming farmers optimize their decisions based on forecast information, the authors estimated that the total economic benefits of ENSO forecasts ranged from $295 and $700 million per year (1996 USD) for crop agriculture, 52 depending on forecast accuracy and ENSO phase definition. The authors also estimated that ENSO forecasts resulted in an additional $54 -$104 million (1996 USD) in benefits to foreign producers and consumers, due to global nature of the agricultural markets. Agricultural yields for the crops assessed in Chen et al. have increased by 90 percent since 1996, the year assessed in their study. 53 For this reason, we increased the figures in Chen et al. by 90 percent, reflecting the assumption that the additional crop production would also benefit from the use of ENSO forecasts. This yields an estimated value of ENSO information for U.S. crop agricultural producers and consumers of between $560 to $1,328 million per year (2016 USD). Including foreign surplus, total annual benefits amount to between $719 to $1,410 million (2016 USD), with higher foreign surplus associated with lower U.S. benefits. 54 However, benefits to foreign nations are not a strong argument for U.S. investments in the NOAA Fleet. For this reason, we did not include benefits accruing to foreign nations in our benefit estimates for this product. The unweighted TPIO swing score representing the NOAA ship impact on the ENSO Outlook is 4.6%. This estimate includes the TAO and ARGO arrays, which the fleet support. NOAA subject matter experts estimated a much higher dependence on the NOAA Fleet, indicating that the ships and observing systems they support account for approximately 50% of the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS), which supports ENSO prediction and monitoring reflected in the Outlook. In addition, the subject matter experts indicated that there is no substitute for the data collected by the TAO array, and therefore, by maintaining the TAO buoys, the NOAA Fleet contributes significantly to the value of the Outlook. Recognizing that GODAS accounts for only a part of the total production of the Outlook, we attributed 20% of total benefits of the ENSO Outlook to the NOAA Fleet as the upper end of our range. Given that NOAA data serve as the primary resource for ENSO forecasts/publications in the U.S. (not just the ENSO Outlook), we did not attempt to separately value the Outlook as being distinct from other forecast products. Based on existing studies we know that seasonal climate forecasts that are dependent on ENSO information can result in $560 to $1,328 million dollars in benefits each year in the U.S. agricultural sector alone. Approximately $26 to $266 million (2016 USD) of this total can be directly attributed to the NOAA Fleet (Table 11). "}, {"section_title": "Ecosystem Management: National Marine Sanctuaries Conditions Report", "text": "Background: The National Marine Sanctuary Conditions Reports directly contribute to regulations, policies, management actions, and education programs related to marine sanctuaries, which in turn helps to protect the important benefits that the sanctuaries provide, including: 53 The 90% increase in production value accounts for price changes from 1996 to 2016 for each of the four crops included in the study, which included inflation-related effects, increases in the acreage cultivated, and increased productivity (output per acre). 54 Foreign surplus updated to 2016 values based on Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. \uf0b7 Market benefits, which reflect the positive local economic impacts associated with sanctuary-related activities, such as tourism, recreation, and commercial fishing \uf0b7 Non-market benefits, including benefits for individuals and recreators who directly use and/or passively enjoy sanctuary resources, as well as benefits for those who do not visit or use the sanctuaries, but who value the important habitat and species protection services they provide. 55 The market benefits associated with National Marine Sanctuaries represent the direct spending/revenues generated by sanctuary-related activities, and the additional economic activity (i.e., sales, income, employment) that this spending creates as it ripples through the local economies in which the sanctuaries are located. NOAA and others have conducted several studies to examine the market benefits associated with individual sanctuaries. Most of these studies have focused on tourism and recreation because these activities account for the largest portion of sanctuary-related economic activity. In total, NOAA estimates that spending on coastal tourism and recreation in areas adjacent to all National Marine Sanctuaries amounts to $5.2 billion (2015 USD) per year. After accounting for multiplier effects in the economy, this spending generates more than $7.3 billion in total economic activity (i.e., sales/output). 56 In addition, NOAA estimates that commercial fishing activity associated with the sanctuaries generates approximately $463 million (2015 USD) in total economic activity per year. This estimate includes revenues associated with commercial fish landings, as well as for businesses that supply the fishing industry, and spending by individuals (e.g., fishermen) that benefit from the increase in commercial fishing revenues. Finally, NOAA estimates that spending by the federal government, educational institutions, and non-profit groups for sanctuary-related research generates approximately $200 million (2015 USD) in economic activity per year. 57 In total, NOAA reports that tourism, recreation, commercial fishing, and research activities associated with the sanctuaries generate more than $8 billion (2015 USD) per year in economic activity in adjacent local economies. 58 In addition to positive economic effects for local economies, National Marine Sanctuaries provide benefits to individuals who directly use sanctuary resources for recreational activities such as boating, fishing, snorkeling, or other more passive beach activities. The values associated with these activities result in what economists refer to as \"use benefits.\" There are also many individuals who may not use the sanctuaries directly, but who value their existence for various reasons. The values that these individuals derive from National Marine Sanctuaries are known as \"non-use benefits.\" Economists refer to use and non-use benefits as non-market benefits because there is no market in which their price, or value, is determined. For example, when users of sanctuaries go on a scuba diving trip, there is no cashier taking their money as they enter the water. Similarly, it is difficult to capture the value that individuals hold for the species protected by the sanctuaries. While there is no established price for these services, economists employ a variety of methods for measuring these benefits indirectly. While NOAA has not conducted a comprehensive study of the nonmarket benefits associated with all marine sanctuaries, several studies provide insights into the magnitude of different types of use and non-use benefits at individual sites. For example, in 2012 NOAA conducted a national survey to assess how much households within the U.S. would be willing to pay to expand the boundaries of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (Gulf of Mexico) from its current three banks to nine additional banks. Results of the study indicated that households were willing to pay $36 to $111 (2015 USD) per year to expand the sanctuarya total of $4.1 to $12.7 billion (2015 USD) 55  Another study estimated the use values associated with recreating on artificial and natural reefs in Monroe County (Florida Keys) for residents and visitors. Employing an on-site survey, the authors estimated that the total use benefits associated with these resources amounted to more than $69 million (2015 USD) per year at this site. This included values for residents and visitors for reef -related activities such as boating, fishing, scuba diving, and snorkeling. 60 Total Value of National Marine Sanctuaries: The amount that individuals spend to participate in sanctuary-related tourism or recreation (or the amount that businesses benefit from these activities) provides an indication of how much they value these activities, and therefore how much they value the sanctuaries themselves. Similarly, commercial fishing revenues made possible by the sanctuaries provides an indication of sanctuary value for this industry. Thus, the $8 billion in market benefits associated with all sanctuaries serves as order-of-magnitude estimate for the sanctuaries' total use value. However, the market benefits represent a lower-bound estimate of value for several reasons. First, individuals may be willing to pay even more to enjoy National Marine Sanctuariesin this case, total spending is not equal to total value. In addition, NOAA's market value estimates include only the money spent or revenues generated in the economies adjacent to the sanctuaries; it does not represent for example, the amount that tourists spend to get to the sanctuary location (e.g., on plane tickets, etc.). 61 The market benefits associated with the sanctuaries do not capture non-use benefits. However, based on the study on the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, we know that U.S. households would be willing to pay $36 to $111 per year to expand just one site. This means that across the 116 million households in the U.S., total non-use values amount to between $4.2 and $12.9 billion per year (2015 USD) for the expansion of that Sanctuary. Thus, it is not hard to imagine that households would be willing to pay at least this much to maintain the non-use benefits associated with all 13 National Marine Sanctuary sites. Based on the studies described above, the total use and non-use values of the sanctuaries amount to at least between $12.2 and $20.9 billion per year (Table 12). Economic impacts/market benefits are not typically included in benefits analysis. However, due to limited available data, we are applying market benefits to provide an order of magnitude estimate of use value. Value of National Marine Sanctuaries Condition Reports and NOAA Fleet Contribution: NOAA and other stakeholders rely heavily on the National Marine Sanctuary Conditions Reports to make decisions about sanctuary management. Thus, they contribute significantly to the sanctuaries' value by protecting the important benefits they provide. Based on input from subject matter experts, we estimate that 20% to 25% of the total value of National Marine Sanctuaries can be attributed to use of the Conditions Reports, which improve management actions that maintain the benefits associated with the Sanctuaries and prevent their future degradation. Thus, the total value of the Conditions Reports amounts to between $2.4 and $5.2 billion per year. Based on information from TPIO and NOAA subject matter experts, 25% to 35% of the value of the Conditions Reports can be attributed to the NOAA Fleet. Thus, the benefits associated with fleet inputs amounts to approximately $0.61 to $1.8 billion per year (Table 13).

We also examined available information on the capacity and availability of contract vessels. This section summarizes and presents conclusions from the cost-effectiveness analysis. Appendix B presents complete details."}, {"section_title": "Marginal Cost of Using the NOAA Fleet", "text": "As a basis for the cost-effectiveness analysis, we used cost data for the NOAA Fleet for fiscal year 2015, the most recent year for which complete cost data were available at the outset of this project. Specifically, we used these data to compare the marginal cost (as opposed to total cost) of operating the NOAA Fleet to the cost of using contract vessels to accomplish the same goals. This approach assumes that NOAA will not make dramatic changes to the overall mix of contract versus fleet ship time employed or radically alter the composition of its fleet in the immediate future. In other words, we assumed that substitutions would take place at the margins. Given this assumption, it is not appropriate to account for the entire budget associated with NOAA's marine operations in the comparison. Some elements of the budget (e.g., fixed maintenance costs, certain support and management costs) are not reduced when NOAA Fleet missions are accomplished using contract vessels. Some of these fixed costs would be reduced only by extreme substitution to the extent of eliminating one or more ships from the NOAA Fleet. Other fixed costs would still be required even in a hypothetical scenario where the NOAA fleet were completely replaced by contract vessels. These costs are associated with functions (e.g., safety and compliance) that would be required regardless of which vessels NOAA uses to acquire ocean observations. With this approach in mind, we used data from OMAO's Office of the Chief Financial Officer for fiscal year 2015 to estimate the variable (or marginal) operating cost for each ship in the NOAA fleet. 62 We used data provided by OMAO on fiscal year 2015 days at sea for each ship to calculate the cost per day at sea (Table 14). These costs include only variable costs that are proportional to the level of effort expended. They exclude fixed costs that would not be reduced by substitution at the margins. Therefore, they are not comparable to costs for the NOAA fleet reported in certain other sources. For example, costs developed for the NOAA Fleet Recapitalization Team 63 cover the total cost of all of OMAO's observing systems, including fixed costs. Appendix B provides more details on the derivation of these costs. Note: The totals presented here include variable direct cost along with those indirect costs that are proportional to level of effort, but exclude fixed costs. Therefore, they are not comparable to costs derived elsewhere (e.g., for the NOAA Fleet Recapitalization Team), which cover the total cost of all OMAO observing systems, including fixed costs.\nThe purpose of this analysis is to compare the marginal cost of operating the NOAA fleet to the cost of using contract vessels to accomplish the same goals. Underlying this comparison is the assumption that NOAA will not make dramatic changes to the overall mix of contract versus fleet ship time employed or radically alter the composition of its fleet in the immediate future. In other words, the assumption is that substitutions take place at the margins. Given this assumption, it is not appropriate to account for the entire budget associated with NOAA's marine operations in the comparison. Some elements of the budget (e.g., fixed maintenance costs, certain support and management costs) are not reduced when NOAA fleet missions are accomplished using contract vessels. Some of these fixed costs would be reduced only by extreme substitution to the extent of eliminating one or more ships from the NOAA fleet. Other fixed costs would still be required even in a hypothetical scenario where the NOAA fleet were completely replaced by contract vessels. These costs are associated with functions (e.g., safety and compliance) that would be required regardless of which vessels NOAA uses to acquire ocean observations. Because the costs derived here reflect variable costs only, they are not comparable to costs for the NOAA fleet reported in certain other sources. For example, costs developed for the NOAA Fleet Recapitalization Team 292 cover the total cost of all of the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations' (OMAO's) observing systems, including fixed costs. To identify the appropriate variable costs, this analysis relies on a document provided by OMAO entitled \"Proposal to Document 100% of OMAO Ship Lifecycle Costs\". 293 This document identifies and categorizes the costs involved in operating the fleet. For those costs that are not directly attributable to a specific ship, it recommends a method of allocation. This analysis uses the recommended method of allocation to further categorize costs as variable or fixed. The variable costs appropriate for use in this analysis include: \uf0b7 Variable direct costs: direct operating and maintenance costs are those specifically attributable to a given ship. Variable direct costs are those that are proportional to level of effort and include, for example, fuel, supplies, and wages for personnel operating the ship. \uf0b7 Variable indirect costs: although not specifically attributable to a given ship, these costs can be allocated across the fleet in a manner that is proportional to direct operating costs. Therefore, they can be considered proportional to the level of effort expended and part of the marginal operating cost. They include, for example, engineering support costs, which are not directly attributed to a particular ship, but are proportional to the level of maintenance required to keep a ship operational. The costs used in this analysis do not include: \uf0b7 Fixed indirect costs: like variable indirect costs, these costs are not specifically attributable to a given ship. Although fixed indirect costs can be allocated across the fleet, the recommended method of allocation (e.g., dividing evenly by the number of ships) is not proportional to operating costs. Therefore, unlike variable indirect costs, fixed indirect costs are not proportional to the level of effort. \uf0b7 Sunk capital costs or depreciation costs: these costs reflect the initial acquisition cost of the existing fleet. Because these costs have already been expended, they cannot be reduced by substituting contract vessels."}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness Case Studies", "text": "NOAA currently uses contract vessels to support a variety of operations. Examples include fisheries surveys, deployment and maintenance of buoys, and collection of hydrographic data. Vessels employed by NOAA also include research vessels, both public sector and privately owned, for scientific data collection. NOAA also uses vessels from partner federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Science Foundation. In some cases, this usage is a no-cost exchange of ship time. In other cases, NOAA reimburses the partner agency. 64,65 In fiscal year 2015, NOAA used approximately 2,700 days at sea aboard contract vessels, roughly equal to the total days at sea executed by the NOAA fleet (2,644, as shown in Table 14). NOAA's use of contract vessels has remained fairly stable during the last few years: contract vessel days at sea varied by 11 percent or less from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016. 66 Although data are also available on the total cost of these contracts, it is not appropriate to compare these aggregate data to the cost of using the NOAA fleet. Factors that must be considered in comparing unit costs for NOAA ships and contract vessels include the following: \uf0b7 Data on contract vessel costs generally reflect the contract price only. Some contracts cover \"bare boat\" costs only, while others encompass a more complete scope of support for the mission (e.g., fuel, crew to operate deck equipment supporting the mission). Even when the contract covers more than \"bare boat\" costs, there can be other costs associated with the use of contract vessels that are not reflected in the contract price. Examples of these additional costs can include: costs for provisions for NOAA staff aboard the contract vessel, mobilization and demobilization of NOAA staff and equipment, and calibration of instruments used aboard the contract vessel. On the other hand, some contracts encompass other services in addition to use of vessels. In particular, NOAA contracts for hydrographic surveys are structured as data buys that purchase a quantity of data instead of a number of days at sea. In addition to providing ship time to collect the data, the contractor also provides quality assurance/quality control and data processing and formatting according to detailed specifications. 67 \uf0b7 A day at sea aboard a contract vessel is not necessarily equal to a day at sea aboard a NOAA vessel. NOAA ships often collect multiple data streams and/or conduct multiple missions simultaneously. Although some contract vessels, such as certain University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ships, 68 have similar multi-data stream/multi-mission capabilities, many vessels are better suited for individual projects and a more limited set of data. These \"economies of scope\" mean that multiple contract vessels can sometimes be required to replace the output of a NOAA vessel. In addition, NOAA uses NOAA ships for advancing technology through testing new equipment and procedures, maintaining and building expertise within the science field and marine operations. \uf0b7 NOAA ships have greater endurance than many smaller contract vessels. Therefore, they can remain at sea for the duration of long projects without returning to port. In addition, NOAA ships often can be scheduled and positioned to transition directly from one project to the next without significant travel time. Both of these factors mean that the use of contract vessels can, in some cases, entail more transit days (i.e., at the start and finish of the discrete projects for which they are hired and, in some cases, to resupply during longer projects). \uf0b7 Contract vessels used for missions with NOAA personnel aboard must meet certain safety standards. 69 Aggregate data on contract vessel costs include missions without NOAA crew aboard. The vessels used for these missions might not meet these standards and, therefore, not be comparable to NOAA ships. In addition, some contract vessels provide services that the NOAA fleet cannot (e.g., data collection in shallow waters). The aggregate data include such missions. Given these factors, a comparison of cost-effectiveness must account for mission-specific details. Accordingly, we used a case study approach to account for these factors and provide a one-to-one comparison of contract vessel costs to NOAA fleet costs. Table 15 identifies the example missions we examined, along with key mission parameters and estimated costs. The case studies reflect missions that support three different NOAA line offices. Each of the cases studies involves a different NOAA vessel. Three of the case studies (TAO array maintenance, sanctuary ecosystem assessment surveys for Greater Farallones and Cordell Banks, and reef assessment and monitoring in American Samoa) are of missions that support NOAA products and services evaluated in detail in preceding sections of this report. For each case study, we estimated the cost of using the NOAA ship based on the marginal costs estimated in Table  14. The contract vessel cost estimates in each case study cover providing the same services and support as the NOAA ship and meeting the same mission requirements. The contract vessel cost estimates include adjustments necessary to make an equivalent comparison. Appendix B provides complete details of the cost estimates. It also includes further discussion of the results for each case study. The following paragraphs provide a summary: 1. The case study of TAO array maintenance covers two scenarios. The first scenario is a mission with scope limited to routine maintenance and servicing of the TAO array, along with deployment of Argo and surface drifting floats. The second scenario is a mission that also incorporates scientific research that is directly related to operating the array. If the scope is limited to the first scenario, a commercial contract vessel can complete the mission more cost-effectively than the NOAA ship Ronald H. Brown. The commercial contract vessel would not be equipped, however, to supply all the requirements of the second scenario. Substituting for the Ronald H. Brown in the second scenario requires the use of a UNOLS ship equipped to collect the underway ocean observations and support the related supplemental science. In this scenario, the Ronald H. Brown is more cost-effective than the alternative of using a UNOLS vessel. For the case study considering a mission of limited scope (the first TAO maintenance scenario, which excludes supplement scientific research), the commercial contract vessel was more cost effective. This result is not surprising, given that the NOAA ship included in the comparison is better equipped than necessary for the limited scope. The case studies also show, however, that even for the multi-disciplinary research missions to which NOAA ships are best suited, cost-effective contract vessel alternatives can sometimes be available. The case studies are not conclusive regarding the factors that determine cost-effectiveness for these research missions. The two case studies where contract vessels came out ahead (CalCurCEAS and SEAS) were for missions in U.S. coastal waters, while the research missions where NOAA ships were more cost-effective (TAO maintenance including research and RAMP) were in the more remote tropical Pacific, suggesting that region of operation is a key factor. This result, however, could be related to the specific NOAA ships examined instead of geography. CalCurSEAS and SEAS involved NOAA ships with marginal costs higher than the average for NOAA ( \nThis section examines cost-effectiveness on a mission-specific basis using selected case studies. These case studies attempt to account for the factors discussed in Section 3 and provide a one-to-one comparison of contract vessel costs to NOAA fleet costs. These four case studies were identified during discussions with NOAA subject matter experts. Additional data used in the case studies includes interviews with contract vessel providers (see Section 5), data for individual contracts downloaded from USAspending.gov, price index data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the marginal cost of using specific NOAA ships estimated in Section 2. The four case studies reflect missions that support three different NOAA line offices. The first two case studies are of missions supporting the National Weather Service (NWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), respectively, which are the two line offices that account for the greatest amount of spending on contract vessels other than contract data buys for hydrographic surveys (see Exhibit B -3). The other two case studies are of missions supporting the National Ocean Service (NOS). Each of the cases studies involves a different NOAA vessel. Three of the four case studies (Sections 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4) are of missions that support NOAA products and services for which the main body of this report describes societal benefits."}, {"section_title": "Capacity, Availability, and Other Factors Affecting the Use of Contract Vessels", "text": "As part of the cost-effectiveness analysis, we also examined available data about the capacity and availability of contract vessels, along with other factors that could affect NOAA's use of contract vessels. A primary source for this part of the assessment included a set of informal, voluntary interviews with nine contract vessel providers. We also used data downloaded from USAspending.gov, a publicly accessible U.S. government website that provides searchable, transaction-level information on federal contracts and grants. 76 Appendix B provides more details on both of these sources. Observations from this part of the analysis, also discussed in greater detail in Appendix B, include the following: \uf0b7 Individual vendors interviewed are generally willing and available to provide support, even to the extent of modifying their vessels to suit project needs. It is important to note, however, that the vessel availability is greater for smaller vessels with more limited capabilities. The individual vessels that are the most obvious substitutes for NOAA ships (UNOLS vessels) are also the least available. \uf0b7 Most of the vendors interviewed (six of the nine) reported that their availability is greater with more advance planning. The lead time required to access contract vessels varies depending on the length of the project and on the size of the vessel. For longer projects aboard larger vessels, more planning is required, however: often a year or more in advance. For context, the missions conducted by NOAA's fleet in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 spanned a range of lengths (Figure 4), with an average of approximately 25 days at sea. 78 \uf0b7 A majority of the vendors interviewed (five of the nine) reported that their vessels are busiest during the summer months. In spite of competing priorities during the summer, however, the interviewees reported good availability, particularly with advance planning. NOAA ships execute missions year-round, but, like contract vessels, they are busiest during the summer (particularly June). The NOAA fleet, however, also executes a significant number of days at sea outside of summer (particularly March through April and October). 79 These schedule data suggest there may be opportunities to utilize contract vessels when those vessels have greater availability. \uf0b7 Despite the overall size of the contract vessel industry and the reports from vendors interviewed of generally good availability, specific projects may have requirements (e.g., vessel capabilities, project scheduling, or location) that are not a good match for a very large number of vessels. The number of such NOAA projects could be significant, based on the available data about the number of vendors bidding on these projects. These data show that, of NOAA contracts for vessel services active in fiscal year 2015, just over half received only one offer and almost 70 percent had two or fewer offers. 80 Data are not available on the number of solicitations that received no bids. 77 See Appendix B for information on how we identified charter contracts in the USAspending data. 78 Based on data provided by OMAO. Excludes fleet services and program support activities (e.g., inspections, shakedowns, sea trials, and transit not assigned to a specific line office) and scheduled missions where actual days at sea were reported as zero. 79 Based on total days at sea in each month for the entire fleet, as derived from data provided by OMAO (Ibid). 80 Data downloaded for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for fiscal year 2015 from https://www.usaspending.gov/DownloadCenter/Pages/DataDownload.aspx. Accessed November 18, 2016. \uf0b7 All nine of the vendors interviewed identified fuel prices as the major factor that would affect future prices for their services. Outside of major changes in fuel prices, most interviewees predicted only small annual increases (in the range of two to three percent) in the prices for their services. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's producer price index for the water transportation industry likewise shows that prices in this industry have remained fairly stable during the last five years, changing by less than 3 percent per year (with the exception of a 5 percent decrease in between 2015 and 2016). 81 \uf0b7 Institutional factors that differ across NOAA programs also affect the use of contract vessels. Some programs have contract vehicles in place that allow easy access to contract vessels. Other programs do not have the mechanisms or budget to access contract vessels. For still other programs, the fleet allocation process may create an incentive to use contract vessels for parts of their mission by limiting the total NOAA fleet time available to the program (i.e., these programs receive a fixed allocation of NOAA fleet time above which they must use contract vessels). See Appendix B for specific examples of each of these institutional factors."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Lessons Learned and Recommendations for Next Steps", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Lessons Learned", "text": "This study demonstrates the value of data collection activities and other services the NOAA Fleet provides through the products it supports. The NOAA Fleet supports a wide range of benefits, including the protection of key resources and species, increased revenues for economic sectors, and increased safety and economic prosperity for U.S. residents. For the five products that we monetized as part of this research, the benefits attributed to the NOAA Fleet amount to between approximately $0.77 and $3.39 billion per year, which is significantly greater than the annual OMAO operating budget for NOAA vessels. This study provides NOAA with a systematic process for assessing the value of individual observing systems and data streams through the development of value chains for the products and services that depend on them. The project team relied on data from the TPIO NOSIA-II model as well as structured interviews with NOAA subject matter experts to develop the value chains, and to inform our valuation of fleet-dependent products. While this study represents a significant first step in demonstrating the value of the NOAA Fleet, it is limited in scope. Under this contract the project team was only able to develop value chains for 12 of more than 600 products, and quantify the value of 5 products, that are dependent on data collected from the fleet and/or the observing systems it supports. In addition, we were not able to conduct original valuation analyses; our monetary estimates of value therefore depend on existing data and estimates from the literature. We were also only able to conduct a limited number of interviews, which we conducted with product experts from within NOAA. In addition, throughout the study we learned that it is difficult to isolate the effect of individual data streams on the performance of a given product, given the interdependency of data that most products rely on. Thus, it is difficult to attribute an exact percentage of product value to the NOAA Fleet. We have attempted to reflect this uncertainty by providing a reasonable range of values using Fleet data dependency estimates provided by TPIO and the subject matter experts. Another source of uncertainty stems from the studies that the project team relied on to develop monetary estimates for the subset of five NOAA products. While these studies rely on standard economic methods and models, they are also subject to limitations and caveats. To address this uncertainty, we have attempted to provide reasonable ranges and describe key assumptions embedded in the studies. The data used as inputs to this analysis represent the best available information. However, the studies upon which the quantifications are based were often few in number and, as with any study, limited in their accuracy, completeness, and broader applicability. Estimates of the contribution of the NOAA fleet to final products and services are based on extensive research and analysis by NOAA's Technology, Planning and Integration for Observation office (TPIO) but this work has its own limitations and the results have not been independently verified (as with a \"denial of data\" analysis). In short, the resulting values represent an empirical first step in the direction of developing more accurate and complete estimates of the value of NOAA products and services and the share of that value attributable to the NOAA fleet. A more scientifically rigorous analysis would require additional primary data collection and analysis which, if performed comprehensively, would be cost-prohibitive. This study does establish a scientifically sound process for assessing the societal benefits of the NOAA fleet and identifies critical information requirements that should be used to inform future research agendas. Despite these challenges, which are inherent in most economic analyses, our use of published studies and extensive interviews with subject matter experts established a highly credible range of value estimates. We are confident that these estimates establish the significant value of the fleet's contributions and provide materially relevant data to support future decisions at NOAA regarding the fleet. As part of this research we also examined the cost-effectiveness of using contract vessels as a substitute for NOAA's marine fleet for certain data collection activities. In terms of the number of days at sea executed, NOAA's current use of contract vessels is approximately equal to its use of own fleet. In many cases, however, the missions conducted by these two types of vessels are not directly comparable for a variety of reasons. For example, NOAA ships often collect multiple data streams and/or conduct multiple missions simultaneously. Although some contract vessels, such as certain UNOLS ships, have similar multi-data stream/multi-mission capabilities, many vessels are better suited for individual projects and a more limited set of data. These \"economies of scope\" mean that multiple contract vessels can sometimes be required to replace the output of a NOAA vessel. To account for these factors and make equivalent comparisons between contract vessels and NOAA ships, we examined several case studies of specific missions that could be conducted by either type of vessel. The single case study involving a single purpose mission of limited scope (TAO maintenance without supplemental scientific research) showed a contract vessel to be the most cost-effective option. The case studies of multi-disciplinary research missions indicated that there are examples where contract vessels are more cost effective and others where NOAA ships are more cost effective. These case studies were not conclusive regarding the factors that determine cost-effectiveness. Geography could be one factor. NOAA ships appeared more cost effective for the research missions conducted in the remote tropical Pacific, while contract vessels appeared more cost effective for those conducted in U.S. coastal waters. These results, however, could also be related to the specific NOAA ships examined. The case studies where contract vessels were more cost effective involved NOAA ships with higher marginal costs than the average for NOAA's fleet overall. We also conducted a limited examination of the capacity and availability of contract vessels, along with other factors that could affect NOAA's use of contract vessels. NOAA successfully contracts with a large number of different contract vessel providers and individual vendors report good availability to provide support. Specific projects, however, may have requirements (e.g., vessel capabilities, project scheduling, or location) that are not a good match for a very large number of contract vessels. Of NOAA contracts for vessel services active in fiscal year 2015, just over half received only one offer and almost 70 percent had two or fewer offers. 82 In general, contract vessel availability appears to be greater for smaller vessels with more limited capabilities. The individual vessels that are the most obvious substitutes for NOAA ships (UNOLS vessels) are also the least available. There may, however, be opportunities for NOAA to make greater use of contract vessels during periods when those vessels have greater availability (i.e., outside of the summer months)."}, {"section_title": "NOAA Fleet Data that Feed the Product", "text": "The report card and underlying indicators require the collection of data by multiple observation systems over a wide geographic region. The stratified random sampling design that NCRMP uses to collect data for the Status and Trends Report is heavily reliant on benthic and other habitat mapping performed in part by NOAA cruises. NOAA ships such as the Nancy Foster provide multi-beam sonar, echo sounder sonar, and other capabilities for coral reef and fish habitat mapping. 83 Buoys and satellites also collect data on ocean acidification and thermal stress, which feed into the report card's climate indicators along with ocean profile data collected during marine biological ship surveys. Using NOAA ships and observation systems to perform data collection helps the CRCP adhere to the standardized sampling methodology that underpins the national status and trends report. Other ship-based data collection options, such as charter personal dive boats, are more expensive and scarce, limiting the timeframe for critical sampling. Some efforts such the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) which is NCRMP in the Pacific, conducted by the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center and funded by the CRCP, could not be done without the use of NOAA vessels. The long distances and remote locations of the Pacific coral reef jurisdictions make some of these programs only possible with NOAA ships. The CRCP is in the final stages of developing its official roll-out plan, and the program targets the U.S. Congress, NOAA and other federal agency leadership, nonprofit organizations, and the public for its report card. NOAA works on an individual basis with jurisdictional coral reef managers and other management partners to disseminate the more detailed jurisdiction-level reports. \nTsunami Inundation Forecast Model depends on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) created by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). DEMs map out the elevation of various features in a certain geographic area. This information is important for knowing how tsunamis of various wave heights and amplitudes will translate into inundation zones and levels in various communities. The NCEI produces approximately 200 DEMs that cover small and large geographic areas in select U.S. coastal regions to support tsunami forecasting and modeling efforts. NCEI has also begun to develop DEMS for select international locations at the request of the NTWC. 187 NCEI relies on high resolution bathymetry data and hydrographic surveys, some of which is collected/conducted by NOAA vessels, to develop DEMs. 188 The DEMs rely on this data to accurately map out the areas of interest. To develop the Tsunami Forecast Inundation Model, NTRC also uses ocean profile data directly collected from NOAA vessels, as well as data from the Voluntary Observing Ship Program, which the NOAA fleet is a part of.\nAdditionally, the Ocean Noise Strategy garners press coverage that helps NOAA educate the public on ocean noise impacts."}, {"section_title": "Product Intermediaries and Dissemination", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Users of the Product", "text": "\nFish stock assessments support sustainable fisheries by providing fisheries managers with the information necessary to make sound decisions. For example, by providing historical and current data, stock assessments allow scientists and Regional Fisheries Management Councils to compare the status of stocks to established targets, and adjust catch limits and stock metric targets accordingly. Stock assessment data also allows managers to determine how much catch is sustainable in general, and decide the best way to replenish depleted stocks. 176 In addition, states can use stock assessments to manage non-Federal stocks. International management entities similarly use the assessments to oversee jointly-managed stocks that straddle international boundaries. 177 Outside of influencing catch limits, fish stock assessments permit regional management councils to develop short-, medium-, and long-term projections of fish population and catch trends. 178 This in turn helps fishery management councils decide between various management options, and allows scientists to develop research priorities. 179\n"}, {"section_title": "Societal Benefits", "text": "Coral reefs provide the United States with valuable goods and services including food, coastal protection, habitat, and opportunity for recreational activities. These goods and services in turn provide different types of economic benefits, including: use values (e.g., snorkeling) and associated tourism benefits; non-use values (e.g., values people hold for the existence of coral reefs); and amenity values (e.g., as measured by increases in property values due to proximity to coral reefs). 88 Several studies have estimated these benefits for the United States using standard economic techniques. Based on a meta-analysis of these studies, 89  Various stressors threaten coral reefs and the ecosystem services they provide. Both the status and trends report and the jurisdiction-level report are effective tools for presenting coral reef health to various users. By incorporating data from the NOAA Fleet into several indicators, the CRCP creates a product that stakeholders can use to inform decision-making, thereby helping to protect coral reefs and the important ecosystem services they provide. A-4   \nThe SLR Viewer allow planners, emergency managers, and others to visualize the local potential inundation level associated with future sea level rise and understand the potential impact on coastal properties and associated resources. This in turn informs planning decisions, which helps to avoid property damage, maintain critical infrastructure, minimize impacts on vulnerable populations, and preserve or enhance coastal ecosystems. Several studies have estimated the costs of sea level rise and coastal flooding. The U.S. EPA estimates that the costs of property abandonment and protective adaptation actions (plus some additional costs) associated with sea level rise and storm surge will amount to $5 trillion through the end of the century. 100 Zillow, using NOAA's SLR maps, estimates that approximately 1.9 million homes worth $882 billion are at risk of being underwater by 2100. 101\nA-13 The greatest value that NOAA's nautical charts provide is safety for navigators. By providing the most up to date information, ships do not navigate blindly and can chart out the safest and most efficient route to their destination. They can also avoid navigational hazards with confidence, which in turn allows them to avoid unnecessary slow-downs. Thus, much of the value of this product can be estimated based on avoided losses from collisions and grounding, injury and possibly death. Because ship time can be expensive, Nautical Charts also provide value in terms of savings in the amount of time spent at sea. Because of its unique use in the international shipping industry, another way to consider the value of Nautical Charts is to examine the value of U.S. ports to the national economy. According the American Association of Port Authorities, U.S. seaports generate nearly $4.6 trillion in total economic activity, and provide $1.2 billion in personal income and local consumption. 121 This would likely be significantly lower without up-to-date Nautical Chart information. In 2007, Kite-Powell conducted a study for the NOAA Office of the Coast Survey to estimate the benefits of ideal nautical charts for recreational and commercial vessels, based on a survey asking users what they would be willing-to-pay for 'ideal' nautical charts. 122 Assuming a minimal difference between the nautical charts that were available at the time and ideal charts, the author estimated that the combined benefits of nautical charts amounted to $47.5 million (2007 USD), 123 including $15.3 million/year in consumer surplus for recreational users, $27.5 million/year in consumer surplus for commercial users, and $2 million/year in producer surplus. We estimate that today, this value amounts to approximately $57.9 million/per year (2016 USD), accounting for the increase in foreign flag ships visiting U.S. ports between 2007 and 2016. 124 While this study provides an order of magnitude estimate of the value of nautical charts, the authors acknowledge that it serves as a lower bound estimate, largely because the study did not include military users, commercial fishing vessels, or marine resource managers, among others. In addition, since the study was conducted in 2007, electronic nautical charts have become even more popular, allowing for more frequent updates that provide additional value to users. 125 The study also does not include the economic activity generated by value-added products that use ENC data as inputs. The development of these products creates jobs, wages, and additional economic output.   \nFor a forecast to have economic value, it must be true that better decisions can be made if a better weather forecast is available. Several studies have shown that predicting the life cycle and strength of a Pacific warm or cold episode is critical in helping farmers plan for, avoid or mitigate potential losses. 138 For example, Solow et al. (1998) found that by incorporating NOAA's ENSO forecasts into planting decisions, farmers in the United States could increase agricultural output and produce benefits to the U.S. economy of up to $300 million per year (1998 USD), depending on the accuracy of the forecast. 139 McKnew (2000) estimated that the value to society of ENSO forecasts on corn storage decisions can be as high as $240 million (2000 USD)-or one to two percent of the value of production. 140 In addition to these sectors, ENSO-related predictions can result in significant benefits for the water, energy, transportation, retail, and tourism sectors. ENSO-related forecasts of the potential for extreme climate episodes like floods and droughts could also save the United States billions of dollars in damage costs. For example, national and state emergency managers can use ENSO forecasts to better prepare for predicted events, which can reduce response costs and avoid weather-related damages. Individual households and businesses can also use the ENSO Outlook to make appropriate preparatory decisions, resulting in avoided damage costs. Tiesberg (2000) reports that on the U.S. West Coast, where El Ni\u00f1o frequently brings a great increase in winter precipitation, prior to the winter of 1997-98, there were reports of heavy demand for the services of roofing contractors, as people repaired or replaced roofs in anticipation of predicted El Ni\u00f1o storms. The benefit of this accelerated maintenance is a reduction in the risk or extent of damage to the inside of structures due to leaking roofs during heavy winter storms. \nThe NMS Condition Reports directly contribute to regulations and policies related to marine sanctuaries, which provide for the protection of key resources, the continued use and enjoyment of these resources, and the economic activity that they support. NMSs are designated for their irreplaceable resources, making them ideal travel destinations for ocean lovers, marine wildlife viewers and recreation seekers. 163 The ecosystem services and opportunities that the sanctuaries provide result in a range of benefits, including direct on-site user benefits (e.g., such as associated with educational programs, recreational or commercial fishing) and indirect benefits accruing to individuals who do not use the marine ecosystem directly but who value their existence or enjoy them passively. These use and non-use benefits are often referred to as non-market benefits, because there is no established price for them in the marketplace. Further, many of the on-site activities associated with marine sanctuaries generate income for businesses and individuals in coastal economies that service the activitiesthese are known as market benefits. For example, NMS reports that the success of many businesses, millions of dollars in sales, and thousands of jobs, directly depend on thriving national marine sanctuaries. NMS research indicates that together, national marine sanctuaries generate approximately $8 billion annually in local coastal and ocean dependent economies from diverse activities like commercial fishing, research and recreation/tourism-related activities. 164 In addition, the NMS Condition Reports help to identify research and information gaps, which are in turn filled by NOAA, and academic and other research organizations. This research can serve to further protect and maintain sanctuary resources, including endangered species and key habitat, as well as inform regulations that affect all marine resources. A good example of this is the research conducted by Point Blue that directly informed NOAA's recommendations to the Coast Guard on actions to reduce whale deaths by ship strikes. 158  Finally, the educational value of the sanctuaries cannot be understated. As noted above, NMS uses the Condition Reports to inform sanctuary outreach and education programs. These programs serve to educate the general public about the sanctuaries, and marine resources in general. These efforts can further protection through education, and increase the value that society places on these resources. \nEffective management of fisheries is essential for the commercial fishing industry, as well as the populations that rely on them for food consumption and recreation. U.S. commercial fisheries contribute $153 billion ($54 billion without imports) and 1.4 million jobs to the U.S. economy each year (0.81 million jobs without imports). Recreational saltwater fishing generates $61 billion in sales. 180 Commercial fishermen harvested $5.5 billion worth (9.4 billion pounds) of fish in 2014. 181 Even though only 20 of the 179 fish stocks for which NOAA determined a stock status in 2016 were overfished, fisheries are under a constant threat of overfishing. 182 Given the history of overfishing for many fish stocks in U.S. and international fisheries, regional management councils may set overly strict limits on catch to avoid stock depletion. NOAA's fish stock assessments provide management councils with stock status information so that they can more accurately set catch limits, thereby allowing commercial fisherman to catch more than would otherwise be permitted. While some information on stocks would be available through more limited stock assessments, it is likely that limited assessments would not provide enough data for regional management councils and their scientific advisory councils to feel comfortable setting anything other than conservative catch limits. Accurate stock assessments allow fishery managers and scientists to more confidently estimate stock status and therefore set more appropriate catch limits. As an example, 3.1 billion pounds of Walleye Pollock were landed in 2014, worth $400 million dollars. NOAA estimates that without the fishery-independent surveys, regional fishery managers would have to reduce their catch quotas by approximately 10%, resulting in a loss of approximately $40 million dollars due to overly conservative catch limits. 183 Figure A.7 presents the value chain for fish stock assessments, showing the different data sources that the assessments depend on, and how the assessments ultimately result in benefits to society. A-28\nThe National Tsunami Inundation Model helps communities to better plan for and respond to potential tsunami events, thereby decreasing the impacts of these events, including property damage and other economic losses, and the number of potential lives lost. In terms of mitigation planning, having accurate TIMs allows communities to make more informed decisions related to the location of critical infrastructure, as well as the planning of efficient evacuation routes and other response preparatory actions. In the event of a tsunami, having the pre-run SIMs and TIMs and associated response plans provide for more effective evacuation processes, reducing damage to people and property. 200 The value of tsunami mitigation practices is still relatively unknown. While some studies have calculated the amount of damage caused by tsunamis, it is difficult to quantify the damages that would have occurred if effective evacuations and/or mitigation actions had not been implemented (or alternatively the extent to which damages were reduced by mitigation actions). In addition, the extent of damages associated with tsunami events not only depend on effective response, preparation, and evacuation, but also on the magnitude and location of the tsunami, the amount of time a community has to implement response/evacuation actions, the accuracy of the forecast, and the effectiveness of the warning system/communication. However, it is clear that well-planned mitigation efforts and response actions, combined with an effective warning system, can significantly reduce the impacts of tsunamis. For example, experts often cite the difference in damages associated with two tsunami events that impacted Crescent City, CA. A tsunami produced by the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake caused over $50 billion in damage and 11 deaths in Crescent City. A tsunami produced by the 2011 Great Tohoku, Japan, earthquake resulted in $5 billion in damage and no deaths in the same location. These events produced waves with similar amplitudes and duration, even though they originated in different locations. The 1964 event did not benefit from having a response/evacuation plan in place while the 2011 event did. 201 While this significant decrease in impacts cannot all be attributed to tsunami mitigation, outreach & education, and disaster planning, it does speak to the potential benefits associated with having a comprehensive Disaster Response Plan in place, as well as the value that the information in models such as SIMs and TIMs provide. \nHAB forecasts allow state shellfish managers and public health officials to close fishing areas and beaches more selectively and precisely, thereby minimizing economic impacts associated with lost landings, lost tourism, and/or adverse public health outcomes. Several studies have estimated the socioeconomic impact of HABs. For example, one study estimated the impact of lost harvester sales of shellfish due to a strong HAB event in 2005. The study estimated losses in Maine to be $1.98 million for soft-shell clams. 231 A separate study estimated the direct economic impacts of the same event in Maine and Massachusetts using data from the NMFS, the Division of Marine Fisheries in Massachusetts and other sources. This study estimated these impacts ranged from $2.4 million in Maine to $18 million in Massachusetts. This estimate includes lost revenue in the softshell clam and mussel fisheries. 232 The study also found that the 2005 HAB event led to an increase in shellfish imports to make up for the drop in local supply. This increase in imports may mitigate the indirect impacts of a HAB event on the seafood industries. Finally, the study found that soft-shell clam price increases were spatially linked, meaning that shellfish closures in Maine may result in price increases in New York. 233 A more recent study examined the impact of temporary pollution closures (either due to HAB events or sewer overflows) on commercial soft-shell clam harvests in Machias Bay, Maine. Over their nine-year study period from 2001-2009, temporary pollution closures contributed to a loss of $3.6 million in forgone revenue, 27.4% of total revenue. 234 Knowing the extent of past economic impacts due to strong HAB events, it becomes clear how valuable a timely and accurate HAB forecast can be. Before these forecasts were available, public health officials would have to close large portions of beaches to ensure public safety. However, as forecasts improve, decision-makers can narrow the scope of these closures and cut the length of time that they are closed, minimizing economic impacts to many industries including shellfishing and tourism. 235 One study examined the value of HAB forecasts in the Gulf of Maine, considering both the frequency of the HAB event, the accuracy of the forecast, and the effectiveness of the response. Assuming a HAB occurs every 10 years, the forecast is perfect, and the responses are highly effective, the study found that the annual value of HAB forecasts amounts to $713,000. This value falls to $61,000 per year if HAB events are less frequent, the forecast is not perfect, and the A-37 responses are not effective. However, if a HAB event occurs every other year, and the responses are effective, the total value of a perfect forecast increases to over $3 million per year. Results indicate that the net present value over 30 years of HAB forecasts ranges from $51.3 million to $0.9 million, depending on HAB frequency, accuracy of prediction, and responses. 236  \nHypoxia impacts the food supply for commercially and recreationally-important fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. As their food sources leave due to lack of oxygen, fish and shrimp crowd into areas with better oxygen levels, which can A-40 lead to competing for food in smaller habitats where it is easier for fishes and shrimp to be consumed by predators or harvested by fishermen. Hypoxia can also affect shrimp spawning and migration, negatively as well as the amount of catch available for harvest. Tourism can also be affected as fish available for recreational fishing can be reduced. Hypoxia Watch can help commercial and recreation fishermen better plan where to fish to avoid hypoxic areas. The economy of the Gulf of Mexico includes significant fishery and tourism activity. Louisiana and Texas accounted for approximately $470 million, or two-thirds, of total U.S. revenue for shrimp landings. While knowledge gaps still exist on the impact of the hypoxic zone on individual species, scientists and economists have already demonstrated habitat loss, migration shifts, and reproductive disruption. 247 These impacts not only alter commercial and recreational fishing patterns, but can also reduce the economic vitality of these fishing industries. While the hypoxic zone has not yet been demonstrated to affect overall population levels of brown shrimp in the northern Gulf of Mexico, during hypoxic conditions, larger shrimp are priced significantly higher in relation to smaller shrimp than when hypoxic conditions are not present. 248 Figure A.10 shows the value chain for the Hypoxia Watch and related products. \nCetMap and SoundMap tools provide a variety of benefits to different users. CetMap products provide current and consolidated density data for compliance, identify data gaps and necessary specifications for data integration, provide a useful tool for ocean planning for proposed activities and for alternative NEPA analysis, and improve current understanding of migratory patterns. SoundMap similarly provides a useful tool for ocean planners to predict noise A-48 could significantly impact certain business sectors. For example, coastal tourism companies make seasonal operational changes based on the information found in the Outlook.\nSince 1980, 35 major hurricanes (those causing at least $1 billion in damages) have struck the United States with total losses exceeding $500 billion. The average annual losses from these 35 storms is nearly $16 billion. 278 The Hurricane Outlook helps key stakeholders to better prepare for the hurricane season, which can lead to reductions in property damage, mortality and morbidity, societal costs associated with evacuation, and lost business activity. Several studies have attempted to value hurricane forecasts based on the costs and damages that they can help to avoid, for both society and individual industry sectors. For example, using data from 1900 to 1990,  determined that loss of life associated with hurricanes exponentially decreased over this time period because of improved hurricane forecasts. 279   used the cost-of-evacuation to estimate the value of improved hurricane forecast information to crude oil and natural gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico. They found that the current value of existing hurricane forecast information is $8 million per year, and that the value rises by more than $15 million per year when this forecast is 50% more accurate. 280 Emmanuel et al. (2012) also found potentially significant savings for the insurance industry associated with improvements in seasonal hurricane forecasts. 281 Figure A.13 demonstrates the value chain associated the Hurricane Outlook, including the data from the NOAA Fleet that they depend on, and how this ultimately results in value to society.

The City subsequently developed a sea level rise strategy, and has received a coastal resilience grant of $766,887 on behalf of the Charleston Resilience Network to implement the strategy. 95 In another case, the City of New York used the SLR Viewer to incorporate coastal flooding and sea level rise risks into a post-Hurricane Sandy comprehensive resilience plan. The city's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability worked with FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and NOAA to develop the Sandy Recovery Tool, which helped the city consider coastal and emergency planning, coastal protection, critical infrastructure and services, and building code upgrades during the post-Sandy recovery. 96 Other users include universities, scientific and engineering groups, and NGOs who use the SLR viewer and underlying data for research. The University of Florida, for example, combined flood data from the SLR viewer with critical infrastructure data, land use data and vulnerability indices to develop a new SLR viewer specifically for the Tampa Bay area. The new viewer allows local, non-expert planners in the Tampa Bay area to prioritize adaptation options under different sea level rise scenarios, including adaptation options related to transportation, institutional, and emergency infrastructure. 97 Various private entities also use the data underlying the SLR Viewer to develop their own sea level rise assessment tools. Zillow and Syndeste LLC, for example, are two private sector companies that use NOAA's SLR data or DEMs to perform assessments. Zillow uses the data to assess the vulnerability of home values to sea level rise, while Syndeste, LLC has developed a unique flood vulnerability application. 98 While there are many additional tools available to assess SLR vulnerability, as part of OCM's DigitalCoast platform, the SLR Viewer, enables users to access a mapping tool and the underlying data, as well as a variety of other coastal vulnerability tools, easily and quickly. The SLR viewer is available, along with several other coastal analysis tools, on OCM's DigitalCoast website. In addition, NOAA provides technical assistance for the tool via Digital Coast. Users can access underlying data through a data access viewer and data registry, and metadata is available in a separate data catalog. In addition, OCM conducts outreach on the SLR Viewer to different groups through workshops and conferences; these groups include federal, state, county, and local agencies, universities, research agencies, private companies, and non-governmental and international organizations. Several of these entities create apps that further disseminate or use NOAA's data. Additionally, the SLR viewer and underlying data gain recognition through articles, presentations, and through social media outlets. 99\nNautical Charts and their related products have many uses. Federal regulations require certain vessels to carry \"navigational charts and publications published by the National Ocean Service.\" 113 These regulations are set by the Coast Guard and the by the international maritime community. Commercial and light commercial sector vessels that transit the same U.S. waters on each trip, such as cruise lines, ferries, tug and tow vessels, rely heavily on NOAA Nautical Charts. The Coast Guard requires each of these vessels to have a large-scale, detailed paper chart of the waters in which they operate. This chart can be printed through any of the NOAA-certified print-on-demand vendors that sell Nautical Charts. 114 The vendors provide a Certificate of Authenticity with each chart to ensure that it meets regulatory requirements. There are 20 to 25 of these vendors that work directly with NOAA. 115 In 2011, direct users and vendors downloaded 210,843 paper nautical charts from NOAA, and there were 18,695 public sales of the Coast Pilot chart books. 116 Most users rely on electronic Nautical Charts for navigation purposes, including both ENCs and RNCs. In 2011 downloads of ENCs totaled 141.6 million, while downloads of RNCs amounted to 97.6 million. 117 Larger vessels in the SOLAS class (meaning they are regulated under the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention) are required to use ENCs. 118 . Recreational boaters are not required to use NOAA nautical charts by law. However, they often indirectly use NOAA nautical chart products through third-party software applications on electronic chart plotters using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or mobile devices. Nautical charts are also important for the international shipping industry. Cargo ships continue to increase in size and draft and need more logistical support to navigate new waters. When a new ship arrives at an American port, they are required to use NOAA nautical charts to understand water depths and the port shoreline infrastructure to determine whether their ship can enter. If mariners cannot rely on nautical charts as an accurate and up-to-date product, ships may avoid U.S. ports and go elsewhere to unload their cargo. 119 In addition, NOAA's nautical charts are the authoritative source for maritime regulation and political boundaries (e.g. Exclusive Economic Zone, EEZ). Further, when a marine accident occurs, the Nautical Chart in use at the time serves as a record for reconstructing the event and assigning liability in a court of law. These events include grounding, collision, and other accidents. Charts that are used to reconstruct these incidents can also be used for training purposes. 120 Finally, nautical charts directly inform several other NOAA products, as well as products developed other government agencies and the private sector. Figure A.3 presents the official NOAA products and services that directly depend on nautical charts.\nCPC provides information contained in the ENSO weekly updates and diagnostic discussions primarily to government stakeholders. Internal users of this information within NOAA include NWS weather forecast offices. Other government users include FEMA, DOD, USAID, and state and local agencies whose operations or decisions are impacted by shortterm climate variations. CPC provides briefings on the information contained in the ENSO Outlook to these various federal, state and local stakeholders. The ENSO blog is meant for the public and is mostly used by people with an interest in short-term climate forecasts. The blog uses less technical language than the other products and is more readable. NOAA has received positive feedback on the blog as means of communication from various stakeholders. 136 The information provided in the ENSO Outlook and associated dissemination venues can affect the decisions and management actions of many different types of stakeholders. For example, a water resource manager, such as the Tampa Bay Water Authority may look at predicted precipitation levels in the ENSO Outlook and make decisions about reservoir releases. Emergency management agencies use ENSO-related information to appropriately prepare and allocate resources to areas that will likely experience adverse effects as a result of El Nino or La Nina. Other state and local agencies affected by ENSO-related conditions include those related to transportation and energy. There are also many private sector users of the ENSO outlook, including agriculture, retail, energy, fisheries, and outdoor recreation/tourism. For example, CPC has a longstanding collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The ENSO information can inform farmers' decisions on which crops to plant and when to plant based on expected precipitation levels and other factors. In December 2016, the Department of Interior's Climate Hub hosted a A-17 briefing in West Texas with private stakeholders and scientists to discuss ENSO forecasts. The goal was to help stakeholders understand short-term climate forecasts including the ENSO Outlook and use that information to decide when to plant their winter wheat. Through these briefings, stakeholders have the tools necessary to get the maximum benefit from the forecasting information provided by the CPC. Private retailers or grocery chains may use the data to rearrange merchandise based on seasonal expectations. Mild or warmer winters may affect private retail stock purchasing decisions. The CPC recently held a briefing with over 100 participants from various grocery chains including Walmart on the record El Nino from last year. The briefing included the same information from the Diagnostic Discussions and Weekly Updates. The participants also asked specific questions and used this information to adjust their inventory for seasonal products. For example, they would not want to send many snow shovels or winter coats to areas expected to have mild winters. The energy sector serves as another example of a private industry that is affected by ENSO conditions, and that therefore benefit from the information provided in the ENSO Outlook. For example, mild and warmer winters due to El Nino can have a large impact on fuel markets due to changes in winter heating demand. 137 If fuel market decision makers learn of expected normal or below normal temperatures, the fuel market can adjust depending on where there will be more heat days or less heat days. Finally, the information in the ENSO Outlook feeds several different NOAA products, including the Hurricane Outlook, the 1-Month and 3-Month Climate Outlook, Sea Ice Forecast, and climate analysis tools. These products reach an even greater number of users, thereby increasing the value of this product.\nThe primary purpose of the NMS Condition Reports is to inform sanctuary management decisions. Effective management of the sanctuaries, in turn, benefits society by []. The Condition Reports serve as an important input into the Sanctuary Management Plan Review Process. Aside from sanctuary staff, the process also involves Sanctuary Advisory Councils comprised of sanctuary staff, members of the public that represent different interests and industries, and jurisdictional partners from local, state, tribal and federal agencies. 154 In addition to summarizing the current condition of key resources in the sanctuary, each Condition Report also describes pressures that threaten these resources. In most cases, NOS NMS will publish a management plan a few years after they develop a Condition Report that addresses the threats described in the report. 155 The Sanctuary Management Plan summarizes existing programs and regulations, lays out the goals and priorities for sanctuary, and guides the future project planning and management decision-making at the sanctuary. 156 The Management Plan affects all sanctuary activities including resource protection, conservation science, research, and education. The Condition Reports also serve as an internal reporting tool for NOAA and the Department of Commerce. 157 The Reports notes where the sanctuaries are achieving resource protection and improvement goals, and where more work may need to be done. Together, the reports help NOAA better understand the state of the sanctuary network, and develop appropriate management actions. In addition, the sanctuaries also work closely with organizations, such as universities and independent non-profit organizations that use the data from the Condition Reports in their independent research projects. This research leads to 147  Universities also support and fundraise for education and outreach efforts conducted by the sanctuaries.\nInformation from the Tsunami Inundation Forecast Model directly informs community and regional planning efforts related to tsunami response and evacuation. First, NTHMP works with local emergency managers to convert SIMs and site-specific TIMs into mitigation and evacuation plans for various tsunami scenarios. NOAA funds these processes and sets guidelines for how mitigation plans and evacuation maps should be created. 194 During an actual tsunami, communities reference the TIMs to understand how NWTC's forecasted tsunami wave height would affect their community and related response actions. For example, after an earthquake of a certain magnitude, NOAA's Tsunami Emergency Centers work as quickly as possible to assess the likely wave height/amplitude of a subsequent tsunami, and pinpoint the locations most at risk. This process takes approximately five minutes from the time an earthquake occurs off the coast to the time that the first amplitude numbers and locations are published. The alert along with the first bulletin goes to Weather Forecast Offices, NOAA Weather Radio, Emergency Alert System Network (banner along the bottom of the TV), and the National Weather Service standard dissemination procedures. 195 State and local emergency officials receive this information from these sources. After the first alert, emergency managers begin to execute their full response protocol and issue evacuation orders based on the predicted wave amplitude and the results of their pre-run site-specific TIMs. Meanwhile, NTWC works to get out more refined information in a second and third alert, which allows managers to re-examine their TIMs, scale back their response and take a more measured approach, if warranted. These alerts are usually out within 20 minutes. 196 It is important to note that the time and distance from the earthquake source and the coast varies by event. In some areas, including parts of Washington and Oregon, the time to the coast can be as short as 20 minutes. In these cases, emergency managers will not have time to adjust their response based on up-to-date forecast information and will have to rely solely A-30 on the first warning. In other cases, such as Hawaii, the time to the coast is much longer so local officials can use the second and third alerts provided by the emergency center to modify their response. 197 States and individual communities also use SIMs and TIMS to develop appropriate tsunami mitigation actions before an event occurs. For example, planners use information from SIMs and TIMs to assess inundation risks and to make decisions about the location of critical infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, water and wastewater infrastructure, hospitals, and implement other preparatory actions. In the event that critical infrastructure is located within an expected inundation zone, communities can develop alternative response actions, such as the use of alternative power sources or shelters for people directly affected by inundation. 198 There is also a large demand for the data from SIMs and TIMs from U.S. universities. Academics use this data to conduct further research on tsunamis. In particular, these users examine ways to better predict the tsunami threats that many people face. They also consider the potential for tsunami threats in areas that are not typically considered threat areas. 199\nThere are many users of the HABs forecasts, many of whom subscribe to receive HAB forecasts from NOAA. Subscribers receive seasonal and weekly forecasts and are kept informed via the NE PSP Listserv. Subscribers include a variety of types of users, including federal and state government agencies, research/academic institutions, industry representatives, regional observing system representatives, and Canadian scientists. 222 Industry subscribers include members of the fishing/aquaculture industry, makers of HAB sensors and toxin tests, and consulting firms. Federal users are primarily within NOAA and the FDA (with indirect interest due to their responsibility to regulate food sources), but also include users in the EPA and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Council. 223 HABs forecasts are used by local authorities and other public decision-makers to guide their efforts to protect public health. State shellfish managers are responsible for sampling and testing different areas of the coast to assess the toxicity levels of the water and the shellfish. These resource managers use the HAB forecasts to determine where they should sample and perform these tests. If toxic levels of shellfish poison are found in the sampled shellfish, state shellfish managers must determine how much of the beach or the intertidal and submerged lands will be closed to shellfishing until subsequent tests show that the HAB has dissipated. 224 These closures are motivated by public health concerns and these officials do not consider the commercial costs associated with these closures when making these decisions. 225 The HAB forecasts allow state shellfish managers and public health officials to close fishing areas and beaches more selectively and precisely, thereby minimizing economic impacts due to lost landings or lost tourism. 226 In Maine, weekly A-36 forecasts also help managers carve out exception areas where shell fish harvesters can work even when much of the coast is closed. 227 In some cases, these forecasts can help state officials secure resources to mitigate the effects of HABs. One former manager in the Maine Department of Marine Resources used the seasonal HAB forecast to convince the State Legislature to budget enough funds for monitoring for the season. 228 Members of the aquaculture industry can also use the HAB forecasts to make management decisions. For example, when a HAB is predicted, harvesters can use HAB forecast information to harvest their shellfish early. 229 As climate change leads to an increase in frequency, intensity, duration and geographic distribution of HABs, fish are more likely to be recurrently exposed to HABs. More efforts are being made to understand the longer-term effects of the resulting toxins on fish at individual, population, and community levels. 230 The results of this research may indicate to fisheries managers the extent to which HAB forecasts should influence fishery management actions.\nHypoxia Watch offers the first look at the season's hypoxia conditions and provides critical information for management of the hypoxic zone in the Gulf. This information is accessed by users in two main wayseither directly from the Hypoxia Watch website through contour maps and the underlying DO data, or through forecast and management models of Gulf hypoxia, for which the DO data from Hypoxia Watch data are critical inputs. The Hypoxia Watch product itself is not a forecast of hypoxic conditions, but rather a mapping of current and historical DO data. However, the Hypoxia Watch DO data are critical inputs to 3D time-variable, hydrodynamic, and biogeochemistry models that characterize the hypoxic zone and its ecological impacts. The information provided in the Hypoxia Watch can directly affect both up-and downstream management practices, and is an essential baseline dataset for researchers, educators, and decision-makers. The interagency Mississippi River/Gulf A-39 of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force (Hypoxia Task Force, HTF), which has a Coastal Goal to reduce the size of the hypoxic zone by watershed nutrient reductions, relies on Hypoxia Watch maps and data for information on seasonal dynamics of the hypoxic zone. This information is important to delineate natural from manmade (e.g. nutrient loading) causes of the hypoxic zone, and to differentiate between hypoxic regions driven by Mississippi River runoff and those resulting from runoff from Texas rivers. Hypoxia Watch products are routinely presented by NOAA NCCOS to the HTF through reports and presentations. In every year since 2010, Hypoxia Watch products have been used to inform proceedings of the Annual NOAA/NGI Gulf Hypoxia Research Coordination Workshop, which has an overarching goal to strengthen communication and coordination between invested researchers and stakeholders to advance management of the hypoxic zone and its impacts. Hypoxia Watch outputs are particularly important to meeting workshop objectives on advancing Gulf hypoxia monitoring and mitigation of ecosystem impacts. For example, the 5 th Annual Workshop focused on prioritizing fishery management needs, and identifying ways to \"best predict and assess the effects of diversions and hypoxia on fisheries through ecological modeling tools\". 241 Hypoxia Watch data will be critical to the success of three new projects supported through the NOAA Northern Gulf of Mexico Ecosystems and Hypoxia Assessment Program (NGOMEX), which are focused on advancing ecological models used to inform water quality and resource managers of the predicted responses of fisheries to future scenarios of hypoxia extent and severity. 242 NOAA-supported scientists use the DO data and maps to help plan ship and glider surveys of the hypoxic zone. Maintaining these data is important to the HTF and other management efforts that aim to mitigate Gulf hypoxia (e.g. Louisiana Master Plan, Landscape Conservation Cooperative Mississippi River Basin/Gulf Hypoxia Initiative) or that target ecosystem restoration goals that include the hypoxic zone region\". 243 Other systems such as fixed observation systems, chartered research vessels, and gliders compliment the NOAA-supported and state cruises to complete the picture of the Gulf hypoxic zone. 244 Hypoxia Watch and forecast/management model results that rely on Hypoxia Watch data are also a source of information for educating stakeholders, politicians, managers and citizens about Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. These models allow managers to characterize the multiple factors affecting the hypoxic zone, including nutrient loading from the Mississippi River watershed. Twelve state agencies within the Mississippi Watershed have nutrient loading reduction goals, and data provided by the HTF, including the Hypoxia Watch data, helps these agencies better understand the status and progress of hypoxia mitigation allowing them to use the most effective management strategies. Data on the hypoxic zone also influence the U.S.D.A.'s Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative, which supports nutrient, tillage, and residue management projects to reduce hypoxic effects in the Gulf. 245 While state actions to reduce watershed nutrient loading are voluntary, a strong scientific foundation with increased monitoring efforts helps ensure effective management. 246 "}, {"section_title": "A-8", "text": "The SLR viewer has enabled communities and areas to assess vulnerability in dollar terms on a local scale.

NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Coast Survey (OCS) is responsible for producing a suite of over 1,000 nautical charts that cover the coasts of U.S. states and territories, as well as the Great Lakes. 104 NOAA's nautical charts show water depths, shoreline of adjacent land, prominent topographic features, aids to navigation (including locations of dangers to navigation), anchorages, and other features. 105 Nautical charts come in two forms, as paper charts and electronically. Paper charts are more traditional, and are less in use today. NOAA used to print NOAA lithograph nautical charts in large runs and sell them to commercial chart agents who would then distribute them to the public. However, the Federal Aviation Administration took over federal chart production in 1999 and closed the printing operation as a cost-saving measure on April 13, 2014. Instead, NOAA has formed partnerships with print-ondemand (POD) distributors. These distributors take orders from the public and print the most up-to-date version of the chart from the NOAA website. NOS updates each chart online every week. Thus, individuals can be certain that they are purchasing the most up to date version of the chart the moment it is printed. 106 NOAA-certified vendors print and sell paper charts throughout the world. Individuals can also purchase and print charts for free directly from NOAA's OCS website. In today's world, electronic charts are more popular and mandated for certain commercial vessels. There are two digital formats for electronic charts, Raster Nautical Charts (RNC) and Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC). The RNC is a simple digital image of the paper chart, while the ENC carries a significantly greater amount of information that can help warn mariners of dangers ahead and provide other information critical to a safe passage. ENCs are basically geographic information systems; they utilize a computerized system called an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) to display the chart data and the ship's position. The ENCs digital format allows quicker updates, which means the mariner has the most up to date information to make a safe passage. This same data can also be used for ocean modeling and other scientific activities. Finally, NOAA also receives information from the recreational boating community through a Cooperative Charting Program with the U.S. Power Squadrons (USPS) and the Coast Guard Auxiliary. USPS members and the Coast Guard can report any chart discrepancies to NOAA online. If the update is deemed critical it is applied to the nautical chart."}, {"section_title": "Complementary Products", "text": "In addition to nautical charts produced by NOAA and certified POD vendors, there are several software companies that use electronic nautical charts to build mapping applications for recreational boaters.

NOS is currently working to format the data that goes into Nautical Charts in a way that makes it easier for these software developers to use."}, {"section_title": "A-12", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "NOAA Fleet Data That Feed the Product", "text": "One of the main inputs to the ENSO Outlook is data from the Tropical Atmosphere/Ocean (TAO) array. The TAO array consists of 70 buoys moored (\"moorings\") in the Pacific Ocean that collect oceanographic and meteorological data. 128 The NOAA fleet maintains the TAO array and transmits the data from these moorings electronically through satellites. 129 Ships go to each buoy once a year to perform necessary maintenance including repairing any damage caused by biological activity, or local fisherman. Basic measurements on TAO moorings include wind speeds, air temperature, relative humidity, sea surface temperature, and subsurface temperatures at 10 levels. 130 Additional sensors can collect data on rainfall, short wave and long-wave radiation, barometric pressure, salinity and ocean currents. 131 The ENSO Outlook relies on weekly sea surface temperature readings and salinity profiles from the TAO array. In addition to data from the TAO array, CPC also relies on ocean profile data collected directly from NOAA fleet vessels, including conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) and expendable bathythermograph (XBT) data, to develop the ENSO Outlook. The Voluntary Observing Ship Program, which the NOAA fleet is a part of, also provide sea surface temperature and weather data.\nThe NOAA fleet provides key data that serves as the basis for many conclusions in the NMS Condition Reports. For example, NOAA vessels participate in habitat characterization for NMS through seafloor mapping surveys. They also collect data on species abundance, diversity and distribution of fish and marine mammals within the sanctuary through bird and mammal observation stations and acoustic surveys. Other NOAA ship data that are often incorporated into the Conditions Reports include information from water quality surveys (e.g., harmful algal blooms), ocean profile data that informs hypoxia forecasts, and processed hydrographic data from NOAA ship bathymetry surveys. While most sanctuaries have access to a sanctuary vessel, these vessels can be smaller and less effective than the NOAA Fleet. The NOAA research vessels are critical for gathering data in seasons where the sanctuary vessel is too harsh for the operation of smaller vessels, such as April, May and June. 146 Some sanctuaries see large seasonal changes in species composition, so it is important to get measurements during each season. NOAA vessels also allow sanctuary staff to spend more days at sea, and reach parts of the sanctuary that are not accessible using the sanctuary vessel because of the distance from ports. They are also able to conduct research in deeper areas of individual sanctuaries. Ultimately, NOAA vessels streamline the data collection process ensuring that it is comprehensive and timely. For example, for their 2010 Condition Report the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary was able to complete A-20 sampling for the entire sanctuary in nine days using the Bell M. Shimada vessel. 147 The data gathered by NOAA vessels like the Bell M. Shimada on habitat characterization and species composition are used to answer the 17 questions within each Condition Report. NOAA weather buoys, many of which are serviced by the NOAA Fleet, also serve as a data source for the Condition Reports of each sanctuary. These buoys collect data on weather and ocean conditions, including oceanographic variables that contribute to these Condition Reports. 148\nNOAA uses three primary types of data to develop standard fish stock assessments, including abundance data, catch data, and biological data. NMFS uses NOAA ships and charter vessels to conduct abundance surveys, as well as to collect biological data that inform stock the assessments, while catch data typically comes from dockside monitoring, fishermen's logbooks, observations from fishing vessels, and telephone interviews. Collecting abundance and biological fish stock data is a primary purpose for 10 of the 16 ships in NOAA's fleet. These ships are equipped with special technologies and experienced crew members that support various data collection methodologies, including electronic catch monitoring, advanced monitoring equipment attached to traditional sampling gear, visual surveys using imaging systems and robotic and autonomous underwater vehicles, non-extractive hydroacoustic technology for abundance sampling, and electronic fish tags. 166 Data collection methodologies depend on which category the sampling falls under, and can include electronic catch monitoring, advanced monitoring equipment attached to traditional sampling gear, visual surveys using imaging systems and robotic and autonomous underwater vehicles, non-extractive hydroacoustic technology for abundance sampling, and electronic fish tags. 167 NMFS feeds the abundance, catch, and biological data into mathematical models that produce time series of historical, current, and forecast fish abundance and fishing mortality rates \nThe HAB forecasts for the Gulf of Maine rely on data from several NOAA ships. The NOAA ship Pisces helped build a map of cysts of harmful algae along the New England coast for use in HAB forecasts. The ship went on a seven-day voyage during which scientists collected more than 55 sediment core samples throughout the Gulf of Maine. Researchers will use these sediment samples to determine the presence and abundance of cysts of the harmful alga A. fundyense to incorporate into the forecasting of HAB events along the New England coast in 2017. 210 The Pisces also provides maintenance for the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS) moorings. 211 These moorings collect real-time weather and ocean data along with other platforms in the area which is incorporated into HABs forecast models. 212 Ships from the NOAA fleet also support HAB Forecasts by conducting NMFS NFSC Hydrographic Surveys. \nEach year from early June through mid-July, as part of the combined state/federal Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP), scientists aboard the NOAA research vessel Oregon II take measurements of DO and other water quality variables near the sea floor over the continental shelf from Texas to northwest Florida. Every one to three days, they transmit the data to NCEI scientists at Stennis Space Center, MS, who create contour maps based on these data, publish the maps and underlying data online for public use, and transmit the latest data and maps to Gulf hypoxia science partners. 240 "}, {"section_title": "Complementary Data", "text": "A second source of data for the ENSO outlook is the ARGO array. This global array of 3,800 floats provides data on subsurface temperature, salinity, and velocity of the upper 2000 meters of the ocean. 132 The ARGO floats go underwater to a depth of about 2 km and then come back to the surface to automatically transmit their data. They require much less A-16 maintenance than the TAO array because there are no vandalism issues. ARGO floats are not supported by the NOAA Fleet. The ENSO Outlook also uses satellite data on Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) to develop precipitation predictions. Data from the TAO array and other sources is incorporated into numerical models through the Climate Forecast System and the North American Multi-Model Ensemble. CPC uses the results of these models to develop the ENSO Outlook.\nSome of the data used for the NMS Condition Reports is collected by other vessels, including sanctuary vessels and chartered vessels. For example, the Monterey Bay, the Greater Farallones, and the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries all use one sanctuary vessel, the R/V Fulmar. The Fulmar goes about 40 miles offshore to collect data and its cruises are about 10 hours in length. 149 The vessel collects baseline data on emerging management issues such as invasive species and marine reserves. 150 This data helps inform management decisions and Condition Reports. 151 The Condition Reports also rely on data collected on chartered vessels. One such vessel is the E/V Nautilus, which explored five National Marine Sanctuaries in 2016 along the U.S. West Coast. 152 The Nautilus supported a variety of projects within each sanctuary by collecting important data including species surveys and sonar bathymetry and subbottom profiling data. 153 These data are also often used in the Condition Reports.\nThere are many other data sources that feed into the DEMs and the Tsunami Inundation Forecast Model overall. Aside from bathymetry data from the NOAA fleet, DEMs rely on coastal and marine Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), and historic soundings, as well as bathymetry data collected by private vessels. 189 184 To develop the Tsunami Forecast Inundation Model overall, NOAA also relies on data from the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) network and the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON). The DART network is an array of 39 buoy systems. Each buoy consists of a bottom pressure center at the bottom of the ocean that is tethered to a surface buoy. This detects and measures tsunami waves as they pass over and plays a key part in the forecast process. 190 Currently, a chartered ship named the Bluefin conducts all necessary maintenance on DART buoys; 191 however, the NOAA fleet maintained DART as recently as 2014, and may do so in the future. Tidal gauge observations from the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) also factor into the models. This data is important in developing SIMs because it is used to validate the model and can be used in real-time forecasting. 192 In addition to the DEMs, the Tsunami Inundation Model also relies on the results of two other models, the Propagation Database and the Method of Splitting Tsunami (MOST) model. NCTR creates and maintain the Propagation Database. The database is made up of a collection of tsunami propagation model runs that are pre-computed for tsunami source functions at certain locations along known and potential earthquake zones. The MOST numerical simulation model helps researchers study tsunami behavior and make long-term predictions about tsunamis. 193 NCTR uses the results from these models, the DEMs, and information from the DART and NWLON, to ultimately create SIMs and subsequent TIMs.\nIn addition to the cyst map, the NERACOOS moorings, and the NMFS NFSC Hydrographic Surveys provided by NOAA ships, the HAB Forecasts also rely on data from several other sources. For example, the HAB-OFS uses satellite imagery, field observations, models, public health reports, and buoy data to provide large spatial scale and a high frequency of observations required for these forecasts. 215 NOAA, National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences have funded research since the early 1990s, including both field and laboratory data, that has been used for developing and validating the HABs forecast model. 216 Specific data sources for the HAB Forecasts include the NOAA National Weather Service, the GNOME Oceanographic Data Server, the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (wind data), and NOAA CoastWatch (remote sensing data). The NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services conducts bloom analysis, and supports forecast production and outreach. NOAA Coastal Services Center and NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science both supported the scientific development. 217 Many institutions outside of government are also involved in this research. In the Gulf of Maine, three universities help gather and analyze data, the University of Massachusetts -Dartmouth, University of New Hampshire, and the University of Maine. In addition, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution participates in the research for the Bulletin. Canadian scientists have also been involved in the development of HAB Forecasts in the Gulf of Maine, as there are large"}, {"section_title": "Product Dissemination", "text": "The ENSO Outlook is disseminated in four ways: through web dissemination, weekly presentations, monthly discussions, and a blog. \nHAB forecasts for the Gulf of Maine have been distributed in two forms during the pilot phase: 1) a seasonal forecast issued prior to the bloom season, usually in March, and 2) weekly updates that provide both a hindcast of the bloom up to that date, and a forecast of bloom conditions for the coming week (HAB Bulletin). It is expected that future forecasts will follow this same format. 219 Both forecasts depend on high-resolution modeling of the region, in which regional models are nested in a global model. The global model used for forecasts is being transitioned from the HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model) to the NOAA Real Time Operational Forecast System (RTOFS). The nested set of models for the Gulf of Maine will be referred to as the Gulf of Maine Operational Forecast System (GoMOFS). The weekly updates are emailed to a subscriber list of various stakeholders including state and local coast resource managers, public health officials and research scientists twice a week during a HAB event and once a week during the HAB season. The format of each Bulletin varies by region but generally provides bloom analysis including information about the location, size and movement trajectory of algal blooms, predicting its location within the next 3-4 days. 220 In some cases, the Bulletin includes graphs of the winds and currents affecting the bloom. 221 This information is used by stakeholders to make important management decisions that minimize risks to the local population."}, {"section_title": "Ecosystem Management: National Marine Sanctuaries Conditions Reports Product Background", "text": "NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) currently maintains 13 National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS) and two national marine monuments.

The Condition Reports help sanctuaries determine if they are achieving their resource protection and improvement goals, and informs future management plans for the sanctuary. 143 Specifically, the reports summarize the current condition of resources in the Sanctuary, the pressures that threaten these resources, and the proposed management responses to these pressures. 144 Individual sanctuaries within the NOS Office of NMS produce the reports, with support from NMS headquarters. Each sanctuary releases an updated Condition Report every five years. The first condition report serves as a baseline assessment of sanctuary resources and focuses on characterizing the species and habitats in the sanctuary. Subsequent condition reports are meant to examine trends, identify how the status of various resources has changed, and establish appropriate management responses. Towards that end, all of the reports answer the same set of 17 questions that touch on a variety of topics including keystone species, keystone habitats, human influences, and climate change impacts. 145 Each sanctuary answers the questions with the goal of relating the report results back to sanctuary-specific regulation, education and outreach, and management actions."}, {"section_title": "Fisheries Management: Fisheries Stock Assessment Product Background", "text": "As part of fulfilling NOAA's responsibility for the stewardship of the nation's ocean resources and their habitat, NOAA conducts stock assessments to help manage commercial and recreational fish species. A stock assessment involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting demographic information to determine changes in the abundance of fishery stocks in response to commercial and recreational fishing and, to the extent possible, predict future trends of stock abundance. The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) manages roughly 500 fish stocks, with data and resources to assess approximately 200 of those stocks each year. 165 The NMFS Office of Science and Technology coordinates NOAA's national stock assessment enterprise. Stock assessments fall under the Healthy Oceans Fisheries Monitoring, Assessment, and Forecast MSA. Fisheries managers primarily use NOAA stock assessments to set catch limits and other regulations that prevent overfishing and provide optimal yield for commercial fishermen. This includes each of the eight regional fishery management councils in the U.S., which are required by mandate of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act to set annual catch limits for their region based on best available scientific data. Coastal, state and international organizations also rely on NOAA's stock assessments for non-federal and joint jurisdictional management of fish stocks.

In the event of a tsunami, state and local officials use short-term forecast information from the National Tsunami Warning Centers (NTWC) and the pre-run TIMs to guide their immediate response and keep their communities safe. The mapping data from TIMs also support community risk assessments, planning, and mitigation actions related to tsunamis.

In some cases, colonies of algae can grow out of control creating Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) or \"red tides,\" which produce toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals and birds. 203 There are several species of HABs that can lead to wild and domestic animal deaths, shellfish toxicity, adverse public health effects, and taste and odor problems in drinking water. 204 HABs have been spotted in all coastal areas of the United States, with different species affecting different regions of the country. NOAA has identified seven regions where HABs and can have large impacts on local and regional economies: \uf0b7 Florida and eastern Gulf of Mexico (Karenia brevis), \uf0b7 Western Gulf of Mexico (Karenia brevis), \uf0b7 Lake Erie (cyanobacteria), \uf0b7 Gulf of Maine (Alexandrium fundyense), \uf0b7 Washington Coast (Pseudo-nitzschia), \uf0b7 California Coast (multiple species), and \uf0b7 Chesapeake Bay (multiple species). 205 In response to this threat Congress passed the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (HABHRCA) in 1998. 206 The HABHRCA led to the development and funding of integrated regional programs, coordinated by NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), that focus on developing tools for detecting and predicting HABs, monitoring their toxicity and determining their effects on local wildlife, humans and local economies. 207 Today large regional ecosystem programs have been implemented in the Gulf of Mexico (in Florida and Texas), the Gulf of Maine and the Great Lakes. These programs make up the NNCCOS's Harmful Algal Bloom Operational Forecast System (HAB-OFS). The HAB-OFS relies on data from a variety of sources, including data collected from the NOAA fleet, to develop operational HAB forecasts. The forecasts predict and assess the extent of algal blooms, allowing state and local managers to more effectively sample and monitor HAB areas. 208 This in turn informs decisions about beach closures, shellfishing restrictions, and other HAB response actions. NOAA's goal is to ultimately develop a national forecast capacity through the HAB-OFS. NOAA anticipates that several new regions will be operational over the next decade. 209 This discussion focuses on HAB forecasts for the Gulf of Maine because NOAA ships contribute data that support HAB forecasts in this region and several studies have estimated the economic value of these forecasts.

BIAs include areas within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that are critical for animal reproduction, feeding, migration, or habitat for small and resident populations. 251 CetSound's underwater sound mapping working group, SoundMap, generated maps of temporal, spatial, and frequency characteristics of man-made underwater noise. SoundMap's website offers larger (regional or ocean basin) scale annual average sound field maps as well as more localized and comprehensive examples of short-term noise events. 252 These maps incorporate two aspects of mapping developed by separate working subgroups: extensive predictive modeling of areas in U.S. EEZ waters of the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Alaska where sound is likely to be produced; and mapping of four localized events of known noise-producing human activity such as military sonar training and oil and gas exploration and activity. 253 Having both cetacean and sound maps at their disposal allows ocean planners to better understand the effect of man-made noise for proposed activities. CetSound's products formed the initial scientific effort towards NOAA's 10-year vision for addressing ocean noise impacts, known as the Ocean Noise Strategy, including the implementation of the Ocean Noise Policy and Ocean Noise Procedure. NOAA has a close relationship with the U.S. Navy, who not only provides data for sound field mapping but is also a high-profile emitter of ocean noise, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and various non-governmental organizations.

The breadth of knowledge gained from these two tools allows for improved characterization and management of noise impacts on marine life and habitat, in particular on seasonally resident marine species that are not captured by empirical sound data collection. NOAA's Ocean Noise Strategy Roadmap includes two case studies that highlight the ability of ocean managers to understand noise impacts on critical marine life and habitat through cetacean and sound modeling. In the first, scientists combined CetMap's mapping tool methodology with higher resolution shipping data to identify and characterize noise impacts of shipping vessels to Baleen Whales off Southern California. The scientists recognized the need for uncertainty and risk metrics in the model, but their framework could be used to evaluate the consequences of potential shipping traffic management actions. 261 In the second study, a separate team studied the impacts of noise on spawning grounds using SoundMap model predictions and produced recommendations to protect these critical spawning grounds. These recommendations, which NOAA usually communicates to relevant action agencies through consultations, included spatial and temporal measures such as avoiding certain areas or time periods to reduce impact, water noise monitoring, and assessment of transiting vessel noise. The team suggested that NOAA work with the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Maritime Administration to evaluate chronic impacts in acoustically sensitive federally designated areas, evaluate impacts in key spawning locations associated with federal actions and predicted growth in East Coast shipping traffic, and encourage the implementation of new, voluntary guidelines to quiet commercial ships. These scientists also proposed that NOAA work with the U.S. Navy to assess overlap of training activity with acoustically sensitive federally designated areas. 262 NOAA's ONS identifies thirteen domestic policy acts such as the Endangered Species Act and the Mitchell Act under which ocean managers may be able to address noise issues. 263 However, organizations and entities outside of the federal government are responsible for many of the decisions that can reduce noise impacts on critical marine species and habitat, and CetSound's products can still influence these decisions. In 2014, for example, the Marine Environment Protection Committee approved guidelines for voluntary underwater noise reduction for member governments in the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that creates regulation and standards for the shipping industry. 264"}, {"section_title": "Fleet Emergency Response Services Background", "text": "Many maritime-related natural disasters and emergency situations require a coordinated response by U.S. government and non-government organizations. These events include hurricanes, oil spills, terrorist attacks, and other disasters. During, and immediately following these events, highly skilled crew members and vessels equipped with specific technologies are often needed to perform search and rescue activities, provide relief services, re-open affected ports, assess damages, and/or collect scientific data. Depending on the nature and extent of the disaster or emergency, the U.S. has a variety of potential maritime-based responders, including the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S. Navy, and multiple NOAA Line Offices and divisions. These agencies work with other federal, state, local, and non-profit organizations, including port authorities, maritime ship pilots, Air National Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Red Cross, and others, to launch coordinated land-, air-, and ocean-based response efforts. The NOAA Fleet is a key part of the ocean-related emergency and disaster response network, and are often called upon to provide the following emergency response services: \uf0b7 Survey our nation's ports and waterway in response to national security threats \uf0b7 Deliver emergency supplies, conduct hydrographic surveys so that ports can be re-opened, and assess hazardous materials, during and after hurricanes and other major storm events \uf0b7 Locate and map debris fields in the ocean for aviation and maritime disasters \uf0b7 Conduct a range of scientific surveys in response to major oil spills \uf0b7 Perform search, rescue, and evacuation services NOAA vessels have unique technologies that, when combined with their availability across an expansive geographic area, can provide superior, timely, and cost-effective response services in many emergency situations.

For example, after hurricanes and large storm events, crewmembers on NOAA vessels conduct hydrographic surveys to ensure safe navigation and re-opening of affected ports as directed by the U.S. Coast Guard. NOAA also uses ship hydrographic survey technologies, which include complete seafloor mapping systems, to map debris fields from aviation and maritime disasters. This enables the quick recovery of victims and flight recorders. Four NOAA ships, including Fairweather, Ferdinand R. Hassler, Rainier, and Thomas Jefferson, conduct hydrographic surveys, which NOS primarily uses to update the nation's suite of 1,000 nautical charts. These ships each have 2-6 smaller boats (called launches) that can be lowered into the water for surveying in shallow areas. NOAA's hydrographic survey ships are equipped with side-scan sonar (SSS) and single-or multi-beam sonar technology, which provides detailed and precise data on subsurface obstructions. 283284 In addition, the hydrographic surveys that NOS conducted prior to an event provide an immediate baseline comparison to conditions after a hurricane or disaster. Besides hydrographic survey capabilities, many NOAA vessels are equipped with biological, chemical, and acoustic data collection equipment necessary for toxicity and water quality testing, which can be beneficial to response efforts for major oil spills and hurricanes, where a range of immediate testing is often required."}, {"section_title": "A-51", "text": "The vast geographic area across which the NOAA Fleet operates also contributes to NOAA's response capabilities, because it typically means that at least one fleet vessel can respond to an emergency location in a timely manner.

Finally, as the administrator of all NOAA fleet activities, OMAO can easily coordinate across line offices to ensure that NOAA's other critical needs are being met throughout the emergency response period. Together, these factors often make it much more feasible and cost-effective to utilize NOAA Fleet vessels for emergency response activities, rather than having to pay charter vessels, which will likely charge premium prices (e.g., through time and materials contracts) for emergency situations, or even using other government-owned vessels. For example, NOAA/OMAO has a standard agreement in place with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) so that they can respond quickly in the event of an emergency; USACE requires that an arrangement be in place for each incident before they respond."}, {"section_title": "Emergency response services", "text": "The following sections provide an overview of the emergency and disaster response services, and associated value, that the NOAA Fleet provides, including services related to hurricanes, aviation disasters, oil spills, national security, and routine search and rescue activities."}, {"section_title": "Hurricanes", "text": "Aside from routine search and rescue activities, the emergency response activities that NOAA ships most commonly provide relate to hurricanes and large coastal storms. During and after hurricanes and other major storm events, NOAA ships conduct hydrographic surveys of ports and important waterways, assess hazardous materials, and provide emergency relief. USCG typically closes potentially-affected ports and shipping lanes 24 to 48 hours before a hurricane strikes. During the storm, a hurricane can cause hazardous situations for water-based traffic in and around ports by sinking harbored ships, knocking over/damaging oil platforms, washing land-based objects such as cars and shipping containers out to sea, moving the location of main shipping channel navigation buoys, and by changing the natural topography of the sea floor. These changes create a potentially hazardous situation for commercial, recreational, or government-owned vessels trying to enter the port. Accurate post-hurricane mapping of waterways allows partner agencies, such as USCG and USACE, to immediately clear sub-surface hazards so that vessels can re-enter economically significant waterways and ports. Reopening ports and harbors, such as New York, Baltimore and Norfolk after Hurricane Sandy, allowed commercial and naval vessels to continue normal operations. USCG reports that 95% of all goods in the U.S. economy come through U.S. ports. 285 Several estimates have been placed on the value of cargo that moves through U.S. ports. The Port of New York and New Jersey, for example, estimated that the value of all cargo that passed through that port alone was greater than $200 billion ($550 million per day, on average). 286 A 2012 study by NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) reports that that ocean commerce for the entire nation is worth more than $1 trillion. 287 By speeding up the process of clearing waterways, NOAA's emergency response capabilities can reduce the number of days a port is closed, allowing hundreds of millions of dollars of daily commercial activity to resume. In some cases, the re-opening of ports can allow for the delivery of essential relief supplies, such as fuel and food supplies. For example, during Hurricane Sandy, NOAA vessels' rapid surveying and charting response allowed the U.S Navy to make a relatively quick determination on possible subsurface obstructions. This led to the USCG Captain of the Port re-opening of many affected ports, which directly alleviated a regional fuel shortage that occurred in the days following the hurricane. In addition, naval vessels from Norfolk Naval Base that were scrambled to sea to avoid damage A-52 were able to return to port. Unnecessarily operating naval vessels at sea can be extremely expensive, not only monetarily but also operationally in terms of disrupting normal naval activities. As part of the hydrographic data collection efforts associated with hurricane response, scientists and engineers on NOAA vessels work closely with mapping partners from sister agencies, such as USACE and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), to coordinate mapping efforts using an Integrated Ocean and Coastal Mapping approach. The objective of this approach is to reduce redundancies and meet multiple missions with the same datasets. These datasets help state and federal partners with recovery from an event and to begin preparing for the next one. 288 In addition to hydrographic surveys, the NOAA Fleet also provides scientific support to hazardous materials response efforts in the wake of hurricanes. For example, NOAA ships have conducted post-hurricane surveys to identify vessels or containers that may be leaking fuel, oil, or other hazardous materials. During Hurricane Katrina, NOAA ships collected data to assess potential seafood contamination from these sources. In many cases, NOAA Fleet crew members also conduct search and rescue activities and deliver emergency supplies during or directly following a hurricane event.

After the Egypt Air Flight 990 crash in 1999 (31 October 1999), the NOAA ship Whiting scanned the seafloor south of Nantucket to find the primary debris field. NOAA's efforts allowed a remotely operated U.S. Navy vehicle to complete the search. Finally, the NOAA ship Rude also played key roles in the 1999 plane crash involving John F. Kennedy, Jr, ultimately finding the wreckage using side-scan and multi-beam sonar."}, {"section_title": "A-55", "text": "NOAA ships' disaster response capabilities are often essential to subsequent efforts in each emergency scenario. For example, pre-and post-event hydrographic surveying allows major ports and harbors to reopen to commercial shipping after hurricanes and other disasters. The ability of NOAA ships to immediately survey these areas allows important economic activity to resume. In 2015 alone, 1.39 billion short tons accounting for $1.56 trillion worth of U.S. goods moved through U.S. ports. Imports and exports via water represented 71% of U.S. imports and exports by weight and almost 42% of cargo value. 291 Debris field location and mapping helps other federal, state, and local groups tailor search and rescue operations for air disasters. Ships already designed for scientific data collection can easily be redeployed to help with critical sampling after major oil spills. These efforts save lives, allow for the continuation of commercial activities and the assessment of natural resource damages. In addition, crew members on NOAA vessels often perform relatively routine search and rescue activities as required by International Maritime law (International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979) and provide relief supplies to affected populations during emergencies. These activities have saved many lives over the course of the fleet's history. The ability of the fleet to respond to emergencies also can result in cost savings for U.S. taxpayers. NOAA vessels have unique technologies and are staffed with scientists and engineers with expertise in hydrographic and scientific data collection, which accounts for a large majority of response activities. In addition, NOAA ships are typically relatively easy to reroute with minimal impact to normal program activities. As a result of these factors, and combined with their availability across a wide geographic area, NOAA fleet vessels can often provide superior, more cost-effective and timely response capabilities compared with other potential responders. The benefits associated with emergency response by NOAA vessels can vary significantly depending on the nature and extent of the emergency or disaster.

Therefore, an average calculated from the aggregate data is not necessarily representative, particularly for contract vessels that might be the most effective substitutes for NOAA ships. Factors that must be considered in comparing unit costs for NOAA ships and contract vessels include the following: \uf0b7 A day at sea aboard a contract vessel is not necessarily equal to a day at sea aboard a NOAA vessel. NOAA ships often collect multiple data streams and/or conduct multiple missions simultaneously. Although some contract vessels, such as certain University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ships, 302 have similar multi-data stream/multi-mission capabilities, many vessels are better suited for individual projects and a more limited set of data. These \"economies of scope\" mean that multiple contract vessels can sometimes be required to replace the output of a NOAA vessel. In addition, NOAA uses NOAA ships for advancing technology through testing new equipment and procedures, maintaining and building expertise within the science field and marine operations. \uf0b7 NOAA ships have greater endurance than many smaller contract vessels. Therefore, they can remain at sea for the duration of long projects without returning to port. In addition, NOAA ships often can be scheduled and positioned to transition directly from one project to the next without significant travel time. Both of these factors mean that the use of contract vessels can, in some cases, entail more transit days (i.e., at the start and finish of the discrete projects for which they are hired and, in some cases, to resupply during longer projects). \uf0b7 Contract vessels used for missions with NOAA personnel aboard must meet certain safety standards. The aggregate data in Exhibit B -3 include missions without NOAA crew aboard. The vessels used for these missions might not meet these standards and, therefore, not be comparable to NOAA ships. Section 5 includes a more detailed discussion of safety standards. \uf0b7 Conversely, some contract vessels provide services that the NOAA fleet cannot (e.g., data collection in shallow waters). The aggregate data in Exhibit B -3 include such missions. Given these factors, unit costs calculated from aggregate data are not an appropriate basis for comparing costeffectiveness. Instead, the comparison must account for mission-specific details. Section 4 uses a case study approach to compare cost-effectiveness while accounting for such details.

Many other U.S. and international organizations also use TAO observations. 305 The NWS National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) uses vessels to service the TAO array by performing necessary maintenance including repairing any damage caused by biological activity or local fishermen. 306 Prior to 2012, NDBC relied on the NOAA ship Ka'imimoana to maintain the array. After the Ka'imimoana was removed from service in 2012, data availability from the TAO array suffered, dropping to as low as 28 percent in March 2014. 307 Since then, NDBC has used a combination of the NOAA ship Ronald H. Brown, UNOLS ships, and commercial contract vessels to service the array and maintain data availability above the 80 percent target performance level. 308,309 Cruises to maintain the TAO array also routinely support the deployment of Argo profiling floats for the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and surface drifting floats for the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (both part of NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research). 310 In conjunction with the maintenance, TAO cruises also sometimes incorporate scientific research that is directly related to operating the array. Such research includes meteorological and ocean observations during the maintenance operations, as well as while the vessel is underway to/from and within the cruise track, to validate the sensors on the moorings. Research also includes testing and evaluation of new sensors, systems and, technologies that could ultimately refresh, B-11 first scenario involving TAO maintenance and float deployment. It does not cover a vessel equipped to supply the requirements of the second scenario that includes related supplemental science. To substitute for the Ronald H. Brown in the second scenario would require the use of a UNOLS ship, such as the R/V Thomas G. Thompson or R/V Roger Revelle, which are equipped to collect the underway ocean observations and support the related supplemental science. 317,318 In fiscal year 2015, NDBC used a UNOLS vessel for TAO maintenance for 40 days at sea at a cost of $1.71 million, or $42,750 per day. 319,320 This cost would cover supplying the requirements discussed above for the second scenario. 321 Discussion: Exhibit B -5 compares the costs for a typical 40-day TAO cruise (including transit time) under the two scenarios discussed above.

Although the commercial vessels are not outfitted for research, NDBC prefers this mechanism in some cases due to ease of access and scheduling. 323 These agreements provide NDBC with access to at least six different global class vessels (and several smaller vessels). In addition to supporting NOAA mooring maintenance, the NDBC subject matter expert indicated that these commercial vessels also likely support other uses including the offshore oil and gas industry, offshore construction, and marine salvage.

Additional objectives included characterizing the ecosystem within the study area, research on mid-trophic level organisms (prey) and non-protected apex predators (sea birds), and identification of cetacean species of special interest. Operations conducted included: visual surveys, biopsy sampling, photography, opportunistic retrieval of marine mammal body parts and bird specimens, passive acoustic sampling to locate and record organisms, oceanography, and El Nino biological sampling. 326 Mission Requirements: CalCurCEAS 2014 consisted of 117 days at sea in five legs, plus three days of staging and set up (total 120 days), with 15 or 16 scientific personnel aboard for each leg. The mission departed from and ultimately B-14 industry-specific index to the contract cost results in an escalated cost of $2,350,048. 336 Although this adjustment is small, it reflects the change between 2014 and 2015 in prices received by producers in the NAICS category to which Ocean Services LLC belongs, allowing a consistent basis for comparison to the 2015 data on the cost of the NOAA fleet. The data collected aboard the Ocean Starr were the same as would have been collected aboard the Reuben Lasker. There were, however, certain trade-offs that included the following: 337 1. The Reuben Lasker has its own dedicated oceanographic science technicians; the cruise as conducted aboard the Ocean Starr required additional oceanographic technicians among the NOAA personnel. 2. Small boat operations were acceptable aboard the Ocean Starr, but more difficult than they would have been aboard the Reuben Lasker, primarily due to crew training and familiarity. 3. The Reuben Lasker is quieter, so passive acoustic data collection would probably have been improved due to less noise interference. 338 4. The Ocean Starr is more maneuverable and the bow deck is closer to the water; these factors improved NOAA's ability to collect biopsy samples from animals near the bow. 339 To account for the labor-related differences identified in items (1) and (2) above, we adjusted the estimated cost of using the Ocean Starr as discussed below. Data are not available to monetize the data collection/data quality differences identified in the other items. Because there are advantages to each ship, these latter items might offset one another to some extent. The NOAA scientific team aboard the Ocean Starr for CalCurCEAS 2014 included one oceanographic technician. As noted in item (1) above, aboard the Reuben Lasker, the ship's existing complement of oceanographic science technician would have supplied this labor, the cost of which is included in the marginal cost for the Reuben Lasker estimated in Section 2. Therefore, in using the Ocean Starr, there was an additional labor cost to NOAA, over and above the contract cost. Data are not available on salary and benefits for the specific NOAA oceanographic technicians employed during CalCurCEAS 2014. To estimate the value of the additional NOAA labor, we used a rate of $503 per person-day. This rate reflects the average salary and benefits for fiscal year 2015 for crew serving aboard the NOAA fleet, calculated from the same data underlying the marginal cost estimates for the NOAA fleet in Section 2. Applying this average rate to the 120 person-days of additional NOAA oceanographic technician labor required aboard the Ocean Starr, results in an additional labor cost of $60,360. 340 Because this value is based on a 2015 labor rate, no escalation is required. According to one NOAA subject matter expert, the difficulties with small boat operations aboard the Ocean Starr could have been alleviated by an additional contract deckhand. The subject matter expert estimated the cost of the additional deckhand would have been approximately $400 per day, based on an estimated salary of $200 to $250 per day and incorporating overhead and profit. 341 Applying this rate to 120 days at sea results in a labor cost of $48,000 in 2014 dollars. 342 Escalating this labor using the appropriate annual average employment cost index (ECI) increases the labor 336 The annual average PPI for NAICS category 483 was 138.5 for 2014 and 138.9 for 2015. Applying these values to the contract cost results in the following calculation: $2,343,280 x 138.9/138. Adding these labor adjustments to the escalated contract cost results in a total cost for using the Ocean Starr of $2,459,353 in 2015 dollars. 344 This estimated cost accounts for supplying all of the requirements discussed above. Discussion: Exhibit B -6 compares the cost of using the Ocean Starr for CalCurCEAS 2014 to the cost of using the Reuben Lasker. Even after accounting for the additional labor required to make the comparison equivalent, the cost of using the Ocean Starr for CalCurCEAS 2014 was much lower than the estimated cost of using the Reuben Lasker. Notes: \uf0b7 Contract vessel cost based on actual contract cost for the Ocean Starr, escalated to 2015 dollars and incorporating the additional labor costs described in the text. \uf0b7 NOAA ship cost based on 120 days at sea using the Reuben Lasker at the marginal cost estimated in Section 2. One explanation for the low cost of the Ocean Starr may be that she is nearing the end of her useful life and not being maintained for longevity, according to one NOAA subject matter expert. 345 The Ocean Starr was still in operation as of July 2016, however, when she completed a cruise supporting the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program. 346 Ocean Services LLC did not respond to a request for an interview, so information about the vessel's future availability and price is not available. Another explanation for the large difference in cost may be that the estimated fiscal year 2015 marginal costs may not be representative of normal operations for the Reuben Lasker. The vessel was at the start of her service life and only executed 80 days at sea. Although more recent cost data for the Reuben Lasker might show the difference to be less dramatic, they are unlikely to change the conclusion. The cost of the Ocean Starr for CalCurCEAS 2014 was less than 120 days at sea even aboard the NOAA ship with the lowest fiscal year 2015 marginal cost."}, {"section_title": "Sanctuary Ecosystem Assessment Surveys (SEAS): Greater Farallones and Cordell Banks National Marine Sanctuaries", "text": "Mission Description: The Sanctuary Ecosystem Assessment Surveys (SEAS) for the Greater Farallones and Cordell Banks National Marine Sanctuaries was a project for the NOS Office of National Marine Sanctuaries conducted in 2016.

The NCRMP provides scientific information required to track the health of coral reefs and delivers a variety of products to support resource managers and decision-makers, including coral reef Status and Trends Report Cards, a product for which the main body of this report describes societal benefits. The NCRMP relies on vessels to collect benthic and other habitat mapping data over a wide geographic region. The specific vessels that NCRMP uses, however, vary depending on the region of the world. 365 This case study provides a quantitative cost-effectiveness comparison specifically for an example mission in the Pacific. The discussion section below, however, also provides a qualitative discussion of the NCRMP's use of contract vessels for Atlantic coral reef areas. The example mission considered here was conducted in 2015 under the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (which is NCRMP in the Pacific). The objective of the American Samoa Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) was to conduct ecosystem monitoring and research in the coral reef habitats of American Samoa and the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. Activities conducted included: self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) dives from small boats, towed-diver surveys of coral reef ecosystems and marine life, recovery and replacement of biological and oceanographic sea-floor instruments, collection and analysis of water samples, and coral reef mapping using multi-beam sonar. In addition to supporting the NCRMP, the data collected also supported NOAA's ocean acidification program to monitor and understand the effects of ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems. 366,367 Mission Requirements: The 2015 American Samoa RAMP consisted of 103 days at sea departing from and returning to Oahu, Hawaii, including a total of nine days of transit to and from the study area. The voyage was conducted in three legs with an intermediate port between legs in American Samoa. Requirements for the vessel used to support the mission were the following: 368 \uf0b7 Global class endurance, capable of operating for 34 or more days at sea. \uf0b7 Accommodations and provisions for a NOAA scientific team of 24 people. \uf0b7 Stowage for equipment supplied by NOAA including: a lab van (80 square feet and 8,000 pounds), two 19-foot small boats and spare outboard (9,500 pounds total), SCUBA and survey gear for the NOAA science team including spare compressor (1,400 pounds), and additional electronics. \uf0b7 Access to, and support in launching and recovering, three additional small work boats capable of carrying two to seven passengers with SCUBA and survey gear. \uf0b7 Multi-beam sonar for reef mapping and access to a mapping launch capable of deploying multi-beam sonar in shallow waters. \uf0b7 Access to on-board hyperbaric decompression chamber for emergency use."}, {"section_title": "B-22", "text": "service code identified in the system. Because USAspending's contract descriptions are brief, this approach is imperfect and was not able to identify all of NOAA's vessel contracts. Exhibit B -10 compares the value of contracts identified in the USAspending data with NOAA's actual spending on contract vessels presented in Section 3. Spending identified in USAspending is the total base and all exercised options value of transactions filtered as described in the text from all NOAA contracts for fiscal year 2015. Acronyms and Abbreviations: NESDIS = National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service; NMFS = National Marine Fisheries Service; NOS = National Ocean Service; NWS = National Weather Service; OAR = Oceanic and Atmospheric Research For NMFS and NWS, the value of contracts identified in the USAspending data for fiscal year 2015 accounts for more than 90 percent of the actual spending on contract vessels by each of these programs. For NOS, on the other hand, the approach used to identify vessel contracts appears to miss most of the spending on hydrographic services. This result is not unexpected, given that these contracts are structured as data buys instead of traditional charters. The approach also misses most contract vessel spending by Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service. Even with these limitations, however, the data extracted from USAspending capture 44 percent of NOAA's total spending on contract vessels, and 80 percent of the total if hydrographic services are excluded. Therefore, data derived from examining the selected contracts may be reasonably representative of the majority of NOAA's vessel contracts, especially for NMFS and NOS. This representativeness is important because the USAspending data allow examining details about NOAA's vessel contracting that are not readily available elsewhere (i.e., number of vendors used, number of offerors)."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit B -10: Completeness of Vessel Contract", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Capacity and Availability", "text": "Collection of comprehensive information on the total number of vessels with capabilities useful to NOAA that might be available under contract was beyond the scope of this analysis.

Although willing to make changes, this institution considers safety carefully before making major modifications, including engaging the services of a marine architect when needed. 399 Examining the information from interviewees in conjunction with the data from USAspending suggests the following conclusions about capacity and availability. The overall size of the charter vessel industry is large and NOAA successfully contracts with a variety of different providers. Individual vendors are generally willing and available to provide support, even to the extent of modifying their vessels to suit project needs. Specific projects, however, may have requirements (e.g., vessel capabilities, project scheduling, or location) that are not a good match for a very large number of vessels.

Changes in fuel prices would, of course, affect both charter vessels and the NOAA fleet. Therefore, the impact of such changes on relative cost effectiveness would be limited to some extent. Outside of major changes in fuel prices, most interviewees, including all of those willing to make a prediction, predicted only small increases in the prices for their services. The most common prediction was in the range of a two to three percent annual increase. As a point of reference for their predictions, two of the interviewees noted that prices have not changed substantially recently. These statements are generally consistent with the trends observed in the PPI for the water transportation industry, used elsewhere in this analysis. PPIs measure the average change over time in the selling prices received by U.S. producers of goods and services. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes PPIs for various industries and groups of products. In this case, we examined the PPI for the water transportation industry (NAICS category 483, which is the category to which many of NOAA's contract vessel providers belong). PPIs measure price changes with respect to a base period, for which the index is set to 100. The PPI for the water transportation industry specifically measures price changes in relation to a base period of December 2003. Thus, the difference between the current value of the index and 100 reflects the percent change in prices since December 2003. 400 So, if the annual average PPI for 2016 was 131.5, it means that prices in 2016 were, on average, 31.5 percent higher than in December 2003. Exhibit B -14 shows annual average values for the PPI for the water transportation industry for the last five years. 401 With the exception of a moderate decrease in 2016, prices in this industry have remained fairly stable.

These factors differ across NOAA programs. For example, the NDBC has a marine services contract vehicle that allows it to access commercial vessels to perform mooring maintenance. Because of this mechanism, when contract vessels can meet the mission requirements (e.g., ancillary science is not required), NDBC finds it easy to access and schedule them. 402 Other programs, however, do not have the mechanisms or budget to readily access charters. For example, when an individual marine sanctuary receives ship time on the NOAA fleet, that allocation is paid out of the larger NOS budget, not out of the sanctuary's budget. If the NOAA ship time is not available, the sanctuary does not receive additional budget to replace that time using a charter vessel or vessels. 403 For still other programs, the fleet allocation process may create an incentive to use charters.
