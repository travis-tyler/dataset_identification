Cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, accounting for 70% of all deaths or approximately 1.7 million each year [1]. These diseases are also responsible for some type of medication use, procedure or limitation/lifestyle change in the daily lives of nearly 1 out of every 10 Americans (roughly 25 million people) [1]. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) states, in discussion about chronic disease prevention, \"although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable\" [2]."}, {"section_title": "The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association and American Diabetes", "text": "Association all agree that among other preventative measures, regular visits to primary care physicians are the most effective means of reducing the negative effects of these chronic diseases [3]. Further, the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), in its 19 th report to Congress, states that a growing body of research shows the United States is facing an increasing shortage of primary care physicians and specialists over the next 20 years [4]. The cost of medical care in the US topped $2.4 trillion in 2008 (about $7,900 per person) and accounted for 17 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP) [5]. Without substantial change in our health care system, health care spending in the US is expected to increase, reaching an estimated $4 trillion by 2015, or 20 percent of US GDP [6]. Most of these costs are passed along to consumers in a variety of forms, including increased insurance premiums, higher bills at each office visit, and increased state and federal taxes to pay for hospital, ambulance and 911 services. Routine primary physician care helps Americans lower their medical costs by decreasing the need for future services and preventing avoidable hospitalizations and emergency services [7,8,9]. However, as of 2006, about 20 percent of the US population resided in places, both rural and urban, that were considered medically underserved areas (MUAs) as defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services [10]. Starfield [1] has shown that greater access to health care, expressed in terms of primary care physician to population ratios, is a positive predictor of health outcomes. As of the year 2000, the US Department of Health and Human Services estimated there were 238,734 primary care physicians (PCPs) in America [11]. That ratio is approximately 85.4 PCPs for every 100,000 Americans (or 1:1,171) [11], which actually exceeds the minimum recommended federal guideline set forth by the Public Health Service Act of 1978 for physician to population ratio (1:3,500 for specified geographic areas, and 1:3,000 for specified population groups) [12]. This guideline is the basis for defining the 'rational service area' concept for determining health professional shortage areas (HPSAs), and continues to serve as the baseline at the time of this study [13]. The fact that some geographic areas are known to be medically underserved or lack an adequate population of health professionals shows that a simple ratio of PCPs to population aggregated at the national level is not sufficient to evaluate actual PCP need. This phenomenon is also known as maldistribution, and is a major focus of health care workforce research [14]. Recently, several studies have focused on the spatial distribution of PCPs. These include examination of distance to nearest provider [15], travel patterns and paths to providers [16], physician shortages in Minnesota [17], health care center service area analysis [18], and new algorithms used in assessing these issues [19,20]. Wade et al. [21] studied the influence that a rural hometown may have on choice of practice locations of family physicians trained at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM). The study explored IUSM graduates from 1988-1997 who were native to Indiana and remained in Indiana to practice. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Urban Influence Codes (1993) were utilized to classify hometown and practice location as either metro or nonmetro (for purposes of statistical analysis), and organized the results into a 4 category subset of large metro, small metro, non-metro adjacent to metro, and non-metro nonadjacent. One of its primary aims was to influence IUSM admissions policies to increase supply of physicians in Indiana MUAs by increasing enrollment of students likely to practice in these areas. Wade et al. found that family physicians from non-metro (rural) hometowns were about four times more likely to practice in a non-metro (rural) area compared to those from metro hometowns."}, {"section_title": "Research Purpose", "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine physician characteristics as potential predictors of primary care practice in geographic areas defined as medically underserved, which include MUAs, HPSAs and some rural areas of Indiana. It is important to note that not all rural areas are \"underserved\", and as such, this research does not focus solely on rural geographic locales."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Physician workforce shortages and geographic maldistribution have been studied extensively in the past several decades. There is little consensus among researchers regarding workforce shortage, with some contending that there may even be an oversaturation of physicians (specialists, most notably) in some geographic areas [25]. While it is generally accepted that there are some populations in the US that do not have adequate access to primary care, why that continues to be the case has not yet been answered. The current study will contribute to the literature on physician distribution by examining selected variables, readily available through the AMA and US Government databases, as potential predictors of physician choice to practice in areas classified as MUAs, HPSAs and/or rural areas. Wade et al. [21] examined age at graduation and gender in relation to practice location and concluded these variables were not significant predictors for practice in \"rural\" areas among physicians graduating from the Indiana University School of Medicine. However, coming from a rural hometown was shown to be predictive of physician choice to practice in rural locations. The current study expands on the work of Wade et al. in part, to consider age at graduation and gender of physicians trained both in and out of the state as possible predictors of practice location choice. Examining different classifications of physician hometown may give a different perspective than looking at hometown alone. Ellsbury et al. [26] studied year of graduation, physician specialty, practice type, medical school and medical school location to determine gaps in rural practice by gender. That study focused on physicians who graduated from US medical schools from 1988 through 1996. Limiting the study by graduation date allowed Ellsbury et al. to make projections about future trends without skewing the results by including older physicians who may have had cultural biases regarding gender in the profession. The Ellsbury study found that male family physicians and general practitioners were more likely to practice in rural areas than females. Additionally, the study found that just 17 schools (of 122 identified in the AMA Masterfile), produced more than 25% of general practitioners who went on to practice in a rural location, and that medical schools on the east and west coasts tended to graduate higher numbers of female rural physicians. Gender variations in rural generalist populations were also noted in the COGME 10 th report [27]. Ellsbury et al. concluded that a dearth of rural female physicians may in fact exist, which may contribute to the problem of maldistribution. While the Wade and Ellsbury studies only considered physicians who were from the US, the current study also considered foreign-born physicians. The current literature on the role international medical school graduates (IMGs -defined as physicians who graduated from a medical school outside of the US) play in rural physician workforce is mixed. Baer et al. [28]  concluded that, overall, IMGs were no more likely to practice in rural underserved areas than were US trained physicians. There were, however, distinctions between foreignborn, internationally trained, and domestic-born but internationally trained physicians. They found that foreign-born IMG internists were three times more likely to work in rural underserved areas, and foreign-born IMG pediatricians were two times more likely. However, US-born IMG internists were just as likely as US-born, US-trained internists to practice in rural underserved areas. US-born IMG pediatricians were less likely than their US-born, US trained counterparts to do so. This suggests that country of origin may be a better predictive factor to underserved practice location than country of training when considering the effect of international physicians. The current study will examine the role that foreign-born PCPs play in medically underserved areas of Indiana by including US-born vs. foreign-born as an independent variable. whether the rising debt incurred by graduates will have an effect on practice location in the future. Therefore, the current study also considers an economic predictor variable. Whereas the Rabinowitz study considered future economic prospects of the graduates, the current study examines the economic status of the county of origin of the practitioner. The county of origin (i.e., the county in which the physician was born) is an imperfect variable to determine a student's hometown; however it is the only indicator available from the AMA Masterfile to establish the hometown. The US Census Bureau provides historical data of mean income through the 1950's. This study will examine the county in which the PCPs were born to determine whether that county had a mean income above or below the state and national median income. Using these variables may reveal influences of the economic background of the graduates. A recent study by Phillips et al. [31] distributed by The Robert Graham Center considered many of the factors previously mentioned in conjunction with practice location, and complemented them by considering economic factors such as debt level at graduation, scholarship and pre-enrollment funding, and income differences by specialty. That study found that likelihood of practicing in a rural area increases modestly as debt level rises. Both the Rabinowitz' and Phillips' studies indicate economic factors, both in background and in the future prospects of a physician, are predictive of geographic selection of practice location."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Physician Data", "text": "The AMA Masterfile provides information about all physicians who are United States residents and who have met the educational requirements for physicians. The file includes doctors who are not members of the AMA as well as internationally trained physicians. Data in the Masterfile are collected primarily from medical schools (a record is created for each student entering an accredited institution) and continuously updated via surveys [32]. The Masterfile has been a primary source of data for studies on physician supply in the US [33,34,35]. From the initial listing of all 16,181 Indiana physicians, those whose primary practice address was not in Indiana were excluded (9,166) leaving 7,015. Physicians whose country of origin, birth city or state was unknown were excluded (1,096), leaving 5,919 records. Physicians were next limited by their primary specialty to include only physicians who are primary/preventative care practitioners (excluded 3,270). Of the remaining 2,649, physicians whose Primary Type of Care was not identified as direct patient care in the Masterfile were excluded (322 records), leaving 2,327 physician records for analysis (Table 1). where the doctor was born prior to 1950, 1959 income data were used. The median income for each county was then compared to the state and national median income levels for the corresponding decade and noted as falling above or below for each physician. Figure 1 represents birth state of the physicians identified for this study. The variables from the Masterfile (referenced in Table 2) were chosen to establish a wide array of background characteristics that collectively create a profile for each individual.  The AMA Masterfile contains self-reported ZIP Codes of physician practice locations. To link physician practice location to MUAs/HPSAs, these ZIP Codes were crossreferenced to MUA/HPSA locations [10,11,38,39] using the ZIP Code driven address matching tool in ArcGIS and each physician was categorized as \"0\" (does not practice in a MUA/HPSA) or \"1\" (practices in a MUA/HPSA). If any part of that ZIP Code overlapped with an MUA/HPSA, the entire ZIP Code was considered part of the MUA/HPSA. Figure 3 illustrates the ZIP Codes classified in this manner. This same process was also used to estimate if the practice coincided with HPSAs. The USDA uses Rural-Urban Continuum Codes as one method for determining the rural/urban status (also called \"rurality\" by the USDA) of a given area [44]. Each county is designated with a Code, ranging from 1 to 9, in an effort to classify metropolitan areas by population size, and non-metropolitan areas by level of urbanization. Table 3 lists "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "The predictor variables listed in Table 2 represent the independent variables in this study. analyzed using all variables other than foreign-born. Results from the chi square and logistic regression analyses were used to identify which predictor variables increased the probability that a physician will practice in an underserved or rural area."}, {"section_title": "Results and Conclusions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chi Square Test Results", "text": "The results of the chi square test comparing predictor variables with practice location are shown in Table 4. Of the 2,327 physicians analyzed in this study, 1,088 (46.7%) were practicing in areas designated as MUA/HPSA, 589 (25.3%) in HPSAs only, and 305 (13.1%) in areas classified as rural (see Appendix A). The results showed some variance by response variable -i.e., as the definition of the geographic area changed, the significant predictors changed as well.  Table 5, the foreign-born predictor variable showed significance in just one response variable; HPSA only (p=0.044). This result indicates foreign-born practitioners in these instances were actually less likely to practice in an HPSA, meaning that US-born physicians were 1.39 times as likely to practice in an HPSA. Gender showed significance only in the rural classification (p=0.016), with males being 1.43 times as likely to practice in rural areas as females. Age at graduation, the only continuous variable analyzed, showed significance in two of the three response variables, combined MUA/HPSA (p=0.041) and rural (p=0.011), however, they indicate a contrasting result. The odds ratio for the rural classification suggests an incremental increase (5%) in the likelihood that a physician will practice in a rural area for each year older they are at the time of graduation, assuming that the relationship is linear. In Dataset 1, there were 305 physicians practicing in an area classified as rural. These physicians were charted against age at graduation to visualize this result ( Figure 6). However, the age at graduation variable in the combined MUA/HPSA response indicates a decreased likelihood of practicing in a MUA/HPSA with age. Graduating from the IU School of Medicine was a significant predictor of practice in a MUA/HPSA (p=<0.001) and rural area (p=0.011); again, the odds ratios for these findings showed an opposite result. The rural classification result indicates a physician is nearly 1.6 times as likely to chose a rural practice location if they graduated from the IU School of Medicine (odds ratio = 1.58), while the combined MUA/HPSA result shows a physician graduating from an institution in a state other than Indiana is more likely to practice in such an area. Because each of the response variables represent a different geographic area, these results should be considered independently; however, there were interesting parallels in the results for this analysis of all physicians practicing in Indiana. The predictor variables  Table 6 shows the results of each of the iterations of this model. Predictor variables gender, graduation from a medical school in the Midwest, and birth state region were not significant. Age at graduation showed significance for response variables MUA/HPSA and HPSA only (p=0.031 and p=0.027 respectively). The odds ratio suggests a slight decrease in likelihood of practice in these areas for each year older they are at the time of graduation. Graduation from the IU School of Medicine had contrasting results. For response variable MUA/HPSA, the odds ratio (0.66) suggests physicians who graduated from the IU School of Medicine were less likely to practice in a combined MUA/HPSA area compared to graduates of out-of-state schools. However, the model for rural classification shows a physician is 1.56 times as likely to practice in a rural area after having graduated from the IU School of Medicine. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The significance of the independent variables examined in this study for predicting physician practice location varies depending on the geographic categories examined. Only one variable was consistent across response variables in its significance and direction (county of birth below State median income). Age at graduation was also notable for significance across the response variables, though the outcomes were divergent, depending on which response variable is examined. Similarly, findings for matriculation from the IU School of Medicine were divergent, though consistent across response variables. In both regression models, IU Medical School graduates were less likely to practice in combined MUA/HPSAs, but more likely to practice in rural areas. This study did not find gender, matriculation from a medical school in the Midwest, or birth county falling below the National median income to be consistent predictors of practice in an underserved area or rural area, though individual instances of significance did occur. The pattern of positive significance of birth county below State median income is noteworthy, and warrants further study. When compared to other studies which have concluded that hometown or birthplace is a positive predictor [21,30,31] Another limitation lies in utilizing the county in which the physician was born in determining if the physician hails from an area that was above or below the median income level. The county of origin is not necessarily the environment in which the person grew up. The physician could have been born in a hospital just across a county line, or the family could have moved to a different location. Additionally, significant variation in income levels can occur within a county, so the county-level average may not be indicative of the neighborhood in which the physician was raised. However, the attempt in this study to explore an economic background variable produced significant results. Future studies could pursue this further by collecting more precise background data from other sources or from physicians directly. Finally, in paring physician records down to the final useable dataset (2,327), 1,096 records were lost because country of origin, birth city or state was unknown. This may represent some bias in the data. With rapidly changing economic and public policy climates in the US, understanding the driving forces of physician practice location choices is crucial. Developing a better understanding of maldistribution has the potential to influence policies that increase access to those who need it most. It seems likely that even as economic forces temporarily slow urban growth, it will not halt altogether. As populations increasingly concentrate in expanding urban areas, the problem of poor access to medical care will only grow. As more potential medical students come from these increasingly urban areas, the likelihood they will have the hometown economic characteristics which predispose them to practice in underserved or rural areas may decrease. This tide could be turned if medical schools made incentives available to students with these characteristics. Altering admissions policy, and even more actively recruiting such students, may increase primary care physician practice in medically underserved and rural areas.        "}]
