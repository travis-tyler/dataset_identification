To clarify how Alzheimer disease pathology develops in the brains of nondemented subjects, we examined the interrelations among the amounts and morphology of A\u2424 deposition, neurofibrillary pathology, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype in the frontal association cortex of 101 autopsy brains from patients aged between 40 to 83. Senile plaque density correlated well with the logarithmic data of insoluble A\u2424 measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The amounts of A\u242442-EIA increased dramatically in the late preclinical stage, whereas the A\u242442\u03e9 plaque density increased in the early preclinical stage. Neurofibrillary pathology appeared only in the areas with severe A\u2424 deposition and in subjects aged over 70. The ApoE 4 allele enhanced the A\u2424 deposition in presenile subjects. Plaque-associated glial A\u2424 was prominent in subjects with mild to moderate A\u2424 deposition. The morphology of cerebral A\u2424 deposition changed from diffuse plaques with small amounts of A\u2424 in each plaque in the early preclinical stage to primitive/neuritic plaques with larger amounts of A\u2424 in each plaque in the late preclinical stage.

A\u2424 is a hydrophobic self-aggregating peptide consisting of 40-42 residues (1), and is derived from a larger membrane-bound protein, amyloid \u2424 protein precursor (APP) (2) . Analyses of the A\u2424 peptide sequence showed some heterogeneity in the C-terminal end of A\u2424; the longer species, A\u2424x-42 (A\u242442), and the shorter species, A\u2424x-40 (A\u242440). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that A\u242442 is present as a major species in the initial stage of plaque formation (3, 4) .\nRecently, longitudinal studies on nondemented elderly people revealed the presence of an intermediate stage named mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is between no cognitive impairment (NCI) and mild AD stages (5, 6) . MCI refers to individuals who have memory impairment greater than expected for their age; yet general cognitive function is preserved, and therefore, MCI subjects do not meet the criteria for AD (6) . NCI nearly corresponds to the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) of 0, MCI to CDR 0.5, and mild AD to CDR 1 or 2 (7). This means that preclinical or nondemented stage can be divided into 2 stages: early preclinical (NCI/CDR 0) and late preclinical (MCI/CDR 0.5). When MCI subjects were followed longitudinally, they converted to clinically probable AD at a rate of 10%-15% per year, which was 10 times more frequently than NCI subjects converted to AD (1%-2% per year) (6) . Finally, a high percentage of patients with MCI developed into early AD (5) . Neuropathological studies on MCI subjects revealed that they had an intermediate value of mean \u2424-amyloid load between that in NCI and AD (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . In the association cortex, MCI subjects had no or few neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and corresponded to Braak stage II or III (7, 12) , suggesting that MCI is an intermediate stage between NCI and AD.\nIn the current study on nondemented subjects, we evaluated the amounts of A\u2424 deposition by both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 2-sites enzyme immunoassay (EIA), examined the neurofibrillary pathology by phosphorylated tau-IHC and ApoE genotype, and analyzed the relation between these markers. Neuro-psychological testing was not done. We also discussed the time sequence of pathological legions in the frontal association cortex in the preclinical stage of AD.\nThe 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been established as a risk factor of AD by promoting cerebral A\u2424 deposition (13) (14) (15) . A recent immunohistochemical study reported that ApoE 4 promoted the early deposition of A\u242442 in the nondemented elderly people, whereas ApoE 4 was associated with greater A\u242440 deposition in end-stage of AD (16) . We were also interested as to whether ApoE 4 gene is related to early A\u2424 deposition."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "We collected autopsied brains from 101 patients who died in the Gunma Cancer Center due to malignant neoplasms. None of the patients showed any signs of dementia in their daily life, although no special examination for detecting mental decline was carried out. The 101 subjects died between ages 40 and 83 yr (mean 65.1 yr) and were divided into 4 groups according to their age (Table 1) . Of the 101 subjects, brain radiation therapy had been administrated in 15 cases (8-66 Gy). History of cerebral infarction was found in 4 subjects, but none had a known history of head trauma. We took approximately 100 g tissue block from the frontal association cortex (Brodmann 9, 10 and 11) of each subject, and stored it at \u03ea80\u040aC before use. Most samples were taken within 2-4 h postmortem. Frozen brain samples from 2 AD patients, aged 83 and 86, were added as a positive control.\nFor the comparison between immunohistochemistry and EIA measurement of A\u2424, frozen brain samples from area 9 or 10 (approximately 3 cm 3 ) were cut into 2 pieces. One third was used for the EIA measurement of A\u2424. Small brain tissue (120 mg) was homogenized in 4 volumes of Tris-saline using Teflon/ grass homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 \u03eb g for 60 min. The washed pellet was re-suspended in 50 volumes of 70% formic acid and centrifuged. The formic acid-soluble fraction, which was neutralized with NaOH and Trizma base, was subjected to 2-site EIA, using BNT77 (monoclonal, A\u242411-28) as the capture antibody and BA27 (monoclonal, A\u242440 end-specific) or BC05 (monoclonal, A\u242442 end-specific) as the horseradish peroxidase-tagged detection antibody (17) . The remaining two thirds was fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde solution at 4\u040aC and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections, 3 m-thick, were immunostained with the following antibodies: 1) MBC42, A\u242442 end-specific monoclonal (1:100, culture sup) (18); 2) MBC40, A\u242440 end-specific monoclonal (1:20, culture sup) (18); 3) G42, pan-A\u2424, rabbit (1:1,000) (18); 4) PS199, recognizing phosphorylated Ser199 of tau, rabbit (1:500, a gift from Dr. Ishiguro) (19) ; and 5) anti-normal human tau, rabbit (1:500) (20) . Immunoreaction was visualized using a Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and diaminobenzidine and H 2 O 2 solution. As controls, A\u2424 antibodies were preabsorbed using corresponding synthetic \u2424 peptides (Bachem, Torrance, CA), and we confirmed the absence of immunoreaction in the adjacent section. After confirming the positive staining by comparing with the control and G42 stains, the density of senile plaques was measured by observing an entire tissue section stained by MBC42 or MBC40 and expressed semi-quantitatively: \u03e9/\u03ea only 1 or 2 small areas in an entire tissue section show 1 or 2 senile plaques (focal presence); \u03e9, senile plaques appear in several areas in an entire tissue section but mean density (average of 20 randomly selected areas) is less than 1/mm 2 ; \u03e9\u03e9, senile plaques appear in the some cortical layers and the plaque density is between 1 and 10/mm 2 ; \u03e9\u03e9\u03e9, senile plaques appear in most cortical layers and plaque density is more than 10/mm 2 . The interrelation between morphology and amounts of cerebral A\u2424 deposition, neurofibrillary pathology, and ApoE genotype was statistically analyzed in 101 subjects using t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison of A\u2424-IHC and A\u2424-EIA", "text": "Sensitivity: A\u242442-IHC using MBC 42 was quite sensitive and labeled all A\u2424 deposition detected by pan-A\u2424 antibody G42. From 101 patients, 44 subjects (43%) were negative for both A\u242442-IHC (neither plaques nor CAA) and A\u242442-EIA (\u03fd12 pmol/g) (Fig. 1a) . In 11 of the 55 A\u242442-EIAnegative subjects, we found 1 or 2 senile plaques and CAA per entire tissue section (A\u242442-IHC \u03e9/\u03ea) (Figs. 1a, 2i ). Alternately, in 5 of 50 A\u242442-IHC-negative subjects, we found 14 to 39 pmol/g of A\u2424 by EIA (Fig. 1a) . We consistently found A\u2424 deposition by IHC when EIA data were higher than 41 pmol/g. Both A\u242442-IHC and A\u242442-EIA were equally sensitive. A\u242440-IHC showed lower numbers of plaques than A\u242442-IHC did (Fig. 1b) . However, senile plaques were faintly or weakly positive for A\u242440 together with moderate A\u242442 labeling when plaque density was quite low (Figs. 2g-j, 3). Values of A\u242440-EIA were always lower than those of A\u242442-EIA, and A\u242440-EIA was less sensitive than A\u242440-IHC. Correlation: A\u242442-IHC correlated well with the logarithmic value of A\u242442-EIA (Fig. 1a) . When A\u242442-EIA values were between 12 and 99, A\u242442-IHC frequently showed focal A\u2424 deposition as a form of diffuse plaques (Fig. 2g) . When A\u242442-EIA data were between 100 and 999, small numbers of senile plaques (mostly diffuse plaques) frequently appeared in \u03eb4 visual fields (Fig. 2e) . Between 1,000 and 9,999 we consistently found considerable numbers of senile plaques in the cortical layers III and IV (Fig. 2c) . Cored plaques were found in some subjects. In samples over 10,000 with A\u242442-EIA, senile plaques appeared in the entire cortical layers as seen in AD, but plaque density seen by A\u242440-IHC was less than that in AD (Fig. 1a, b) . Correlation between A\u242440-HIC and A\u242440-EIA (R 2 \u03ed 0.53) was significant, but weaker than that between A\u242442-HIC and A\u242442-EIA (R 2 \u03ed 0.85) (Fig. 1) . In 71 A\u242440-EIA-negative (less than 12 pmol/g) subjects, 14 had focal A\u2424 deposition (A\u242440-IHC \u03e9/\u03ea Fig. 2h , j) and 3 had some disseminated A\u2424 deposition (A\u242440-HIC \u03e9; Fig. 2f ). A\u242440-IHC varied from negative (\u03ea) to moderate amounts (2\u03e9) in 23 subjects whose A\u242440-EIA data were between 12 and 99. A\u242440-EIA tended to be positive when the A\u242442-EIA value was over 100 pmol/g. CAA was found in 16 subjects by A\u242442-IHC and 14 of them were also positive for A\u242440-IHC (Fig. 4) . Five of the 16 subjects had CAA without senile plaques.\nInterrelation between Aging, A\u2424 Deposition and Neurofibrillary Pathology\nAs shown in Table 1 , cerebral A\u2424 deposition was found in all age groups by A\u242442-IHC, and the prevalence of A\u2424 deposition (percentage of subjects with A\u2424 deposition) increased with aging. When male and females were compared, middle-aged females tended to show a higher prevalence, although the number of the subjects was too small for statistical analysis (Table 1) . We found phosphorylated tau-IHC-positive neurons (p-tau\u03e9 neurons) in 7 of 101 subjects. All of them were aged over 70 yr and the mean age (77.7 yr) was significantly higher (p \u03fd 0.05) than that of the subjects without p-tau\u03e9 neurons (64.7 yr). As shown in Figure 1 , p-tau\u03e9 neurons were not found in the subjects with small amounts of A\u2424 deposition (A\u242442-IHC \u03e9/\u03ea or 1\u03e9 subjects), whereas 3 of the 13 A\u242442-IHC 2\u03e9 subjects and all 4 A\u242442-IHC 3\u03e9 subjects showed p-tau\u03e9 neurons. Most of these 7 subjects also had high A\u242442-EIA values (mean 8,628 pmol/g). In 9 subjects with abundant A\u242442 deposition (A\u242442-EIA, \u03fe4,000 pmol/g), 6 had p-tau\u03e9 neurons, whereas only 1 subject (A\u242442-EIA, 683 pmol/g) had ptau\u03e9 neurons out of 92 with moderate to no A\u242442 deposition (A\u242442-EIA \u03fd4,000 pmol/g). Values of A\u242440-EIA varied from 35 to 1,240 pmol/g in the 7 subjects with p-tau\u03e9 neurons (Fig. 1b) . Tau-IHC showed an accumulation of degenerating neurites in primitive/neuritic plaques in 3 subjects (A\u242442-EIA, 4,500, 6,164, and 28,700 pmol/g; Fig. 6a, b) . The density of p-tau\u03e9 neurons in nondemented subjects was much lower than that seen in AD (Fig. 6c) . In 6 of 7 subjects, density of the p-tau\u03e9 neurons was quite low (less than 0.1/mm 2 ), and 0.3/mm 2 in 1 subject with the highest A\u242442-EIA value. The shape of the tau-positive neurites was straight, but not tortuous like the neuropil threads/curly fibers in AD (Fig. 6c) ."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between ApoE Genotype and A\u2424 Deposition", "text": "In 101 subjects, 21 had 1 or 2 copies of ApoE 4 allele (4\u03e9 group). The 4\u03e9 group showed significantly higher (nearly 2 times) prevalence of A\u2424 deposition than the 4-group (2\u03eb2, 2 \u03ed 9.2, p \u03fd 0.05), whereas mean age was not significantly different between the 2 groups (Table 1) , and CAA was also found 2 times more frequently in the 4\u03e9 group, suggesting that the 4 allele accelerates both vascular amyloid deposition and senile plaque formation. When analysis was done in 40 presenile subjects (younger than 65), the 4\u03e9 group (5/9, 55.5%) showed a significantly higher prevalence of A\u2424 deposition (2\u03eb2, 2 \u03ed 4.2, p \u03fd 0.05) than the 4\u03ea group (9/31, 29.0%). The prevalence of A\u242440-EIA-positive subjects was also increased nearly 2 times in the 4\u03e9 group (Table 1) . The relation between A\u242442-EIA levels and the age of the subjects is shown in Figure 6 . Most subjects in the 4\u03e9 group (closed circles) were above the base line (12 pmol/ g), whereas more than half subjects in the 4\u03ea group (open circles) were on the base line (A\u242442-EIA-negative). In the 32 subjects with A\u242442-EIA level of more than 100 pmol/g, 14 subjects (44%) had 1 or 2 ApoE 4 alleles."}, {"section_title": "Intraglial A\u2424-Positive Granules", "text": "In this study, we frequently found intraglial A\u2424-positive granules that usually appeared around weakly labeled diffuse plaques. The plaque area tended to be positive for both MBC42 and MBC40 (Fig. 3) , although 10 of 23 A\u2424-positive glia-bearing subjects were A\u242440-EIA-negative. The A\u2424-positive glia was prominent in subjects with mild (\u03e9) to moderate (2\u03e9) A\u2424 deposition, but not in subjects with a high density (3\u03e9) of senile plaques (Fig.  7) . ApoE 4 allele did not affect the presence of glial A\u2424-granules."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We used the term ''p-tau\u03e9 neurons'' instead of NFTs, because in the nondemented subjects the p-tau\u03e9 neurons consisted of pretangles and early tangles, most of which might not be detected by Bodian stain (21) . In the current study, the presence of the p-tau\u03e9 neurons was limited to elderly subjects (over 70 yr of age) with large amounts 734 ID 19 (a, b) was 75 yr old, and the ApoE genotype was 3/3. A\u242442-EIA was 28,700, and A\u242440-EIA was 1,280. In 2 subjects, ID 47 (g, h) and ID 9 (i, j), senile plaque, which was MBC42-positive (i) and also MBC40 weakly positive, was incidentally found only in 1 area of the entire tissue section. \u03eb26.\nof A\u2424 deposition, whereas both A\u242442-EIA and A\u242442-IHC were positive in subjects from age 40 upwards. Furthermore, no one showed neurofibrillary pathology without A\u2424 deposition. From these findings, we suggest that massive A\u2424 deposition precedes the presence of p-tau\u03e9 neurons in the frontal association cortex, and that the time lag between the onset of A\u242442 deposition and NFT formation is 10 to 20 yr in the frontal association cortex. Although NFT formation preceded the A\u2424 deposition in hippocampal CA1 and locus ceruleus (22) , NFT formation in the frontal association cortex seemed to follow moderate to massive A\u2424 deposition. Aggregated A\u2424 may activate the GSK-3\u2424 (23), which is an important tau kinase and present in NFTs (19) . Actually, massive amyloid deposition in the blood vessel wall was reported to promote accumulation of tau-immunoreactive cell processes around the vessels (perivascular neurofibrillary pathology) (24) . In the frontal association cortex, the presence of numerous senile plaques with no or few NFTs was a characteristic feature of MCI stage, and that of abundant plaques together with disseminated NFTs was a feature of AD (7, 12, 25) .\nIn the present study, A\u2424 deposition began in the fifth decade as shown in our previous study on another 123 middle-aged subjects with malignant neoplasms (26) . The large-scale study of Braak et al (27) also showed an agedependent increase of A\u2424 deposition from 40 yr of age. In the current study, the prevalence of A\u2424 deposition was much higher than that expected from the findings of nondemented subjects (17, 27) . The ApoE 4 allele frequency of the current subjects (0.114) were nearly 2 times higher than that of Japanese control subjects (0.05-0.06) (28, 29) . Furthermore, we used briefly fixed brain tissues for IHC that were once frozen and immunostained with a highly sensitive antibody, MBC42. Under careful observation at a high-power field, we could detect solitary plaques showing faint A\u2424 labeling. Therefore, the sensitivity of A\u242442-IHC was similar to A\u242442-EIA, which contradicts the findings in a previous study where IHC detected senile plaques in the subjects over 100 pmol/g of A\u242442-EIA (17) .\nIn the current EIA study, the amounts of A\u2424 dramatically increased in the subjects with 2\u03e9 to 3\u03e9 A\u242442-IHC, agreeing with the findings of a logarithmic increase of A\u2424 deposition measured by EIA (17) . Cortical senile plaque density was reported to reach nearly maximal in subjects with mild AD (9) . Studies on asymptomatic mutation carriers of the APP and presenilin 1 gene have shown a linear and disease-related decline in most cognitive functions that begins approximately 10 yr before the expected clinical onset of AD (5). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging showed that the estimated median time of conversion from MCI to AD was 4.4 yr (30) . From these findings, we speculated the time sequence of legions in a representative subject as shown in Figure 8 . The plaque density may increase in the early preclinical (NCI) stage and may reach plateau in the mild AD stage. In contrast, the real amounts of insoluble A\u2424, measured by EIA, may steeply increase in the late preclinical (MCI) stage (Fig. 8) . This means that the amount of A\u2424 in each plaque increases in the late preclinical stage in parallel with the maturation of the plaque from diffuse to primitive/neuritic plaques, although the increased plaque density is another factor. Recently, we reported the ultrastructural localization of A\u2424 in diffuse plaques by postembedding gold labeling (31) . In the early stage of diffuse plaques, A\u2424 appeared exclusively as a membrane-bound form on cell surface plasma membrane and no apparent amyloid fibrils were found. In the advanced stage of diffuse plaques, small amounts of amyloid fibrils appeared between cell processes. In primitive plaques, bundles of amyloid fibrils appeared much more frequently with degenerating neurites (32) . The amount of A\u2424 was quite small in diffuse plaques, the predominant form in the early preclinical stage. However, it became quite large in each primitive/neuritic plaque, the density of which increased in the late preclinical stage (Fig. 8) .\nIn this study, we have shown cerebral A\u2424 deposition in a subset of nondemented subjects. Neuropathological studies of the subjects in the MCI stage revealed intermediate amounts of A\u2424 deposition between those in NCI and AD stages as measured by IHC (8-10) and EIA (11) .\nAs stated by Morris et al (8) , these findings suggest that senile plaques may not be a part of ''normal'' aging but instead represent presymptomatic or unrecognized early symptomatic AD, although the presence of senile plaques in the neocortex of apparently nondemented elderly subjects are often accepted as a part of ''normal'' aging. Thus, we speculate that plaque density does not correlate well to the degree of dementia when examined in the AD subjects (33) (34) (35) , but the amounts of A\u2424, especially those measured by EIA, may correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment in preclinical/mild AD subjects (Fig.  8) (11, (36) (37) (38) (39) . Our findings seem to contradict the findings of Terry et al that synapse loss is the major correlate of cognitive impairment in AD (40) . They analyzed the correlation using 2 groups; 15 mild to severe AD subjects and 9 neuropathologically normal subjects whose brains had no or minimal A\u2424 deposition (NCI group). They did not examine the correlation in the MCI group, which should further elucidate which is the major correlate of cognitive impairment in the MCI subjects-A\u2424 deposition or synaptic loss.\nUnfortunately, our subjects were not examined neuropsychologically, and therefore, we could not analyze whether subjects with large A\u2424 deposition were in the MCI stage or not. However, in the nursing records of the subject with the highest A\u2424 deposition (ID 19, A\u242442-EIA 28,700 pmol/g, Fig. 2a) , memory impairment was noted. In the current study, even with high amounts of A\u242442, the amounts of A\u242440 and degree of neurofibrillary pathology were much less than those seen in the typical AD subjects. In the frontal cortex, NFTs were usually absent in the preclinical stage and NFTs became apparent first in subjects with mild AD (7). In this study, we showed that ApoE 4 genotype was associated with earlier onset of A\u242442 deposition, agreeing with the preceding studies showing that an 4 allele predicted an earlier onset of A\u2424 deposition (16, 29, 41, 42) . In the subjects with considerable A\u2424 deposition (more than 100 pmol/g of A\u242442-EIA), however, about half of them were without an ApoE 4 allele. This 4 allele frequency was similar to that in AD subjects (13, 14) . A recent immunohistochemical study reported that ApoE 4 promoted the earlier deposition of A\u242442 in the nondemented elderly people, whereas ApoE 4 was associated with greater A\u242440 deposition in end-stage of AD (16) . They suggested that the increased A\u242440 in ApoE4-positive AD cases probably was due to the earlier onset of cerebral amyloidogenic processes in their cases, which began with deposition of A\u242442. They also hypothesized that the number of diffuse, A\u242442-plaques eventually reaches a steady state in advanced AD, where the emergence of new diffuse plaques is in equilibrium with their transformation into A\u242440-positive mature plaques and disappearing processes. In another point of view, ApoE isoforms were reported to bind differently to tau (43, 44) and NFT-bearing neurons tended to be ApoE-immunoreactive (45, 46) , and thus ApoE was related to NFT formation. ApoE 4 was associated with denser NFT formation throughout the age span examined (60-100 yr) in the nondemented elderly people, although enhancing effect of 4 on A\u2424 deposition appeared milder with increasing age (47) . However, the mechanism by which ApoE 4 influences the metabolism of A\u2424 has yet to be elucidated. In the transgenic mouse model, ApoE knockout caused decreased A\u2424 deposition in APP Sw -transgenic mice, suggesting that ApoE enhanced the amyloid deposition (48) . Another study, using mice with human ApoE 3/3-or 4/4-knock-in and APP V717F -transgenes, showed that E4 enhanced amyloid fibril formation and neuritic plaques more than E3 (49) . E3 and E4 isoforms differ by 1 amino acid sequence, and therefore the chemical that binds to E4 and changes its 3-dimentional structure to match E3, can be useful in preventing AD in MCI subjects with ApoE 4 allele.\nIn the brains of nondemented subjects, we have reported the ''disappearing plaques,'' which were diffuse plaques associated with astroglial A\u2424 granules, and discussed a dynamic balance between plaque formation and destruction (18) . This hypothesis was supported by the immunization study of APP V717F transgenes, in which A\u2424 immunization prevented or removed cerebral A\u2424 deposition (50) . In the current study, we found that astroglial A\u2424 was prominent from the beginning of A\u2424 deposition, but became scarce in the high A\u2424 load stage (A\u242442-IHC 3\u03e9). In the preclinical stage of AD, astroglia may attempt to remove A\u2424 in diffuse plaques. Diffuse plaques, which were associated with grail A\u2424-positive granules, tended to be immunoreactive for both A\u242440 and 42 antibodies.\nIn the early preclinical stages, quite small amounts of A\u242440 colocalized with A\u242442 in disappearing plaques, whereas both the plaque density and amounts of A\u2424 were too low to be detected by EIA. The presence of disappearing plaques in the preclinical stage suggests that the prevention of A\u2424 deposition at this stage can be a rational therapeutic target, especially in ApoE 4-bearing elderly people."}]
