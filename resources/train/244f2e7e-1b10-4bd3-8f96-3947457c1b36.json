The country accelerated development in human resources effectively. In the past, all countries in the world have been developed and improve in new educational management system in term of 'Educational Reform'. This aims to develop an effective educational management, quality standards because it could produce quality manpower to social economic based knowledge involving in competition by using intelligence or knowledge based working. Besides, the current period focused on education development in order to support educated personnel of the country and could help them catch up with the changing world (Office of the Education Council, 2008).\nNational Education Act of B.E.1999 (Improved Issue: 2002 defines the objectives and principles of educational management \"Education shall aim the full development of the Thai people in all aspects: physical and mental health; intellect; knowledge; morality; integrity; and desirable way of life so as to be able to live in harmony with other people\". The intention of these could help learners to be virtue, intellect and happiness. And the Chapter 4, Sector 22 mentions that Education shall be based on the principle that all learners are capable of learning and self-development, and are regarded as being most important\". The teacher's burden is to be important. And most society has anticipated teachers to develop the quality of learners as civilized country. However, the results of National Tests or O-NET in 2014 showed that G.P.A of 5 main course subjects: Thai, Social studies, English, Mathematics and Science were in low level: lower 50% and some subjects had G.P.A lower than last year. It pointed clearly that Thai students had lower learning achievement, Furthermore; the results of international standard tests: Program for International Students Assessment (PISA), Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) were in lower scores. Besides, it was lower than neighboring countries, except Indonesia (Research Institute for Thailand Development, 2012) . Even though, Thai students spent the time for the class more than other neighboring countries.\nAccording to the problems above, it realized that \"What is the cause and effect towards students' learning achievement continuously? The findings of A Study The Quality of World Leader School System of Mckinsey and Company revealed that the important factor to effect to changing the school learners' learning was the quality of teachers. It means that in the past ten years, an important study from data collection in Tennessee State, U.S.A. told that the implementation of two moderate proficiency students, one learned with a high performance teacher, and one learned with a low performance center teacher. After the past three years, the results found that there was difference in 'very much' between two of them, it was more than 50 percentile (Office of the Education Council, 2009).\nThus, if we want to develop the quality of learners effectively, we need to develop more teachers' competency. However, Thailand had still encountered some problems of teacher development. The results of a research confirmed that teachers lacked of development effectively because of limited budgets, missing evaluation their development. They could not solve the real students' problem.\nIn the past, development private school teachers still lacked of clear system of development teachers. Most teachers' training came from Office of the Private Education Commission. The training was divided into each sector and there were a lot of trainers in each seminar. Most private schools often have a seminar in the school vacation because it does not effect to learning and teaching management. There is sometimes to have the training with The Primary Educational Service Area Office Kalasin in 2011-2013. Office of the Private Education Commission had the projects for each province to have training teachers. Besides, co-private schools had the training for teacher development for 1-2 days. However, there was still the lack of following it up about their advancement. These reasons above pointed that development teachers of private schools missed the system or the clear model. So, these made development teachers miss a continuous training and teachers lacked knowledge and ability to learning and teaching management effectively. Moreover, it could not solve the problem directly and correctly.\nAccording to the reasons above, the researcher realize that it is very important to develop teachers by development a program to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers so as to enhance the quality of teachers in new period and it could reflect the results of the quality of learning management and the quality of learners."}, {"section_title": "Purposes of the Study", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "1)", "text": "To study the factors and indicators to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers.\n2) To study current situations and desirable situations and techniques to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers.\n3) To develop a program to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers."}, {"section_title": "4)", "text": "To study the effects of a program to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers."}, {"section_title": "Literature", "text": "This study is a research and development to develop a program to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers.

And the results of indicators of curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers were confirmed by experts, they were in 'very much' level. It was supported by Wright (2001: 20) in a research \"A Study Performance Capabilities of Human Resources\" revealed that competency was an important sector to develop human resources and it was an indicator of human growth that was the human cost. It was to support the service duty and an important strategy to follow up working and it was a driving force to get through success.\n2) The current situations of curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers were in 'moderate' level in overall.

As Sukanya (2006, p. 17) defined the competency means the knowledge, skills, personal characteristic of attributes to help person work more responsible than others. And it was related to the concepts of Department of General Education (2001, p. 4) addressed the importance of learning management that 'the goal of learning management is to develop skills and capabilities that could promote each person to learn independently and to be a lifelong learning. Besides, it could help learners are capable of learning on their own pace and to the best of their potentiality.\n3) A Program to Enhance and Learning Management Competency of private primary school teachers developed by researcher was consisted of factors as follows: 1) concepts of a program to enhance curriculum and learning management competency of teachers, 2) objectives of a program, 3) model and techniques to develop, 4) outline of program, 5) content of a program including with five modules: building and developing curriculum module, designing learning management module, learning management focusing on learner center module, using media and IT innovation for learning module, measurement and evaluation of learning module.

And the techniques to develop a program were as follows: workshop, self-learning, coaching, mentoring, seminar of group interaction activity, supervision, after action review. The processes of development had four steps: step1 pre-test before development; step 2 developing a program; step 3 integrating knowledge and step 4 post-test after development. And the results of providing the manual of usage a program to enhance and learning management competency of private primary school teachers effected as follows: The test of knowledge about learning management competency of private primary school teachers showed that average scores of pre-test was 16.95 in full marks 30, it was 56.52%. And average scores of posttest was 24.64 marks in full marks 30, it was 82.12%.

Three of them had to be suitability and fit each other in order to get success of working. As Janthakarn (2007, p. 74) in a research \"The New Leader of Thai Government\" had developed learning through practice e.g. case study, simulations, proactive game and role plays, the results were in 'much' level. It had been spent the time of treatments for two weeks to one month. Their needs were in 'much' level. It was supported to Parinya (2009, p. 89 ) in a research \"The Effects Design a Participatory Professional Development Program of Teachers\" found that most teachers had been trained in 8 the professional development models: workshop, observation, participatory development process, group-study as whole school, action research, self-learning, mentoring and study further in graduate."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions", "text": "According to this research, the suggestions were as follows:\n1) The suggestions of the results of the study.\n1.1) The results of this research had the factors and indicators of curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers that could be helpful towards administrators and teachers of private school. They could have a plan and operation involved in curriculum and learning management.\nMoreover, it could be useful to the high administrators of Office of the Private Education Commission to provide the policy involved and they had known the current situations, desirable situations, techniques of curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers. And they could adapt and adopt the variety strategies to train the teachers. Besides, they could realize the trends of competency development for the teachers in the future. So, the findings of this research were the most useful to apply it in further research.\n1.2) A Program to Enhance and Learning Management Competency of private primary school teachers was research and development. The researcher and subjects were in the field research; this could be helpful to meet the real problems and limitation of research. So, this program could solve the problems by real practice in the fieldwork. The results was very satisfied and the researcher could describe the results of research procedures deeply and clearly in 4 steps: step1 pre-test before development; step 2 developing a program; step 3 integrating knowledge and step 4 post-test after development. These are the process of development a program.\n2) Suggestions for future research 2.1) Researchers should study compare the usage more other strategies or various strategies so as to examine comparing the results of development. And they could seek for the best way of competency development for teachers effectively and efficiently.\n2.\n2) The schools should provide the research and development of development a program for teachers in the institutions and follow it up closely and continuously.\n2.3) A Program to Enhance Curriculum and Learning Management Competency of private primary school teachers should be a model to apply in other private primary schools and should be provided it into the website for self-access learning by internet for teachers. It is very easy and convenient for them to develop by own self.\n2.4) The schools should study other models or other factors of enhancing curriculum and learning management competency of private primary school teachers so that the schools might have a clear and effective learning guideline for development teachers further."}]
