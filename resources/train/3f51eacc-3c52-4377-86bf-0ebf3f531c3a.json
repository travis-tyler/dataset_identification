[{"section_title": "DEDICATION", "text": "I wanted to take the opportunity in this small space to acknowledge the support of some very important people in my life. Both my parents and my wife stood by me through this entire process and deserve the appropriate recognition. From their humble beginnings, my parents agreed to devote all their efforts to allow their children to achieve beyond what they themselves could only imagine. They wanted us to reach for a level of achievement that would open up a lifetime of opportunities for ourselves and the generations to follow. My brother and I knew from an early age that going to college was not only a possibility, but a foregone conclusion. Education, in their belief was our path to opportunity. My parents worked multiple jobs and sacrificed many creature comforts in life in order to finance a private catholic education for both of their children. They continued this tireless support and work to not only get us through our undergraduate degrees, but to instill the belief, the dream, the opportunity, and the desire to reach the highest levels of educational attainment. They never made it feel like a burden, or something that was forced. My brother and I ultimately fulfilled their dreams, by his completion of a Doctor of Chiropractic and my completion of a Ph.D. But they did not limit their support only to their sons. My parents also became ardent supporters of both of their daughter-in-laws. They, without hesitation or reservation, did whatever was needed to stand behind both Tara and Jen and see them through to the completion of their undergraduate degrees. When I look back on the entire duration of this degree, I realize that I have been a doctoral student for over five years and that my wife and I will celebrate our 5-year anniversary on October 1, 2010. Throughout our engagement and entire marriage I have been in the pursuit of this doctoral degree. With that acknowledgment, comes a realization that this was not a singular sacrifice and achievement. My wife Jennifer was there with me in the beginning when I interviewed in Elizabethtown to be admitted to the program, when I had assigned reading during our honeymoon, through the semesters of lonely evenings while I was at class, and the weekends consumed with studying. She tolerated the many late nights I spent writing my dissertation with our dogs Topper and Marley at my feet. She may not have always been happy with the sacrifices, and at times I know she was fed up with the circumstances, but she stayed by my side and saw me through to the end of this degree. These are the intangible things that are not described in the wedding vows, but embody a strong and dedicated spouse. Jen, you mean the world to me, and thank you for travelling down this journey with me and following it through to completion. Therefore it is with years of hard work, endless late nights of reading, researching, and writing that I dedicate my dissertation to my wife Jen and to my parents Larry and Jennie. To my wife Jen, I look forward to building a long and happy life and finally having the time to just be together without having to put ourselves on the back burner. Congratulations Mom and Dad, now both of your sons, Dr. Scott Gittings and Dr. Glenn   .............................................................................................................134 INTRODUCTION Lovitts and Nelson (2000) surmised, \"Forty years of studies suggest the long-term doctoral attrition rate nationwide is about 50%\" (p. 45). Doctoral students represent a highly educated and typically motivated group of students that have demonstrated the academic aptitude and personal characteristics to successfully complete multiple degrees, yet a large number are not completing the doctoral degree. Golde (1994) explained that, \"Doctoral students are people who have generally succeeded at school. For some, choosing to leave graduate school can feel like the ultimate defeat by a system in which a student has always been successful\" (p. 23). A misconception perpetuated by institutions is that doctoral students have navigated the educational waters of receiving a bachelor's degree and a master's degree and therefore should not need and do not want much guidance or assistance throughout the doctoral program. Pontius and Harper (2006) asserted that institutions typically focus on undergraduate students and expend less effort engaging graduate and professional students. Doctoral education remains an evolving research setting that can be explored to further the knowledge base of understanding, not only concerning individual and institutional characteristics that contribute to doctoral attrition, but also with programmatic interventions that affect doctoral student completion rates. de Valero (2001) stated the following: Given the high costs associated with graduate education, the current national climate of diminishing resources for higher education, and an increased competition for these resources between undergraduate and graduate programs, understanding and examining the factors that affect the students' ability to complete their degree requirements in a timely manner and considering the implications of these factors becomes crucial. (p. 341) According to Lampley (2001), \"Factors such as decreased funding, slow enrollment growth, rising cost, increased competition, an increasing need for accountability, and a stronger sense of student consumerism, may force institutions of higher education to take a closer look at how they operate\" (p. 13). Kluever and Green (1998) concluded the doctoral dissertation consists of independent activity that encompasses multiple hurdles to overcome and a variety of decisions to be made in order to complete the degree. Golde (1994) summarized that \"Attrition cannot be seen as a discrete event, but rather, it is clearly a dynamic process, with antecedents, for some can be traced to expectations and goals formulated before enrolling\" (p. 23)."}, {"section_title": "The Problem", "text": "The National Science Foundation (1998, p. 1) stated, \"The doctoral student is a precious resource in providing the new discoveries and expert knowledge essential to the nation's future.\" Lipschutz (1993) suggested as faculty and graduate deans seek financial resources from government, foundations, and private sources, they need to justify their completion rates. Jacks, Chubin, Porter, and Connolly (1983) clarified graduate students that do not complete their education have always been around, yet little is known about them, their perceptions of the graduate education experience, and their assessment of their failure to complete and subsequent career choices. Golde (1994) stated, \"One aspect of doctoral education that is often deplored but little studied is the high level of student attrition\" (p. 1). Hatley and Fiene (1995) lamented that a significant number of talented doctoral students do not successfully complete the degree. Jacks et al. (1983) stated the subject of doctoral students that never complete the dissertation has not been a topic for systematic study. Golde (1994) surmised that graduate and doctoral attrition is rarely published and most doctoral attrition research is only focused on individual doctoral student characteristics. Gillingham, Seneca, and Taussig (1991) explained that due to the years committed to completion of the doctoral degree and the sacrifice, measured by potential contributions to both doctoral students and society, is costly. Hatley and Fiene (1995) indicated ABD students \"Pleaded for more structure, opportunity, encouragement, and mentoring\" (p. 2). Kluever, Green, and Katz (1997) postulated at the doctoral level that attrition is damaging and costly for the student, faculty advisers, and the institution. Given the essential impact doctoral study has on research, education, leadership, policy, and professional practice, consistently high drop out rates remain inappropriate . Malmberg (2000) suggested future research to determine the extent of interaction and influence of the factors affecting the degree progress of doctoral students and research into the value of doctoral student workshops and seminars designed to obtain and exchange information prior to completing coursework and prior to entering doctoral candidacy. Pauley (1998) indicated a need to examine the length of time to degree for the program and whether or not this variable affected attrition. Emerson (1998) encouraged research on the value of institutional support or programs designed to offer structure and/or guidance during the dissertation stage. Huguley (1988) recommended the need for institutions to develop departmental courses built into the program that structure the dissertation process for students. Lee (2003) suggested further research on the relationship with faculty mentors and the significance these relationships had on doctoral completion. Campbell (1992) also encouraged further research on the mentor-mentee relationship and the significance on doctoral completion. Girves and Wemmerus (1988) concluded more research was needed concerning the type of graduate student financial support along with a further examination of the relationship between students and faculty at the graduate level. Gardner and Barnes (2007) assert more research concerning how various graduate disciplines encourage student involvement must occur. Globetti, Globetti, and Smith (1991) stated further study was needed to assess the graduate student population. Finally, Golde (1996) explained that it is time for candid discussions within departments and disciplines concerning the role of doctoral attrition and what are acceptable levels of doctoral attrition. Just as important a need is to discuss ways to remove potential barriers to doctoral student completion in order to help remedy some more common reasons for doctoral attrition."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "Researchers acknowledge and even lament that it is of considerable concern that such a small proportion of doctoral students stay the course and complete the degree (Berg & Ferber, 1983). The investigator grounded the current study on two key thoughts of inquiry: (a) how to begin to diagnose, up front, individual characteristics that lead to success in doctoral study and completion of the doctoral degree, and (b) a desire to identify critical doctoral program components that lead to success in doctoral study and completion of the doctoral degree. The population for the study consisted of doctoral students across various departments that entered the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville spanning the academic years of [1997][1998][1999][2000][2001][2002][2003]. Under the guidelines of survey construction and Web-based survey administration techniques provided by Dillman (2000) and Dillman, Smyth, & Christian (2009), the researcher constructed and administered the instrument via the Internet utilizing the online survey design and administration company SurveyMonkey. The researcher based the study on suggested further research from other authors in the field (Campbell, 1992;Emerson, 1998;Gardner & Barnes, 2007;Girves & Wemmerus, 1988;Huguley, 1988;Lee, 2003;Malmberg, 2000). The purpose of this research was to predict and identify both individual doctoral student characteristics and doctoral program components that affected doctoral student degree completion."}, {"section_title": "Kentucky Higher Education Reform", "text": "The Kentucky General Assembly completely revamped higher education in the the production of doctoral engineers. This report also stated that \"In 1996, the estimated doctoral degree production required for Kentucky to reach national averages needed to increase by 69% from the current 1996 level of 397 to the current 1996 national level of 672\" (p. 24). According to this report, 1995-1996 figures indicated that 33% of doctoral programs in the state of Kentucky were low performing programs that graduated fewer than three degrees per year. At the time of this investigation by the Task Force on Kentucky Postsecondary Education in 1996, Kentucky lacked any nationally recognized doctoral degree granting institutions and neither the University of Kentucky nor the University of Louisville had doctoral programs ranked in the top levels nationally. The report pointed out that at the time, the state appropriations for higher education in Kentucky did not provide incentive funding for national competiveness of research and graduate programs. The dismal statistics produced by this report led the Kentucky General Assembly to craft higher education reform goals. Specifically related to graduate education, the state believed that nationally prominent graduate and research programs could spur economic growth for Kentucky. Based on the statistics and suggestions from the Postsecondary Education Assessment report in 1997, an agenda from then governor of Kentucky Paul Patton in 1997 to the Task Force on Postsecondary Education mapped out the entire plan of postsecondary education reform. Among the many other reforms, changes, and suggestions this report (Patton, 1997) mandated the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky implement broad changes based on the reform that included the following: University of Louisville will: 1. Become a metropolitan university with selected nationally-competitive research and graduate programs designed to enhance the regional economy. 2. Develop partnerships with the local community colleges and technical schools that are responsive to the needs of the region. 3. Provide the same services the regional universities provided to its assigned service area. University of Kentucky will: 1. Perform as the state's flagship university. 2. Develop as a nationally-recognized center of excellence of academic study and research. 3. Be responsible, as the primary land-grant university, for statewide technology transfer for business and agriculture. 4. Attract the brightest students from Kentucky and across the world (p. 13)."}, {"section_title": "HB1 mandated that the University of Kentucky become a Top 20 Public Research", "text": "University by the year 2020. It also charged the University of Louisville to become a preeminent metropolitan research university over the same time frame (Patton, 1997). When HB1 mandated that the two institutions achieve national prominence, it included programs at all levels including doctoral. One specific metric of measurement of the state's achievement of these goals is graduate enrollments in the state of Kentucky and degrees and credentials earned. Among the many alterations that occurred due to the passage of this higher education reform, one focus centered on degree program and departmental systems and practices that could not only allow the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville to become nationally recognized but also enroll, retain, and graduate more students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. McGuiness (2002) explained that HB1 provided incentive funding linked to action agenda items focused on enrollment, retention, and graduation at all levels of education. By recruiting, retaining, and graduating more graduate and doctoral students, the two institutions will rise in the national rankings for specific programs and overall institutions (State of Kentucky Task Force on Postsecondary Education, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Doctoral Student Attrition Case Study", "text": "Attrition research is rich with examples from the realm of the undergraduate level. At the undergraduate level the students entering the institution of higher education bring a limited set of academic experiences and levels of preparation. Colleges and universities maintain highly divergent standards for admission that allow for all levels of students into the institution. With this in mind, there is a natural amount of attrition that will occur due academic inexperience, poor institutional acclimation, immaturity of the student due to age, and even poor pre-college preparation or pre-college academic ability. Tinto (1993) stated, \"In most countries, the more selective the level of education, the higher the rate of completion, yet in the United States, the reverse is true\" (p. 230). At the graduate and even more specific, the doctoral level, of higher education, the admitted students have previously achieved at a level academically that allowed them to complete at least a bachelor's degree and more often than not a master's degree. Institutions select doctoral students that demonstrated the academic preparation to not only succeed previously in their academic endeavors, but that exude the skills and intelligence necessary to complete the academic requirements of a doctoral program. Even with the academic credentials and preparation that students possess coming into a doctoral program, they are still not completing doctoral degrees at acceptable rates. Very little doctoral attrition research has focused on the individual student experiences and explanations for not completing a doctoral degree. The study below by Golde (1994) provided a detailed account of three doctoral students' experiences of dropping out of their doctoral programs at various points in his or her academic pursuits. Golde (1994) conducted a qualitative study, drawn from a larger project on doctoral student attrition, that highlighted the educational experiences of doctoral students who did not complete their doctoral degrees. The participants in the study were doctoral students (N = 3) who left their doctoral studies at differing stages of the doctoral degree including after the first year, after 4 years of study, and a student completing all requirements but the dissertation. The respondents completed a 1-hour interview that consisted of chronicling the students' descriptions of the graduate school career and gaining the students' experiences of their doctoral careers. Golde analyzed the data in search of emergent themes with a particular focus on the role of the departmental context. Four major themes emerged from the interview sessions concerning non-persisting doctoral student experiences: (a) opposing a common view that attrition serves a sorting purpose, the interviews indicated that the students demonstrated academic aptitude but could have continued their education with departmental intervention; (b) students inherently expected caring advisers and a social community and felt isolated when no community was found; (c) students reached out to someone in their departments about leaving; and (d) students all attempted diligently to navigate the structure of their departments and their own motives. The Golde research sought to tell the story of attrition and explained that even the most capable of academically prepared doctoral students can and do fail to persist. Even though these students have succeeded at every academic level, they still inherently needed departmental assistance, faculty connection, student interaction, and clear and logical departmental structure to succeed."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "The researcher sought to find influence of individual characteristics of doctoral students on doctoral degree completion, but also the influence of doctoral program characteristics on doctoral degree completion. Specific research questions were as follows: 1. Do certain doctoral student demographic variables (age, ethnicity, gender, financial support, employment, marital status, dependents, distance from campus, debt load, employment status change after comprehensive exams, and enrollment status) affect doctoral student degree completion? 2. Do doctoral program characteristics (graduate student orientation programs, departmental assistance, social involvement, dissertation preparation courses, dissertation preparation seminars, clarity and understanding of academic program procedures/requirements, dissertation chair contact, academic involvement, support groups, and mentoring) affect doctoral student degree completion?\nWith national statistics of doctoral completion rates hovering at or below 50% (Lovitts & Nelson, 2000)  more specifically doctoral degree programs, now had marching orders to not only graduate more doctoral students, but if they were unsuccessful, they must justify why they failed or risk losing funding.

Researchers have consistently reported national doctoral completion rates at just barely at or above 50% (Astin, 1997;Bauer, 2004;Cook & Swanson, 1978;de Valero, 2001;Dorn & Papalewis, 1997;Ehrenberg & Mavros, 1995;Golde, 2001;Kluever, 1997;Lee, 2003;Lovitts, 2004;Lovitts & Nelson, 2000;Malmberg, 2000;Nerad & Miller, 1996;Wynn, 2003). Polson (2003) suggested that investment in opportunities that help graduate students transition into their new roles were more likely to retain graduate students through degree completion. Researchers suggested departments invest resources in coursework and student programs centered on training for the dissertation process, career roles, and addressing student concerns (Golde & Dore, 2001;Hatley & Fiene, 1995;Kluever et al., 1997;Lampley, 2001). The current study attempted to build upon and add to the research literature by determining individual and doctoral program characteristics that may contribute to or impede doctoral student degree completion. The researcher narrowed the focus of the study to the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville since these institutions are the dominant doctoral degree granting institutions in the state of Kentucky and due the higher education reform legislation that sought an overhaul in the entire educational structure and culture at these two institutions. This information could be significant to institutions of higher education, specific academic departments within the institutions, graduate faculty, doctoral degree program designers, and doctoral students. The information gained in this study could also benefit the programmatic and departmental practices at both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. If specific individual characteristics or departmental programmatic interventions/coursework contribute to, or detract from doctoral student degree completion, the previously mentioned groups would benefit from the knowledge in order to implement structure or behaviors that would contribute to doctoral student degree completion.

The sample of this study was limited to students who entered doctoral study between the years of 1997-2003 at the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. Limiting the sample to only a specified 6-year time period did not encompass the entire population of doctoral students that have enrolled at any time period in the history of the institutions. The use of non-experimental research methods did not allow the researcher to manipulate or control the independent variables and can therefore only provide correlations based on observations and measurements (Vogt, 2005).

With a national economy that has bottomed out and a country trying to dig out of a recession, higher education funding has experienced prolonged and sometimes severe annual reductions. With federal, state, and private funding sources continuing to dwindle, institutions must further depend on revenue streams provided by tuition from all graduate and doctoral students. In the state of Kentucky, Higher Education reform has mandated among other things that the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville become nationally prominent in a multitude of areas, including doctoral education. The state pinned its hopes on the need for a better educated citizenship in order to embrace a knowledge based economy. It is imperative that doctoral degree completion remain a topic for investigation and institutional intervention in the state of Kentucky, at least until higher rates of completion become the norm. The current study attempted to understand individual and departmental characteristics and actions that may affect doctoral student degree completion. Chapter Two reviews research studies of the topic of student attrition/persistence and more specifically doctoral student attrition/persistence. To address the research questions the researcher developed a survey instrument based on the work of Vincent Tinto and his survey designed for the National Science Foundation (NSF) called the Doctoral Studies Questionnaire along with a nationally vetted instrument called the Survey of Earned Doctorates to assess student perceptions of their personal and departmental level experiences with their doctoral education. Through the use of logistic regression, the researcher explored the relationship between individual doctoral student characteristics and departmental characteristics unique to each doctoral student as they relate to doctoral degree completion. The investigator then explored the relationship of various demographic variables as they relate to doctoral degree completion. Chapter Three outlines the overall methodologies employed in the current study. Chapter Four consists of the reporting of the data gathered and analysis of the results. Finally, the implications of the results concerning policy and practice along with suggestions for further research are discussed in Chapter Five.\nGraduate students experience the acquisition of an entirely new culture when entering graduate education. Graduate students can experience, positively or negatively, a socialization process that introduces them to both the academic department and their future career (Tinto, 1993). Lawson and Fuehrer (1989) explained that graduate students experienced more satisfaction with increased contact from faculty. Importance of the relationship between faculty and graduate students has been well documented (Kelly & Schweitzer, 1999). The socialization process involved a transition and adoption of new roles and responsibilities as well as a formation of opinion about the institution (Taub & Komives, 1998). The transition process was laden with stress, anxiety, expectation, and responsibility (Rosenblatt & Christensen, 1993). Social support served as an effective moderator of stress experienced in the early aspects of graduate school (Lawson & Fuehrer, 1989). Orientation programs served important roles for graduate students transitioning to graduate education (Barker et al., 1997;Poock, 2002;Taub & Komives, 1998). Orientation programs served as an opportunity for institutions to address adjustment and transition concerns that negatively affect attrition (Polson 2003;Poock, 2002). Socialization into higher education can be directly fostered through the use of institutional orientation programs (Boyle & Boice, 1998;Polson, 2003;Poock, 2002). Attrition in graduate education due to rejection of the issues and concerns with this early transition is a paramount concern among researchers and institutions (Bowen & Rudenstine, 1992;Golde, 1996Golde, , 1998Tinto, 1993). Golde (2005) explained that almost 40% of doctoral students do not complete their program. Poor integration into the institution increases the likelihood of a student withdrawing from the institution (Leppel, 2002). Graduate students with greater stress and lower social support were more likely to drop out (Cooke et al., 1995). Leppel (2002) explained that shrinking enrollment in higher education due to demographic changes in the United States placed more importance financially on higher education to increase student persistence. Golde (2005) indicated that non-economic costs of graduate student attrition, such as social and emotional costs, affected students and faculty in higher education. In summary, this chapter addressed multiple strands of research on the topic of \nThis research study was a non-experimental analysis of survey data and doctoral student persistence data from both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. The dependent variable was doctoral student completion, as defined as graduation from a doctoral degree program that would include completion of all coursework, passing doctoral comprehensive exams, and fulfillment of the dissertation requirement of the academic department. The independent variables in this study were grouped in two key factors and within each factor the variables were further defined as more specific measurable attributes. These variables included (a) individual doctoral student characteristics (age, ethnicity, gender, financial support, employment, marital status, dependents, distance from campus, debt load, employment status change after comprehensive exams, and enrollment status); and (b) doctoral program characteristics (graduate student orientation programs, departmental assistance, social involvement, dissertation preparation courses, dissertation preparation seminars, clarity and understanding of academic program procedures/requirements, dissertation chair contact, academic involvement, support groups, and mentoring). This study attempted to address the following research questions: (1) Do certain student demographic variables (age, ethnicity, gender, financial support, employment, marital status, dependents, distance from campus, debt load, employment status change after comprehensive exams, and enrollment status) affect doctoral student degree completion? and (2) Do program characteristics (graduate student orientation programs, departmental assistance, social involvement, dissertation preparation courses, dissertation preparation seminars, clarity and understanding of academic program procedures/requirements, dissertation chair contact, academic involvement, support groups, and mentoring) affect doctoral student degree completion? Eight directional hypotheses were tested: (1) Students who are employed full-time will be less likely to complete the doctoral degree; (2) Students who experience an employment status change after comprehensive exams will be less likely to complete the doctoral degree; (3) Students who are enrolled part-time will be less likely to complete the doctoral degree; (4) Students who are satisfied with the departmental assistance available will be more likely to complete the doctoral degree; (5) Students who are satisfied with the opportunity for social involvement during their doctoral degree will be more likely to complete the doctoral degree; (6) Students who are satisfied with the clarity and understanding of academic procedures/requirements within their program will be more likely to complete the doctoral degree; (7) Students who are satisfied with the dissertation chair contact will be more likely to complete the doctoral degree; and 8Students who are satisfied with the opportunities for academic involvement within their program will be more likely to complete the doctoral degree. In order to address these questions, the researcher used a survey instrument adapted from previous surveys used in research on doctoral student attrition designed to assess the influence of individual doctoral student attributes and doctoral program attributes on doctoral student degree completion.

As Pascarella (1986) stated, \"Tinto presented a major theoretical conceptualization of the student persistence or withdrawal process that has been the focus of substantial research\" (p. 100). Tinto's undergraduate model sought to explain that various characteristics influence undergraduate student persistence. These concepts included background characteristics, initial commitments to the goal of college graduation, social and academic integration of student within the college, and subsequent commitments to the goal of college graduation. The model that Tinto developed, substantially contributed to the theoretical understanding of undergraduate student persistence and withdrawal behavior (Pascarella, 1986). After decades of continued and substantial contribution to the topic of undergraduate persistence, Tinto offered the beginnings of a theory on doctoral student attrition in his 1993 influential book on undergraduate attrition. Tinto (1993) suggested that, \"Graduate persistence is shaped by the personal and intellectual interactions that occur within and between students and faculty and the various communities that make up the academic and social systems of the institution\" (p. 231). Tinto explained doctoral persistence, stating: The process of doctoral persistence should be visualized as reflecting an interactive series of nested and intersecting communities not only within the university, but beyond it to the broader intellectual and social communities of students and faculty that define the norms of the field of study at a national level. The process of doctoral persistence seems to be marked by at least three distinct stages, namely that of transition and adjustment, that of attaining candidacy or what might be referred to as the development of competence, and that of completing the research project leading to the awarding of the doctoral degree. (pp. 234-235). Within this influential book published in 1993, Tinto further attempted to develop a longitudinal model of graduate persistence (See Figure 1), but quickly cautioned that the process of graduate persistence cannot be easily described by one simple model. Tinto postulated that factors of importance to attrition included: student attributes, entry goals and orientation, institutional and program experiences, academic and social integration into a program, and research experiences ). Tinto, notably defined several components of the model, including (a) student attributes (gender, age, race, ability, individual educational experiences, and social class); (b) external commitments (work and family responsibilities); (c) individual goals (educational and career); (d) commitments (goal and institutional); (e) financial resources (type and amount of financial aid); and (f) participation in graduate school (full-or parttime attendance and on-or off-campus residence). The model and theory of doctoral persistence posited by Tinto, is in no way offered as a rigid formula that serves as the only method in which to study doctoral student retention/attrition. Tinto's work on doctoral persistence, rather, offers the opportunity to guide research with tools that help provide a frame of reference and allow for evaluation. Therefore, based on this theoretical framework, the researcher sought to address the variables that may serve to assist or detract a doctoral student with degree completion."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variable", "text": "Based on prior research utilization, the researcher used doctoral degree completion as a single defined method of measuring doctoral student progress (Bauer, 2004;Campbell, 1992;Dorn & Papalewis, 1995;Dorn & Papalewis, 1997;Emerson, 1998;Hatley & Fiene, 1995;King & Chepyator-Thompson, 1996;Leadabrand, 1985;Lovitts, 2004;Malmberg, 2000;Pauley, 1998;Stallone, 2003, Tinto, 1993 \nThe dependent variable in this study was doctoral student degree completion. Throughout the body of research on doctoral student attrition or retention doctoral student degree completion stood as the definitive item of success measurement. For the purpose of this study, doctoral student degree completion was defined as graduation from a doctoral degree program that would include completion of all coursework, passing doctoral comprehensive exams, and fulfillment of the dissertation requirement of the academic department. The dependent variable categorized a subject in one of two groups (no doctoral degree completion, doctoral degree completion) and therefore was a dichotomous variable. Glatthorn and Joyner (2005) deduced that the nature of the research problem and the subsequent choice of the research methodology should be viewed as an interactive process. Quantitative research by nature is experimental, searches for relationships between variables, can be interpreted numerically, and can be measured (Glatthorn & Joyner, 2005;Vogt, 2005). This study followed a correlational research design that analyzed relationships between two or more variables and sought to find patterns among variables (Glatthorn & Joyner, 2005). Vogt (2005) summarized correlational research uses measures of association to explain that some of the variance of the dependant variable is caused by a correlation between groups. According to Vogt, \"Regression analysis seeks to explain or predict the variability of a dependent variable using information about one or more independent variables\" (p. 269). Due to the nature of the dependent variable being dichotomous, the researcher utilized logistic regression for statistical analysis. Vogt stated:"}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "When designing the instrument for the NSF, Tinto utilized his theory on doctoral persistence as well as incorporated research that built upon his initial doctoral persistence theory in 1993. The independent variables used were either included in the Tinto (1993) model or the Tinto designed NSF instrument, utilized in prior research, suggested in various research to have influence in the overall experience of the pursuit and experience of attaining a doctoral degree, or designed based on research findings on variables that effect doctoral degree completion. The independent variables in this study were grouped in two key factors, and within each factor the variables are further defined as more specific measurable attributes. Individual doctoral student characteristic variables: 1. Age (Abedi & Benkin, 1987;Campbell, 1992;Huguley, 1988;Lee, 2003;Malmberg, 2004;Pauley, 1998;Tinto, 1993). culture of the institution. The socialization of the student involves a transition into a new career and a new set of values based on the chosen field of study. As Tinto explained in his theory, doctoral students are shaped by the various types of interactions between various individuals at multiple social layers within the institution. Doctoral students are socialized while shifting into a new responsibility and will develop new academic, social, and institutional needs based on adjustment to the student's new institutional and departmental culture. The socialization of the graduate student includes the understanding of institutional and departmental culture held by the student and faculty when considering student role, expectations, and support. Both students and faculty can harbor perceptions, sometimes negative, about the socialization experience of becoming a new graduate student. Gottlieb (1961) conducted a study to assess the extent faculty-student socialization influences effect changes in career orientations of graduate students. Gottlieb utilized data from the National Opinion Research Center's sample of graduate students. The researcher selected the participants through a two-stage stratified cluster sample of graduate students (N = 2,842) from 25 American graduate schools. The participants ranked their preference of items located in the following four categories: (a) career preferences, (b) level of integration with faculty, (c) faculty value climate, and (d) specific encouragement. Gottlieb found a large portion of graduate students reported a change in their career preferences. The investigator discovered the more integrated a student was with the faculty, the more likely the student would change career preference. Gottlieb determined that single-minded departments produced the greatest amount of changers towards research than do eclectic departments. Winston (1976) assessed the perceptions of graduate students and faculty in relation to enrollment and departmental environments. The researcher sought to understand the graduate student environment in order to produce programmatic responses in reaction to the needed change indicated by graduate students. The participants in the Winston study responded to the Graduate Environmental Perception Scales (GEPS) instrument mailed to all entering graduate students, established graduate students, and faculty from the History, Psychology, and Counseling and Student Personnel Services departments at the University of Georgia. The participants (N = 180) in the Winston study rated perceptions and expectations in five sections. Winston found entering students had significantly unrealistic expectations that did not match those of continuing students or faculty. The researcher noted entering graduate students expected a much more intimate, personal, caring, and social character to their relationships with peers and faculty than was reported to exist in any department. Kuh and Thomas (1983) examined whether graduate students experienced developmental transitions. The researchers grounded the study in a composite developmental framework of adult development theory. The participants in the study were randomly selected from a group of graduate students (N = 20) enrolled in the spring semester at a midwestern university. The research subjects in this study responded to questions that assessed developmental tasks while raters assessed behavioral patterns of the participants' responses. The investigators' analysis demonstrated significant differences in behavioral patterns of adult students and younger students. A majority of older students' behavior patterns fit into a category of responsible adulthood, while almost 100% of the younger students' behavior patterns rested into categories of either novice adult or rethinking adulthood. Kuh and Thomas (1983) reported four themes that emerged from content analysis of students' responses: (a) redefinition of self, (b) purposeful independence, (c) exploration versus maintenance of a stable life pattern, and (d) the dream. Corcoran and Clark (1984) conducted a study to assess the differences in socialization experiences and career attitudes that indicate career success for two groups Investigators determined most faculty decided to pursue a faculty career after the undergraduate experience and were influenced by both undergraduate and graduate faculty. The researchers indicated participants recognized the anticipatory socialization gained through both observation of faculty in their career roles and participation in teaching and research. Corcoran and Clark (1984)  The researchers reported that after 4 years of the study a significant number of students did not wish to pursue a career in the professoriate. Nyquist et al. (1999) found three common themes concerning the graduate students' experiences: (a) graduate students experienced tension when adapting to the values embodied in higher education, and (e) self-awareness. The researcher indicated the importance of including the five themes in an overall model of professional development offered to graduate students. Austin (2002) based an article on a previous collaborative longitudinal study conducted by multiple authors. The researcher focused this study on the examination of doctoral education as socialization for the professoriate. The investigator undergirded the research through the lens that described socialization as a systematic process in which students constructed their individual roles through interaction and engagement with others. The study participants were a purposive sample of graduate students (N = 79) in various disciplines (humanities, sciences, social sciences, professional) at two universities who aspired to be college professors and held teaching assistantships. Participants responded to open-ended interview questions that asked the students to reflect on their experiences as graduate students. Austin 2002 Weidman and Stein (2003) conducted a study to assess the informal socialization of doctoral students to the academic norms of research and scholarship. The researchers undergirded the concepts and variables tested with the Weidman, Twale, and Stein (2001) framework of graduate and professional student socialization. The participants in the study were doctoral students (N = 50) in the sociology department and department of educational policy and administration at a major research university. The participants responded to a mailed questionnaire that assessed characteristics of socialization of graduate students. Weidman and Stein found students' perceptions of being in a supportive faculty environment and departmental collegiality were associated with student scholarly encouragement. The researchers determined that perceptions of being in a supportive faculty environment were associated with collegiality among the departmental faculty and student-faculty interaction. Weidman and Stein determined that students' perception of the clarity and understanding of departmental norms were important to the student experience. The most significant general findings discovered by the above studies related to incoming graduate student perceptions on expectations being unrealistic (Winston, 1976) and the finding that graduate students reported positive career changes and career affirmations related to stronger integration with faculty during their transition into the department (Corcoran & Clark, 1984;Gottlieb, 1961;Nyquist et al., 1999;Winston, 1976). Researchers indicated socialization into graduate education produced opportunities to reflect on personal growth and development, understanding, and camaraderie (Kuh & Thomas, 1983;Poock, 2001). Confirming concepts postulated by Tinto's doctoral student attrition theory, researchers found the key components needed to foster graduate student socialization were interaction with faculty, interaction with peers, and opportunities for observation and participation (Austin, 2002;Brown-Wright et al., 1997;Corcoran & Clark, 1984;Poock, 2001). Students reported an emphasis on the development of personal/quality life goals when entering graduate education (Kuh & Thomas, 1983). Nyquist et al. (1999) found that graduate students indicated a need for help in managing stress and anxiety of the new role. The understanding of departmental and career norms strongly associated with greater likelihood of doctoral student persistence (Weidman & Stein, 2003). Furthering Tinto's thoughts on students developing career norms and belonging to nested communities, researchers indicated that graduate assistantships and teaching assistantships contributed to departmental and career socialization (Corcoran & Clark, 1984).\nThe independent variables in this study were grouped in two key factors, and within each factor the variables are further defined as more specific measurable attributes. Individual doctoral student characteristic variables: 1. Age -Ratio scale based on self-reported date of birth by year. 8. Academic Involvement -Interval four item scale with 5-point Likert-type response measuring satisfaction with opportunities for academic involvement within the doctoral program. 9. Support Groups -Dummy coded nominal variable indicating participation in this type of support group. 10. Mentor -Dummy coded nominal variable indicating utilization of a mentor."}, {"section_title": "Orientation", "text": "The studies addressed in this section reviewed the issues of general practices and effects of orientation on student adjustment. Orientation programs typically occur prior to the start of the new student's academic endeavor. Tinto's doctoral student attrition theory postulated that one of the stages of persistence included a time of initial transition and adjustment. Orientation programs serve to address perception, transition, and role acquisition that graduate students' experience. These topics addressed programmatic, structural, and policy concepts that surround graduate student orientation. Certain common practices occur in orientation programs at a variety of institutions. Universities offered orientations that contained distinctions as either campus-wide or departmental specific. Orientation programs serve as the initial organized experience that graduate students encounter as an incoming member at the institution. Rosenblatt and Christensen (1993)  which ascertained strengths of the program and suggestions for improvement. Rosenblatt and Christensen (1993) explained all participants found the program to be extremely helpful. The researchers reported students' unanimity when indicating positively that the program should be offered again. Rosenblatt and Christensen determined students noted that the information presented, the chance to meet faculty and students, and the chance to register for classes were all positive aspects of the program. Barker, Felstehausen, Couch, and Henry (1997)  Taub and Komives (1998) conducted a study to assess graduate student perceptions of the effectiveness and importance of the various components of the comprehensive orientation approach in the college student personnel (CSP) program at the University of Maryland. The goals of the CSP comprehensive orientation program allowed the students to assess themselves, the chosen professional field, and the institution for proper \"fit.\" Participants in the study responded to a survey administered in the fall to the incoming class of CSP students (N = 15). The research subjects rated perceptions of the importance and the effectiveness of the various components of the comprehensive orientation approach. Taub and Komives (1998)  The most significant general findings discovered by the above studies included: (a) graduate students indicated a need for services and orientation activities to help understand university resources and meet academic and educational objectives (Rosenblatt & Christensen, 1993); (b) time to meet faculty and other students when transitioning were positive opportunities to orientation programs (Poock, 2002;Rosenblatt & Christensen, 1993;Taub & Komives, 1998); and (c) graduate students perceived orientations were needed for the improvement of the graduate experience (Coulter et al., 2004). Research explained that a majority of graduate students perceived an orientation program would be helpful and that they would attend (Barker et al., 1997;Rosenblatt & Christensen, 1993). Orientations allowed students time to meet faculty and classmates and provided needed information (Taub & Komives, 1998). Graduate students viewed orientations as important and were willing to arrive early to campus prior to the semester to attend an orientation (Barker et al., 1997;Poock, 2002). Investigators explained the most common components of orientation included awareness of institutional policies, student services, and academic facilities and resources available to students (Poock, 2002). Orientation programs generally produced an effect on issues of graduate student adjustment to a new role and institution (Barker et al., 1997). The results from these various students highlighted importance that Tinto explained of building the nested levels of community that serve to maintain persistence throughout a doctoral program. The orientation event functioned as a mechanism for programs and institutions to introduce the students to the people, structures, values, and career roles that serve to support the students' adjustment and development of layers of community that Tinto attributed to persistence."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Student Support", "text": "The studies addressed in this section reviewed the issues of graduate student support throughout the graduate and doctoral studies career. The forms of support measured included spouse/family, adviser, financial, cohort, employer support while pursuing the degree, faculty support, and departmental support. Varying levels of support types tend to have positive and negative effects on the level of commitment and progress. Tinto's theory on doctoral attrition explained that in a second stage of persistence the student is adjusting and developing competency. It is at this point that the nested layers of community (academic, social, family, career, etc.) assist in furthering the students' development in order to integrate the academic and social experiences which can propel the doctoral student forward into candidacy and along the way to completion. Doctoral student support within the department, with the adviser/committee, and with other peers could provide a connection to the pulse of the university and the department and serve as a strong tool to motivate student persistence. The transition into graduate school and eventually into doctoral candidacy manifested as the unknown situations in which students most often indicated the need for support. Goplerud (1980)  and support groups for minority students. Single graduate students perceived a significantly higher need for time management workshops, opportunities for sports and cultural events, on-campus apartment options, and support groups for minority students. Berg and Ferber (1983) conducted a study to examine various success measures of male and female graduate students and whether the measures led to different results. The participants (N = 459) in the study were graduate students from 32 academic units at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The respondents completed a mailed questionnaire that measured, among other things, importance of intellectual challenge, satisfaction, intellectual and social contact, and support. Berg and Ferber (1983) indicated more women than men received support from their family and spouse. The researchers found men and women were similar in satisfaction and problems in graduate school. The investigators explained that, in forming relationships with faculty, students gravitated to faculty of the same sex. Berg and Ferber determined three measures associated with earning a doctoral degree: (a) intellectual challenge was very important in choosing the field of study, (b) the student was more likely treated as a junior colleague by at least one male faculty, and (c) the student was more likely to develop a strong relationship with two or more male faculty members. Lawson and Fuehrer (1989) conducted a study to assess whether or not social support buffered stress experienced by graduate students and to connect what types of support would best address varying types of stress. The study participants were a randomly sampled group of first-year graduate students (N = 20) in the English, history, and zoology departments of a midwestern university. The participants in the study responded to semi-structured interview questions about stressful situations while in school. Researchers indicated social support served as a main effect of negating stress and improving satisfaction with graduate school. Lawson and Fuehrer explained highly stressed individuals gained more from social support. Researchers noted students that reported the most satisfaction also reported the most stress and subsequently reported the highest usage and need of social support. Globetti, Globetti, and Smith (1991) conducted a study to examine the perceived needs of graduate students at a southern public university. The researchers developed the study to respond to a need for practical and policy considerations in the provision of student services and programs for graduate students. The participants in the study responded to the Student Needs Assessment Survey (SNAS) mailed to a random sample of 1,700 undergraduate and graduate students who attended the state-supported university. The student response (N = 762) provided 122 responses from graduate students. The investigators found graduate students placed a heavier emphasis on personal/quality of life goals than on academic professional or service goals. The researchers explained graduate students reported a strong need in career development areas. Globetti et al. (1991) determined graduate students needed help with educational planning, especially in acquiring financial resources. Overall, investigators indicated graduate students expressed a need for help in handling stress and anxiety. Hodgson and Simoni (1995) conducted a study to examine how students in various fields of study differed with respect to graduate social support, financial problems, perceived academic functioning, and psychological distress. The researchers undergirded the study with previous research by the National Research Council indicating students in non-science fields of study experienced longer time to degree compared to students in life and physical sciences. The participants in the study responded to the Graduate Student Stress Survey offered to all full-time, first-year and second-year doctoral students (N = 538) in the School of Letters and Science at a large urban university in the southwest. The investigators explained the need for more financial aid for students in humanities and social sciences. The researchers found no difference in psychological distress between the students in differing disciplines. Hodgson and Simoni reported a lack of graduate social support and financial problems strongly related to psychological distress. Webb, Njoku, and Allen (1996) conducted a study to assess doctoral students' perceptions of institutional and program quality. The study participants were a random sample of doctoral business students (N = 392) from 12 northeastern public and private colleges. Respondents indicated their level of agreement or disagreement to survey questions related to quality of service in six different areas of institutional services. Webb et al. (1996) found four significant differences between institution type and perception of quality: (a) international/global studies, (b) external grant assistance, (c) quality of library publications, and (d) circulation time for library materials. Investigators indicated both types of institutions needed to improve the following services: (a) preparation of students for changes in job markets, (b) mentoring programs, (c) training on Internet/e-mail, (d) preparation of students for data analysis, (e) offering evening courses, (f) assistance in grant writing, (g) supply of research rooms in library, and (h) involvement of students in policy and curriculum changes. Hahs (1998) conducted a study that analyzed graduate student assistants' needs for perseverance toward graduation in order to create a model for graduate student support. The participants (N = 144) in the study were graduate students holding assistantships at the University of Alabama. The research subjects responded to the Graduate Student Services Survey, which measured, among other things, time on campus, graduate level involvement, and interest in workshops and social activities. Hahs 1998 Seagram, Gould, and Pyke (1998) conducted a study to assess male and female doctoral training experiences, financial support, adviser relationship, and enrollment status on time taken to complete the doctoral degree. The participants (N = 154) in the study were graduates of various doctoral programs at York University. The respondents completed a mailed questionnaire designed to assess experiences as doctoral students, experiences with supervision, and financial/enrollment information. Seagram et al. (1998) found no significant effects of gender on time to completion. Conversely, the researchers indicated women more often determined their committees delayed their degree progress. The investigators discovered initial full-time students who changed status to part-time enrollment took significantly longer to complete the degree compared to the full-time students. The researchers found those that completed the degree in the fastest time had several traits in common: Kelly and Schweitzer (1999) conducted a study to explore which graduate students mentor other students and to assess the effects of mentoring on graduate students' perception of university climate, grades, and provision of funding. The study participants were a stratified random sample of caucasian graduate students, minority graduate students, and international graduate students. Participants (N = 670) in the study responded to either a survey by phone or a mailed questionnaire that assessed aspects of mentoring with questions that required simple answers (yes, no) and aspects of the institutional climate. Graduate students with some type of mentor reported better perceptions of the institutional climate (Kelly & Schweitzer, 1999). The researchers revealed a significantly higher number of minority students mentor students outside of their respective racial groups. The investigators found graduate students with mentors received better grades and had a higher propensity to receive financial funding. The most significant general findings discovered by the above studies included the following: (a) social support increased satisfaction and decreased stress (Goplerud, 1980;Lawson & Fuehrer, 1989); (b) lack of social support and financial support greatly increased stress (Hodgson & Simoni, 1995;Lawson & Fuehrer, 1989); and (c) stronger emotional and intellectual faculty/student relationships reduced the likelihood of health and emotional problems in the first semester of graduate school (Goplerud, 1980); frequent and consistent adviser interaction increased persistence (Berg & Ferber, 1983); and (e) graduate students expressed a need for help in handling stress and anxiety (Globetti, Globetti, & Smith, 1991). Graduate students explained a need for structured opportunities to meet with peers and faculty along with regular mentoring and advising (Kelly & Schweitzer, 1999). Beginning graduate school brought on a time of major life transitions. Hahs (1998) determined the graduate students indicated strong interest in workshops involving topics on thesis and dissertation writing, computer training, resume writing, grant writing, and financial aid. Students continued to express needs for assistance in many facets of both the academic and personal issues faced while in graduate school. Investigators found graduate students with mentors received better grades and had a higher propensity to receive financial funding (Kelly & Schweitzer, 1999). The research in this section found that doctoral students needed and were developing understanding of the roles and tools for success. As Tinto' theory on doctoral attrition explained, the layers of commitment (goal and institutional) shape the participation within the various communities of a doctoral program. The researchers in this section found that integration of the institutional experiences and nested community layers Tinto explained, provided satisfaction and better doctoral student success."}, {"section_title": "Dissertation Preparation/Structure", "text": "The studies reviewed in this section discussed the concepts centered on structured programming to service needs of doctoral students. The following studies continually demonstrate the strong need of doctoral students to have structured support and clearly established procedures throughout the dissertation process. Doctoral students in multiple studies indicate a need for stronger departmental communication concerning requirements, procedures, and resources connected to completing the doctoral degree. Tinto's theory on doctoral attrition explained that a final phase of persistence was completing the research project or dissertation. This final phase, as Tinto described, included faculty/advisor relationships and research opportunities as being central to the students' experience within the department/program. At the beginning of doctoral study and in the dissertation phase, defined structure serves as the single most effective tool in persistence and degree completion. Courses, seminars, support groups, and departmental resources can provide doctoral students with much needed structure, experience, and guidance in eliminating the sometimes mystifying process of completing the doctoral degree. Heiss (1967) conducted a study to assess the quality and character doctoral students experienced in their education and to highlight stressful points in the doctoral process. The participants (N = 2,251) in the study were doctoral students from various departments at the University of California at Berkley. The respondents completed a mailed questionnaire designed to assess doctoral degree requirements and the quality of student/faculty relationships along with a smaller sample (n = 100) that completed semistructured interviews. Heiss 1967explained most students indicated they pursued doctoral education either to become a faculty member or due to an interest in an intellectual life. The researcher found only half of the students began their doctoral education expecting to complete the degree. The investigator determined nearly one third of students experienced the first year of doctoral education without an adviser. Heiss stated many students noted the selection of the dissertation topic took too long and proved to be an isolating process. The researcher reported some students felt ill-prepared for research and unable to cope with the writing required for the dissertation. The investigator found parttime students and off-campus students expressed alienation and hostility toward the institution more frequently compared to students with higher peer interaction. Cuetara and LeCapitaine (1991) conducted a study to examine training procedures of doctoral programs and to explore the relationship between training environment and student dissertation writing experiences. The participants (N = 192) in the study were recent graduates of doctoral programs in counseling psychology from various universities throughout the United States. The research subjects completed a mailed questionnaire that contained the Training Environment for the Dissertation Scale, the Dissertation Implementation Scale, the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, and a small qualitative component. Cuetara and LeCapitaine (1991) found respondents indicated strongly that research courses helped prepare students to select a researchable problem for the dissertation and write the dissertation. The researchers indicated a higher level of student research exposure correlated with lower negative effects such as depression, anxiety, and hostility toward the dissertation. The investigators explained higher student research preparation helped stimulate research interest and lower student research preparation strongly reduced research interest. Students found that a lack of structure and direction from the adviser became a serious problem and led to delayed or failed completion of the dissertation. Baker 1992 Baker found traditional age students expressed a greater need for and use of most services than adult students. The researcher determined graduate students desired services to fulfill academic and educational needs. peers, advisers, and faculty; (e) facilitating cooperative work and mentorship between the student and adviser; and (f) producing a complete research proposal. Hatley and Fiene (1995) found that all students that enrolled in the seminar had completed the seminar requirements, received dissertation proposal approval, completed the dissertation, and received the doctoral degree. The researchers explained the department continued to offer the seminar after the initial experiment and the seminar has served more than 100 students successfully. The investigators found the departmental seminar drastically reduced the population of ABD students. The researchers determined the departmental seminar led to the following improvements: (a) enhanced timely degree attainment, (b) increased consistency in writing, (c) enhanced clarity in research design, and (d) encouraged a more cooperative departmental environment. Kluever (1997) conducted a study that compared intellectual and academic attributes of doctoral graduates with ABD doctoral students. The participants (N = 239) in the study were doctoral graduates (n = 142) and ABD doctoral students (n = 97) from the college of education at the University of Denver. The respondents completed a mailed questionnaire that consisted of the Procrastination Scale, the Help-Hindrance Scale, and the Responsibility Scale. Kluever 1997 well-managed time allocation. The researchers summarized common themes students expressed concerning difficulties experienced: (a) the dissertation process lacks structure, has no defined beginning or end, and has no prescribed outcome; (b) the dissertation process lacks clarity and guidelines; (c) students had difficulty getting the dissertation started; (d) students had difficulty finding time to work on the dissertation among other responsibilities; and (e) students had difficulty finding a supportive adviser and committee. Sigafus (1998) conducted a study to focus on the point in which doctoral students exhibited disenchantment with their doctoral studies. The researcher based the exploration on a previous study centered on understanding how full-time professional educators adjusted when adding a doctoral program to their commitments. The participants (N = 25) in the study were doctoral students in the latter stages of a doctoral program in educational administration and supervision at the University of Kentucky. The respondents participated in both small group and individual interviews to gather information on the perceptions of their experiences. Golde and Dore (2001) conducted a national study to provide a summary of the experiences of doctoral students in the arts and sciences. The participants (N = 4,114) of the study were doctoral students in various disciplines in the arts and sciences from universities across the United States. The research subjects responded to the Survey of Doctoral Education and Career Preparation, which measured reasons for pursuit of the doctoral degree, perception of effectiveness of their programs, and their expectations and understanding of their programs. The researchers found doctoral students did not receive the educational training they wanted, and the training did not prepare them for their desired jobs. Golde and Dore (2001) explained many students did not understand how the process of doctoral education functioned, how to navigate the process, or what was involved in doctoral study. The investigators determined students satisfied with their adviser utilized many more adviser selection criteria than the students dissatisfied with their adviser. The researchers found less than half of the respondents indicated a clear understanding of graduation criteria, and barely one third of the respondents clearly understood the length of time for doctoral study. Golde and Dore summarized that a mismatch occurred among the purpose of doctoral education, the student goals of doctoral education, and the careers available for doctoral graduates. Lampley 2001used gap analysis in a study to assess the differences among service quality expectations and experiences of doctoral students. The study participants were a random sample of doctoral students (N = 300) in either the department of education or philosophy at six universities. Respondents completed a questionnaire, which asked students to compare their experiences with their expectations of service quality at the institution they attended. The researcher utilized t tests to determine gaps in differences between doctoral student expectations and doctoral student experiences. Lampley explained that the larger the gap score, the higher the dissatisfaction doctoral students experienced with his or her academic endeavors. The investigator found a significant relationship between the gap score and six of the seven dimensions that explained differences between doctoral student expectations and doctoral student experiences. The researcher determined age influenced satisfaction with education. Lampley explained that participants with large gap scores were less satisfied with services provided by the institution. The areas with the largest gap scores included (a) course scheduling reflects the needs of students, (b) university possesses up-to-date technology, (c) university records are maintained error-free, and (d) business and support staff resolve student problems in a fair manner. Forney and Davis (2002) conducted a qualitative study of ongoing transition sessions provided for graduate students to ascertain the perceptions of the most and least helpful aspects of the sessions, impacts on the students individually and collectively, and suggestions for improvement. The researchers undergirded the transition sessions by the theoretical base on transition established by Schlossberg, Waters, and Goodman (1995). The participants in the study were a purposive sample of first-year and second-year students (N = 119) in the college student personnel program at Western Illinois The most significant general findings discovered by the above studies included the following: (a) students were not prepared academically (Heiss, 1967;Kluever, 1997;); (b) dissertation process was unstructured and isolating (Cuetara & LeCapitaine, 1991;Heiss, 1967); and (c) graduate students desired student services to fulfill academic needs (Baker, 1992). Doctoral students indicated a need to clarify dissertation guidelines and requirements and that the transition into doctoral candidacy began a period of needed structure and clarity (Kluever et al., 1997). Investigators concluded dissertation support groups assisted in motivation, support, structure, and persistence (Forney & Davis, 2002;Hatley & Fiene, 1995). The researchers in this section presented results that supported Tinto's concepts on attrition in that support, structure, and involvement at multiple levels within a department/program were critical in moving or not moving to degree completion. A lack of structure and direction from advisers led to delayed or even failed completion (Cuetara & LeCapitaine, 1991;Kluever et al., 1997). Researchers suggested departments invest resources in coursework and student programs centered on training for the dissertation process, career roles, and addressing student concerns (Golde & Dore, 2001;Hatley & Fiene, 1995;Kluever et al., 1997;Lampley, 2001). Multiple studies indicated a lack of understanding of the time required for doctoral completion, skills needed for doctoral completion, criteria required for doctoral completion, who the student's adviser was and how to choose the adviser, and clear starting and ending points of the doctoral degree (Cuetara & LeCapitaine, 1991;Golde & Dore, 2001;Heiss, 1967;)."}, {"section_title": "Retention/Attrition", "text": "The studies covered in this section addressed the issues of retention/attrition of students in higher education. Graduate students have demonstrated dismal persistence rates throughout the country. Addressing graduate student needs when adjusting to a new environment serve as an important element of retention. Graduate student retention may be affected by a variety of aspects that are independent of the student. Structural, individual, and institutional methods are discussed; these factors allow the opportunity for students to develop a more meaningful connection to the institution and persist at greater rates. The research in this section highlighted the multiple phases of persistence, as well as the influence of socialization, student support, orientation, and dissertation structure on persistence as described by Tinto's theory on doctoral attrition. Lunneborg and Lunneborg (1973) Wood (1976) conducted a study to identify attrition factors, critical attrition periods within a doctoral program, and differences between completers and noncompleters of a doctoral degree. The participants (N = 325) in the study were doctoral student graduates (n = 139), Education Specialist students (n = 11), and inactive doctoral students (n = 72) in the College of Education at the University of Toledo. The research subjects responded to a questionnaire designed to assess perceptions or barriers to completion along with assessments of doctoral student characteristics. Wood (1976) found that overall graduates experienced fewer stressful incidents during academic pursuit than did dropouts. The researcher explained dropouts expressed more financial trouble, less spousal support, and incongruence between the academic degree and career interests. The investigator determined that dropouts indicated weaker faculty relationships, higher academic pressures, and stronger work pressures than did graduates. Wood found a much larger proportion of graduates received scholarship or assistantship than did dropouts. The researcher indicated dropouts tended to be older and averaged a longer time between receipt of their last degree and enrollment in the doctoral program than did graduates. Cook and Swanson (1978)  Terenzini (1979) study that measured student and faculty relationships and students' academic and intellectual development. Leadabrand found those students that temporarily halted study indicated problems with work pressure, family issues, or financial trouble. The researcher discovered the students rated their adviser and spouse as a positive factor in the doctoral program. The investigator determined the following factors to be significant to persistence: (a) academic and intellectual development, (b) peer group relations, (c) informal relations with faculty, (d) institutional and goal commitment, and (e) motivation. Ott and Markewich (1985) conducted a study to identify predictors of graduation within a range of years after admission and to identify predictors of retention each year after entry to programs of both master's and doctoral students. The researchers desired to develop a model of graduate student retention and graduation. The participants (N = 4,512) in the study included both master's students (n = 3,058) and doctoral students (n = 1,454) at the University of Maryland, College Park. The investigators developed the desired model and applied the model to the sample group using logit analysis to identify the various potential predictors sought in the research. Ott and Markewich found differences in predicted retention of academic departments related to specific perceived advantages of a compared discipline to sacrifices required for completion of the degree. The researchers explained full-time student status had greater predicted retention and graduation rates and could result in stronger social integration than part-time students. Ethington and Smart (1986) conducted a study to assess a model of enrollment decision for graduate schools. The researchers utilized data drawn from the longitudinal study of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) which was designed to study cognitive and affective student outcomes of the college experience (N = 6,242). The investigators identified 12 independent variables and categorized them as either exogenous or endogenous. The investigators determined the model utilizing the abovementioned independent variables accounted for more than 33% of variance in graduate school attendance. Researchers found the stronger the social and academic involvement of students while at the undergraduate institution, the greater the likelihood of attending graduate school.   Wagner found that no statistical significance existed between doctoral graduates and ABD students on fear of success or locus of control. The researcher determined, however, that certain factors emerged as barriers for ABD students: (a) dissertation adviser and committee, (b) the dissertation topic, (c) statistical research skills, (d) geographic distance from campus, (e) finances, (f) job schedules, and (g) time allotted for dissertation work. The investigator explained first-born and only children completed the degree more often and men more often completed the degree than women. White (1986) conducted a study to examine factors that contributed to doctoral students halting the pursuit of the doctoral degree. The participants in the study were doctoral students (N = 34) who withdrew from doctoral studies from the Florida State University and the University of West Florida Cooperative External Doctoral Program. The research subjects completed a questionnaire designed to assess factors related to doctoral attrition based on previous research studies. White  Cooke, Sims, and Peyrefitte (1995) conducted a study to identify personal attributes that predicted graduate student attrition. In order to provide stronger minority representation, the study participants were a cluster sampling of graduate students (N = 230) enrolled in the business, engineering, public administration, and education departments at a southeastern urban university. Participants responded to a survey, which incorporated multiple questionnaires from previous research that were adapted to address various factors needing to be studied. The researchers divided the survey in sections, each with a unique Likert scale used to measure participant responses. The investigators indicated more than 84% of dropouts were correctly classified and more than 80% of graduated/current students were correctly classified. Researchers explained graduate student attitudes and intention to continue were significant predictors of attrition. The investigators found graduate students with higher school satisfaction and commitment continued with school at a higher rate. Dorn and Papalewis (1995) conducted a study to analyze persistence motivators of doctoral students including social interaction, peer mentoring, and group cohesiveness. The participants (N = 108) in the study were doctoral students in educational administration from eight universities. The research subjects responded to the Ehrenberg and Mavros (1995) conducted a study to assess doctoral student completion rates and time-to-degree for students in select disciplines. The participants of the study were doctoral students in the departments of economics, English, physics, and mathematics at Cornell University. The researchers computed frequencies and estimated models based on the collected data. Ehrenberg and Mavros found that almost half of all those that dropped out of doctoral programs did so in the first 2 years of study. The researchers determined student GRE scores were not associated with completion and dropout. The investigators explained students starting the doctoral programs with a master's degree had a greater likelihood of completing the program and a lower likelihood of dropping out. Ehrenberg and Mavros found students receiving fellowships or research assistantships had higher completion rates and shorter time-to-degree compared to students with teaching assistantships, tuition waivers, or self-support. King and Chepyator-Thompson (1996)  The researchers found that 80% of all doctoral students completed a graduate program. Nerad and Miller (1996)  Kluever and Green (1998) explained respondents felt the student does and should bear the most responsibility for dissertation progress more than the university or the committee. The investigators reported current students felt more strongly than graduates about taking responsibility for their preparation. Kluever and Green explained higher procrastination levels and stronger barrier perceptions to dissertation completion were found for those with stronger perception of university responsibility for dissertation tasks. The investigators concluded the Responsibility Scale demonstrated viability for assessing respondents' attitudes toward responsibility for degree and dissertation completion. Pauley (1998)  Lovitts and Nelson (2000) conducted a mixed-methods study to assess the shortterm and long-term effects of completing or not completing a doctoral degree. The study participants were a randomly sampled group of students (N = 816) who entered doctoral programs at two distinguished research universities, one private, urban university, the other a public, rural university. The participants in the study responded to a detailed survey designed to examine reasons students leave or do not leave the academic program. A select group (n = 18) of two students for each of the nine academic departments represented in the study also completed an hour-long telephone interview. Lovitts and Nelson found integration into the department's social and professional life highly correlated with successful completion of the doctorate. The investigators indicated students who completed their degree were twice more likely to be satisfied with their relationship with the faculty adviser than those who did not complete their degree. de Valero (2001) found students that completed degrees in the shortest time and most frequency shared the following factors: (a) financial support, (b) departmental orientation and advising, (c) relationship between coursework and research training, (d) required significant results during the dissertation, (e) student-committee/adviser relationship, (f) department focused on students, (g) student participation, and (h) peer support. The researcher determined for the most successful students, departmental climate was positive and advisers were involved from the beginning of the doctoral study to the final dissertation defense. The investigator found students who completed degrees in the longest time and least frequency shared the following factors: (a) departmental advising and orientation impeded success, (b) conflicts among people, (c) limited departmental social and academic activities, and (d) lack of student/faculty collaboration. Leppel (2002) conducted a study to examine similarities and differences in persistence of men and women. The investigator undergirded the research based on the understanding that students compare the satisfaction they expect to obtain from attending/persisting in college with the satisfaction they expect from nonattendance/dropping out. The researcher based the study on data gathered in the 1990 survey of Beginning Graduate Students (BPS). The participants in this study were a stratified sample of male and female first-time students (N = 5,384) starting college at institutions across the nation and enrolled in courses leading to a bachelor's degree. Respondents completed a survey of demographic data and questions about their participation in certain activities and their perceived abilities. The researcher found children had a significant negative impact on persistence for men, but a significant positive impact on persistence for women. The investigator determined the variable of being Black had positive impacts on persistence for women, but negative impacts on persistence for men. Leppel (2002) determined that age, marriage, and hours worked had a negative impact on persistence for all students and that family income and grade point average had a positive impact on persistence for all students. The researcher explained persistence was higher for all students who had higher integration into the institution. Lee (2003) conducted a study to determine factors that affected the noncompletion of doctoral degrees by students who had completed all degree requirements except the dissertation. The population for the study consisted of students (N = 312) who were enrolled, enrolled but later discontinued, and those who graduated from the educational administration and curriculum and instruction doctoral programs at Tennessee State University from 1988-1998. Lee specifically referenced Tinto's (1993) research as the theoretical basis for this study. The researcher utilized variables drawn directly from the model postulated by Tinto (1993). Demographic variables included age, ethnicity, gender, financial support, employment, marital status, number of dependants, and enrollment status. Program variables utilized included departmental assistance factors, social involvement, dissertation chair contact, and academic involvement. Lee administered the Doctoral Studies Questionnaire, which was adapted from the National Science Foundation (NSF) instrument developed by Tinto (1995Tinto ( -1996 while at Syracuse University. Lee found the following results: (a) a significant difference existed between the levels of overall satisfaction of doctoral degree recipients and ABD responders, (b) a significant difference existed regarding perceptions of research satisfaction between doctoral degree recipients and ABD responders, (c) a significant difference existed between doctoral degree recipients and ABD responders based on overall satisfaction with the faculty adviser, and (d) a significant difference existed between doctoral degree recipients and ABD responders based on satisfaction with the dissertation chair. departmental factors, student internal motivation accounted strongly for persistence. Lovitts (2004) conducted a study to determine the social-structural causes of attrition. The researcher grounded the research in the theory of cognitive maps and the theory of integration. The participants (N = 816) in the study were students that completed the doctoral degree (n = 511) and students that did not complete the doctoral degree (n = 305) at two universities. The research subjects participated in a survey and a select group of non-completers (n = 30) took part in semi-structured telephone interviews. Lovitts 2004 The researcher found completers overwhelmingly received research assistantships or teaching assistantships compared to non-completers and one quarter of non-completers received no financial support at all. Lovitts explained completers were more likely to have an adviser, more likely to be satisfied with their adviser, and more likely to have selected the adviser based on academic interests. The researcher summarized attrition related to unequal distribution of support resources for dissertation completion. Golde (2005) conducted a study to understand the department and the disciplinary influence on doctoral student attrition. The researcher undergirded the study with theoretical framework defined initially by Tinto (1993) and further explained by Lovitts. The framework or model explained three postulates: (a) doctoral attrition evolved through the interaction/lack of interaction between the student and the institution; (b) doctoral students must be integrated into both the discipline and the department; and (c) academic integration was most important to doctoral integration, while social integration has an indirect effect. Participants in the study were a purposive sample of doctoral students (N = 58) who had left the doctoral program in four departments at one midwestern university. The research subjects responded to semi-structured interview questions regarding their reason for choosing the school, their graduate school experience, and contributions to their decision to leave the program. Golde (2005) found six themes emerged that led to attrition: (a) research practices not matched with student's strengths; (b) poor fit of expectations between student and department, inaccurate expectations about nature of graduate school, and academically under prepared; (c) mismatch between adviser and student; (d) student perceived research university faculty life was incompatible; (e) student perceived job market to be poor; and (f) structural isolation of student. The researcher explained a common theme that students perceived a looming departmental requirement, which usually led to advancement to candidacy, as a significant hurdle and contributed to attrition. The most significant general findings discovered by the above studies included the following: (a) social integration and student's institutional commitment had direct effects on persistence (Golde, 2000); (b) developing a social network helped retain students at a higher rate (Berry, 1993;de Valero, 2001;Lovitts & Nelson, 2000;Stallone, 2003); (c) the relationship with the faculty adviser was the key to remaining at the university and key during the dissertation stage Campbell, 1992;de Valero, 2001;Lovitts & Nelson, 2000;Malmberg, 2000;Stallone, 2003;Wood, 1978); (d) integration of graduate students into the social and professional aspects of their department and holding graduate assistantships increased retention (de Valero, 2001;Golde, 2000;Lovitts, 2004;Lovitts & Nelson, 2000;Stallone, 2003); (e) stronger communication/relationship with adviser and committee chair had positive effects on persistence (Berry, 1993;de Valero, 2001;Lee, 2003;Lovitts & Nelson, 2000;Wynn, 2003); (f) scholarships/financial support or assistantships increased persistence (Abedi & Benkin, 1987;Bauer, 2004;Cook & Swanson, 1978;de Valero, 2001;Ehrenberg & Mavros, 1995;Gillingham et al., 1991;Isaac et al., 1991;King & Chepyator-Thompson, 1996;Pauley, 1998;Sheridan & Pyke, 1994); (g) more research preparation assisted in dissertation completion ; and (h) orientation program participation produced higher grade point averages and higher graduation rates (Bauer, 2004;Poock, 2002). The studies echoed a need for centralized information within the department on aspects of professional and academic development, social activities, and support groups (Bauer, 2004;Pauley, 1998). Researchers determined orientation program attendance produced long-term positive retention benefits for students and that students who attended orientation were more likely to persist, more likely to re-enroll, and more likely to obtain a degree (de Valero, 2001). Investigators noted that contrary to popular belief, doctoral attrition occurred early in the program and prior to completion of doctoral coursework (Cook & Swanson, 1978;Ehrenberg & Mavros, 1995;Nerad & Miller, 1996;White, 1986). Along the lines of personal or individual characteristics, multiple researchers found human variables connected to persistence/attrition. Various studies found the following attributes to play a role in doctoral student attrition: (a) priority placed on dissertation (Berry, 1993;Cooke et al., 1995;Cheatham et al., 1982;Germeroth, 1991;Wynn, 2003); (b) starting a new or demanding career role (Berry, 1993;Cheatham et al., 1982;Myers, 1999;Nerad & Miller, 1996;Wynn, 2003); (c) personal problems (Berry, 1993;Jacks et al., 1983;Myers, 1999;White, 1986); and (d) balancing the career and family demand with academic pursuits (Cheatham et al., 1982.;Germeroth, 1991;Huguley, 1988;Isaac et al., 1992;Jacks et al., 1983;Leppel, 2002;Myers, 1999;Nerad & Miller, 1996;Stallone, 2003;Wood, 1978;Wright, 1991;Wynn, 2003). The colossal task of the dissertation seemed so large to some students, that advancement to candidacy never occurred (Golde, 2005). Investigators determined structural isolation of a student reduced retention (Berry, 1993;Golde, 2005;Leppel, 2002). Researchers indicated an overall need for mentoring programs and that a strong relationship existed between cohesiveness and persistence Dorn & Papalewis, 1995King & Chepyator-Thompson, 1996). Belonging to a doctoral group/cohort was found to increase support and benefited persistence Dorn & Papalewis, 1995. Researchers determined that social support not only helped reduce stress among graduate students, but family support, peer support, and faculty support worked to increase persistence (Bauer, 2004;Emerson, 1998;King & Chepyator-Thompson, 1996;Leadabrand, 1985;Malmberg, 2000;Pauley, 1998). Research indicated students with higher institutional satisfaction and commitment to the institution were more likely to persist (Cooke et al., 1995;Leppel, 2002). The research in this section demonstrated the key concepts of persistence as postulated by Tinto's theory of doctoral attrition. The researchers in this section demonstrated that goals and commitments, orientation opportunities, layers of institutional and program experiences, nested levels of academic and social integration, and structure research/dissertation experiences served to influence doctoral student attrition/persistence as explained by Tinto."}, {"section_title": "Themes Reviewed", "text": "The socialization stream of research included in this chapter discussed the adaptation of new norms, roles, responsibilities, and expectations that doctoral students experience when pursuing graduate education. When starting a new graduate program, Kezar (2001) described how students again, just as with undergraduate work, gave up security and familiarity to allow growth and knowledge acquisition to occur. Tinto (1993) noted new graduate students experienced challenges with respect to both academic and social integration. Poock (2002) reported many graduate students experienced confusion and anxiety when entering their programs similar to feelings experienced when they were new undergraduates. Polson (2003) indicated many institutions expended a large amount of resources in the recruitment of graduate students, yet offered very little assistance to graduate students as they transitioned and persisted through the demands of graduate study. Golde (1998) explained many graduate students confronted a dual socialization process that involved both the transition into the graduate student role and the preparation for a new profession. Brown- Wright et al. (1997) noted among the major purposes of graduate education, socialization into the academic culture was integral. Komives and Taub (1998) reported institutions rarely applied the knowledge found in undergraduate socialization research and programs to the graduate student experience. The orientation stream of research included in this chapter discussed the benefits and roles that graduate student orientations play in the adaptation to a graduate student's role, department, and institution. Vlisides and Eddy (1993) agreed with other researchers when they noted graduate students appear to be a neglected segment of the student population in areas spanning from orientation to research. Polson (2003) explained student services played an important supportive role in graduate student socialization through offering orientation programs. Vlisides and Eddy concluded the role of graduate orientation programs was to welcome and allay incoming student anxiety. Poock (2002) noted departmental and general orientation programs played important roles in graduate student socialization. The graduate student support stream of research included in this chapter discussed personal, departmental, and institutional forms of support that doctoral students experience during graduate education. Ethington and Smart (1986) explained group support and peer mentoring provided an added boost on the path to doctoral degree completion. Hahs (1998) emphasized the importance of a university support structure that provides academic and personal support for graduate students. Kluever (1997) found doctoral graduates indicated receiving higher emotional support from various sources than did non-graduates. The dissertation preparation stream of research included in this chapter discussed institutional and departmental attempts at providing structure and guidance to doctoral students during the dissertation process. Cesari (1990) explained master's and doctoral students garner less student services attention. Vlisides and Eddy (1993) recommended special services be developed for graduate students and should be addressed in student or academic affairs. Cesari reported dissertation support groups effectively assisted in navigating graduate students through a confusing process. Dorn and Papalewis (1995) suggested the incorporation of support group and cohort development components in doctoral programs to improve retention and persistence. Baker (1992) concluded that graduate students expressed the need for services that helped them meet their academic and educational objectives. Polson (2003) stated, \"It was assumed because graduate students were mature, well-focused, goal oriented, and college graduates, they were capable of handling the responsibilities of graduate study without needing special services\" (p. 59). The retention/attrition stream of research included in this chapter discussed a variety of research on the possible contributions to doctoral student retention/attrition. Vlisides and Eddy (1993) explained that institutional resources were ever shrinking and recruitment and retention of graduate students has become increasingly urgent. Attrition during the first year of graduate school accounted for nearly a third of all doctoral student attrition (Bowen & Rudenstine, 1992;Golde, 1996Golde, , 1998. Polson (2003) suggested that investment in opportunities that help graduate students transition into their new roles were more likely to retain graduate students through degree completion. Dorn and Papalewis (1997) summarized that peer mentoring served as a powerful support, with increased likelihood of doctoral student persistence. Dorn and Papalewis (1995) noted group support and peer support served as a major tool in completing the doctoral degree. Poock (2002) surmised graduate student orientation programs demonstrated a positive effect in reducing attrition rate in graduate education. Gilliam and Kristsonis (2006) stated \"The most academically capable, most academically successful, most stringently evaluated, and most carefully selected students in the entire higher education system, doctoral students, are the least likely to complete their chosen academic goals\" (p. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Description of Variables", "text": "Primarily the independent variables were drawn heavily from the research and doctoral persistence model created by Tinto (1993) in a seminal book on undergraduate attrition in which he extended his attrition work into the realm of doctoral students.

Students pursuing professional degrees in medicine, law, dentistry, and pharmacy were eliminated from consideration. The students pursuing a professional degree in the areas mentioned above do not have the same degree completion requirements as doctoral students including, but not limited to, the completion of the dissertation, which serves as the capstone of doctoral study in American graduate education. The University of Kentucky is a comprehensive doctoral granting public institution with an overall enrollment of more than 26,000 students of which more than 7,000 are in pursuit of graduate degrees and more than 2,300 of the graduate students are doctoral students.

Lee (2003) adapted the survey designed by Tinto in order to study the relationship between selected variables that influenced attrition in a doctoral program at Tennessee State University. Abedi and Benkin (1987) utilized data collected through the Survey of Earned Doctorates specifically for UCLA. The researchers utilized this data to examine the degree to which a set of variables predicted a student's time to doctoral degree. The questionnaire, attached in Appendix A, contains sections on demographics, doctoral educational information, doctoral student experiences, and support received. Section A consists of questions related doctoral student background and demographic topics. Section B covers questions centered on educational experiences and characteristics and includes a subset of questions for those students that discontinued their doctoral education. This subset of questions includes anchors for a five answer Likert scale with the range of 1 = not at all important, 2 = of little importance, 3 = neutral, 4 = important, and 5 = very important. Section C covers questions concentrated on doctoral student experiences while pursuing their doctoral degree and includes subsets of questions on the following topics: (a) satisfaction, (b) social involvement, (c) clarity and understanding of degree requirements, (d) interaction with dissertation chair, and (e) satisfaction with academic involvement opportunities. The subset of questions on satisfaction, clarity and understanding of degree requirements, interaction with dissertation chair, and satisfaction with academic involvement opportunities includes anchors for a five answer Likert scale with the range of 1 = very dissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = neutral, 4 = satisfied, and 5 = very satisfied. The subset of questions on social involvement includes anchors for a five answer Likert-type scale with the range 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.

The survey items in this research were analyzed to determine if the survey items are measuring the factors being studied. Factor Analysis (FA) is a procedure that allows a researcher to reduce the number of variables. Vogt explained that, in survey research, factor analysis often serves to permit the researcher to explore the possibility of reducing or grouping longer series of questions into shorter series of questions and seeks to find patterns within the variations of several variables. Generally the most common forms of factor analysis include exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Exploratory factor analysis allows a researcher to discover the factors inherent in certain variables or measures. Exploratory factor analysis requires no prior theory and allows the investigator to model the factor structure based on the factor loadings. In confirmatory factor analysis, the researcher generally starts with a theory and utilizes the technique to test hypotheses on factors that are expected to be found (Vogt). The investigator sought to confirm that variables would load as predicted on the expected number of factors and, therefore, factor analysis was used to assess construct validity.\nIn order to assess the extent to which variables accurately measured the constructs of interest, the survey items in this research were analyzed using factor analysis based on a pilot study performed by the researcher. Costello and Osborne (2005) explained that \"Exploratory factor analysis is a widely utilized and broadly applied statistical technique in the social sciences\" (p. 1). Based on prior research by Costello and Osborne, the research used maximum likelihood as the method of extraction for the factor analysis. In order to allow for the possibility of factors to correlate, the investigator utilized oblique rotation as the rotation method.

According to Upton and Cook (2006), \"Reliability is a measure of the confidence that we can have in the results obtained [from research]\" (p. 368). The investigator subjected the instrument to a pilot study to determine how well the survey measures doctoral student experiences. The pilot study participants (N = 16) were members of the most recent cohort of doctoral students admitted into the Educational Administration program at Western Kentucky University. The researcher utilized this population due to the similarity of the intended population for the actual study. Cronbach's alpha procedures were utilized on the scaled items within the instrument in order to determine survey reliability. The pilot study participants were invited to complete the survey instrument. The researcher e-mailed the online survey link to the professor of record of the incoming cohort class and the students were requested to complete the survey on a volunteer basis.

Once the doctoral students arrived at the Web address provided on the postcard, they encountered the preamble that explained why response is important. Once the doctoral students read the preamble, they began the online survey. The survey did not collect e-mail addresses or any personally identifiable information. By sending a postcard through the postal system, the survey participants had the freedom to utilize any computer and complete the survey anonymously and at the participants' convenience. Dillman, Smyth, & Christian explained that multiple contacts were essential to maximizing survey results; therefore, based on Dillman, Smyth, & Christian's suggestions 3 weeks after the initial postcard mailing, the researcher mailed a \"Thank You\" postcard that expressed appreciation for those that already responded and encouraged survey completion for those who had yet to complete (p. 243).

The independent variables were identified through prior use in research or further suggestion from researchers within the topic of doctoral degree completion (Abedi & Benkin, 1987;Bauer, 2004;Campbell, 1992;Cheatham et. al., 1982;Coulter et al., 2004;Dorn & Papalewis, 1995;Dorn & Papalewis, 1997;Emerson, 1998;Golde, 2000;Golde & Dore, 2001;Hahs, 1998;Hatley & Fiene, 1995;Jacks et. al., 1983;King & Chepyator-Thompson, 1996;Kluever, 1997;Kluever et al., 1997;Leadabrand, 1985;Lee, 2003;Leppel, 2002;Malmberg, 2000;Meyers, 1999;Pauley, 1998;Poock, 2002;Rimmer, Lammert, & McClain, 1982;Seagram et al., 1998;Sigafus, 1998;Taub & Komives, 1998;Tinto, 1993;Wright, 1991;Wynn, 2003). The independent variables clustered around two broad categories: a) doctoral student characteristics (age, ethnicity, gender, financial support, employment, marital status, dependents, distance from campus, debt load, employment status change after comprehensive exams, and enrollment status); and b) doctoral program characteristics (graduate student orientation programs, departmental assistance, social involvement, dissertation preparation courses, dissertation preparation seminars, clarity and understanding of academic program procedures/requirements, dissertation chair contact, academic involvement, support groups, and mentoring). The dependent variable was doctoral student degree completion and it served as a single defining method of measuring doctoral student progress. The researcher used the dependent variable based on prior research utilization (Bauer, 2004;Campbell, 1992;Dorn & Papalewis, 1995;Dorn & Papalewis, 1997;Emerson, 1998;Hatley & Fiene, 1995;King & Chepyator-Thompson, 1996;Leadabrand, 1985;Lovitts, 2004;Malmberg, 2000;Pauley, 1998;Stallone, 2003;Tinto, 1993).

A factor analysis was run on the full sample using maximum likelihood extraction with oblique rotation (Costello & Osborne, 2005). Costello and Osborne (2005) explained that oblique rotation should render more accurate and more reproducible solutions. Once factors were identified, the items comprising individual factors were re-run to create the factor-score weighted scales. The instrument contained both non-Likert scaled items and Likert scaled items. Several of the questions on the survey instrument that measured various independent variables were scaled questions using multiple items. Factor analysis does not require all items to be on the same scale as it operates on the correlation matrix between items. Tabachnick and Fidell (2007) explain that as long as factor analysis is used to summarize the relationships in a large set of observed variables, assumptions about the distributions of those variables are not in force. Therefore, the researcher did nothing unique to the variables that were not Likert scaled. All variables that were categorical, were dummy coded. All of the scaled items were located in Section C of the instrument which measured the doctoral student experiences. According to Costello and Osborne (2005), \"The data and literature supports the argument that optimal results will be achieved by use of a true factor analysis extraction method of maximum likelihood, oblique rotation such as direct oblimin, and the use of scree plots for information on how many meaningful factors might be in a data set\" (p. 7). In order to decide on the number of factors, the researcher used the scree test, examining the graph of the eigenvalues on the scree plot, looking for the natural bend in the data where the curve flattens. Costello and Osborne (2005) explained that the number of data points above the break is usually the number of factors to choose.

Policies within departments are designed to provide certain experiences, opportunity, and learning desired by the department. The actual practice of carrying out the departmental policies affects the individual and group experiences that both students and faculty encounter throughout a doctoral program."}, {"section_title": "Implications to Policy", "text": "Doctoral programs should consider the implications of higher degree completion among older students and part-time enrollment status when considering composition of incoming cohorts of doctoral students and the structure of the coursework offered and the pattern of doctoral student enrollment status. When creating the course scheduling and offerings, doctoral programs could focus on course times and structures that would better appeal to older part-time enrolled students. Although most programs employ a multitude of evening coursework, the structuring of a single day that offers two courses in one evening may better appeal to students. Starting the first course in the late afternoon, followed by a small dinner break and then offering the second course in that same evening allows students to devote only one night a week to class, yet attend two courses. This block scheduling could be an attractive alternative in course scheduling. Weekend coursework and distance education coursework can also allow for varied opportunities for students to attend either only on select weekends throughout a semester or at the convenience of their home through the use of an online format. Simply working to offer these varied methods of scheduling may serve to remove impediments to efficiently completing the coursework component of the doctoral degree. With age demonstrating a strong relationship with degree completion, it would behoove doctoral programs to integrate admissions practices and services that accommodate older students. The composition of the graduate students at both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville included an average age of just over 43. The composition also included a high majority of student employed full-time and a majority of students enrolled part-time. Therefore, it is obvious that the need is not only to plan for future students of an older age, but the current student population already represents a higher range of ages and would be well served by policies and services designed for their needs. A needs assessment of the current population could serve as a direct opportunity to understand what this population may desire to best succeed. Once these needs are understood, a program could then better serve the current students and the future incoming students that will most likely be represented by an older, full-time employed, and part-time enrolled composition. Doctoral programs and incoming doctoral students should consider the implications of higher degree completion among students satisfied with their dissertation chair. Careful planning and consideration of selecting a dissertation chair in the early stages of a doctoral program could be facilitated by the program itself and could be designed to fit into the structure and the culture of the doctoral program. The better a student is informed of the interests and research of faculty the better a student can select a chair that aligns to their research interest and therefore have a stronger opportunity for higher dissertation chair satisfaction. The correlation results of positive influence of degree completion when students complete either dissertation coursework or attend dissertation seminars could be important policy opportunities for doctoral programs. The dissertation is an exercise in independent research by a student who more than likely is an inexperienced researcher at best. Once the student is admitted to candidacy and begins the research component of the degree, a high majority of the structure, previously provided through the coursework phase, disappears. Doctoral programs could provide coursework that is focused on practicing the methods of dissertation writing. The more a student is exposed to structures, examples, and opportunities to begin guided work on the dissertation, the more prepared the student will be to complete the daunting task of overcoming the ABD status and completing the doctoral degree. Seminars or programs offered through the department on dissertation writing could also serve as both motivation and a tool to better equip a student with the ability to complete the doctoral degree."}, {"section_title": "Implications to Practice", "text": "Doctoral programs should consider the implications of higher degree completion among students employed full-time while pursuing a doctoral degree. This result would seem to go against a common perception that the more a student works, the less time that student has to complete a doctoral degree and therefore leading to a higher attrition rate. For the purposes of this study, Table 4 indicates the high majority of respondents worked full-time while pursuing their doctoral studies (73.6%). While the results must be considered with caution since only a minority of the respondents were employed parttime, this may indicate a profile of a student that demonstrates a strong motivation, organization, and structure to complete a doctoral degree while remaining employed fulltime. Doctoral student completion may increase if program advisers and dissertation chairs consider cautioning against, if at all possible, an employment status change after completing comprehensive exams. Many individuals within a doctoral program endure the needed commitment of the degree plan in order to eventually create future career opportunities. The fact of this desire is not lost on the researcher. Once students complete the comprehensive exams and enter into candidacy, the road to completion becomes an unstructured path of independent research. It is at this point, where a student needs further goal commitment and focus on the research requirement. Opportunities for promotion and new career roles can also become available due to the achievement of ABD status. It is at this point where the practice and guidance of faculty, staff, and mentors can serve to remind the student that beginning a new career opportunity can severely siphon away time, focus, and commitment to completing the degree. Any new professional role will require a stronger investment in time and energy to adjust and perform to the desired level. The results of this study can be used by programs to demonstrate this negative effect on degree completion and caution against changing employment status after completing the comprehensive exams. Doctoral student completion may increase if program advisers and dissertation chairs consider recommending a part-time enrollment status. Yet conversely, doctoral programs should not shy away from those students employed full-time that desire to pursue a terminal degree. Tinto (1993) explained, \"Individuals whose educational and career goals are such as to require the completion of a doctorate are more likely to finish than other persons whose goals are not so linked\" (p. 239). This result of full-time employment status indicating higher degree completion is an implication that should be considered by doctoral students contemplating the start of a doctoral degree and doctoral programs when considering composition incoming cohorts of doctoral students and the structure of the coursework offered to accommodate doctoral student employment status. The indication that doctoral student completion may decrease if respondents indicated higher satisfaction with academic involvement is a peculiar finding. This may be interpreted that possibly the student's focus and attention on the dissertation may be getting distracted due to other research interests within the department. It also may explain that over involvement, over commitment of non-required activities and research can sideline completion. Those students that take on too many volunteer research projects, attend a myriad of conferences, and simply take on too many things not connected to completing the coursework and dissertation, are inviting opportunities and excuses to reduce their focus on completing the doctoral degree. Tinto's theory on doctoral attrition seems to focus on the building of communities both socially and academically. The faculty, staff, and mentor community the student builds could serve as a cautionary force in the area and help reign the student's extracurricular activities in to a manageable amount."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study gathered data for only two institutions within the state if Kentucky and only included a specific time period of enrollment between the years of 1997-2003.

Future research could replicate this study using a different scope of population and even different states within the U.S. to determine if outcomes might be similar. Future research may include a measurement of how individual student academic attributes (GRE, GPA) that occur prior to the start of the program, affect the variable of doctoral degree completion. Based on the low response rate of this study, future studies may include provisions and resources to allow for more and varied methods for follow-up and reminder to the survey population in order to positively increase response rate. Along similar lines with response rate, future research may utilize institutional Alumni Associations in order to more precisely collect accurate data and follow up with participants. Cooperation with institutional Alumni Associations can help to clean up initial address information provided from the initial student enrollment at the university, based on the most recent address and activity the student may have engaged in with Alumni events and giving history. Within this study, there was no analysis at the academic discipline level. Future studies could add research questions and analysis to determine the effect certain types of academic disciplines have on doctoral degree completion. The current study included only a 6-year window of doctoral enrollment from 1997-2003 in order to highlight the Higher Education reform occurring in the state of Kentucky. Expanding this study to include multiple decades of enrolled doctoral students may yield different and possibly more robust results on the effect of individual student characteristics and program characteristics on doctoral degree completion. Also connected to higher education reform in the state of Kentucky, this study focused on only the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. More recent developments in the landscape of higher education in Kentucky have created the atmosphere in which other universities have developed doctoral programs. Therefore, further research could replicate this study at these institutions with newly developed doctoral programs. Based on a stream of research called survival analysis, a fruitful stream of future research could attempt to ascertain when and how long it took for doctoral students to pass through certain components of a doctoral degree (residency, completion of coursework, passing of comprehensive exams, admission into candidacy, and finally dissertation defense/doctoral degree completion). This research could assist in developing a way to assess stop out data of students at various points within the program and allow departments to actually collect this data to inform practice & policy. In order to try and understand student and faculty perceptions, future research may include a student ranking of the common reasons for attrition along with a faculty ranking of the common reasons for attrition and then a correlation of the two rankings. An important concern within doctoral programs that does not seem to be measured in research, but could have a strong impact on students would be for future research to include a variable that measures the impact on students when faculty leave the program. Faculty leaving could affect many components of a student's progress and satisfaction and would be an interesting variable to better understand. Results from this research study indicated a possible positive relationship exists between students employed full-time and successful completion of the doctoral degree. Future research could focus in on the variable of employment status in order to determine the effects and issues surrounding employment status and degree completion. Finally, some of the intricacies of individual motivations, barriers, relationships, and overall personal stories are not found within the statistical nature of quantitative research. Therefore, future research with this population, using a qualitative nature of inquiry, could discover the detail and insight on the personal nature of attrition /persistence.
