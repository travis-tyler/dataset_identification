Table S1 also provides details of aa and nucleotide variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence with that of SARS-CoV. Mutational analysis results for the SARS-CoV-2 sequences downloaded from GISAID are stored as an excel file which consists of information of entropy scores (between 0-1) for the 28 SARS-CoV-2 genes, with genomic location of the mutations, in Table S2 (Sheet1 named as Entropy). The mutation event counts from different countries with corresponding SARS-CoV-2 genes are present in Table S2 (Sheet2 named as events).\nThe list of miRNAs targeting SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 reference genomes is available as an excel file named Table S3 . The file lists the predicted targets with corresponding miRanda score, binding energy, miRNA start and end site, target start and end site, alignment length, similarity, and identity percentage. These miRNAs were compared with a list of experimentally proven anti-viral miRNAs (against any known virus) from the literature. We found 42 such miRNAs, the details of these miRNAs with miRBase accession ID, miRNA sequence, viral target with their UniProt ID and PubMed accession number (PMID) is available in the Table S3 , sheet3 (named as 42_miRNA).\nThe gene expression datasets representing virus-infected human cell lines were retrieved from the GEO database. We downloaded the NCBI GEO SARS-CoV microarray dataset (GEO ID GSE17400) and SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing dataset (GEO ID GSE147507) (Table S4) , analysis sample collected at 24 hr in both the datasets. The SARS-COV-2 data, generated from A459 and NHBE cell lines, showed 131 and 606 differentially expressed genes respectively.

Complete, high coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database were subjected to mutational analysis using Genome Detective Coronavirus subtyping Tool (version 1.1.3) [2] . To remove redundancy, the genome nucleotide sequences that share 99.99% similarity with the reference genome (NC_004718.3) were excluded from further analysis. We downloaded the sequences of all the available 2654 mature human miRNAs from the miRBase (Release 22.1) [3] . Additionally, we also surveyed the literature to identify experimentally validated antiviral miRNAs, including artificial miRNAs. Comparing our predictions for the three viruses and the list of antiviral miRNAs (against any known virus) from the literature survey, we found 42 miRNAs to be common. Twelve out of these are artificial miRNAs, however these also target the three viral genomes studied by us. These miRNAs were used to identify potential miRNA target sites in the virus genome sequences, using miRanda (3.3 a version) [4] , with an energy threshold of -20 kcal/mol, a threshold used in other studies too [5] .\nSARS-CoV (NC_004718.3), MERS (NC_019843.3), and SARS-CoV-2 isolate from Wuhan (NC_045512.2) were used as target viral genomes.
