The aim of this study was to create a new computational epidemiological model for Pakistan by implementing symptomatology, healthcare capacity and behavioral risk reduction mathematically to predict of Covid-19 case trends and effects of changes in community characteristics and policy measures.

The transition equation for this population's conversion into Exposed-Latent population is given as:\n\u2202S/\u2202t = (fs.br.rcd).(PI(\u03b2) + MS(\u03b2)(1\u2212ief) + SS(r\u03b2)(1\u2212ief)) In this equation, fs represents Fraction susceptible, br is behavioral risk factor while rcd represents relative contact density ( Table 1) . Each of these parameters are additional controlling levers which can either increase or decrease the rate of conversion into Exposed-Latent population. A decrease in fs reflects less susceptibility to infection, low br reflects better hygienic and social isolation behaviour while a low rcd reflects sparse population density when number of susceptibles decreases, thus naturally low contact between the remaining susceptibles as they are far apart. Decrease in any or all of these parameters can slow down the rate of conversion into the next compartment. The second part of the equation represents the ability of PI, MS and SS to infect a susceptible person with the probabilities of \u03b2, (\u03b2)(1\u2212ief) and (r\u03b2)(1\u2212ief) ( Table 1) respectively. \u03b2 reflects the probability of getting infected from a PI population, r\u03b2 represents the relative change in probability of getting infected if the infection is coming from a severe case to a susceptible, while (1\u2212ief) is a measure of isolation effectiveness (Table 1) .

We derive \u03bc from a safe quarantine period for diagnosed cases equal to 10 days (15). We assumed 1/\u03bc to last on average for 7 days from symptoms development to recovery. The sum of1/ \u03bc and previously estimated lpi (presymptomatic infectious period) results in 11.5 days which represents the total duration from becoming infectious till recovery after a person acquires the disease. Using \u03bc and (1/lpi), we can now calculate \u03b2 which comes equal to 0.383. We also selected r\u03b2 to be 0.5 following the assumption for this parameter used in the 2009 influenza outbreak (16) .

For rate of mortality in mild cases (pDM), We chose a value on the lower spectrum of 0.01, based on the results obtained from early Wuhan studies (20) .

In one study, the mortality rate in ICU patients was reported as high as 0.67 (6) . In order to calculate the combined rate of mortality in severe cases (CMR) ( Table 1) , we used two types of mortality estimates: 1.

In the third experiment, we fully implement the smart lock downs as well and observe the similarity between actual case number and our predicted ones. In the fourth experiment, we test two assumptions; 1. What if the smart lockdown measures end? 2. What if some form of smart lockdown measures persist. Finally, In the fifth experiment, assuming that covid-19 returns, we observe the effect of varying hospital, public health capacity and possible vaccination and its impact. Before reviewing the following experiments, it's important to note that the simulation time starts 36 days before the first 2 cases were officially reported in Pakistan (Table 4 ), thus any of the day references mentioned below are from the simulation timescale. In this experiment, we run the simple base model consisting of SEIDRD compartments as explained in the methodology section. This run was under the assumption that none of the lockdown measures have been imposed and the cases are spreading at a natural rate. This model also incorporates the seasonality adjustment ( Table 2) . As per this model, the cases start rising around day 70 to 75 simulation time. The cases peak at around day 125 with a maximum of around 200000 cases being reported each day. The numbers then start to decline but very slowly.\nAs this model assumes no behavioral risk reduction measures, this would have been the worse case scenario were it not for the timely lock downs. The second experiment assumes the implementation of the 1st set of lockdown measures. It mimics the timings on which the first lockdown was started around day 60 and stopped after 52 days simulation time. This model represents the scenario when only a single down is put in place only to lift it later as happened in Pakistan from March 24 to May 9, 2020 (Table 4) .\nThis model mimics the initial rise of cases in Pakistan closely peaking at around 100000 cases on day 150 and then plateauing subsequently for some time. This model shows a better case then the base model but it predicts a subsequent rise from day 175 if no further lockdown measures are put in place. Figure 6 .

Since in our model, we assume the population to exist in a single geographic area homogeneously, the concept of smart lockdowns is implemented as the one before. It is evident that the cases follow a similar curve until day 175 but then after a brief plateau, they start to decrease as happened in Pakistan (Table 4 ).\nSince this model assumes the second set of lockdown measures to start around day 162 and persist up to 38 days, the cases start to rise again around day 220 after reaching the lowest case report number of 2829 per day. As per this model, if the smart lockdowns are completely lifted, the cases will rise again and eventually reach a maximum of 200000 cases per day around day 250 simulation time ( September 27, 2020).

It tests several experimental scenarios with or without conventional or smart lockdowns, with improvement in bed capacity and with vaccination. It was shown based on the SEIDRD model that after the end of smart lockdowns in Pakistan, the Covid-19 active cases in Pakistan are expected show a rise at the start of September 2020 and if no risk reduction measures are taken, they are expected to achieve a second peak around 27th September 2020. We also observed that increasing the ITU bed capacity to a 10 time current value will not have a significant impact on the number of active cases or mortalities per day. Finally, a vaccination schedule of 100000 vaccines per day started after the second peak of Covid-19 will cause a drop in active cases and mortality per day but the effect will be observed over a period of few years without any risk reduction measures. Based on above findings, we recommend to put in place minimum risk reduction measures (smart lockdowns in high risk areas) at least until the availability of any form of vaccination."}]
