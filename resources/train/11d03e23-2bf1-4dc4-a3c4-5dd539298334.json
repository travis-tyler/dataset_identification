[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Limited access to nutritious foods threatens the development and growth of children throughout the world. Despite the eradication of widespread hunger and malnutrition in the established market economies of Europe and North America, a healthful diet remains the most expensive alternative for families (Maillot et al. 2007 ). Imbalances in the nutrient composition of children's diets can have long-run consequences because regularly consuming foods high in essential vitamins and minerals is imperative for avoiding deteriorations in the body's ability to resist infections; and a concurrent combination of infection and undernourishment often results in unfavorable development and growth outcomes for children (Scrimshaw and SanGiovanni 1997) . The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is the widest reaching policy response to this threat in the United States, with more than 30 million students taking advantage of its benefits every school day. 1 A central objective of the program is to relax household resource constraints by providing access to free or low-cost domestic agricultural products for children during school. The meanstested component of the NSLP targets students from households with low income relative to national standards, and it now accounts for over half of the total number of program participants and subsidized school lunches. Eligible students pay 40 cents or less, or nothing for school lunches if they come from a household with income below 185% or 135% of the Federal poverty guidelines, respectively (U.S. Congress 2004a). 2 There has been considerable debate over the program's effectiveness in providing balanced nourishment to children in light of the increasing national trend in obesity prevalence. 3 However, little work has been carried out to investigate the intermediary mechanisms through which program participation impacts children's body sizes. In the most recent study, Gordon et al. (2007b) find that program participants have higher average intakes for micronutrients, such as calcium and vitamins A and B, relative to nonparticipants in the previous 24 hours; and differences in average macronutrient intakes were mixed with increases in protein and decreases in carbohydrates. Similarly, Gleason and Suitor (2003) find that program participants have higher average intakes for several vitamins and minerals and dietary fat and lower average intakes for added sugars. An important limitation of earlier studies was the omission of any precise, comprehensive measure of children's body sizes in the empirical models. To the extent that differences in body sizes partly explain individual dietary patterns, conclusions based on earlier findings may be incomplete. Furthermore, no analytical distinction has been made for those participants receiving means-tested subsidies, and this is arguably the most vulnerable population targeted by the program. Given the vast reach of the NSLP and its strong potential to improve individual development and growth outcomes, we examine how the dietary patterns of children from low-income households are impacted by the school lunch subsidies.\nA healthful diet according to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines comprises five main food groups: grain, vegetable, fruit, milk, and meat and beans. 4 In this study, we investigate how the NSLP meanstested subsidies affect children's consumption of items included in the vegetable, fruit, and milk 2. Congress established uniform national guidelines and criteria in the determination of eligibility beginning fiscal year 1971.\n3. In fact, all food and nutrition programs have come under scrutiny. See Currie (2003) for an overview. For more recent analyses of the effects of NSLP participation on obesity, see Schanzenbach (2009) and Millimet, Tchernis, and Husain (2010) .\n4. See http://www.mypyramid.gov/index.html food groups. Although we are unable to fully explore the effects of the subsidies on items in every recommended food group, the items we do analyze are important dietary sources of calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C that support favorable development and growth outcomes (Scrimshaw 1991; Scrimshaw and SanGiovanni 1997) . For instance, not having enough iron in the body, even a moderate deficiency, is linked with decreased cognitive performance among school-age children (Halterman et al. 2001) . Consumption of vitamin C helps prevent iron deficiencies by enhancing its absorption from different types of meals (Hallberg, Brune, and Rossander-Hulthen 1987) , but it also plays a vital role in the optimal functioning of the body's immune system (Wintergerst, Maggini, and Hornig 2006) . From a public policy standpoint, it is imperative to identify whether school lunch subsidies increase children's dietary intake of items known to provide vitamins and minerals that are fundamentally related to development and growth outcomes. Moreover, it is important to understand whether intra-household reallocation occurs in response to the subsidies and, if so, whether the responses offset any increases in children's consumption from subsidized school lunches. Although analyzing 24-hour recall data is informative, our outcomes measure consumption for a period of 1 week and can help provide deeper insights into household responses over a longer time horizon than has previously been studied in this context. In particular, we analyze data on 5,140 public school children in fifth grade, aged 10-13 years, observed during spring 2004 from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K). 5 The extensive information collected in this study enables us to include several variables in our empirical models that are likely to influence dietary patterns, such as children's body sizes and physical activity patterns, and further include detailed control measures from zone improvement plan (zip) code-level and school-level surveys. To address the nonrandom assignment of NSLP means-tested subsidies, we match information on the schools and school districts in which children are enrolled and formulate an instrumental variables estimation strategy based on variation in the demand 5. The NSLP funds school lunches in every public school that children attend in our sample. The consumption survey module was not introduced until the sixth round of the ECLS-K, which prevents us from taking advantage of any time variation while children are in elementary school.\nfor school meals. Overall, the results suggest that NSLP means-tested subsidies significantly increase the number of servings of fruit, green salad, carrots, other vegetables, and 100% fruit juice consumed by children and provide the strongest empirical evidence to date that the subsidies increase children's consumption over a time period longer than one school day.\nThis article proceeds as follows. We discuss a conceptual framework for our analysis based on the extant literature in Section II. Our empirical framework and estimation strategy are described in Section III, and the data sources utilized in the analysis are outlined in Section IV. We present the results in Section V, and conclude with Section VI."}, {"section_title": "II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "Economic theory suggests that in-kind commodity transfers can change dietary patterns depending on individual preferences. In the context of welfare assistance targeted toward children, the model developed by Becker (1974) indicates that transfers may stimulate a reallocation of resources within households; however, the extent of any response is contingent on the preferences of the \"head\" or decision maker of the family, household-specific resource constraints, and the time horizon. On the one hand, if the means-tested subsidies received through a child's participation in the NSLP result in a reallocation of household food spending away from children by the full cash value of the subsidies then we would expect no change in observed dietary patterns because of the school lunches. For instance, Jacoby (2002) finds no intra-household reallocation of the total calories consumed by children in response to participation in a school feeding program. On the other hand, there is the possibility that previous levels of household food spending are only partially displaced or are not displaced at all in response to the subsidies. For instance, Long (1991) finds households that reduce spending on food by 61 cents for each additional dollar value of NSLP school lunches.\nThe empirical evidence to date suggests there is scope for the means-tested component of the NSLP to change the composition of food and beverages consumed by children from lowincome households on a weekly basis or an even longer time horizon. For instance, Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2007) recently find that the marginal propensity to consume food is slightly larger for in-kind transfers as opposed to cash transfers. Although it is difficult to determine whether the response is because of the constraints imposed by the design of inkind welfare programs or the preferences of the household decision maker, the evidence to date suggests a marginal propensity to spend on food in the range of $0.17 to $0.47 and substantially less than 1 (Currie 2003) . 6 To gain perspective on the economic impact of the subsidies on household budgets, for the time period of our analysis, the maximum reimbursement rate paid to schools located in the contiguous United States through the NSLP is $2.36 per meal (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2003) and amounts to an approximate transfer of $50 per month for each child to a household with income below 135% of the Federal poverty guidelines. If this transfer is viewed by the head of the family as equivalent to a direct cash transfer then total household spending on food would increase by a minimum of about $9 per month. It remains an empirical question as to whether the households reallocate food resources to other family members in response to the school lunch subsidies or whether the children experience net increases in consumption."}, {"section_title": "III. EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK AND ESTIMATION STRATEGY", "text": "To examine the relationships between the NSLP means-tested subsidies and the number of servings of food and beverages consumed in a week, we proceed with the following model for the ith child living in a household with zip code j and attending school k in school district l:\n6. The matter is further complicated by the fact that certain households are simultaneously receiving assistance from more than one program. In our full sample, for example, about 11% of households received food stamps in the previous 12 months and 94% of these households had children participating in the NSLP. Similarly, about 4% of households received aid through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program in the previous 12 months and 92% of these households had children participating in the NSLP. Simultaneous participation in multiple welfare programs is another reason for why treating children's NSLP program take-up as exogenous can lead to estimation bias. We explicitly account for the endogeneity of children's NSLP beneficiary status in our preferred model.\nwhere NSLP means-tested subsidy is an indicator variable for the child having to pay 40 cents or less for a school lunch; and in an expanded model, we contrast those children receiving a free lunch, full subsidy, from those paying a nominal cost for a school lunch, partial subsidy 7 :\nServings ijkl = \u03b2 0 + \u03b2 1 (full subsidy) ij kl + \u03b2 2 (partial subsidy) ij kl (2) + \u03b2 3 ln(BMI) ij kl + X ij kl 1\nThe control variable ln(BMI) is the natural logarithm of a child's body mass index (BMI) and is constructed as the ratio of weight to squared height. The BMI measure is typically compared against national standards, conditional on age and gender, to gain perspective on the physiological development of children (Cole 1991) . We include this measure of body size to control for children's overall nourishment and, more importantly, for the unobserved serving sizes corresponding to children's reported weekly rates of consumption. To a limited extent, BMI also controls for differences in children's appetites and metabolisms that affect dietary patterns."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "X is a vector of potentially confounding variables measuring children's ages, gender, and disability status. We further include the natural logarithm of the highest parental years of schooling because of its complex relationship with children's health status and height (Thomas, Strauss, and Henriques 1991) and its potential to affect food choices, serving sizes, and preparation methods of parents. The natural logarithm of annual household income, the number of siblings, and the total household size are included to control for resource constraints 7. The extent of the household income effect for fully subsidized beneficiaries depends primarily on school attendance and for partially subsidized beneficiaries it depends on attendance, as well as whether their household is able to afford the remaining cost of school lunch. Sample means of the number of days a child were absent during the school year for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries are close at 6.6 and 5.7, respectively, but statistically different from one another (p < .001); data on school absence were only available for approximately 90% of the children in the analytic sample. Differences in absenteeism do not appear to explain our findings.\n8.

For instance, large supermarkets typically charge lower prices and have a wider variety of food items relative to convenience stores and restaurants. Moreover, the evidence suggests that low-income households tend not to concentrate in suburban areas where food costs are generally lower (Kaufman et al. 1997; MacDonald and Nelson 1991) . The additional variables we include in our model to control for differences across children in their access to food sources near home are per capita levels of supermarkets, convenience stores, full-service restaurants, and limited-service restaurants within the zip code area of households."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "Finally, S is a vector of potentially confounding school-level characteristics. We include a set of mutually exclusive indicator variables for Title I program eligibility and school-wide Title I program eligibility to control for general differences across schools in the proportion of students from low-income households.\n12 To control for the overall quality of each school we include the average student-teacher ratio (Card and Krueger 1992; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain 2005) and the total student enrollment (Kuziemko 2006) .

Estimation Strategy and Statistical Methods", "text": "Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of the models in Equations (1) and (2) are likely to be biased if the decision to participate in a public welfare program is related to other unobservable determinants of individual behavior. For instance, variation in appetites among children may result in those with lower energy requirements enrolling into the NSLP with lower frequency even if their households meet the eligibility criteria. Moreover, even if all eligible children enroll in the NSLP, children with lower energy requirements would be less likely to consume school lunches, on average; and this would work to bias the estimated effects of the means-tested subsidies on children's weekly rates of consumption toward zero. In general, energy requirements are highly correlated with an individual's physical activity, body size, and metabolism. 13 To account for omitted and difficult-to-measure factors influencing children's dietary patterns, we include a reliable measure of body size (BMI) in our model to control for general differences in children's appetites and metabolisms. However, the frequency of consumption and the types of foods consumed can affect children's metabolisms which, in turn, can influence their body sizes. 14 Strictly relying on the inclusion of all potential variables affecting children's dietary patterns, body sizes, and NSLP participation decisions is a tenuous solution because appetites and metabolisms are the product of many environmental factors."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "To minimize the estimation bias resulting from the nonrandom assignment of NSLP 13. Bhargava, Jolliffe, and Howard (2008) find a greater frequency of physical exercise per week is negatively associated with children's body weights and BMIs. See Prentice et al. (1989) for a discussion of the complex interrelationships between energy intake, energy expenditure, and body size.\n14. An individual's metabolism, or basal metabolic rate, is the minimum daily amount of energy required to sustain life. See Johnstone et al. (2005) for recent evidence on factors, such as fat-free body mass, which explain variation in these rates across individuals.\n15. Escobar (1999) and Birch and Fisher (1998) provide a nice qualitative overview of the developmental and environmental factors affecting food preferences and patterns of food consumption from early ages onward.\nmeans-tested subsidies and the endogenous relationship between body sizes and dietary patterns, we formulate an instrumental variables estimation strategy based on variation in the demand for school meals across the schools and school districts in which children are enrolled. Conditional on a child's energy requirements, the decision to participate in the NSLP may depend on prevailing social norms within a school or school district. For instance, Moffitt (1983) discusses the general phenomenon of individuals who meet eligibility criteria, but prefer to avoid a benefit entitlement because of a perceived social stigma associated with welfare program participation. In the context of the NSLP, a higher proportion of classmates consuming subsidized school meals on a daily basis would reduce any stigma associated with enrollment in the program and indicate a greater desirability of meals offered within a district. For example, 34% of children in our sample attend schools that report offering a la carte food items, and an increase in the variety of meal options is likely to stimulate overall student demand. In general, districts are granted considerable leeway in designing school meal menus and these menus exhibit wide variation in terms of nutrition and variety (Gordon et al. 2007a; Poppendieck 2010) ; however, the heterogeneity in menus also implies greater variation in the macro-and micronutrient balance of school meals (Gleason and Suitor 2003; Gordon et al. 2007b ). In the United States, prevailing inverse relationships between energy cost and energy density of available foods provide a strong economic incentive for the substitution of low-cost, energy dense meal options for healthier, more expensive alternatives. Moreover, low-income households are more likely to face financial constraints that ultimately exacerbate any imbalances in children's macro-and micronutrient intakes by increasing body sizes and, in turn, minimum daily energy requirements (Darmon, Ferguson, and Briend 2002; Darmon 2005a, 2005b) .\nWe utilize the following instrumental variables for children's NSLP participation decisions and body sizes. First, we use the number of students in the school who participated in the means-tested component of NSLP in the previous school year and disaggregate the students into those receiving full and partial subsidies, respectively. Holding school enrollment constant, a higher proportion of students receiving subsidies would work to reduce any stigma associated with program participation. However, holding participation stigma constant within a school, the appeal of school meals would also affect the decision to participate. To measure variation in demand for school meals we use total school district revenues from all school meals sales and disaggregate the revenues into the mutually exclusive funding categories of federal, state, and local sources. The revenues from each source are then expressed in per student levels to normalize by school district size. 16 Although the number of children in our analytic sample from each school district is very small relative to a district's total size, we take spending levels from the previous school year before the children are observed to avoid the possibility of simultaneity bias in our estimates.\nThe variable federal measures the revenues allocated by the federal government for Child Nutrition Act (CNA) programs such as the NSLP, School Breakfast Program, Special Milk Program, and A La Carte Program, and the variable state measures the revenues allocated by the state government for CNA program matching payments. 17 In contrast, the variable local measures the gross school meal sales revenues for each district, minus the revenues from state or federal sources. Holding constant a school district's total school meal sales revenues (local ), higher federal and state revenues per student imply a higher number of CNA program participants consuming subsidized school meals, as well as lower stigma associated with program participation. Similarly, holding constant all CNA program revenues (federal and state), higher local revenues per student imply a higher aggregate demand for school meals in a district. The higher aggregate demand is for school meals, the greater the likelihood that children's body sizes will reflect the macroand micronutrient composition of school meal items available within a district. Because we do not directly observe what the children consume at school during a typical week and the consumption outcomes we analyze are general categories of food and beverages, our estimation strategy controls for any substantive differences in the nutritional composition of school 16. Data on school-level revenues from meal sales are unavailable.\n17.

Columns (1)-(4) report the OLS estimates, whereas columns (5)-(8) report the GMM estimates under the assumption that children's BMIs and decisions to participate in the means-tested component of the NSLP are endogenous. The main findings are, first, OLS estimates indicate significant positive associations between NSLP means-tested subsidies and children's consumption of fruit, carrots, other vegetables, and 100% fruit juice by a magnitude in the range of 0.5-1.2 servings per week; however, the association is strongest among the population of children receiving full school lunch subsidies. In contrast, neither full nor partial school lunch subsidies are significantly related to children's consumption of green salad, potatoes, cow's milk, and sweetened beverages in models that assume the random assignment of NSLP participation decisions and exogeneity of children's body sizes.\nSecond, we applied the instrumental variables estimation strategy outlined in Section III(A) to draw stronger conclusions regarding the causal effects of the subsidies on children's dietary patterns. GMM estimates indicate significant increases in the number of servings of fruit, green salad, carrots, other vegetables, and 100% fruit juice consumed in a week for subsidized children relative to unsubsidized children. The local average treatment effect for children receiving full and partial subsidies is an additional 10.8 servings of fruit per week, 3.1 servings of green salad per week, 5.6 servings of carrots per week, 5.2 servings of other vegetables per week, and 10.2 servings of 100% fruit juice per week. Although the cost of school lunches for children receiving partial subsidies is nominal at 40 cents or less, GMM estimates of the model in Equation (2) suggest the cost constraint is binding. For instance, children receiving full school lunch subsidies have significant increases in fruit consumption per week, whereas partial school lunch subsidies are not significantly associated with changes in fruit consumption (Table 1, column 7); and a similar pattern is evident for children's consumption of other vegetables (Table 5 , column 7)."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 1", "text": "Estimates Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 2", "text": "Estimates of the Effect of NSLP Means-Tested Subsidies on Children's Weekly Consumption of Green Salad a,b Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "Servings of Green Salad Consumed in Previous Week", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "OLS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GMM", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TABLE 3", "text": "Estimates of the Effect of NSLP Means-Tested Subsidies on Children's Weekly Consumption of Carrots a,b Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "Servings of Carrots Consumed in Previous", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TABLE 4", "text": "Estimates of the Effect of NSLP Means-Tested Subsidies on Children's Weekly Consumption of Potatoes a,b Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "Servings of Potatoes Consumed in Previous", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TABLE 5", "text": "Estimates Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 6", "text": "Estimates Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 7", "text": "Estimates Table A2 . * Significant at 10% level; * * significant at 5% level."}, {"section_title": "TABLE 8", "text": "Estimates Third, the GMM estimates of the model in Equation (2) also indicate children's body sizes predict dietary patterns over the course a week. In particular, children with higher BMIs consume fewer servings of fruit and carrots per week and more servings of potatoes and sweetened beverages per week. This finding is consistent with larger body sizes having higher energy requirements and, hence, requiring greater macronutrient intakes, on average. Fourth, higher annual household incomes are positively associated with children's consumption of fruit, green salad, carrots, and 100% fruit juice. Although carrots are generally an inexpensive source of nourishment, the other items are more expensive sources of the micronutrients that form the basis of a healthful, nutrient-dense diet. 24 Moreover, the associations we find between household incomes and children's dietary patterns are conditional on several detailed controls for variation in the availability of food sources close to a child's home, and underscore the importance of accounting for the effects of budgetary constraints in the context of household dietary choices."}, {"section_title": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this study, we evaluate the effect of the NSLP means-tested subsidies on the number of servings of fruit, green salad, carrots, potatoes, other vegetables, cow's milk, 100% fruit juice, and sweetened beverages consumed by fifth grade public school children aged 10-13 years over the course of 1 week. The empirical methodology we develop here produces results that suggest treating the assignment of the school lunch subsidies as random or ignoring the endogenous relationship between children's body sizes and dietary patterns leads to incorrect conclusions regarding the effectiveness of this large-scale program, or understated conclusions at best. Overall, the findings indicate this policy component of the NSLP has a significant impact on children's dietary patterns and contributes toward meeting USDA recommendations of consumption of items in the vegetable and fruit food groups of a healthful diet.\nThis article provides the first empirical analysis of the changes in children's dietary patterns that result from the subsidies over a period longer than one school day. Understanding the extent to which increases in children's consumption persist at a weekly interval of time is an important step in evaluating the effectiveness of the NSLP in meeting its policy objective of preventing the undernourishment of children from low-income households. We find that children receiving full and partial subsidies consume an additional 10.8 servings of fruit per week, 3.1 servings of green salad per week, 5.6 servings of carrots per week, 5.2 servings of other vegetables per week, and 10.2 servings of 100% fruit juice per week. Regularly consuming foods high in essential vitamins and minerals is an important ingredient in the prevention of unfavorable development and growth outcomes for children. In this regard, the NSLP means-tested subsidies are positively affecting children's diets. However, we caution against drawing stronger conclusions on the overall effect of the program on children's nourishment because the dietary survey data analyzed here are somewhat limited in scope. The outcomes do not cover items included in the grain or meat and beans category of a healthful diet, and we are unable to map the reported number of servings of food and beverages into more precise macro-and micronutrient intake levels. More extensive data on the dietary patterns of children and their household members would afford deeper insight into the extent to which low-income households reallocate food resources to other members in response to the benefits of food and nutrition programs.\nIn conclusion, the estimated effects of the program on fruit and other vegetable consumption are stronger among children receiving full school lunch subsidies, as opposed to partial school lunch subsidies. Although the cost of school lunches for children receiving partial subsidies is nominal at 40 cents or less, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the cost is a binding constraint for certain children on the margin of eligibility. Additional research into the extent to which the nominal cost of school meals is a barrier to access for children from low-income households would likely prove informative for policy makers considering the future direction and overall effectiveness of the NSLP and other entitlement programs concerned with preventing undernourishment among children. a For our analysis of milk consumption, we restrict the analytic sample to 3,930 children reporting the milk consumed in the previous week was cow's milk because this is the particular type of milk provided by the NSLP.
