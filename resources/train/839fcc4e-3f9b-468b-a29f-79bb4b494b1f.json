The long presymptomatic stage of AD provides a valuable window for early intervention with disease-modifying therapy if the mechanisms of AD can be detected using reliable biomarkers. Among neuroimaging biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe, noninvasive, and nonradiating technique suitable for preclinical screening and monitoring disease progression in AD. Volumetric measurements using T1-weighted MRI are used extensively to detect AD and other dementia-associated brain atrophy, which could include a combination of microscopic degenerative processes, such as neuronal death, myelin degeneration, and loss of neurites or axons [3] [4] [5] . Such microscopic alterations may be assessed by diffusion MRI (dMRI), an imaging method for probing human brain microstructures.\nDiffusion MRI provides imaging metrics of the cellular organization by measuring water diffusion properties under the influence or restriction of biological barriers. Cellular microarchitectures create restricted environments that shape the diffusion probability function of water molecules. Therefore, the shape, size, and properties of the diffusion function estimated by dMRI allow for quantitative assessment of ADassociated microscopic degeneration. For example, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) produces two summary metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and two orthogonal metrics, axial diffusivity (Da) and radial diffusivity (Dr). FA, the variance of Da and Dr, indicates how elongated the diffusion is and reflects the coherence of underlying tissue or the fiber organization. MD, the mean diffusion in three directions, describes the general freedom of diffusion in the tissue regardless of the directionality. FA and MD have been the main focus in DTI studies of AD, whereas Da and Dr, associated with axonal and myelin integrity in animal studies [6] , may help to interpret potential neurobiological mechanisms [7] .\nDTI is sensitive to white matter degeneration in the early stages of AD, including in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a potential preclinical stage of AD [8] [9] [10] [11] , and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Diffusion metrics in SCD have been shown to be intermediate between cognitively normal (CN) older adults and individuals with MCI [8, 9, 11] . Across the disease continuum, the direction of changes in DTI metrics are as follows: (1) decreased FA, indicating loss of tissue organization and/or (2) increased mean and radial diffusivities, suggesting a breakdown of neurobiological barriers (myelin degeneration or cell membrane deterioration) or cytotoxic edema [8, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .\nIn addition to classic DTI approaches, a recent advance in dMRI is the ability to assess axonal density and cellularity among other microstructural features [18] [19] [20] [21] . Diffusion microstructural features are obtained through nonparametric q-space analyses and parametric compartment modeling. The q-space analyses provide a metric for tissue restriction (P 0 ) associated with myelination in animal studies of dysmyelination [22, 23] and in human studies of multiple sclerosis [24] and aging [25] . Parametric diffusion modeling further decodes the diffusion signal into multiple compartments (e.g., extracellular and intracellular) and provides neurobiological metrics. Since 1997, many diffusion models have been proposed and applied to animal [26, 27] and human studies [18] [19] [20] . One of the diffusion compartment models, called neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), proposed that white matter tissue comprises three diffusion compartments detectable by using modern clinical MRI scanners with a reasonable scan time [20] . The NODDI approach provides the intra-axonal volume fraction (ICVF) as a proxy for axonal density and an orientation dispersion index that describes the axonal organization. While DTI provides a general assessment of averaged microstructures within an imaging voxel, NODDI provides diffusion metrics with a finer granularity that further decipher intracellular and extracellular microscopic properties. We believe that the NODDI-derived axonal density may provide explanation and details on potential disease mechanisms of why and how changes in the AD white matter were observed by DTI.\nThe NODDI approach has been validated with histologic evidence reported in the literature. The NODDI-derived axonal density (ICVF) is almost identical to values obtained from electron microscopy of ex vivo mouse brain and in good agreement with previously reported fiber densities of the human brain obtained by electron microscopy [28] . In addition, ICVF correlates with an animal model of tau pathology in AD [29] . In vivo applications suggest that NODDI can detect white matter changes in the aging brain [25, [30] [31] [32] [33] , and associations of NODDI-derived metrics with focal cognitive deficits and the APOE\u03b54 status in young-onset AD have been demonstrated [34] .\nHere, we used complementary diffusion metrics (i.e., DTI, NODDI, and q-space) to study white matter alterations in early-stage AD. We focused on individuals with objective cognitive impairment (MCI) and individuals with only SCD assessed via the Cognitive Change Index (CCI), a comprehensive measure of perceived neuropsychological function focusing on the memory, executive, and language domains [35, 36] . To investigate AD-related anatomical variations, we performed tract-specific analyses focusing on 27 major white matter bundles across the entire brain. The tracts of interest were generated by crossing fiber model-based probability tractography rendered by a coregistered white matter atlas [37] . This study identified the best diffusionanatomical classifiers and their associations with clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that besides commonly reported hippocampal fiber tracts (e.g., limbic system), additional white matter fiber tracts outside the limbic system can significantly differentiate cognitive impairment and that the deteriorations in these fiber tracts are associated with neuropsychological assessment scores."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center (IADC) funded by NIA P30s since 1991 has screened approximately 2000 subjects and created an extensive longitudinal clinical database.

An advanced multishell diffusion imaging technique, hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI), was added to the IADC routine MRI protocol in April 2015. All IADC participants received the Uniform Data Set version 3 battery (as used in all NIA AD Centers) [38] and additional neuropsychological tests used at the IADC with special emphasis on memory and executive function (see details in the Neuropsychological Assessment section).

The diffusion-weighted images were first denoised using the local principal component analysis approach [45] . With a pair of reverse phase-encoded b0 images as reference, the denoised diffusion-weighted images were corrected for static-field geometric distortion, motion, eddy current artifacts using the TOPUP and EDDY tool from FMRIB software library (FSL) (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).\nThe preprocessed HYDI data were used to compute diffusion metrics of DTI, NODDI, and q-space imaging [25] . The DTI metrics were computed using the FSL DTIFIT command on the first (b-value 5 250 s/mm 2 ) and second shells (b-value 5 1000 s/mm 2 ) of the HYDI data, including FA (the coherence of microstructure water diffusion), MD (the magnitude of overall water diffusion), and supplementary analyses of axial (Da, along the principal water diffusion direction) and Dr (perpendicular to the principal water diffusion direction). All five HYDI shells were used in the NODDI analysis with the AMICO toolbox (https://github. com/daducci/AMICO) [46] . Unlike the classic diffusion tensor model, the NODDI model proposes specific assumptions about the way in which local microarchitecture affects the diffusion properties. In particular, it models the water diffusion signal according to one of three different pools: (1) free-water diffusion (such as in cerebrospinal fluid); (2) intracellular restricted diffusion inside dendrites and axons, and (3) extracellular hindered diffusion. The resultant indices included in the analysis are the ICVF, a measure of neurite density, and neurite orientation dispersion index (OD, the degree of fanning in neurite orientation). In addition to DTI and NODDI, zero-displacement probability (P 0 ) was estimated by integrating the volume of the q-space signals, which reflects water mobility or tissue restrictions. This q-space approach is model free, as it does not use any assumptions of the underlying diffusion properties [44] . Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the diffusion metric acronyms and their microstructure implications.\nParallel to metrics fitting, a within-voxel multifiber tract orientation structure was modeled using BEDPOSTx followed by probabilistic tractography (with crossing fiber modeling [47] ) using PROBTRACKx [48] . For each subject, automatic mapping of the 27 major white matter tracts was conducted in the native diffusion space. The start/stop region-of-interest masks of the 27 major white matter bundles were first rendered and identified in a coregistered standard Montreal Neurological Institute space before being reversely transformed to the native diffusion space (as implemented in the AutoPtx plugin for FSL) [37] . Tractspecific measures of diffusion metrics (i.e., FA, MD, Da, Dr, ICVF, OD, P 0 ) were derived for the following 27 tracts of interest [49] : middle cerebellar peduncle (mcp); medial lemniscus (ml); uncinate fasciculus (unc); cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal portions of the cingulum bundle (cgc, cgh); forceps major and minor (fma, fmi); corticospinal tract (cst); acoustic radiation (ar); anterior, superior, and posterior thalamic radiation (atr, str, ptr); and superior, inferior longitudinal, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (slf, ilf, ifo) (Fig. 1).

For the diffusion variables, between-group analyses were performed using two approaches. First, we examined overall group differences among the three groups using F-tests, followed by ANOVA tests for pair-wise group differences. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust the P value for multiple comparisons Fig. 1 . White matter tracts of interest in one cognitively normal subject generated using probabilistic tractography rendered in sagittal (left), coronal (center), and axial (right) views.

Second, we studied which combination of diffusion metrics within tract of interests can best classify the disease stage. To do so, we used an extension of the regularization approach called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [50] . The classification was performed via the penalized logistic regression using the function glmnet (an R library \"glmnet\"). To select the optimal predictors in the training phase, we run 100 iterations. In each iteration, predictors that gave a cross-validated error within one standard error of the minimum were selected. The predictors that appeared in the majority of the iterations (greater than 50%) were entered into the prediction phase. The final prediction and receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained using a prediction method with a general linear model. Linear regression was used to assess the relationships between neuropsychological performance and diffusion variables on tracts identified in the LASSO analysis.\nTo identify the best-correlated pairs between neuropsychological scores and diffusion variables, sparse canonical correlation analysis was performed (function \"CCA\" in R library \"PMA\"). Briefly, permutation analysis was performed to produce the optimal tuning parameters for sparse canonical correlation using the penalized matrix decomposition using the R function \"CCA.permute\". Afterward, sparse canonical correlations were applied with the optimal tuning parameters to produce the most correlated pair(s) between the diffusion metrics and neuropsychological measures using the R function \"CCA\".

The high FA in the forceps major was mostly driven by high Da with relatively low Dr. The bilateral parahippocampal cingulum (cgh) had the lowest FA and highest OD, which was driven by high Dr. Also, the bilateral parahippocampal cingulum (cgh) had the lowest neurite density (ICVF) and the lowest tissue restriction (P 0 ). In most tracts, the SCD group demonstrated diffusion values that were intermediate between those of the CN and MCI groups.\nFollowing the F-tests for overall group effects (Supplementary Table 2 ), tract-specific diffusion values were evaluated by ANOVA to examine between-group differences ( Supplementary Fig. 2A , before Bonferroni correction).

These tracts of interest also had the highest predictive power to discriminate groups.

With relatively stable Da, the differences in FA and MD were mostly driven by the increase in Dr, suggesting deterioration in the axonal membrane and/or myelin sheathes [6] . This implication is supported by decreased P 0 , a measure of tissue restriction, which is sensitive to myelination in animal and human studies [22] [23] [24] .

It relies on high-quality registration across subjects, which could be challenging in some cases [51, 52] . Alternatively, the tract-specific analyses use tractography to render entire fiber bundles in the subject diffusion space and take account for all the voxels within the fiber bundle.\nPrevious tract-specific AD studies focused on a single preselected tract, such as the uncinate fasciculus [53, 54] and cingulum bundle [14] , or on fibers in the limbic system [16, 55] , whereas few studies have thoroughly investigated whole brain white matter bundles [15, 47] . Similar to previous findings, the parahippocampal cingulum exhibited significant sensitivity and predictive accuracy between the three groups. The significant decrease in FA and increase in Dr suggest microstructural disruption in the parahippocampal cingulum in the MCI group. The parahippocampal cingulum bundle is highly related to MCI and AD as it connects the hippocampus to the rest of the brain area [56, 57] . Deteriorations in the parahippocampal cingulum are associated with episodic memory in nondementing elderly adults [58] and in those with AD [59] .\nIn addition, we identified two other major fiber bundles, the posterior thalamic radiation and forceps major, that consistently demonstrated significant sensitivity and classification accuracy in both the ANOVA and penalized logistic regression analyses. The posterior thalamic radiation connects the caudal parts of the thalamus with the occipital and parietal lobes, while the forceps major facilitates interhemispheric communication. Although not previously reported in AD studies, the pulvinar nuclei of the caudal thalamus play a role in selective attention, particularly visual attention filtering and focusing [60, 61] . Similarly, not previously reported in AD, the microstructures detected by DTI in the forceps major are associated with visuospatial working memory in the developing brain [62] .\nOverall, the identified fiber bundles are located at the posterior part of the brain, suggesting a posterior-anterior gradient. Such gradients support the Braak staging and recent evidence of spatial distribution of tau deposition across AD stages [63] . Furthermore, these fiber bundles were all significantly associated with auditory verbal learning performance with a trend of higher correlation coefficient in the MCI group (not tested), supporting the earlier hypothesis of accumulating cognitive deficits [64] .\nOverall, the diffusion measurements in individuals with SCD were intermediate between the CN and MCI groups ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Despite the known etiological heterogeneity and modest group sample sizes, we detected emerging signals, although weak at this point, of sensitivity in diffusion metrics for differentiating SCD from CN. Notably, Da in the forceps major and superior longitudinal fasciculus differed significantly between CN and SCD at uncorrected P ,.05 ( Supplementary Fig. 2A ). Moreover, Da in the forceps major was also significantly associated with performance in the assessment of perceived cognitive change (i.e., CCI) for the CN and SCD groups (Supplementary Table 3 ). Future large-sample studies may provide sufficient power to determine the significance of the small effect size between CN and SCD. Owing to the spatial heterogeneity of the initial pathophysiological changes (e.g., varying locations of amyloid-beta-triggered neuronal apoptosis and degeneration [65] ), the group-wise analyses, which search for synchronized abnormalities and penalize intersubject variation, may not be efficient for detecting heterogenous subject-specific alterations. Thus, alternatively, subjectspecific analytical approaches [66, 67] may be more sensitive for detecting subtle microstructural changes in the preclinical stage of AD [68] .\nIn this study, no significant differences between CN and SCD were observed. Widespread, but inconsistent, changes in diffusion metrics in SCD have been reported, with higher MD and Dr [9] and lower MD and Dr [11] . The SCD in these previous studies, however, was categorized differently with significantly decreased AVLT scores [9] or decreased MMSE and RAVLT [11] . In this study, the SCD group was classified more stringently with no significant differences from the CN controls in any objective cognitive assessments (e.g., RAVLT-IR, RAVLT-DR, and MoCA). The term SCD, which has also been variously referred to as cognitive complaints [35] , significant memory concern in ADNI [43] , and, at times, subjective memory impairment refers to a somewhat heterogeneous early stage, and definitions tend to vary across studies that preceded a recent consensus definition [69] and operational criteria [70] .\nLimitations of the present study include preclinical cerebrovascular disease affecting white matter, a cross-sectional study design with progression to AD not yet known, modest group sample sizes, a lack of AD subjects as the benchmark, and potentially the choice of the diffusion model. Although NODDI provides a clinically feasible approach with robust nonlinear data fitting for probing axonal density in vivo, NODDI estimates may deviate in severe disease conditions where white matter microstructures are highly distorted [71] . We considered the subtle white matter microscopic changes in early stage AD may still satisfy NODDI model assumptions. Alternative options may be to use white matter track integrity based on diffusion kurtosis imaging [19] , to model the axons based on composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED) [18] , or to measure microscopic anisotropy using spherical tensor encoding [72] . These options, however, require different sets of diffusion constraints, ill-fitted voxels resulting in \"black holes\" requiring imaging smoothing, many more diffusion encoding directions, or special MRI pulse sequences (non-product sequences)."}]
