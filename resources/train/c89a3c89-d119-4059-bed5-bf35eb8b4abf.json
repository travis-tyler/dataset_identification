A farmer's farm management decisions greatly depend on regional climate conditions. In particular, land use change has been a major adaptation strategy of farmers to optimize their profit based on given environmental and market conditions. Farmers also have incorporated federal crop insurance programs to deal with farm operating risk. However, in terms of strategies for adapting to climate conditions, land use change and crop insurance are less well known. In addition, recent agricultural literature has focused on unintended policy effects of federal crop insurance programs on farmers' adaptive behaviors to climate conditions. Given limited conceptual and empirical evidence, one major purpose of this dissertation is to identify the causal relationship between climate conditions and land allocation and analyze the intertwined relationship between subsidized crop insurance and land allocations in terms of farmers' adaptive behaviors to climate conditions (Chapter 2). In designing future plans for sustainable agriculture and resource management, policy developers and farm operators require credible estimates of climate change impacts on agricultural production. However, lack of knowledge about climate systems and farmers' response to climate conditions creates uncertainty regarding the causal relationship between climate conditions and regional agricultural production as well as the economic impacts of climate change. In particular, no consensus exists regarding how to construct farmers' expected weather conditions in previous land use literature. Also, projected weather data sets based on general circulation models (GCMs) generally differ from realized station-level weather outcomes and have large variations among them. To examine the effects of these two uncertainties regarding climate measures on forecast land use in 2030 and farmers' response, Chapter 4 analyzes decadal land use over the Midwest based on various scenarios and model specifications. Genetic improvements and advanced crop management practices have been major contributing factors to corn yield growth in the U.S. after the 1930s. During the last decade, adoption of GM corn, pest scouting, and yield monitor has increased significantly. However, insufficient empirical evidence regarding the effects of GM corn and information technologies on corn yield and nutrient management may be an obstacle to understanding the costs and benefits of adopting the technologies. Chapter 3 provides empirical evidence regarding the effects of GM corn and information technologies on corn yield and nitrogen use management. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 analyze farmers' behaviors in response to given exogenous conditions, including climate conditions, government policies, and technology adoption. The results of our research show that changes in agricultural productivity or profitability resulting from changes in climate conditions, policies, and available technology are key factors in determining agricultural production. This research contributes to our understanding of the implications of recent climate changes, expansion of crop insurance programs, and high adoption of GM corn and information technologies for United States (US) agriculture. This dissertation is organized as follows: The next three chapters consist of the three essays introduced above. The dissertation closes with a general conclusion, including an overall summary and discussion of the findings."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent climate models predict that climate change in the Midwest over the next few decades will increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as intensive rainfall (see Figure   2.1). These changes may reduce crop yields and decrease agriculture net returns. The Midwest region is an important component of agriculture in the United States. Farmland accounts for more than half of the land in the Midwest and constitutes roughly 33% of US cropland. The region also produced roughly 62% of US corn and soybeans in 2015. Projected climate change in the Midwest raises concerns about regional agricultural production and may have important national and international effects in commodity markets. Analyses that do not consider adaptive behaviors tend to overestimate the damage of climate change (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, & Shaw 1994). Given that agricultural production depends on local climate conditions, farmers generally respond to harmful weather conditions and climate change in the long run. The government also provides indirect and short-term adaptation options for farmers through agricultural policies, such as income support programs, as well as long-term options through public research and development (Malcolm et al. 2012). This study analyzes the adaptive behaviors of Midwestern farmers to regional climate conditions based on their decisions regarding land allocation and crop insurance purchases. A change in cropping pattern is an important farm-level adaptation option. The regional distribution of agricultural production depends on farm-level cropland allocation. For example, Figure 2.2 shows the changes in the proportion of soybean acreage to cropland. Soybean acreage has expanded to the north and northwest, and these changes in soybean acreage may be caused by changes in climate conditions (Reilly et al. 2003). Changes in cropland allocation also may affect environmental conditions. For example, intensification of row cropping may alter precipitation patterns . Also, nitrogen-intensive crops may contribute to leaching and runoff, which degrade water quality and contribute to adverse environmental outcomes (Jones et al. 2016). How federal crop insurance programs are coupled with agricultural production has been an important issue. For example, Goodwin and Smith (2013) point out the production distortion caused by subsidized crop insurance, including changes in production pattern. This production distortion caused by crop insurance is an ongoing issue. After the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, subsidized crop insurance programs expanded tremendously. Approximately 90% of corn and soybean acreage was insured in 2014 (see Figure 2.3). More recently, after the 2014 Farm Bill was passed, federal crop insurance programs expanded coverage and became a primary tool for farmers in dealing with farm operation risk. Although crop insurance is a farm-level adaptation option, subsidized crop insurance programs may make farmers more vulnerable to extreme weather events and long-term climate changes (GAO 2014;Annan & Schlenker 2015). In particular, subsidized federal crop insurance programs may mitigate farmers' incentive to adjust their land use to accommodate climate conditions for four reasons. First, if land allocation is one way to self-insure, demand for crop insurance and land allocation can substitute for each other (Ehrlich & Becker 1972). 1 Second, crop insurance may encourage farmers to grow riskier high-value crops by guaranteeing a certain amount of revenue (Wu & Adams 2001;Goodwin & Smith 2012). Also, if the amount of subsidy is coupled with production risk, the premium subsidy structure may distort farmers' land use change in response to production risk (Feng, Hennessy, & Miao 2013;Miao, Hennessy, & Feng 2016). Last, the Government Accountability Office (GAO 2014) indicates that the Risk Management Agency (RMA) recommends RMA's good farming practices, which focus on maintaining historical crop yields in the short term. However, certain practices, such as conventional tillage, may unintentionally make famers more vulnerable to climate change in the long run. We seek to answer four specific research questions. First, how do weather and climate conditions influence land allocation of farmers at planting time? Second, how does governmentsubsidized crop insurance alter farmers' cropland allocation? Third, does federal crop insurance change farmers' incentive to adapt to extreme weather events and climate conditions? Finally, do farmers consider weather and climate conditions when they decide which crops to plant and whether to purchase crop insurance? To answer these four questions, we develop a simultaneous equation model consisting of decisions regarding crops to grow, land allocation, and insurance purchases. We use farm-level data based on the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) for estimation. Our findings show that climate conditions have significant effects on farmers' decisions to grow specific crops, purchase federal crop insurance, and allocate their land. Also, federal crop insurance programs change farmers' adaptive behaviors to extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfalls. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews relevant literature. Section 3 explains the effects of production risk and federal crop insurance by using a simple conceptual model. Section 4 outlines our empirical model, explains basic assumptions used for estimation, and describes how to estimate the model. Section 5 explains how we specify equations regarding farmers' decisions to grow specific crops, purchase federal crop insurance, and allocate land. This section also shows how we construct farm-level data, county-level climate and soil data, and state-level price data. Section 6 describes the results and economic implications, and Section 7 discusses conclusions and limitations of our study. Section 8 includes references, tables, and figures. Last, the Appendix shows the proof of analytic results in Section 3, how to derive final equations for estimation in Section 4, and climate variables in Section 5.\nIdentifying the effects of technology adoption on corn yield and nutrient management is important to understand the economic and environmental implications of technology adoption. Gains in corn yield as a result of technology adoption can increase profitability by increasing corn yield (revenue) and further exceeding production costs or by maintaining corn yield (revenue) and further reducing production costs. If profitability improves through the adoption of technology that reduces nitrogen use per bushel of corn -that is, improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE)nitrogen pollution from runoff, leaching, and volatilization in corn fields can be reduced. 1 This study investigates the economic and environmental implications of the adoption of genetically modified (GM) corn and information technologies in the context of corn yield and nutrient management. The adoption of GM corn and information technologies has increased over time and the adoption of GM corn increased fairly rapidly after the introduction of commercial GM corn in 1996. In 2013, the proportion of GM corn to total corn acreage reached 88% (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). The adoption of information and precision agricultural technologies progressed at a slower pace. Pest scouting, for example, is the most widely adopted information technology. In 2014, weed scouting and insect scouting were used on 94% and 90% of Iowa corn acreage, respectively (NASS quick stat). The adoption of yield monitor, which is the first stage in the adoption of precision agriculture, increased to roughly 70% of Midwest corn acreage in 2010 (see Figure 3.1). The increased adoption of GM corn and information technologies reflects the profitability of adopting these technologies, as shown by gains in corn yield and NUE (Schimmelpfennig & Ebel 2011;Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). GM corn adopters can increase corn yield by decreasing yield loss from pests. GM corn enables adopters to suppress pest populations more efficiently than farmers who use conventional varieties. Herbicide-tolerant (HT) corn also allows farmers to rely heavily on glyphosate, thereby reducing the use of more environmentally detrimental herbicides. Insect-resistant (Bt) corn produces a toxic protein that targets insects damaging the plant above and below ground. In addition, the Bt trait facilitates efficient water and nutrient uptake of the plant through an improved corn root system (Miranowski, Rosburg, & Aukayanagul 2011) and the HT trait reduces weed competition for water and nutrients for the plant. Information technologies may have positive effects on corn yield and NUE. Pest scouting provides information on pest infestation, pesticide performance, and pest resistance during the growing season. Farmers who adopt pest scouting can more effectively control pest infestation in their fields and minimize damage to corn yield. Furthermore, we can consider pest scouting as an indicator of general crop management. High adoption of weed scouting, insect scouting, and scouting for diseases suggests that most of the pest scouting adopters adopt the three technologies at the same time (NASS quick stat). Also, pest scouting is closely related to nutrient, soil, and water management. 2 Yield monitor generates field-level information regarding corn yield distribution, soil conditions, and results of crop management practices during the previous year. Farmers may use this information when determining the most profitable crop management system for each corn field prior to planting season. In addition, yield monitor may encourage farmers to apply nitrogen based on corn yield distribution within and among fields and potentially improve NUE. Thus, farmers may have an incentive to increase nitrogen use on certain areas of fields or fields with higher yield potential but reduce applications on more marginal areas. This study also investigates the relationship among GM corn, pest scouting, and yield monitoring in improving corn yield and nutrient management. It is desirable to analyze the effects of adopting these technologies jointly to correctly measure the effects of GM corn and information technologies on crop management. Technology adoption decisions are made simultaneously, and the effects of one technology depend on its combination with another. For example, suppose farmers who adopt GM corn are more likely to adopt pest scouting. If pest scouting is not considered, comparing corn yield across fields will overestimate the yield effects of GM corn when pest scouting has positive effects on corn yield. In this study, we seek to answer the following specific three research questions: (1) Does the adoption of GM corn and pest scouting increase corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE? (2) Is the relationship between GM corn and pest scouting complementary in improving corn yield and nutrient management? (3) How does information from yield monitor alter corn yield and nutrient management of farmers who adopt GM corn and/or pest scouting? To answer these questions, we construct and estimate equations for corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE based on the technology adoption status of individual farmers. An endogenous switching regression approach is applied to control for the effects of unobserved factors in technology adoption. We use extensive field-level information based on Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data for our estimation. Results show that adopting GM corn and information technologies increases corn yield and nitrogen use but has insignificant effects on NUE. We also find that the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting on corn yield and nitrogen use are larger for fields having low soil productivity. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature. Section 3 explains the effects of technology adoption on corn yield and nutrient management by using a simple conceptual model. Section 4 provides the model specifications and related assumptions. Section 5 explains the implications of selected variables and the construction of field-level data. Section 6 discusses the results and economic implications. Section 7 provides the conclusions. References, summary statistics, and estimation results are shown at the end of the paper. The last section is the Appendix, which includes results of robustness checks and supplementary tables.\nIn These methods of projecting future weather conditions can also be applied retrospectively to construct historical weather data sets. The advantage of this method is that researchers can use weather data sets with the same GCMs in estimating the causal relationship between economic outcomes and climate and in forecasting climate change impacts. However, the historical weather data sets based on GCMs generally differ from realized station-level weather outcomes, even with the use of bias-correction algorithms to address this problem. intensive rainfall events and larger variations in the first two measures. However, the literature on climate change argues that GCMs are based on imperfect knowledge of climate systems, and little evidence suggests that any particular GCMs outperform others in describing historical weather outcomes (Gleckler, Taylor, & Doutriaux, 2008;Reichler & Kim, 2008;Pierce et al., 2009 In addition, the forecast land use in 2030 and predictive accuracy of models vary among the 30 scenarios. However, we find that forecasting results based on models consisting of yearly agronomic variables are more stable and have better predictive accuracy than models consisting of monthly variables. Last, the predicted land use in 2030 shows that corn and soybean acreage will expand to the northwest. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the previous literature and describe the contributions of this study. Section 3 introduces a simple conceptual model. "}, {"section_title": "Literature review", "text": "Our paper is based on literature regarding land use change, crop insurance, and climate change. First, research on land use change has analyzed the effects of federal crop insurance on farmers' land use and its unintended policy effects on regional environmental conditions (Wu 1999;Wu and Adams 2001;Young, Vandeveer, & Schnepf 2001;Goodwin, Vandeveer, & Deal 2004;Lubowski et al. 2006;Classen et al. 2011;Feng, Henessy, & Miao 2013;Walter et al. 2013;Miao, Hennessy, & Feng 2016). 2 Wu (1999) analyzes the effects of corn crop insurance on land allocation and groundwater quality in the Central Nebraska Basin. He finds that corn crop insurance encourages farmers to shift their land from hay and pasture to corn, but the influence of crop insurance programs diminishes as farm size increases. Goodwin, Vandeveer, and Deal (2004) perform a comprehensive analysis, including cropping pattern and insurance participation. They find modest effects of crop insurance on cropland allocation in the Corn Belt and Upper Great Plains. Miao, Hennessy, and Feng (2016) analyze how crop insurance subsidies and the Sodsaver program affect farmers' decisions regarding land conversion from grasslands to cropland. 3 Their simulation results show that 3% of cropland in the US Prairie Pothole Region covered by crop insurance would have not been converted absent a crop insurance subsidy. Also, they predict that the Sodsaver program can reduce land conversion in that region by about 5%. However, previous literature on land use and agricultural policies has been limited to small study areas and imperfect information about individual farms. Specifically, except for Wu (1999) and Walter et al. (2013), most studies are based on at least county-level data. Walter et al. (2013) analyze only the land allocation among insured crops. Recently, the literature on climate change has interpreted land use change as a strategy for adapting to regional environmental conditions (Malcolm et al. 2012;Hornbeck & Keskin 2014;Yang & Shumway 2015). For example, Hornbeck and Keskin (2014) show that farmers without groundwater have increased their planting of drought-tolerant crops in arid regions. However, farmers over the Ogallala Aquifer have increased their use of water-intensive and droughtsensitive crops. Although studies examining climate effects on land use have increased, empirical studies are insufficient to gain a full understanding of how government policies and the adaptive behaviors of farmers are correlated. Methodologically, our empirical model merges the corner solution model and the switching regression model to control for indecisive censoring and simultaneously measures the treatment effects of crop insurance. Cropland allocation by farmers is censored at zero, and this censoring is the result of optimization by individual farmers. Moreover, land allocation for insured crops is only observable when farmers buy crop insurance. Land use studies have controlled for corner solution responses by specifying crop selection equations (Sckokai & Moro 2006;Lacroix & Thomas 2011), but less effort has been exerted to measure treatment effects of farmers' insurance purchases. Wu (1999) considers two features of data simultaneously, but his model is based on the self-selection model instead of the corner solution model and he assumes that decisions to grow crops and to purchase insurance are independent. 4 Our model is designed to measure the intertwined relationship between two adaptive options of farmers: changing cropping pattern and purchasing subsidized crop insurance. First, our analysis is expected to contribute to the empirical evidence for unintended effects of crop insurance programs on farmers' adaptive behaviors to long-term climate change. Second, our results are based on farm-level data in eight Midwestern states. Since we control for detailed information on management of farmers' decisions, our results are more consistent than studies based on aggregate data. Furthermore, by allowing the correlation between decisions to grow crops and to purchase insurance, our model is more general than previous models assuming independence between the two decisions.\nAn extensive body of agricultural economics literature has analyzed the relationship between GM crops and agricultural production. Compared with the yield effects of GM corn, the effects of GM corn adoption on nutrient management are less well known. In addition, scouting has been examined to measure its effects only on pest management (Carson 1970;Miranowski, Ernst, & Cummings 1974;Yee & Ferguson 1996;Mishra, Nimon, & El-Osta 2005). Literature on yield monitor has focused on general information about precision agriculture, including yield monitor, yield and soil maps, and variablerate technology and their adoption rates (Griffin & Lowenberg-DeBoer 2005;Schimmelpfennig & Ebel 2011). Only Miranowski, Rosburg, & Aukayangul (2011) discuss the implications of GM crop development on NUE. They argue that increased corn yield will decrease the amount of land and nitrogen required to produce the same amount of corn in 2009 by 17 to 27 million acres and by 0.6 to 1.4 million metric tons of nitrogen in 2030. Previous literature has emphasized the self-selection problem in measuring the effects of adopting agricultural technologies. Qaim (2009) and Nolan & Santos (2012) argue that the lack of field-level or farm-level information can cause selectivity bias. Shi et al. (2013) explain that the quality of germplasm between conventional corn and GM corn is systematically different and show that this unobserved difference can be a source of selectivity bias. To overcome this problem, an endogenous switching regression has been used to analyze the effects of agricultural technology adoption on economic outcomes of crop management practices (Fuglie & Bosch 1995;Wu & Babcock 1998;Khanna 2001). In particular, Lee (1983) suggests an approach to formulating a polychotomous choice problem with mixed continuous and discrete dependent variables. Based on this approach, endogenous switching regression models can be incorporated to evaluate the effects of alternative combinations of technologies (Wu & Babcock 1998). However, previous literature does not always consider nonnegative corn yield and nitrogen use despite nitrogen use and corn yield always being greater than or equal to zero. Terza (1998) shows how to extend an endogenous switching regression approach to models having an exponential functional form. In this study, we merge Lee (1983) and Terza (1998) to construct a polychotomous choice selectivity model with an exponential functional form. The advantages of our approach are its consideration of selectivity bias in technology adoption and its guarantee of nonnegative outcome variables. Moreover, this approach allows us to evaluate the effects of adopting alternative combinations of technologies and the effects of adoption of an individual technology at the same time. Insufficient empirical evidence regarding the effects of GM corn, information technologies on corn yield, and nutrient management may be an obstacle to understanding the costs and benefits of adopting the technologies. We expect that our empirical study will contribute to filling this gap. In addition, our results are based on extensive field-level data covering the 13 major cornproducing states. Moreover, by using weights in field-level data, we can generalize our results in a statistically reliable manner. Thus, our results should be more general and credible than those of previous studies.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of studies has forecast land use change in response to changes in climate and policies to measure their potential economic effects (Fezzi & Bateman, 2010;Kaminski, Kan, & Fleischer, 2012;Jianhong, McCarl, & Wein, 2013;Miao, Khanna, & Huang, 2016 "}, {"section_title": "Conceptual approach", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The role of risk in cropping pattern changes", "text": "The effects of risk and crop insurance on cropping pattern change can be analyzed by extending the analytic model of Miao, Hennessy, and Feng (2016). 5 Consider farmer i who has several land units and grows two crops: crop 1 and crop 2.

The yield function of crop j is assumed to be a simple linear form. (1) missing data problem. For example, we can observe zero acreage for hay when farmers decide not to grow hay. However, the self-selection model is used for selection bias caused by missing data. Moreover, applying a two-step procedure for the self-selection model (Heckman 1976) to the corner solution model would lead to inconsistent estimates (Shonkwiler & Yen 1999). 5 They focus on land conversion based on yield risk. Land conversion from marginal land to cropland may not be a relevant issue in the Midwest because total cropland in the Midwest has decreased (NASS quick stat). However, cropland harvested in the Midwest was constant over time, which means that productive land has been used for crop production continuously. As a result, in the Midwest, the allocation of cropland would be more important issues for farmers. where is the mean yield of crop j, \u2208 [0,1] is a risk parameter varying over land units and follows ( ) , and \u2208 [\u2212 , ] is a random variable representing yield loss (or gain) from unexpected weather events.

We assume independence between and . Farmer i is assumed to have a utility function, ( ), defined on profit with > 0 and < 0. Then, farmer i's decisions regarding how to use land unit k having risk level can be summarized as "}, {"section_title": "\uf0f2\uf0f2", "text": "Last, without the loss of generality, we assume that ( | = 0) > ( ) > ( | = 1) and ( 1 | = 0) > ( 2 | = 0). That is, the expected utility from growing crop j in the riskiest land unit is less than the expected utility from non-cropping, and the second equality means that crop 1 is more profitable than crop 2 without production risk. Since ( | )/ < 0 and 2 ( | )/ 2 < 0, we know that there is where ( | = ) = ( ) for j=1, 2 (see Appendix A). This result implies that farmers allocate their land until = max{ 1 , 2 }, and farmers give up growing crops when the risk of land units is greater than . Farmer i chooses a crop with the highest expected utility from land unit k. Cropping patterns in his fields depend on changes in the expected utility due to changes in the risk level. Changes in expected utility can be represented by the size of the first and second derivative of expected utility with respect to : ( | )/ and 2 ( | )/ 2 . We cannot determine the relative sizes of ( | )/ and 2 ( | )/ 2 between crop 1 and crop 2 without further qualification. However, by using a Taylor series expansion, we can show that  ( 1 | )/ > ( 2 | )/ for all , and we can verify that farmer i will grow only crop 1 because the expected utility from growing crop 1 is larger than the expected utility from growing crop 2 for all less than 1 . However, when ( 1 | )/ <"}, {"section_title": "The effects of subsidized crop insurance", "text": "For simplicity, we only consider yield protection crop insurance and assume that the expected output prices are the same as the projected price established by the Risk Management  4where \u03c6 = \u2212 .

Since crop insurance increases the expected utility of growing insured crops, farmers replace land for uninsured crops with land for insured crops after purchasing federal crop insurance, as in Figure 2.7. 7 6 The indemnity price for yield protection crop insurance is the average futures market price during the month before the sales closing. For example, the February price is used for corn and soybeans. Farmers can choose a price from 60 to 100 percent of the indemnity price. However, most producers choose their coverage based on 100 percent of the projected price (Edward 2011). In addition, the difference between yield protection crop insurance and revenue protection crop insurance is when indemnity is paid. In the case of yield protection crop insurance, indemnity is paid when the average yield per acre is less than the yield guarantee. However, in the case of revenue protection crop insurance, indemnity is paid when farmers' actual revenue is less than their revenue guarantee. 7 Even though the expected profit after buying crop insurance equals the expected profit without crop insurance, the concavity assumption regarding farmers' utility function makes the expected utility after buying crop insurance larger than the expected utility without crop insurance. The sign of ( | )/ depends on the subsidy rates and coverage levels. That is, it can be positive for given risk levels when the subsidy rate and the coverage level are high (see Appendix A). 8 Also, we can easily show that ( | )/ > 0, which means that increases in the subsidy rates may increase acreage of the insured crop by enhancing the expected utility from growing the insured crop at the given risk level (see Figure 2.7). From these results, we can imagine that the subsidy structure decreasing the incremental cost of coverage can distort farmers' cropping pattern more than the subsidy structure decoupled from farmers' choice of coverage. We can summarize the effects of crop insurance on farmers' cropping pattern change as follows: Remark 2: Adopting yield protection crop insurance changes cropping patterns by increasing the expected utility from growing insured crops and changing the size of ( | )/ . Since high subsidy rates and coverage rates change the sign of ( | )/ , subsidy structures coupled with coverage levels bring about more distortions in farmers' land allocation decisions. From the conceptual approach, we can answer our research questions with a simple theoretical model. The model shows that, without crop insurance, the production risk decreases farmers' expected utility from growing crops. The decreasing rates of expected utility in response to increases in the risk level and their curvatures are heterogeneous among crops. Farmers' cropping pattern thus depends on differences in the marginal expected utility with respect to risk level and its curvature among crops. It also shows that federal crop insurance programs can change farmers' cropping pattern by altering the responsiveness of farmers' expected utility to production risk. In the next section, we try to find empirical evidence regarding our research questions. In particular, we use extreme weather events such as intensive rainfalls and extreme heat degree days 8 Even though we need further qualification to derive necessary and sufficient conditions, we can show that there exist * and * such that ( | )/ < 0 for > * and > * (see Appendix A). as proxy variables for production risk and measure the effects of federal crop insurance on farmers' response to these extreme weather events."}, {"section_title": "Empirical model and estimation", "text": "Consider the problem of farmer i, who must decide whether to grow crop j or not, whether to buy crop insurance for crop j or not, and how much acreage to allocate to crop j if he chooses to grow it. The farmer's decisions regarding crops to plant, insurance purchases, and acreage allocation can be correlated. For example, unobserved conditions of farmer i and his farm, such as his attitude toward the risk or heterogeneous soil quality in his fields, can affect his crop insurance purchase and land allocation decisions at the same time. To begin this analysis, we specify the linear acreage allocation equation in the context of the switching regression model to account for the effects of crop insurance on farmers' land allocation (Wu 1999;Wooldridge 2010, pp. 948):  where * is the latent acreage for farmer i's land allocation to crop j. is a crop insurance dummy for crop j. is the vector of explanatory variables for land allocation. and are the parameters. means changes in farmers' behavior resulting from crop insurance purchases, and the effects of a climate condition on land allocation decisions of farmers having crop insurance can be measured by the sum of and corresponding to the climate measure and the interaction term between the climate measure and an insurance dummy for crop j. 1 and 0 are error terms corresponding to each decision: buying crop insurance for crop j or not. We assume that 1 = 0 = for simplicity. Equation 5has two limitations in identifying the effects of federal crop insurance programs on farmers' land allocation decisions. First, we incorporate insurance dummies as a measure of insurance demand. Even though insurance dummies capture the effects of crop insurance participation, they do not reflect the intensity of crop insurance demand, such as high coverage or demand for revenue protection crop insurance. 9 Second, crop insurance effects may depend on the combination of crops grown and crops covered by insurance. For example, assume that farmer i decides to grow corn and soybeans. The effects of corn insurance on corn acreage when farmer i buys only corn insurance will differ from the effects of corn insurance for corn on corn acreage when farmer i buys insurance for corn and soybeans at the same time. Likewise, the effects of corn insurance will vary when farmer i grows only corn. However, with our model specification, only the aggregate effects of crop insurance can be identified. Second, we construct a simultaneous equation model for farmer i's decisions to grow crop j and purchase crop insurance for crop j:  where * , and * are latent variables for farmer i's decisions to grow crop j and purchase insurance for crop j, respectively. is the observed amount of land allocated to crop j. and are the vectors of explanatory variables for the decision to grow crop j and purchase crop insurance for crop j. and are the parameters.

Thus, we allow the correlation between and for \u2260 . Based on Equation 6, the unconditional expectation of farmer i's land allocation to crop j becomes:   From Fishe, Trost, and Lurie (1981), the conditional expectation of error terms in Equation (7) is as follows: where , and , ; ). and \u03a6 represent a probability density function and a cumulative density function of standard normal distribution. \u03a6 2 is a cumulative density function of the standard bivariate normal distribution. is the correlation coefficient between and . is the covariance between and . is the covariance between and . , = ( )/ \u03a6( ), = 1, \u2026 , , and it is the correction term from an equation regarding farmer i's decision to grow crop k. As a result, the final acreage equation for crop j is as follows: ) where = \u2212 ( * | , , ). 11 The estimation proceeds in two steps (Shonkwiler & Yen 1999). In the first step, we estimate equations regarding decisions to grow crops and purchase crop insurance. In our data, we can observe a decision of farmer i on crop insurance for crop j only when farmer i decides to harvest crop j. 12 To control for missing observations, we use a probit model with sample selection, as in Van de ven and Van Praag (1981), instead of the bivariate probit model. In the second stage, linear regression is applied to Equation (9) based on the predicted probabilities of growing crop j and purchasing crop insurance for crop j. We have to account for the sampling design of our farm-level data for inference . To account for the survey design of the ARMS data, we generate 2,000 random bootstrap samples using probability weights, estimate Equation (9) 2,000 times, and then use the mean and variance of the replicated estimates as estimates of parameters and their variances (Goodwin, Mishra, & Ortalo-Magne\u0301 2003;. There are several practical reasons to use the bootstrapping method based on probability weights. 13 First, even though the ARMS data provide replicate weights for delete-a-group jackknife estimators, the number of replicate weights was changed from 15 to 30 after 2008. Thus, incorporating only 15 replicate weights means using more samples in 2009 and 2010 AMRS data than for previous years during estimation. Second, Goodwin, Mishra, and Ortalo-Magne\u0301 (2003) argue that the jackknife procedure may not be valid when using only a subset of the data. Third, the two-step estimation procedure does not account for variations in the first-stage estimates. Also, the error term in Equation 9is heteroscedastic because it is a function of individual exogenous variables. Thus, if we use ordinary least squares (OLS), the estimated variance in Equation 9is inconsistent. The marginal effect of a continuous variable ( ) including the three equations in Equation (6) is calculated as follows (Chritofides, Stengos, & Swidinsky 1997): Last, based on estimates in Equation (9), we calculate the marginal effects of crop insurance on acreage for crop j based on Wu (1999): Equation 11represents the impact of crop insurance on acreage for crop j when we do not know famers' decisions regarding crops to grow. The first term of Equation (11) means the expected acreage of crop j with crop insurance, and the latter term indicates the expected acreage of crop j without crop insurance. To calculate the expected change in acreage for crop j due to crop insurance purchases, we use the weighted average of \u2206 ( * ) for all farms, with sampling weights in our data.\nTo evaluate the effect of technology adoption, we must account for two features of corn yield and nutrient management. First, we cannot observe the extent to which technology adopters use nitrogen or increase corn yield without adopting technology. Second, decisions regarding technology adoption are voluntary. Unobserved individual conditions may simultaneously affect corn yield (nutrient management) and farmers' decisions regarding technology adoption. For instance, pest scouting is more beneficial in high pest pressure environments. Thus, comparison between corn yield of pest scouting adopters in high pest pressure environments and corn yield of non-adopters in low pest pressure environments leads a downward bias in the effects of pest scouting on corn yield. Technology adoption, thus, can be non-random, and corn yield and nutrient management of farmers who adopt technology differs systematically from corn yield and nutrient management of randomly selected farmers with the same individual characteristics. To account for these features, we apply a polychotomous choice selectivity model (Lee 1983) to conceptualize farmers' incentives regarding technology adoption and simultaneously control for the self-selection problem. A polychotomous choice selectivity model of technology adoption consists of two parts. The first part analyzes farmers' decisions on technology adoption. The second part estimates the effects of technology adoption on corn yield and nutrient management, conditional on technology adoption status."}, {"section_title": "Model specification and data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model specification", "text": "We impose the following assumptions for our model specification: (1) Farmers are riskaverse and their utility depends on the risk of profit and expected profit, (2) farmers seek to maximize their expected utility by allocating their land to crops and buying crop insurance, 3farmers are price takers; that is, we assume that output prices and production (crop yield) are independent at the farm level , (4) farmers have expectations regarding weather conditions during the growing season and these expectations are based on previous weather conditions, and (5) farmers' expectations about profit after harvesting crops and variance of profit depend on output prices, variance of output prices, expected weather conditions including extreme weather events, and agricultural policies.

One disadvantage of the two-step procedure for self-selection or the corner solution model is identification of parameters in the second step. That is, when , and , only include , and , , the parameters' corresponding explanatory variables in acreage equations are poorly identified. , includes off-farm income and age as well as , and , . Off-farm income can be used as a proxy for off-farm activity. Since farmers allocate their time between on-farm and offfarm activity, the extent of off-farm work can affect production decisions. For example, high offfarm income requires a high commitment to the off-farm job and, therefore, off-farm income is negatively correlated to labor-intensive crop choices and farm management. Also, farmers prefer to grow the most profitable crops based on available technologies. Off-farm activity may give disincentive to farmers to adopt management-intensive technologies but motivate them to adopt management-saving technologies (Fernandez-Cornejo 2007). Thus, off-farm income can influence farmers' decisions on crops to grow through available technologies. Age is positively correlated with landownership, and landownership can affect farmers' decisions regarding crops to grow. In particular, Bigelow, Borchers, and Hubbs (2016) show that younger farmers rent a large portion of the land they operate, but older farmers are more likely to be full owners. Also, Varble, Secchi, and Druschke (2016) show that, in Iowa, renters are more likely to use crop rotation than full owners. Last, age is positively correlated with farming experience (Khanna, Epouhe, & Hornbaker 1999), and greater experience can lead to better knowledge of the fields and more efficient land use. , consists of variables regarding prices and climate conditions and variables representing farmer i's financial status, such as debt ratio and equity. Equity means the difference between farms' assets and debt and has been used as a proxy of farms' wealth. Debt ratio means the debt-to-assets ratio and measures farms' risk exposure and ability to overcome adverse financial events. Goodwin (1993) argues that farms' debt is positively correlated to their demand for crop insurance because farms having a higher level of debt are more likely to be subject to borrower-imposed insurance purchases. However, the effect of debt on crop insurance choice is an empirical question. Specifically, large farms are more likely to have higher debt ratios than small farms , and small farms are more likely to buy crop insurance because they may not be able to survive a crop failure (Wu 1999). Last, Farrin, Miranda, and O'Donoghue (2016) show that, when examining crop insurance demand over multiple years, demand for crop insurance is affected by farmers' financial wealth more than their attitude toward risk. They also find that, except for low-income farmers, demand for crop insurance is negatively correlated with farms' level of wealth.\nOne disadvantage of the two-step approach is identification of parameters in the second step. When variables affecting technology adoption and outcomes variables (Y) are identical, problems regarding multicollinearity can arise during the estimation. For identification, we impose at least one exclusion restriction on Z (Terza, Basu, & Rathouz 2008;Terza 2009;Wooldridge 2014). That is, we include variables which are not included in X and satisfy conditions of instrument variables in Z, in addition to X. To follow the restriction, we use the multi-state GM corn prices, off-farm work hours per year of an operator and his or her spouse, and farmers' financial status. 8 Since GM corn can lower labor requirements for chemical management, a high degree of commitment to off-farm work increases farmers' incentive to adopt GM corn (Gould, Saupe, & Klemme 1989;Fernandez-Cornejo 2007;Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). We include farmers' total debt and equity to control for their financial status. Credit constraints impede technology adoption (Feder et al. 1985;Fernandez-Cornejo 2007); however, the effects of farmers' financial status are not determined. Large farms are more likely to have high levels of debt and equity . Since large farms can spread the cost of technology adoption, they are more likely to adopt new technologies (Schimmelpfennig & Ebel 2011). 9 Last, we assume that GM corn prices, farmers' off-farm work, and financial status influence farmers' technology adoption but not necessarily corn yield and nutrient management."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm-level data", "text": "This study constructs a farm-level data set based on the Agricultural Resource Management Survey Phase III version 1. Aggregate land use change can mask farmers' cropland allocation decisions, even though aggregate land use data are easily accessible and convenient for estimation. 14 Farmers respond to local market and environmental conditions in different ways because of heterogeneous features of their farm. Capturing heterogeneity between farms is necessary in measuring weather and climate effects on farmers' land allocation. Farm-level data include land allocation, crop insurance status, financial status, and socioeconomic characteristics. To include the relatively homogeneous group of farms, we select 10,056 farms satisfying five conditions : (1) The farm's largest sources of gross income are grains, oilseeds, dry beans, and dry peas, 15 (2) the farm was operating in one of eight Midwestern states during 2003 -2011, 16 (3) the farm has more than 50 acres of total cropland, (4) the principal operator is not retired from farming or ranching, and (5) the insured crops of the farm are identifiable. 17 Since the ARMS data only cover harvested land, we use harvested land as a proxy for planted land. The crops considered are corn, soybeans, winter wheat, and other. We consider acreage allocated to other crops as residual land use and assume that choices regarding other crops are independent of choices regarding corn, soybeans, and wheat conditional on explanatory variables in acreage equations. In the case of Minnesota, we include spring wheat instead of winter wheat. Table 2.1 summarizes the farm-level data and market variables. However, some disadvantages are associated with the ARMS Phase III data. First, since the ARMS data is repeated cross-sectional data, it may be difficult to control for unobserved characteristics of each farm. Also, the ARMS Phase III data do not include historical land use, which means that we cannot explicitly control for the effects of crop rotation. Second, the ARMS Phase III data do not provide locational information, which means that farm-specific environmental conditions are uncontrolled. Last, to merge the multiple-year survey for estimation, we assume that the survey design and population density of the samples are constant during the study periods. 18"}, {"section_title": "Market Variables", "text": "For expected output prices, state-level futures prices are constructed by adjusting regional differences in farm-gate prices (Barr et al. 2011). For example, the expected price of corn ( ) is calculated as follows: where \u0305 is the average of daily February closing prices of December corn futures contracts. is called the \"basis\" and is used to account for systematic differences between farm-gate prices and futures prices. \u0305 is the average of daily December closing prices of December corn futures contracts, and \u0305 is the state-level farm received price. For futures prices of soybean and winter wheat, we use daily February closing prices of November soybean futures contracts and daily February closing prices of July winter wheat futures contracts, respectively. Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) futures prices are used for corn and soybeans, and Kansas City Board of Trade futures prices are used for wheat. To control for price support programs, we use the higher price between futures prices and national loan rates (Wu et al. 2004). The expected variance of output prices is calculated as where are 0.5, 0.33, and 0.17, respectively (Chavas & Holt 1990;Sckokai & Moro 2006;Wu et al. 2004). , \u2212 is the state-level farm-received price of crop j in year t-k and \u2212 \u22121 is farmers' expectation of harvest output price at planting time in year t-k. All economic variables are normalized by the planting year price index for the other inputs. 19 Climate and Soil Variables Table 2.1 also summarizes the statistics of environmental conditions. Daily Parameterelevation Regression on Independent Slope Model (PRISM) data are used to construct weather variables: growing degree days (GDD), extreme heat degree days (HDD), precipitation, and intensive rainfall. Based on daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the PRISM data, we use  simple method to compute GDD and HDD during the growing season (see Appendix C). GDD and HDD measure the amount of exposure to beneficial heat and harmful heat, respectively. Precipitation is calculated as the sum of total precipitation during the growing season. Intensive rainfall means the number of daily rain events above 25.4 mm during the growing seasons . We assume that farmers' expected weather conditions are the averages of weather conditions over the previous 20 years. State-level growing seasons for corn, soybeans, and wheat are applied (NASS quick stat, USDA 2010). Last, since high soil moisture caused by rainfall during the early spring has negative effects on corn root development, spring rainfall can prompt farmers to plant soybeans instead of corn. Thus, we include April-May precipitation in equations regarding corn and soybeans. In addition to spatial variations of expected weather variables, temporal variation in expected weather variables is useful in assessing the effects of climate on farmers' land use decisions. Figures 2.9 and 2.10 show the changes in expected weather conditions between 2003 19 We construct the price index for the other inputs as = \u2211 , where is the relative weight of the jth input and is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published price paid index of the jth input. The other inputs include several production items, financial fees, and family living expenses (USDA 2011). and 2010. From the figures, we can verify that the amount of intensive rainfall and precipitation increased more in western Iowa, eastern Illinois, and Missouri than in other parts of the Midwest. Also, HDD and GDD during the corn growing season decreased slightly in the Midwest. Soil data are based on the Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO). We include slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), available water capacity (AWC), K-factor, depth to water table, and percentage of organic matter as variables representing soil quality and land characteristics. Slope is the difference in elevation, expressed as a percentage. Ksat measures the permeability of soil, while AWC represents how much water the soil can store. K-factor indicates the susceptibility of soil to water erosion. Depth to water table is the minimum depth above a wet soil layer. Organic matter is the amount of decomposed plant and animal residue in the soil. Since the ARMS Phase III data contain only county-level location information, all climate and soil variables are aggregated to the county. Table 2.2 shows that Midwest farmers' decisions to grow crops are closely related to climate conditions. The estimates in Table 2.2 represent coefficients of a probit model with a sample selection model. First, spring precipitation has negative effects on the decision to grow corn but positive effects on the decision to grow soybeans. This result is because the high soil moisture during the early spring makes farmers delay planting corn and, in the end, may shift their cropping pattern from corn to soybeans. Second, GDD, the beneficial heat, has positive effects on the decision to grow corn, soybeans, and wheat. However, the coefficients on HDD, the harmful heat, in all equations regarding crops choices are negative. Last, an increase in total precipitation during the growing season increases the likelihood of growing corn. However, the results show that an increase in total precipitation decreases the likelihood of growing wheat or soybeans, even though the effect of total precipitation on the probability of growing soybeans is insignificant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Estimation results", "text": "Since corn is a water-intensive crop, farmers are more likely to grow corn when precipitation is sufficient and corn is profitable. The results related to purchasing crop insurance are also shown in Table 2.2. First, the coefficients on intensive rainfall in equations regarding insurance purchases for corn and soybeans are positive, suggesting that farmers expecting frequent intensive rainfall during the growing season are more likely to purchase crop insurance for corn and soybeans. Since intensive rainfall reflects a potential risk of loss, farmers protect their revenue from such risk by purchasing federal crop insurance. Second, an increase in GDD decreases the likelihood of purchasing insurance for soybeans, but HDD positively affects the decision to purchase insurance for soybeans. However, the results show that the effects of GDD and HDD on purchasing federal crop insurance for corn are insignificant. Third, insurance purchases are more likely in areas having less precipitation. As a result, we interpret results regarding heat and precipitation as good weather conditions, including enough precipitation, adequate GDD, and fewer HDD, may give farmers incentive to grow the three crops. However, good weather conditions may also give farmers disincentive to purchase crop insurance because there is less risk of loss caused by harmful weather conditions. Table 2.3 shows the effects of climate conditions on acreage adjustment of farmers among three crops, given their decisions regarding crops to grow and crop insurance purchases. 20 The results show that farmers' response to intensive rainfall and total precipitation during the growing seasons depends on their insurance status. Without crop insurance, corn (soybean) growers are more likely to decrease corn (soybean) acreage when the frequency of intensive rainfall events increases or total precipitation decreases during the growing season. However, the coefficients corresponding to intensive rainfall events (total precipitation) and the interaction term between intensive rainfall (total precipitation) and the crop insurance dummy have opposite directions. The coefficients of interaction terms between crop insurance dummies and climate measures can be interpreted as changes in farmers' behaviors due to crop insurance purchases. The results, thus, indicate that crop insurance makes farmers less sensitive to increases in intensive rainfall events or decreases in total precipitation. Last, as we hypothesized, the results show that total precipitation during the early spring has positive effects on soybean acreage. However, the estimates in Table 2.3 do not consider the effects of climate measures on farmers' decisions regarding crops to grow and crop insurance purchases. Also, the large size of the estimates and units of climate measure are less intuitive to understand the effects of climate conditions on farmers' land allocation decisions. 21 To understand the total effects of climate conditions on farmers' land allocation decisions more clearly, we calculate the average acreage response elasticities to climate conditions based on Equation (10) (see Table 2.4). These elasticities are weighted averages of each acreage response elasticity across our samples based on sampling weights of the ARMS (Arnade & Kelch 2007). 22 First, the results show that GDD has positive 21 The large sizes of coefficients corresponding to weather measures and variances of output prices in Table 2.3 result from two factors. First, explanatory variables in Equation (9) are multiplied by the probability of growing a specific crop or the probability of purchasing crop insurance for the crop. Second, changes in some explanatory variables by one unit implies the huge change in market or environmental conditions. For example, an increase in HDD or variances of output prices by one unit may be unrealistic changes: the average and the standard deviation of HDD are about one (see Table 2.1). Thus, to interpret the results more clearly, we need to account for two factors. In addition to these two factors, the correlation among output prices and state dummies would make the size of coefficient large. 22 To reduce the effects of observations having extreme values on the average marginal effects and acreage response elasticities, we also calculate the trimmed weighted average. To be specific, after calculating marginal effects and acreage response elasticity of climate variables on land allocation of each observation, we exclude values larger than 95% quantile and less than 5% quantile. Especially, in the case of the expected land allocation to wheat, some effects on acreage for the three crops. To be specific, when GDD increases by 1%, corn, soybean, and wheat acreage increases by 1.7%, 3.6%, and 2.6%, respectively. This is intuitive because GDD can be interpreted as beneficial heat for crop development. Farmers who expect sufficient GDD have an incentive to increase acreage for crop production. Second, soybean acreage is negatively affected by HDD, but the effects of the extreme heat are modest: An increase in HDD of 1% decreases soybean acreage by 0.6%. Third, the results show that an increase in precipitation of 1% decreases soybean acreage by 2.9%. However, the results indicate that increases in HDD and precipitation have insignificant effects on corn and wheat acreage. Last, the effects of intensive rainfall events on acreage allocation are insignificant. From Figures 2.9 and 2.10, we can verify the spatial variations in GDD and HDD. Also, Table 2.6 shows differences in the two variables among states. To be specific, the table shows that Illinois has the highest GDD, and the difference in GDD between Illinois and Iowa is approximately 10% of the GDD of Iowa. Indiana has the lowest HDD, and the difference in HDD among three states is larger than 10% of the HDD of Indiana. Also, our data set shows that, in Iowa, variation in GDD among counties is about 5% of the average GDD over Iowa. Previous literature finds a nonlinear relationship between temperature and corn yield (Schlenker & Roberts 2006;Schlenker & Roberts 2009). In particular, Schlenker and Roberts (2009) show that corn yield growth increases gradually only within a certain range of temperature, but, beyond this range, corn yield decreases sharply. Also, the agronomic literature typically represents the effects of temperature on plant growth in terms of cumulative exposure to heat and postulates that plant growth is linear in temperature only within a certain range. GDD and HDD capture this agronomic relationship, and previous literature shows that GDD (HDD) has positive observations have too large the marginal effects of crop insurance purchases to wheat acreage and make the mean and variance of the average acreage response elasticity too large (see Table 2.4). As a result, spatial variations in GDD and HDD may imply differences in productivity of land; our results in Table 2.4 reflect farmers' responses to changes in productivity of land across the Midwest. However, the empirical evidence regarding the effects of GDD and HDD on land allocations is not sufficient and varies among studies. For example,  show that increases in the annual sum of degree days increase the acreage for field crops by 0.5%. Also, Feng, Hennessy, and Miao (2013) show that increases in GDD (precipitation) of one unit of normalized GDD (precipitation) increase the share of corn acreage across the Dakotas by approximately 3%. However, these results do not consider the effects of climate variables on farmers' decisions regarding crops to grow and insurance purchases. To identify the effects of crop insurance on farmers' responses to climate conditions, we separate the acreage response elasticity in Table 2.4 into two parts (see Table 2.5). The first part is the acreage response elasticity to climate conditions without crop insurance (the upper part of Table 2.5). To calculate the estimates in the upper part of Table 2.5, we use the sum of the first two terms in Equation (10) as the marginal effects of climate conditions. The second part is changes in the acreage response elasticity to climate conditions due to crop insurance purchases (the lower part of Table 2.5). We use the sum of the last two terms in Equation (10) as the marginal effects of climate measures when calculating estimates in the lower part of Table 2.5. Last, the estimates in Table 2.5 are weighted averages for all observations based on sampling weights in our data. The results show that, without crop insurance, increases in intensive rainfall events of 1% decrease corn and soybean acreage by 3.6% and 6.4%, respectively. In addition, the results indicate that increases in total precipitation increase crop acreage, even though only the effects of total precipitation on soybean acreage are statistically significant. However, the results regarding the second part show that corn and soybean acreage response elasticity to intensive rainfall events increases by 4.0% and 6.3% due to crop insurance purchases. Also, corn and soybean acreage response elasticity to total precipitation decreases by 4.7% and 14.12%, respectively, after purchasing crop insurance. In sum, from the results in Table 2.4 and Table 2.5, we can verify that crop insurance distorts farmers' incentive to adapt to climate conditions by adjusting their land allocation for crops. Also, less intuitive results regarding total precipitation and intensive rainfall events shown in Table 2.4 reflect the effects of crop insurance on farmers' land allocation. Last, the total effects of federal crop insurance programs on crop acreage are summarized in the last row of Table 2.4. The estimates in Table 2.4 are the averages of percentage change in crop j acreage caused by insurance for crop j. However, since the majority of farmers purchased insurance for all crops they planted, we can consider the results as the acreage response elasticity of crop insurance. The estimates show the significant effects of federal crop insurance on farmers' land allocation decisions: The results show that purchasing crop insurance increases corn and soybean acreage by about 5.1% and 10.7%, respectively. However, the estimates of insurance effects on farmers' land allocation have large variations in the previous literature, and these variations depend on study areas, study periods, estimation methods, and measures of insurance demand. For example, Wu (1999) shows that crop insurance participation changes the share of corn (soybeans) in the Central Nebraska basin from 0.27 to 0.05 (from 0.04 to 0.05), and the size of insurance effects depends on farm size. The simulation results of Wu and Adams (2001) show that a 75% coverage level for revenue protection crop insurance for corn (soybeans) increases corn acreage in the Corn Belt by 9.8% (0.1%). The results of simulation in Goodwin, Vandeveer, and Deal (2004) show that decreases in premium rates of 30% increase corn acreage over the Heartland region only by 0.20%. Compared to previous literature, our result regarding the insurance effect on corn acreage is located within the range of previous findings, but the insurance effect on soybean acreage is larger than results of previous studies. However, it may be difficult to compare our results directly with previous results. To begin with, most of the literature analyzes land use change before the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (ARPA), which means that most previous studies do not account for the effects of changes in subsidy structures after 2000. For example, Goodwin and Smith (2013) find that the effects of insurance are larger for soybean acreage than corn acreage. Also, except for Wu (1999), most studies assume that farmers' decisions regarding crops to grow and crop insurance purchases are independent of farmers' land allocation among crops."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "To deal with the risks caused by unexpected weather conditions, farmers have adopted crop insurance. The federal government introduced federal crop insurance programs to eliminate the need for ad hoc disaster assistance and has motivated farmers to use crop insurance by providing subsidies. In particular, ARPA has ensured that the subsidy rates fall more slowly than premium rates. The purpose of this change is to motivate farmers to increase coverage levels and insured crop acreage. In addition, based on the \"shallow loss\" programs introduced in the 2014 farm bill, farmers can use higher coverage levels. As a result, the cost of subsidies has increased as the program has expanded and, in 2014, the federal government paid $6.2 billion as premium subsidies. However, the benefits of subsidized crop insurance are controversial (Paulson, Babcock, & Coppess 2014). 23 Our results provide evidence regarding the distortions caused by subsidized crop insurance. The conceptual approach shows that crop insurance can weaken farmers' responsiveness to production risk and increase land allocation to insured crops, even when farmers recognize the potential risks of growing insured crops. The analytic results also indicate that the expected utility from growing insured crops can increase as the level of risk increases when subsidy rates and coverage levels are high. These results imply that the subsidy structure after ARPA and higher coverage of \"shallow loss\" programs can increase the distortion of federal crop insurance. Our empirical results also show that federal crop insurance gives disincentive for farmers to adjust their land allocation for potential production risks such as an increase in intensive rainfall events. We thus imagine that subsidized crop insurance programs will make farmers more susceptible to an increase in extreme weather events in the future. An increased potential risk of yield loss from climate change may increase farmers' premium rates and the government's expenditure for crop insurance subsidies.\nWe find that GM corn and its combination with pest scouting have larger effects on corn yield and nitrogen use when these technologies are adopted in fields having low soil productivity. This result indicates that GM corn and information technologies may enable farmers to obtain economic gains from increasing their land use at the extensive margin. This result also shows the importance of GM corn and/or pest scouting adoption in reducing the likelihood of low corn yield that farmers are likely to have in fields having low soil productivity. It is highly likely that fields having low soil productivity have low corn yield. For example, Egli and Hatfield (2014) show the positive relationship between county-level corn yield and NCCPI. Our results indicate that adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting increases corn yield at the lower tail of the yield distribution and decreases the probability of low corn yield. Our conceptual model indicates that technology adoption may increase nitrogen use when technology adoption increases the marginal productivity of nitrogen use. Given that adopting GM corn and information technologies can increase the marginal productivity of nitrogen use, as explained in Section 1, farmers have an incentive to increase nitrogen use to optimize their input use when they adopt these technologies. The empirical results indicate that GM corn and information technologies increase nitrogen use. Increased nitrogen use can result in increases in nutrient loss to surface and groundwater from corn production (Sawyer 2015). In this sense, 23 Table 3.6 shows the marginal effects of adopting yield monitor on corn yield and nutrient management depending on soil productivity. The table shows that the differences in estimates between fields having high soil productivity and fields having low soil productivity are ignorable. benefits from adopting GM corn and information technologies may be limited considering the adverse effects of corn production on regional environmental conditions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "To assess and alleviate harmful climate change impacts, policy makers need to understand farmers' adaptive behavior to local environmental conditions. This study identifies responses of Midwest farmers to climate conditions and federal crop insurance programs by analyzing their cropping patterns. The study has four key findings. First, sufficient precipitation, adequate GDD, and less HDD have positive effects on farmers' decision to grow crops but negative effects on their decision to purchase crop insurance. Intensive rainfall has positive effects on insurance purchases for corn and soybeans. Second, we calculate the overall effects of climate variables on land allocation decisions of Midwest farmers. These effects include climate effects on farmers' decision to grow crops, purchase insurance, and allocate their land to crops at the same time. The results show that a 1% increase in GDD increases corn, soybean, and wheat acreage by 1.7%, 3.6%, and 2.6%, respectively. When HDD increase by 1%, soybean acreage decreases by 0.6%. An increase in precipitation of 1% decreases soybean acreage by 2.9%. However, increases in HDD and precipitation have insignificant effects on corn and wheat acreage. Third, without crop insurance, farmers are more likely to increase corn and soybean acreage when intensive rainfall events decrease and total precipitation increases during the growing seasons. However, our results show that federal crop insurance mitigates farmers' incentive to adopt increases in intensive rainfall events or decreases in total precipitation by adjusting their land use. Fourth, federal crop insurance programs induced Midwest farmers to allocate more acreage to corn and soybeans. The findings in this paper contribute broadly to our understanding of climate change, land allocation, and crop insurance. To be specific, by constructing a simultaneous equation model consisting of decisions to grow crops, purchase crop insurance, and allocate land, our results identify the effects of climate variables on the intensive margin, the extensive margin, and insurance purchases separately. Also, we identify the effects of crop insurance on cropping pattern, and the results can stand as empirical evidence of the unintended policy effects of subsidized crop insurance programs. Last, our results offer one answer to a controversial question: How does crop insurance alter farmers' response to long-term climate risks? The results in this paper have some limitations. First, county-level climate and soil variables fail to capture farm-level spatial heterogeneity of climate and soil. Second, our model heavily depends on distributional assumptions, including independence among crop selections and normality assumptions on error terms. Third, because of the lack of information on historical land use, we do not control for the effects of crop rotation even though we allow for the correlation between decisions on land allocation and crops to grow.

Over the last decade, the adoption of genetically modified (GM) corn and information technologies has increased. We analyze the effects of GM corn, pest scouting, and yield monitoring on corn yield and nutrient management of Midwest farmers. We incorporate a nonlinear endogenous regression approach to control for self-selection bias, and the Agricultural Resource Management Survey is used for estimation. We find that GM corn and its combination with pest scouting increase corn yield and nitrogen use. Also, the effects of GM corn and/or pest scouting depend on soil productivity. Last, the relationship between yield monitoring and pest scouting is complementary in increasing corn yield and nitrogen use.\nTo forecast future land use, researchers need to consider heterogeneous features of projected weather data sets. Also, the land use literature has used different assumptions to construct farmers' expected weather conditions. This study examines the effects of these two uncertainties regarding climate measures on forecasting future land use. Using an out-of-sample forecasting test, we compare the predictive accuracy of 13 linear models depending on five general circulation models (GCMs) and six assumptions regarding expected weather conditions. Our analysis is based on decadal land use data over the Corn Belt, Lake States, and Northern Plains during the last three decades. We find that the forecast land use over three regions and predictive accuracy of models depend on the choice of GCMs and methods of constructing expected weather conditions. However, models consisting of yearly agronomic variables are more stable and have better predictive accuracy than models using monthly climate variables.

We assume that nitrogen is essential in corn production, and the effect of technology adoption on corn production can be captured by incorporating a function \u210e( ) in the production function. Also, we assume that the effects of technology adoption depend on given environmental conditions and characteristics of the farmer ( ), such as soil productivity and human capital. We thus define the production function as = ( , , \u03b5 , \u210e( )), where y is corn yield and \u03b5 is a random variable (Koundouri, Nauges, & Tzouvelekas 2006). Assume that \u2032 > 0 and \u2032\u2032 < 0 for all elements. If we assume only production uncertainty, then the farmer's expected utility maximization problem can be represented as follows: where means a corn price. and mean a nitrogen price and a vector of other input prices, respectively. Then, we can derive the first-order condition for nitrogen use as Equation (2). To illustrate the effects of technology adoption on nitrogen use, assume that the farmer's decisions on technology adoption can be modeled by a binary choice: adopting new technology (\u210e 1 ( )) and using conventional technology (\u210e 0 ( )), Also, assume that the equality in Equation (2) holds at = 0, before adopting new technology. From Equation 2, we can show that, when adopting new technology increases the marginal productivity of nitrogen use, , ,\u03b5 ,\u210e 0 ( )) | = 0, , the farmer will increase nitrogen use up to 1, satisfying , ,\u03b5 ,\u210e 0 ( )) | = 0, = . Also, when technology adoption changes the marginal productivity of agricultural inputs, the optimal input use is changed, and this change may affect corn yield indirectly. Thus, we can express yield gains resulting from technology adoption as 2shows that changes in the marginal productivity of nitrogen (or agricultural inputs) resulting from technology adoption may depend on given conditions.

From the conceptual approach, we can answer our research questions with a simple optimization problem. The model shows that technology adoption can increase nitrogen use and corn yield simultaneously when technology adoption increases the marginal productivity of nitrogen use. In the next section, we attempt to find empirical evidence to test our research hypotheses.\nOur conceptual model is drawn from a classical profit maximization problem of riskneutral farms with land (Chambers & Just, 1989;.  show that the optimal land allocation problem can be represented as: where p means a price vector, z is the vector of given environmental conditions, L is total land, and s , = 1, \u2026 , is the land share allocated to crop i, M denotes the number of crops, and ( , , , 1 , \u2026 , ) means the maximum profit conditional on given land shares ( 1 , \u2026 , ). From Equation (1), the optimal land allocation * ( , , ) is determined at the point where the marginal rent or shadow price of each land use is identical among all crops.  Previous land use literature uses a dual approach to derive land share equations from Equation 2and estimate welfare effects of agricultural policies. Since the purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between land use change and climate conditions, we use a simple linear approximation of * ( , , ) to construct our empirical model. Consider a farmer who allocates his field j to crop i at time t. His land allocation problem can be specified as Equation 31 2 3 where is the vector of output prices, is the vector of given environmental conditions including expected weather measures, variables representing soil quality, and irrigation status. is total cropland, and is unobserved heterogeneity of field j.

We thus specify equations representing farmer i's corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE based on his technology adoption status. Based on this approach, the differences in size and direction of coefficients corresponding to each explanatory variable among the equations can be interpreted as slope changes caused by technology adoption. 5 To control for non-negativity of our outcome variables (Y), we use a log transformation and apply ordinary least squares (OLS) for estimation. However, a log transformation does not account for observations whose outcome variables equal zero. 6 In addition, when the error term is heteroscedastic, the estimate of the expected outcome variables, E(Y|X), based on a log transformation can be biased (Manning & Mullahy 2001;Wooldridge 2010, pp. 740).

The first step is to estimate Equation (3) by using a multinomial logit model to obtain consistent estimates of . Second, we estimate Equation (8) with a Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE). Gourieroux, Monfort, and Trognon (1984) show that a QMLE based on a linear exponential family (LEF) generates consistent estimates when the conditional mean function is correctly specified and its range is identical to the range of the chosen LEF density. The conditional mean function based on an exponential functional form such as Equation 5 Variance estimates from the two-step method are not consistent because variance estimates generated from the second-step do not take into account the variation of first-step estimates.

We adopt a bootstrapping method based on probability weights . That is, we generate 1,000 bootstrap samples based on probability weights and estimate Equations (3), (8), and (9) 1,000 times. The mean and variance of the replicated estimates are used as estimates of parameters and their variances ). 7\nFor estimation, we must account for two features of Equation (3). First, our dependent variables represent mutually exclusive and exhaustive shares of each land use. In addition, the optimal solutions of Equation (2) can be corner solutions, which means the nontrivial proportion of optimal solutions can be 0 or 1. Let X be the vector of explanatory variables in Equation 3, X = {X 1 , \u2026 , X }, except for the unobserved heterogeneity ( ). Then, the features of our model can be described as: If we assume the strict exogeneity of {X | = 1, \u2026 } conditional on c , we can conceptualize the above problem as Equation (4) based on Mullahy (2015). 2 1 ) (0,1) In addition, Mullahy (2015) assumes that the conditional mean of each outcome has a multinomial logit functional form preventing the possibility of predicted shares which are less than 0 or greater than 1. After normalization based on crop M, that is, \u03b2 = \u03b1 = , Equation (5) can be rewritten as To control for unobserved heterogeneity, we assume that ( | , ) = ( | ) where ( |. ) means the conditional distribution of c , and is a vector of redundant and ignorable variables, but a vector of good proxy variables for c . Then, from Wooldridge (2010, pp. 22-24), we derive Equation (7). , ,  where and denote the expectation with respect to c and . X is a fixed value of X , and X , is one of covariates in X . Equation 7means that we can calculate the average partial effects (APE) of each explanatory variable on land use for crop i at time t without integration with respect to c . 3 We use dummies representing major land resource areas (MLRAs) as . 4 After controlling for , we deal with our panel data as repeated cross-sectional data when estimating our model. 5 For estimation, we incorporate the quasi maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) method based on likelihood functions of a multinomial logit model to estimate coefficients consistently (Mullahy, 2105). 6 3 To control for the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in probit models, Mundlak (1978) and Chamberlain (1980) assume that c follows the normal distribution. Their estimated coefficients of probit models are scaled by the variance of c . Thus, the estimates cannot be used directly to calculate the partial effects of each explanatory variable. Our approach has the same disadvantagethat is, even though we do not assume a specific distribution of c and use w instead, the estimated coefficient could be affected by the distribution of c . However, APE is the intuitive way of summarizing partial effects of explanatory variables for nonlinear models. To be specific, in the case of nonlinear models, the partial effects of each explanatory variable depend on the specific value of X , which means APEs are different from individual partial effects, and their directions and sizes are not determined by estimated coefficients alone. Thus, even though we only identify scaled estimates, we can analyze the effects of climate on farmers' land use based on APEs of explanatory variables. 4 Papke and Wooldridge (2008) and Wooldridge (2010, pp 653-654) recommend using the average values of time variant variables in X ( \u0305 ) as to control for the effect of c . However, in our study, since climate variables are highly correlated with their averages, we use dummies representing MLRAs instead of \u0305 . MLRAs are determined by regional water use, land use, and environmental conditions of specific areas. Thus, even though one MLRA covers a larger area than our observations, its use would alleviate the effects on unobserved heterogeneity  To calculate the APE on land use for crop i based on Equation 7, we use the average structural function (ASF) approach (Papke & Wooldridge, 2008). To be specific, given consistent estimates \u03b8 = (\u03b2 , \u03b1 ), = 1, \u2026 , , the APE on land use for crop i at time t can be calculated by taking the derivative or change of Equation (9) with respect to one element of X . Thus, if X , is a continuous variable, then its APE becomes Also, if X , is a discrete variable, then the APE can be represented as where \u0302, \u2212 and ,\u2212 are coefficients and covariates, except for \u0302, and , for i= 1, \u2026 , . . Finally, we average Equation (10) and Equation (11) across t to calculate the effects averaged across time and cross-sectional units. For inference, we cluster observations by MLRA and year and use a cluster bootstrap with a run of 1,000 for three reasons. First, the variance estimates based on Equation (6) are inconsistent (Mullay, 2015). Second, since some part of unobserved heterogeneity is omitted, arbitrary dependence may exist among the dependent variables, which means that variance estimates should be robust for this correlation (Wooldridge, 2010, pp. 654). Clustering by MLRA and year allows spatial dependence between all areas in the same MLRA and year but assumes independence among MLRAs and years. Finally, to calculate variances for the APEs, the iterative method is also used without specific distributional assumptions. As is evident, corn and soybean acreage has expanded to the northwest."}, {"section_title": "Data and model specification", "text": "We use ARMS Phase II and Phase III version 2 (2001III version 2 ( , 2005III version 2 ( , and 2010 data for this study.

The ARMS Phase II data include information about one specific cornfield, such as corn yield and crop management practices for the field. The ARMS Phase III version 2 data contain farmers' financial status and socioeconomic characteristics. We merge two data sets and link production practices of farmers to their individual characteristics. In addition to the rich information in the ARMS data, we incorporate sampling weights accounting for sampling design to generalize our results . However, since the ARMS data are repeated cross-sectional data, it may be difficult to control for the unobserved heterogeneity of each field even though we use field-level information in the data. 10 Also, to merge multiple-year surveys, we assume that the sampling design and population density of samples are invariant across survey years.

In addition, we exclude fields in which manure was applied because the heterogeneous nitrogen content in manure makes it difficult to measure actual nitrogen use for corn production. Last, about 4% of observations did not apply nitrogen for corn production, and we exclude them when we estimate equations for NUE.

Figure 3.1 shows changes in the proportion of corn acreage in which farmers adopted a corresponding technology over three survey years. All estimates in Figure   3.1 are weighted by ARMS weights in calculating proportions; hence, the estimates can be considered as representative proportions of the study area. Figure 3.1 indicates that the adoption of GM corn, pest scouting, and yield monitor have increased over time. In particular, the adoption of GM corn and yield monitor increased considerably in 2005 and 2010. For estimation, we categorize the technologies as GM corn, yield monitor, and pest scouting. However, we assume that adopting yield monitor is a given condition when farmers make decisions regarding nutrient management practices and adoptions of GM corn and/or pest scouting. Yield monitor has become standard equipment on recent models of farm machinery, especially combines (Schimmelpfennig & Ebel 2011). We can imagine that farmers' decisions on yield monitor adoption are less likely to be related to their decisions on nutrient management practices during the growing season. In addition, yield monitor is a durable good. The status of yield monitor adoption is not affected by other factors when farmers have already adopted yield monitor for harvesting corn during previous years. We thus specify our empirical model based on farmers' decisions regarding GM corn and pest scouting adoption. In the case of yield monitor, we include a dummy variable representing adoptions of yield monitor in all equations. To begin with, the table indicates that corn yield and nitrogen use of adopters of GM corn and pest scouting are higher than corn yield and nitrogen use of non-adopters: The differences in corn yield and nitrogen use between the two groups are approximately 24 bushels/acre and 17 pounds/acre, respectively. Also, the table shows that corn yield and nitrogen use of GM corn adopters are larger than corn yield and nitrogen use of non-adopters by approximately 15 bushels/acre and 14 pounds/acre, respectively. However, from Table 3.2, we can verify that there is no difference in corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE between pest scouting adopters and non-adopters. Also, NUE among the four groups are almost identical. This implies that farmers adopting GM corn (and pest scouting) use nitrogen more intensively to increase corn yield. However, differences in outcome variables can be attributed to many factors. To be specific, Table 3.2 indicates that the proportion of irrigated fields among fields of GM corn and pest scouting adopters is about 21%, which is the largest proportion among the four groups. In addition, from the table, we can verify that adopters of GM corn and pest scouting are more likely to apply nitrogen during the previous fall and grow corn continuously than other groups. Last, the field size of adopters of GM corn and pest scouting is larger than the field size of non-adopters by about 26 acres on average. In sum, a simple comparison among the average values of outcome variables may mislead about the economic and environmental implications of technology adoption. In this study, we control for farmers' crop management practices, characteristics of farmers, and environmental conditions during the growing season to identify the effects of technology adoption on corn yield and nutrient management."}, {"section_title": "Determinants of corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE", "text": "Crop management practices and characteristics of farms or fields We include farmers' management practices in equations for corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE: nitrogen application timing, continuous corn production, and irrigation. We include a dummy variable for nitrogen application during the previous fall in equations for nitrogen use and NUE. Fall nitrogen applications have a risk of nitrogen loss from the soil during the winter; thus, farmers applying nitrogen in the fall may try to compensate for nitrogen loss by applying more nitrogen. Continuous corn production increases nitrogen use but decreases corn yield. Continuous corn production requires more nitrogen use than corn production following soybeans because the available soil nutrient is reduced after corn production. In addition, continuous corn production results in a yield reduction compared to corn production following soybeans, referred to as the continuous corn yield penalty (Gentry, Ruffo, & Below 2013). Irrigation can reduce yield loss from drought, and irrigated corn fields generally have higher seeding rates than dryland corn fields. Also, irrigation can facilitate efficient uptake of corn for chemical inputs. For example, irrigation systems can be used to apply agricultural chemicals with water, called chemigation. Irrigated farms thus may have higher corn yield and more incentive to increase nitrogen use to optimize corn yield than non-irrigated farms. As characteristics of fields or farmers, we include field size and variables representing farmers' human capital. Field size is used to control for scale effects on corn yield and nutrient management. The existence of farm machinery, such as center-pivot irrigation systems, can lead to economies of scale. However, the empirical evidence regarding the scale effects on input productivity remain inconsistent (Khanna 2001). For example, increasing the scale of production may make field management difficult and increase the uncertainty regarding productivity within a field and among fields. Human capital is a key factor determining farmers' ability to use the technologies appropriately. In this study, years of farming experience and a dummy variable representing college education are incorporated to control for the effects of human capital on corn yield and nutrient management (Stefanou & Saxena 1988). To control for policies supporting conservation plans, we include a dummy with a value of one for fields under an existing conservation program contract. 14 If conservation plans decrease soil and nutrient loss from corn fields to water bodies, participation in a conservation program may increase the productivity of corn fields. However, participation in a conservation program contract may also indicate that fields are highly erodible. Last, we use year dummies and regional dummies to control for unobserved year-specific events and systematic regional differences. One source of yearly variation is biofuel policies. The In addition, we also use year dummies to control for changes in corn prices and nitrogen prices. Our data set has little spatial variation in output and input prices. 15   bushels/acre and 21 bushels/acre, and the size of the yield effects depends on model specifications and GM traits. Finally, Brookes and Barfoot (2012) report that HT corn increases corn yield in Argentina, Brazil, and the Philippines by 1%-15%. Second, the results show that adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting increases nitrogen use, even though only the effects of GM corn adoption on nitrogen use are statistically significant. An intuitive explanation is based on our conceptual model. That is, our conceptual model indicates that adopting new technology can increase nitrogen use when it increases marginal productivity of nitrogen use. Thus, increases in nitrogen use as a result of adopting GM corn may reflect increases in the marginal productivity of nitrogen use due to adopting GM corn. 19 Third, we find that adopters of GM corn and/or pest scouting do not achieve gains in nitrogen use efficiency. Moreover, Table 3.4 indicates that increases in nitrogen use caused by pest scouting adoption are larger than the yield effects, and thus pest scouting increases NUE by 0.3 pounds/one bushel of corn. This result may reflect the interaction between nutrient management and weed management. To be specific, the improvement in early season corn growth with additional nitrogen use results in greater leaf area, biomass, and height, which enhances the competitive ability of corn against weeds (Evans et al. 2003b). Thus, if pest scouting weeds is adopted for weed management, farmers may have an incentive to increase nitrogen use to decrease yield loss due to weed competition. Table 3.4 shows the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting on corn yield and nutrient management conditional on soil productivity. The effects of GM corn and/or pest scouting adoption on corn yield and nutrient management depend on soil productivity (Fuglie & Bosch 1995;Khanna 2001). To identify the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting conditional on soil productivity, we separate fields into two groups: fields having NCCPI-CS higher than 0.5 and fields having NCCPI-CS lower than 0.5. Considering that NCCPI-CS is only for dryland fields, we exclude irrigated fields when we estimate our model and calculate Equation 9for Table 3.4. 21 From Table 3.4, we find that the yield effects of GM corn and/or pest scouting for fields having low soil productivity are statistically significant and larger than those for productive fields. Adopters of GM corn (pest scouting) achieve yield gains of approximately 16.6 bushels/acre (18.6 bushels/acre) by incorporating the technology for fields having NCCPI-CS less than 0.5. Also, the results indicate that adopting GM corn and pest scouting increase corn yield for less productive fields by approximately 31.4 bushels/acre. However, for fields having high NCCPI-CS, the yield effects of pest scouting and its combination with GM corn are insignificant, except for GM corn adoption. In the case of nutrient management, the results indicate that the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting on nitrogen use for fields having low soil quality are statistically significant and larger than those for productive fields. However, the results show that the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting on nitrogen use for productive fields are statistically insignificant. These result may reflect that the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting on the marginal productivity of nitrogen use in fields having low soil productivity are positive and larger than those in fields having high soil productivity. Thus, farmers may be more likely to increase nitrogen use for fields having low soil productivity. 20 For example, when corn yield is an increasing and concave function of soil productivity, the yield effects of technology adoption on productive fields may be smaller than the effects of technology adoption on fields having low soil productivity. Conversely, field-level information increases the productivity of nitrogen by decreasing nitrogen use on marginal areas. 21 To control for the effects of continuous corn production, we also calculate the estimates in Table 3.4 after excluding fields producing corn continuously (see Appendix B). The results show that excluding fields producing corn continuously has modest effects on the results. Yield monitor generates information regarding corn yield distribution, soil conditions, and results of crop management practices during the previous year. Farmers have used this information to improve the profitability of their crop management systems by comparing corn yield depending on corn variety, agricultural technology, and chemical use. However, the effectiveness of information generated from yield monitor may vary according to its combination with other technology. For example, assume that the variation in corn yield in fields in which GM corn is planted is smaller than the variation in corn yield in fields in which conventional varieties are planted. Then, information on corn yield distribution over the fields may be less useful for farmers planting GM corn than farmers planting conventional varieties. 22 We measure the effect of yield monitor on corn yield and nutrient management and test the relationship between yield monitoring and other technologies. The estimates in Table 3.5 indicate the marginal effects of yield monitor on corn yield, nitrogen use, and NUE conditional on GM corn and/or pest scouting adoption. From the table, we can verify that adopting yield monitor has positive effects on corn yield and nitrogen use, even though the effects of yield monitor adoption on corn yield and nitrogen use are statistically insignificant when it is used with GM corn. The results show that yield monitor increases corn yield when it is used alone by 8.2 bushels/acre. When yield monitor is incorporated with GM corn and pest scouting, it increases corn yield by 8.9 bushels per acre. Also, we find that the effects of yield monitor combined with pest scouting are larger than those of any other combination of yield monitor and other technology. Yield monitor adoption increases corn yield and nitrogen use of pest scouting adopters by 16.8 bushels/acre and 22 Previous literature also argues that the value of information increases when the uncertainty regarding farm management increases (Feder 1979;Babcock & Blackmer 1992;Fuglie & Bosch 1995;Koundouri, Nauges, & Tzouvelekas 2006). 14.6 pounds/acre, respectively. This result implies that the effects of adopting yield monitor on corn yield and nutrient management are positively correlated to adopting pest scouting. 23"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Genetic improvement and advanced crop management practices have been major contributing factors to corn yield growth in the U.S. after the 1930s (Duvick 2005). During the last decade, adoption of GM corn, pest scouting, and yield monitor increased significantly. However, only a limited number of studies have investigated the economic and environmental implications of adopting these technologies. This study identifies the effects of adopting GM corn, pest scouting, and yield monitor on corn yield and nutrient management of Midwest farmers. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, adopting GM corn increases corn yield and nitrogen use by 13 bushels/acre and 16 pounds/acre, respectively. Adopting the combination of GM corn and pest scouting has larger effects on corn yield and nitrogen use than adopting only one technology. Second, the effects of adopting GM corn and/or pest scouting on corn yield and nitrogen use are larger for fields having low soil productivity. Third, the effects of adopting yield monitor on corn yield and nitrogen use are significant when farmers adopt yield monitor and pest scouting at the same time. A major limitation of this study is based on the structure of the ARMS data. Our data are repeated cross-sectional data and include only three survey years. Thus, we may not be controlling for unobserved characteristics, even though we use field-level information and the endogenous switching regression model. Also, spatial variations in price variables are too small to identify price effects on corn yield and nutrient management. Finally, our results are based on short time periods, and they may be very sensitive to year specific events. However, we do not check the robustness of our results based on each survey year because of the lack of information regarding non-adopters in 2005 and 2010. Note: Estimates on the percentages of acres are based on weighted sum. The weights are calibrated so that the sum of planted acres for corn based on the survey data matches the NASS published estimates of planted corn acreage for each survey year.

First, we find that climate uncertainty has large effects on acreage response elasticity to expected weather conditions and forecasting results. We also find that forecast land use and acreage response elasticity depend on methods of forming farmers' expectations regarding weather variables, even though the effects of changes in methods of forming farmers' expectations regarding weather variables are smaller than the effects of climate uncertainty. Second, the results show that models including monthly climate variables are sensitive to the choice of GCM and the choice of how to form expected weather conditions. However, the predictive accuracy of models having yearly agronomic variables is more robust to changes in methods of forming farmers' expectations regarding weather variables. Third, our results show heterogeneous responses to climate changes among the three regions and changes in regional distribution of crop production. We find that acreage response elasticity to environmental variables differs among the three regions. Also, forecasting results show that corn and soybean acreage will expand to the northwest. Specifically, the forecasting results based on the best model show that corn and soybean acreage in the Corn Belt will decrease from about 43% to 41% on average. However, the model predicts that corn and soybean acreage in the Lake States will increase from 20% to 25%. Last, we find that corn acreage in areas close to the border between Iowa and Minnesota will increase, even though the intensity of corn acreage in the Corn Belt will decrease slightly. Our results have certain limitations. The first limitation of our forecasting results is not accounting for the effects of farmers' adaptation and technology development in agriculture. That is, farmers have many adaptation options from self-insurance to adopting biotechnologies, and we can expect that damage from climate change can be partially mitigated through their adaptation efforts (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, & Shaw, 1994). Also, technology innovation, such as droughttolerant corn and precision agriculture, can reduce farmers' susceptibility to climate change. Second, the dynamic relationship between regional land use and climate conditions is important in forecasting land use. The interactions between land use and climate conditions are well recognized in climatology Mendelsohn & Dinar, 2009;. The land surface of the central US is a key factor in determining its climate conditions. Changes in agricultural land use over large areas feed back into the water cycle through changes in transpiration, evaporation, and runoff. These changes, in turn, affect surface energy balances and provide the atmosphere with additional water vapor for precipitation. Conversely, farmers alter their land use in response to changes in climate conditions to maximize their farm operating profit.

However, we use only one emission scenario (RCP 4.5) because climate change during the next 25 years is predicted to be the same regardless of the emission scenario (McCarl, 2015). To test the influence of the method for constructing expected weather conditions on forecasting results, we construct expected weather variables based on six scenarios. The first three scenarios assume that information regarding weather conditions can decay at three different rates, 0.925, 0.95, and 0.975, and expected weather conditions are the weighted averages of weather conditions over the previous 30 years. 9 Figure 4.6 shows the weights used to construct the expected weather conditions based on different decay rates. From the figure, we can verify that as the decay rates decrease the years closer to a specific study year have larger weights. The remaining three scenarios assume that farmers' expected weather conditions are the simple average values of weather conditions over the previous 10, 20, and 30 years. In addition, we set 13 models having different specifications based on five popular weather variables: average temperature, precipitation, growing degree days (GDD), extreme heat degree days (HDD), and intensive rainfall (see Table 4.2). 10 In the case of intensive rainfall, we include three measures: the number of daily rain events above 25.4 mm and above 76.2 mm per year (or month) and the fraction of precipitation (mm) during the 10 wettest days per year Kunkel et al., 2013). As a result, we construct 30 scenarios based on five GCMs and six ways of constructing farmers' expected weather conditions. Also, we evaluate 13 models per each scenario based on their predictive accuracy. Finally, we choose the best model 9 We assume that information at time t-1 ( \u22121 ) is less valuable than information ( ) at time t. To be specific, we assume that = I \u22121 , where is a decaying rate. Based on this assumption, we construct of farmers' expected weather condition ( ) as = \u2211 \u2212 . 10 Snyder (1985) is used to construct GDD and HDD with an upper bound of 34 \u00baC and lower bound of 8 \u00baC. per each GCM and use it for forecasting. For monthly weather conditions, we include March through September. 11 Last, to control for soil quality, we include the National Commodity Crop Productivity Index -Overall (NCCPI-all), silt percentage, sand percentage, representative slope, available water storage within crop root zone depths (RZAWS), and soil organic carbon (SOC). The NCCPIall is used to control for time-invariant and average soil productivity of each cell . Representative slope is the difference in elevation between two points expressed as a percentage of the distance between those points. SOC is the carbon stored in soil organic matter and the main source of energy for soil microorganisms. Soil texture is categorized by sand, silt, and clay based on the size of soil particles. In this study, we include silt percentage and sand percentage to account for soil texture. RZAWS is the maximum amount of available water in the soil within crops' root zones for crop development.

First, our model specification is designed to estimate conditional means of dependent variables. In addition, single-value point forecasts are useful to identify the effects of uncertainties regarding climate measures through comparison. We thus focus only on farmers' expected land allocation in 2030 conditional on expected weather conditions, not the distribution of future land use. 12 Second, we have to choose an appropriate measure of predictive accuracy, called the scoring function. Gneiting (2011) points out the importance of consistency between the scoring function and the distributional feature of a forecaster which researchers want to estimate; he suggests that a scoring function having Bregram form is a consistent measure for mean forecasting (see Equation 12). where \u0302 is the point forecast, and y means the verifying observation. is the convex function with gradient \u2032. When we assume that (\u0302) =\u03022, then Equation 12becomes the squared error. However, from Equation 12, we can verify that scoring functions commonly used in the literature such as the absolute error and the relative error are not consistent in forecasting the mean of the predictive distribution. We can then extend Equation (12) to the multivariate case (Gneiting, 2011). That is, we can use the squared Euclidean norm as and estimate the predictive accuracy of our models. We use the out-of-sample forecasting test (the holdout or validation estimator) to measure prediction errors and avoid the risk of selecting an over-fitted model specification. The validation estimator is a straightforward measure to estimate out-of-sample prediction errors and assesses forecasting models based on an appropriate scoring function. The advantage of this approach is that it can be applied to a wider range of model selection problems with few assumptions regarding the true underlying model: The training samples and the validation samples follow an identical distribution and the training samples are independent of the validation samples (Arlot & Celisse, 2010). To use this approach, we assume that land use in the 2000s is independent of land use in the 1980s and 1990s, but land use in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s is identically distributed after controlling for the effects of the explanatory variables we use. We separate observations based on decades and use observations in the 2000s as a validation set. Last, we access forecasting models based on the following scoring function. where N is the total number of observations in a test set, and M is the number of crops. is acreage for crop i in cell j at time t, and \u0302 is its predicted value."}, {"section_title": "Results of out-of-sample forecasting test and land use in 2030", "text": "We incorporate the out-of-sample forecasting test to find the model having the most stable and best predictive accuracy for each GCM.

Specifically, when Model M7 consisting of monthly 13 When forecasting results have large variations within a GCM, our approach may be considered as \"cherry picking\". However, Table 4.11 shows that forecasting results within a GCM is small when we use Model M3 for estimation and prediction. Also, we find that there is no significant difference in forecasting results based on Model M3 when we use only one assumption on expected weather conditions, such as climate normal, for forecasting among GCMs. climate variables is incorporated to forecast land use in 2030, we find that the standard deviation within a GCM becomes larger than the standard deviation within a GCM based on Model M3 (see Table 4.6). These results imply that the effects of uncertainty regarding farmers' expected weather conditions may depend on model specifications. Also, from the results, we can infer that climate uncertainty and uncertainty regarding farmers' expected weather conditions should be considered at the same time to make forecasting results more credible, especially when we use models based on monthly climate conditions. From Table 4.5, we also verify that the direction of land use change among GCMs is identical. The table indicates that Model M3 predicts that corn acreage in the Corn Belt will decrease from 23% to 20% on average, but the model predicts that soybean acreage in the Corn Belt will increase from 20% to 21% on average. In the case of the Lake States, the model predicts large increases in corn and soybean acreage: Model M3 predicts that corn acreage in the Lake States will increase from 11% to 17% on average, and it forecasts an increase in soybean acreage in the Lake States from 8% to 9%. These results reflect the trend in Figure 4.2: Corn and soybean production has expanded to the northwest. 14 For estimation, we use 30-year averages when we construct expected weather conditions. From the results, we can verify that the variations in estimates in these tables are larger than the variations in estimates in Tables 4.7, 4.9, and 4.11.

To identify each item during processing, two additional fields are included: 5 digit FIPS code (Federal Information Processing System code) and identifier merging 5 digit FIPS code, planting year, and item identifier. Planting and harvest data is first filtered to non-null FIPS entries to remove crop reporting district data and only data in the period of analysis. NASS data is not recorded with the same attributes everywhere; in some states they break crop acreage into 'Irrigated' and 'Non-Irrigated' categories and some crops (corn and sorghum) are broken into 'Silage' and 'Grain' categories. For consistent calculations, all data are assigned into Irrigated and Non-Irrigated categories and total crop acreage. If data are classified into 'Grain' or 'Silage' categories, the data is placed into the corresponding category. However, if no distinguisher is given, it is placed into the 'Grain' category as that is the majority of acres of each crop. Also, if 'Irrigated' or 'Non-Irrigated' categories are present, the data is placed into the appropriate category. But if no identifier is found, the acres are placed into the 'Non-Irrigated' category. Planted acreage still transpires, even if the crop is not harvested. Planted acreage is the preferred method of estimating crop coverage in a county. We primarily want to work with planted acreage data but this is not available for all years and all crops. Thus harvested acreage is only used to estimate planted acreage when data is not available. The data at which planted acreage is available varies by crop and state, but generally starts being available in the 1950s to 1970s.

This dissertation can be extended in several meaningful directions. First, analyzing the dynamic relationship between agricultural production and regional environmental conditions would be useful in understanding the environmental implications of climate change and technology adoption. For example, as discussed in Chapter 4, land use change greatly affects regional climate conditions, and changes in climate conditions alter agricultural productivity of land use. Second, accounting for the effect of asymmetric information on resource management may make our results more general. Our conceptual model in Chapter 2 does not assume information asymmetry, and a simple analytic model in Chapter 3 assumes risk-neutrality. However, farmers' moral hazard and limited information regarding technology should affect farm management decisions. Finally, technology adoption is one way to mitigate adverse climate effects, and climate change effects depend on available technologies. By analyzing the relationship between climate conditions and technology adoption, we can measure the climate change effects and effects of technology adoption on farm management decisions more comprehensively."}]
