However, the respondents are asked to also include activities of \"other adults in your household\" in the question wording. Thus, the \"parent involvement\" term used in this report also includes activities of adult siblings and other relatives or nonrelatives residing in the child's household. Since other NCES reports show that parent-school participation is higher during the elementary school years (Noel, Stark, and Redford 2013;McQuiggan and Megra 2017), this brief focuses on elementary school children's parents and some barriers to participation in certain activities at school. Readers should keep in mind that parents can participate in their children's schooling in other ways, such as communicating with their child's teachers, that are not discussed in this report.  The specific cutoffs for low (0-3 activities), moderate (4-6 activities), and high (7 or more activities) involvement were based on the distribution of the number of times a parent or another adult in the household had gone to a meeting or participated in activities at the child's school. Each category accounts for roughly one-third of the sample size. Although alternative methods are available, such as using continuous values instead of specific cutoffs, these cutoffs were used to ensure there were sufficient samples in each category to produce reliable estimates and provide substantively meaningful size groupings, as well as to make the language throughout the report easier to follow. These cutoffs and labels were not created based on prior research and should not be interpreted as what are acceptable amounts of effective parent-school involvement based on evidence-based research."}, {"section_title": "Level of parent-school involvement", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Measuring Parent-School Involvement-Continued", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Parent-school involvement activities", "text": "The brief estimates parents' involvement in various school activities using the following question: \"Since the beginning of this school year, have you or the other adults in your household\u2026 \u2022 attended an open house or a back-to-school night? \u2022 attended a meeting of a PTA, PTO, or Parent-Teacher Organization? \u2022 gone to a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference with {CHILD}'s teacher or meeting with {CHILD}'s teacher? \u2022 attended a school or class event, such as a play, sports event, or science fair? \u2022 served as a volunteer in {CHILD}'s classroom or elsewhere in the school?\""}, {"section_title": "Barriers to parent-school involvement", "text": "In addition to asking parents about their participation in school activities, the ECLS-K:2011 asked parents about the barriers that made it difficult for them to participate, using the following question: \"This year, have the following reasons made it harder for you to participate in activities at {CHILD}'s school? \u2022 inconvenient meeting times? \u2022 no child care keeps your family from going to school meetings or events? \u2022 family members can't get time off from work? \u2022 problems with safety going to the school? \u2022 the school does not make your family feel welcome? \u2022 problems with transportation to the school? \u2022 you don't hear about things going on at school that you might want to be involved in?\" Using the responses to these ECLS-K:2011 questions, the analyses in this brief examine parents' participation in specific school activities, and the barriers they face to participation, by their level of reported parent-school involvement.
