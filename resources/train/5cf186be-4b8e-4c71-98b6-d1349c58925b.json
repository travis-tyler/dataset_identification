By 1997, that figure had fallen to 25 percent for doctoral scientists and engineers in the education sector.' An analysis in Science and Engineering Indicators.. 2000 concluded that if current retirement patterns continue, the number of retirements among workers with science and engineering (S&E) degrees, especially those with doctoral degrees, will increase over the next 10-15 years. Even with these retirement patterns, the average age of this group will continue to rise unless there are large increases in degree production.4  Press, 1992). Examining the relationship between age and ability to do scientific work, Stephan and Levin reached two main conclusions. First, scientists write less as they age, though this effect is not great for average (versus exceptionally productive) doctoral scientists. Second, there is a stronger relationship between age and exceptional contributions to science, with most such contributions being made before age 40 (pp. 156-7).

The SDR data also facilitate comparison of these characteristics between younger scientists and engineers and those of their older colleagues. This report presents selected results, derived primarily from the 1997 SDR, which illuminate certain labor force characteristics of doctoral scientists and engineers for different age groups. Particular attention is paid to those aged 55 and older. Initiated in 1973, the SDR is a longitudinal demographic survey of science and engineering doctorate holders conducted every two years for the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other Federal agencies. The SDR database contains information on various educational and work-related characteristics of scientists and engineers, which can be compared for different age groups. The sampling frame for the SDR is the Doctoral Records File (DRF), a census of all research doctorates earned in the U.S. since 1920. The 1997 SDR sample included 54,100 doctoral-level scientists and engineers who were recipients of doctoral degrees in a science or engineering field from a U.S. institution between January 1942 and June 1996, aged 75 or younger, and residing in the U.S. during the week of April 15, 1997. The estimated size of this population is 582,080. The following results, unless noted, are derived from the 1997 SDR database. A limited number of comparisons are made with results from the 1993 and 1995 SDR's as well as with relevant 1997 data from NSF's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) database. SESTAT is an integrated information system containing employment, education, and demographic data on both doctoral and non-doctoral (i.e., those whose highest degree was a bachelor's or master's degree) scientists and engineers in the United States.' In addition, differences in results among the three principal employ- This report aims to shed light on the following questions about the characteristics of U.S. doctoral scientists and engineers: 1. What is the age distribution of scientists and engineers by labor force status and employment sector? Do these differ according to field of doctoral study? 2. How does labor force status such as not being employed and looking for work, or working parttime but wanting full-time vary with age? 3. How do factors that might be related to labor force status (including retirement) vary with age? Factors explored in the survey include buyout offers, employer-provided health benefits, and level ofjob satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "How does productivity vary with age? Factors", "text": "examined include rates of publication and patent application activity.' There appears to be no firm definition of what is meant by \"older\" scientists and engineers. Within the context of this report, \"older\" generally refers to those 55 years and up. However, where the data warrant, other age groupings are utilized, which may commence at an age greater than"}, {"section_title": "55.", "text": "In this report, doctoral scientists and engineers are defined as individuals having doctoral degrees in one of five science and engineering fields: computer and mathematical sciences; life and related sciences; physical and related sciences, social and related sciences; and engineering.' The analysis does not focus on occupations. 61n the three-sector employment summary utilized in analyzing SDR results, the education sector consists largely of universities and other institutions of higher education. The industry sector contains large and small businesses, as well as self-employed scientists and engineers. 'To date, information on patents and publications is only available in the 1995 SDR. 'For the limited number of comparisons with scientists and engineers whose highest degree was a bachelor's or a master's degree, as obtained from the SESTAT database, a sixth degree field category, non-science and engineering degree, was included in the degree totals for those two degree levels. This category in SESTAT includes individuals working in science and engineering occupations. For further information, see Kannankutty and Wilkinson, note 5.  Table 1 shows the labor force status of doctoral scientists and engineers by age. For ages 54 and younger, the employment rate was about 96 percent. For older age groups, the employment rate was lower, due to doctoral scientists and engineers leaving the labor force. However, for doctoral scientists and engineers aged 65-69, about half (53 percent) were still working. At 70-75, 9The term \"employed\" includes those who worked for pay or profit during the survey reference week. \"Unemployed\" refers to those who did not have work during that week, but who actively looked for work during the previous four weeks. This population includes those temporarily laid off. \"Not in the labor force\" includes those who were not designated as either employed or unemployed during the reference week. These definitions were adopted for the NSF SESTAT surveys from Bureau of Labor Statistics definitions. See http: / /stats.bls.gov /cps /cps faq.htm. \"Unless otherwise noted, all differences stated in this report are significant with a 95-percent confidence interval. Significant tests were performed with a generalized variance function (GVF) model, using parameters available for SDR data sets or for SESTAT data sets for specific years. \"Ninety-four percent confidence level.  (table 2). The largest differences between age groups for both the industry and education sectors were between scientists and engineers aged 60-64 and 65-69 on one hand, and those aged 70-75 on the other. For those aged 70-75, the percentage working in industry, including the self-employed (49 percent), was considerably greater than in the 60-64 and 65-69 age groups (36 percent for both). In contrast, the percentage of employed doctoral scientists and engineers aged 70-75 working in the 'Unlike the SESTAT population (which includes those with a bachelor's or a master's degree as their highest degree), the population sampled for the SDR is restricted to those who earned doctorates from U.S. institutions. However, the differences between SDR results and those derived from the doctoral component of SESTAT are not large enough to affect the comparisons presented in this report. education sector (43 percent) was smaller than for those ages 60-64 (54 percent) and 65-69 (56 percent). This result may reflect the tendency of retirees from educational institutions to continue to work in industry or be selfemployed as consultants or in some other capacity. However, when the results are differentiated further by full-time versus part-time employment, the picture changes somewhat, as will be discussed below in connection with table 3. The incidence of part-time work is much higher for those over 59, and particularly for those over 64 (figure 1). Part-time workers constituted about 5 to 7 percent of employed doctoral scientists and engineers aged 59 or younger, about 30 percent of those 65-69 and nearly half (48 percent) of those 70-75. Thus, the part-time doctoral science and engineering labor force has a larger proportion of older workers than the full-time labor force. Those 55 or older constituted 45 percent of part-time science and engineering doctoral employees, compared with only 24 percent of all such full-time workers. The distribution of part-time doctoral science and engineering workers across the three principal employment sectors (education, government, and industry) was roughly the same for those aged 65-75 as for those 64 or younger (table 3). However, among full-time workers, older doctoral scientists and engineers were more likely to be employed in the education sector and less likely to be employed in industry. For doctoral scientists and engineers aged 65-75 and employed in industry, the ratio   Table 3 also illustrates aspects of self-employment as the primary employment for doctoral scientists and engineers. Some 14 percent of those aged 65-75 who were employed were self-employed, compared with 4 percent of those 64 and younger, indicating that selfemployment, such as consulting work, constitutes a more significant aspect of employment for older workers. More than half (57 percent) of self-employed doctoral scientists and engineers aged 65-75 worked part time, versus about a third (32 percent) of those 64 and younger."}, {"section_title": "A previous analysis summarized in Science and", "text": "Engineering Indicators: 2000 using 1997 SESTAT data found that those scientists and engineers with doctorates tended to continue to work full time to more advanced ages than their counterparts with bachelor's or master's as their highest degree.13 By age 63, half of scientists and engineers with bachelor's or master's degrees as their highest degree were no longer working full time whereas for doctoral scientists and engineers, this 50percent mark was not reached until age 66, three years later. By age 70, about 20 percent of doctoral scientists and engineers were still working full time, compared with 10 percent of scientists and engineers with bachelor's or master's degrees as their highest degree. The distribution of all employed doctoral scientists and engineers by field of doctoral degree was similar for those 64 and younger and for those 65 to 75 years old (table 4). Among those working part time, the distribution by field of degree showed that a larger proportion of those aged 65-75 had doctoral degrees in the physical sciences (26 percent) than did the younger doctoral scientists and engineers (14 percent). In contrast, a smaller proportion of part-time employees aged 65-75 had doctoral degrees in the social sciences (38 percent) than did younger doctorates (48 percent)."}, {"section_title": "PART -TIME WORK", "text": "Overall, a greater proportion of doctoral scientists and engineers working part time wanted full-time work than did part-time workers whose highest degree were bachelor's or master's degrees (table 5). For example, for scientists and engineers aged 35-49 working part time, 28 percent of those with doctorates wanted full-time work, compared with 15 percent with master's degrees and 12 percent with bachelor's degrees as their highest degree. The percentage of doctoral scientists and engineers working part time but wanting full-time work ranged from 24-34 percent for age groups up to 59, dropping steadily thereafter to about 10 percent for those aged 70-75 (table  5). Overall, some 9,650 doctoral scientists and engineers, constituting 24 percent of those employed part time, wanted full-time work. For those aged 60-75, there were 1,670 doctoral scientists and engineers, 13 percent of those working part time, who wanted full-time employment. Doctoral scientists and engineers aged 65-75 most frequently stated that retirement or semi-retirement was the reason they were working part time (77 percent),'4 followed by not needing or wanting to work full-time '4A related result from a previous study indicates that of the doctoral scientists and engineers aged 63-70 who reported having \"retired,\" some 13.9 and 17.6 percent continued to work part and full time, respectively.

For those aged 55-59, 19 percent had received a buyout offer and 31 percent of those receiving an offer had accepted it. A crossover pointat which half of those receiving an offer accepted itwas reached for the group aged 60-64. About one-third of doctoral scientists and engineers aged 65-69 had received a buyout offer and 72 percent accepted. For employed doctoral scientists and engineers 60 or older who ever received a buyout offer, those currently in industry were considerably more likely to have accepted (67 percent) than those in education (36 percent) or government (22 percent) (table 6). It should be kept in mind that reported buyouts may be cumulative and someone who responds within a given age group and employment sector may have received a buyout offer when they were previously in a younger age group and working in different employment sector. For all (employed and not-employed) scientists and engineers 60 or older, a somewhat higher percentage of   those with doctoral degrees (30 percent) had received a buyout offer sometime during their careers than those whose highest degree were bachelor's (23 percent) or master's (24 percent) degrees. However, the percentage of those in this age group receiving buyout offers that actually accepted the offers was lower for scientists and engineers with doctorates (65 percent) than it was for those whose highest degree was a master's (78 percent) or bachelor's (80 percent) degree."}, {"section_title": "HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS", "text": "Health insurance benefits may be related to scientists' and engineers' employment decisions. Health insurance costs are on the rise and may constitute a major expense for older or retired workers. Over 90 percent of employed doctoral scientists and engineers aged 64 or younger had health insurance benefits made available to them that were at least partially paid for by their employers (table 7).\" Older doctoral scientists and engineers had substantially lower proportions with health insurance benefits made available to them: 79 percent for those aged 65-69, and 58 percent for those aged 70-75. These smaller percentages may be attributable to older scientists and engineers being more likely to receive Medicare benefits, to work part time or be self-employed, to have benefits from a previous position, or to have spouses with benefits covering both. Across employment sectors, older doctoral scientists and engineers working in industry (which includes the self-employed) were less likely to have health benefits "}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "\"The survey question was as follows: \"Concerning your principal job during the week of April 15, were any of the following benefits available to you, even if you chose not to take them?\" One of four multiple response (Yes-No) items was: \"Health insurance that was at least partially paid for by your employer.\" 9 13 partially funded by their employer than those in education or government. For those 65 or older, half (50 percent) working in the industry had employer-provided health benefits available to them, compared with three-quarters (75 percent) in government and 84 percent in education. This latter result also may reflect the higher tendency of older doctoral scientists and engineers employed in education and government to be in full-time employment. For all age groups, doctoral scientists and engineers were more likely to have access to health benefits at least partially paid for by their employers than their counter-parts with their highest degree at the bachelor's or master's level (table 7).

In 1997, greater percentages of employed doctoral scientists and engineers in older age groups expressed satisfaction with their jobs than those in younger age groups. For example, while 71 percent of those 65 or older were \"very satisfied\" with their jobs, this level of satisfaction was reported by 50 percent of those 54 or younger. This distinction was less pronounced if those at least \"somewhat satisfied\" are also considered. There were 89 percent of scientists and engineers aged 49 or younger very or somewhat satisfied with their jobs, compared with 96 percent of those 65 or older."}, {"section_title": "PUBLICATIONS AND PATENTS", "text": "Two indicators readily derivable from 1995 SDR data may be used to illuminate the relationship between the productivity of doctoral scientists and engineers and their age. The 1995 SDR collected information on two research outputs that may be used as a proxy to measure the productivity of doctoral scientists and engineers, namely publications and patents. The indicators examined in this report are the article publication rate and the patent activity rate. The article publication rate (APR) is defined as the percentage of doctoral scientists and engineers in a given age group who authored or co-authored at least one paper accepted for publication in a refereed journal between April 1990 and April 1995. For employed doctoral scientists and engineers, the APR had progressively lower values for older age groups (table 8). For example, the APR of doctoral scientists and engineers aged 60-75 was only 40 percent as large as the value for the group aged 35-44. If only those employed doctoral scientists and engineers who were in the education sector are considered, the fall-off was more gradual: the APR for those aged 60-75 was 70 percent of that for the group aged 35-44. Previous analysis has indicated that doctoral scientists and engineers in the education sector who published less frequently than their peers were more likely to leave fulltime employment's For doctoral scientists and engineers aged 51-65, those who did not publish at all left full-time academic employment at four-year institutions between 1995 and 1997 at a rate more than twice that for those publishing six or more articles. The patent activity rate (PAR) is defined as the percentage of doctoral scientists and engineers in a given age group named as an inventor on at least one U.S. patent application from April 1990 to April 1995.'9 For employed doctoral scientists and engineers, the PAR also had lower values for older age groups but the decline in values was somewhat more gradual than for the article publication rate. For doctoral scientists and engineers aged 60-75, the PAR was about half (47 percent) that of the group aged 35-44 and about two-thirds (67 percent) of that for the group aged 45-59. If only employed doctoral scientists and engineers in the education sector are considered, the patent activity rate for those aged 65-75 was about the same as for all doctoral scientists and engineers in education (7 percent versus 6 percent, respectively). In contrast, the article publication rate for those aged 65-75 (61 percent) was smaller than for all age groups combined (78 percent). Thus, there is some indication that, unlike publications, patent output within academe may not decline with age.2\u00b0S"}, {"section_title": "UMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This report has presented information on educational and work-related activities, and characteristics of doctoral scientists and engineers as a function of age using data from the 1997 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). During the mid-1990s, there was a continued trend towards aging of this population. Furthermore, higher percentages of older doctoral scientists and engineers continued working than scientists and engineers whose highest degree were bachelor's or master's degrees. In 1997, about half of those 65 to 69 and about a quarter of '9Additional information in the 1995 SDR is available on numbers of patents granted as well as numbers commercialized.

Those with bachelor's or master's degrees as their highest degree who were not employed were less likely to be looking for work than those with doctorates. Employed doctoral scientists and engineers in industry at 60 years of age and older were much more likely to state that they had accepted a buyout offer sometime in the past than those working in government or education. However, doctoral scientists and engineers 60 years of age and older were less likely to accept a buyout offer they had received than those with bachelor's or master's as their highest degree. Older doctoral scientists and engineers in industry were less likely to have had health benefits available to them than their counterparts in education or government. Higher percentages of doctoral scientists and engineers had access to health benefits than scientists and engineers whose highest degree were bachelor's or master's degrees. About 70 percent of doctoral scientists and engineers aged 65 and older were very satisfied with their jobs, compared to 50 percent of those aged 54 or younger. Two indicators derived from 1995 SDR data, the article publication rate and the patent activity rate, provide limited information on the relationship between the productivity of doctoral scientists and engineers and their age. Doctoral scientists and engineers in their 60's and 70's were much less likely to have authored or co-authored at least one published paper within a five-year period than their counterparts in their 40's. The gap is smaller in the education sector than in government or industry. In contrast, the patent activity rate, an indicator based on patent applications, was only about a third greater for doctoral scientists and engineers in their 40's than those on their 60's and 70's. Furthermore, the patent activity rate for doctoral scientists and engineers in the education sector is about the same for those aged 65-75 as for all ages combined.
