[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the past fifty years, the average time spent in graduate school for a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) Ph.D. has increased by two years. At the same time, the probability of ever obtaining an academic tenure-track position has been cut in half. Although doctoral programs are designed to train Ph.Ds. for tenure-track positions, only a quarter of STEM Ph.D. graduates today ever move into these positions. (Anderson 2019, Loriaux 2019 Despite the lengthening graduate training and the low probability of tenure-track, a growing 41% of STEM Ph.Ds. pursue postdoctoral positions. Postdoctoral positions do not improve one's chances at tenure-track: approximately 20% of STEM Ph.Ds. transition from their last postdoctoral appointment into tenure-track positions, which is a similar probability to the 17% of STEM Ph.Ds. who transition directly from graduate school. Rather, this paper finds evidence that postdoctoral positions offer option value allowing STEM Ph.Ds. to remain in academic research positions -albeit not necessarily on the tenure-track. Retaining this option value has an upfront opportunity cost: starting in a postdoctoral position pays approximately $20,000 less than starting in a tenure-track position. However, having postdoctoral experience puts STEM Ph.Ds. on a faster salary growth path, closing this salary gap approximately six years post-graduation. All together, postdoctoral appointments may be a worthwhile investment for STEM Ph.Ds. to persist longer in academic research at relatively low opportunity cost. The scientific community has long been concerned with the lengthening training of STEM Ph.Ds. for a shrinking number of academic tenure-track positions.(Bridges to Independence: Fostering the Independence of New Investigators in Biomedical Research 2005) However, limited research has focused on doctorate and post-doctorate stages of the STEM pipeline -especially outside of the biomedical fields. (Balsmeier and Pellens 2014, Mathur et al. 2018, Mishagina 2009, Roach and Sauermann 2016, Science and Engineering Indicators 2018, Stephan 2012, Zolas et al. 2015 1 This paper thus systematically examines the long-term trends of STEM Ph.D. career paths. Using the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) linked to the 1993-2015 longitudinal waves of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), I create detailed career profiles for 156,089 research doctorate holders across ten STEM fields. Expanding Ginther and Kahn (2017)'s methodology for estimating postdoctoral incidence, I identify each post-Ph.D. year that an individual spends any portion of the year working in six job types -postdoctoral researcher, tenure-track academic, non-tenure track academic, for-profit industry, non-profit, and government -and in two employment statuses -unemployed and out of the labor force. I compare how these career paths and 1 A larger literature has focused on STEM persistence at the pre-doctorate level (e.g. Blotnicky et al. 2018, Boudreau and Marx 2019, Evans 2017, Shu 2015, Tai et al. 2006 or alternatively among established scientists (e.g. Azoulay et al. 2017, M. Levitt andJ. M. Levitt 2017). This is due to limited data -particularly on postdoctoral researchers, which have historically been poorly tracked.(Biomedical Workforce Working Group Report 2012) There has only recently been a push for universities to collect the long-term career outcomes of their graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.(Coalition of Next Generation Life Sciences n.d., Silva et al. 2019) job characteristics change across 1950-2013 Ph.D. graduation cohorts. I find that the average time spent in graduate school has increased from 5.9 years (s.d. = 2.2) among 1960-1980 among 2000-2013 cohorts. 2 The probability of ever obtaining a tenure-track academic career has plummeted from 42. 8% of 1960-1980 of 2000-2013 cohorts. Despite this decline in probability, more STEM Ph.Ds. are pursuing postdoctoral positions each year: 41.0% of 2000-2013 cohorts are ever observed in postdoctoral positions, compared to 31.3% of 1960-1980 STEM Ph.Ds. The average STEM Ph.D. spends 2.7 years (s.d. = 2.3) in these postdoctoral positions. There is no evidence to suggest that this additional training significantly improves a STEM Ph.D.'s chances at obtaining a tenure-track job: 17.1% of 2000-2013 cohorts transition directly to a tenure-track job within two years of their Ph.D. graduation, compared to 19.6% transitioning from their last postdoctoral appointment. Rather, the benefit of postdoctoral positions comes in allowing STEM Ph.Ds. to remain in academic research -though not necessarily on the tenure-track. Consistent with the average STEM Ph.D.'s preference for academic research over industry positions established in the literature, this paper finds evidence of a compensating differential in time and salary for remaining in academia -particularly at research-intensive universities. (Agarwal and Ohyama 2013, Conti and Visentin 2015, Ganguli and Gaul\u00e9 2018, Janger and Nowotny 2016, Stern 2004 Because of their temporary nature, postdoctoral positions allow flexibility in the transition to a permanent job sector. Non-postdoctoral positions are absorbing states: approximately 80% of individuals who take on a permanent academic, for-profit, non-profit, or government job remain in the same job sector for the remainder of their career paths, compared to 21% of postdoctoral researchers. 3 STEM Ph.Ds. who take on postdoctoral positions are able to spend longer in academic research than those who transition directly from their Ph.D. Since 1970, 12.7% of STEM postdoctoral researchers transition to non-tenure track academic positions -compared to 6.8% of STEM Ph.Ds. directly from graduation. Postdoctoral researchers are twenty percentage points more likely to transition from their last appointment to a Carnegie-Classified high research activity university than Ph.Ds. directly from graduate school. 4 To retain the option of remaining in academic research, postdoctoral researchers face an upfront opportunity cost. The average STEM Ph.D. starting in a postdoctoral position earns an estimated $72,420 (s.d. = $8,343) five years post-graduation, compared to $ 80,199 (s.d. = $11,811) for those starting in a tenure-track position and $109,396 (s.d. = $10,773) for those starting in a for-profit industry position. However, having postdoctoral experience places STEM Ph.Ds. on a faster salary growth path, closing the salary gap between starting in a postdoctoral position and starting in a tenure-track position approximately eight years postgraduation. The thirty-year internal rate of return between the two starting positions is 4.8%, indicating that STEM postdoctoral positions are worth the upfront salary investment. Taken all together, postdoctoral appointments offer option value for STEM Ph.Ds. to remain in academic research -albeit not necessrily on the tenure-track. As the number of postdoctoral researchers becomes more commonplace and the number of tenure-track positions drops, postdoctoral experience does not improve a STEM Ph.D.'s chances of obtaining a tenure-track position. However, postdoctoral researchers are more likely than STEM Ph.Ds. transitioning directly from graduate school to remain in academic positionsparticularly at research-intensive universities -through non-tenure track positions. The temporary nature of postdoctoral appointments give STEM Ph.Ds. the flexibility to wait for these academic research positions. To take advantage of this option value, postdoctoral researchers face an upfront opportunity cost. However, because of faster postdoctoral salary growth, the salary gap from starting in a postdoctoral position and from starting in a tenure-track position closes approximately eight years post-graduation. Thus, for STEM Ph.Ds. interested in academic research, postdoctoral positions thus provides beneficial option value to remain in academic positions at relatively low opportunity cost. 2 Data: NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) Linked to Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) This paper draws on the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) linked to the 1993-2015 waves of the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). This is the largest, nationally representative sample of individuals receiving first-time research doctorates from accredited U.S. institutions in science, engineering, and health fields. The survey starts following individuals the year they apply for their Ph.D. graduation in the SED, then checks in with respondents on a roughly biennial basis in the SDR waves until they reach the age of 76, emigrate from the U.S., 5 or are otherwise unable to respond. 6 Each survey collects extensive information on the doctoral recipient's individual demographics, education, and job characteristics. From the SED, respondents provide information on their education through the doctorate and their expected immediate post-graduation plans. In each following SDR wave, respondents answer a wide range of questions about their current job -such as their employment sector, most common work activities, and salary. Some questions also shed light on work experience in between surveys -such as their current job's starting date and whether one has changed jobs since the last survey. Based on these responses, the SED-SDR paints a detailed picture of an individual's career over time. One limitation of the SED-SDR is that the survey has limited information on ability proxies. A few survey waves (1995, 2001, 2003, and 2008)  Overall, the response rate for a SDR wave is approximately 70%.(Foley 2015) Individuals who do not respond to a specific SDR wave remain in the sample and continue to be contacted for future waves until they are no longer eligible (as defined by the conditions in Footnote 6). Thus, it is possible for individuals to miss multiple waves but respond later. For the 1993-2015 SDR waves, Table 1 gives a comparison between the number of waves an individual is expected to have responded to the SDR -based on their Ph.D. graduation year and age -to the actual number of waves an individual is observed in the SDR. The fewer waves contributed to the SDR, the less complete of a career path can be constructed.  where y it gives the inflation-adjusted (in 2015 dollars) salary in year t, 1 ( focus on four major STEM fields of study: biological sciences, chemistry, engineering, and physics. 10 Table   2 gives summary statistics on Ph.D. demographics.

Appendix B gives figures for chemistry, engineering, and physics. 11 Similar increases are observed in chemistry, engineering, and physics. (See Appendix Figure B.1.) 12 A near majority of chemistry and physics Ph.Ds. have also transitioned directly to postdoctoral positions since the 1980's. Engineering, which had almost no Ph.Ds. transition directly to postdoctoral positions in the 1960's, has also increased to approximately 20% of chorts moving into postdoctoral positions. (See Appendix Figure B.4.)"}, {"section_title": "Trainees No Longer Transition to Tenure-Track But to Other Jobs", "text": "In the same fifty years that doctoral training lengthened and more STEM Ph.Ds. pursued postdoctoral training, the probability of obtaining a tenure-track academic career has nearly halved. Only 25.2% of 2000-2013 STEM Ph.D. graduating cohorts ever hold a tenure-track position, compared to 42. 8% of 1960-1980 cohorts. As shown in Figure 6, the percent ever observed in tenure-track positions has steadily declined since the mid-1960's. 13 Despite the focus of doctoral programs on academic tenure-track careers, only 17. It is now more likely that STEM Ph.Ds. and postdoctoral researchers transition to other job sectors.  "}, {"section_title": "Waiting for Academic Research Jobs", "text": "As a larger percent of postdoctoral researchers transition to academic non-tenure track jobs than new Ph.D. graduates, this may indicate that individuals with a higher preference for academic jobs -regardless of tenure status -are selecting into postdoctoral positions. Previous literature has documented researchers' willingness to trade off salary for greater research time. 17 Consistent with these results, most STEM Ph.Ds. pursue academic positions that have high research activities but low salaries compared to industry positions. Figure   11 gives the fraction of respondents holding each job type that state they spend the most hours on select work activities; Figure 12 gives the average salary for each job type in each survey wave. STEM industry jobs have the least focus on research -with 13.5% spending the most time on basic research -but have the highest average salary at $127,709. Comparatively, 17.9% of tenure-track positions and 19.5% of non-tenure track positions spend the most time on basic research, with an average salary of $92,428 and $67,080 respectively. Carnegie-Classified high research activity institutions have even higher research levels, at 27.7% for tenuretrack and 27.2% for non-tenure track respectively. Of all job types, postdoctoral positions performs the most basic research and have the lowest salary: 28.7% of all postdoctoral positions -up to 56.3% at high research activity institutions -spend the most time on basic research at an average salary of $48,724. 18 Given the limited number of permanent academic positions, a postdoctoral appointment may allow STEM Ph.Ds. the flexibility to wait for high research positions. Only 21.3% of STEM postdoctoral researchers remain in these positions for their entire observed career path. 19 As shown in Figure 13, the postdoctoral appointment is far more transitive than the tenure-track academic, non-tenure track, for-profit-industry, government, and non-profit positions. These permanent positions act as absorbing states: at least 60% who begin a position in each of these job sectors are never observed switching to any other job type. 20 Because individuals do not typically transition between absorbing states, an individual who moves out of academic research to another permanent job type is unlikely to ever return. By remaining in a transitory state like a postdoctoral position, STEM Ph.Ds. retain option value to move to any of the permanent job types. A benefit of the option value provided by postdoctoral positions, STEM postdoctoral researchers spend more time at research-intensive universities than individuals who transition directly from graduate school. 78.1% of first postdoctoral positions are at Carnegie-Classified R1 high research activity institutions. Al-though postdoctoral researchers are not more likely to transition to tenure-track positions than new graduates, as shown in Table 5, those who do are 21.0 percentage points more likely to be on a high research activity university's tenure-track and 18.6 percentage points more likely to be in a high research activity university's non-tenure track position compared to individuals transitioning directly from graduate school. This indicates that individuals pursuing postdoctoral positions are not of lower ability than those who move directly into permanent positions; rather, they may have a higher threshold in the level of research activity they would accept for a permanent position. Postdoctoral experience does set individuals on a faster growth path -particularly among tenure-track academics, as they are more likely to be at high research activity universities than those who transition directly from graduate school. The salary gap between individuals starting in a postdoctoral position and starting in a tenure-track position closes approximately eight years post-graduation. The salary gap between individuals starting in a postdoctoral position and starting in a for-profit industry position takes approximately 35 years post-graduation to close. 21 As a result, STEM Ph.Ds. interested in academic positions may find the opportunity cost is worth the added option value. Assuming a 3% interest rate, Figure 16 gives the net present value for the first thirty years after one's Ph.D. graduation based on starting job type."}, {"section_title": "Option Value at Relatively Low Opportunity Cost", "text": "Similar results hold when controlling or employment sector five years post-graduation, as given in Figure   17. The internal rate of return between starting in a postdoctoral position and starting in a tenure-track position is 4.8%, indicating that STEM postdoctoral positions are worth the salary investment to remain in academic positions. 22 However, because of the large postdoc-industry salary gap, STEM Ph.Ds. who are interested in industry positions do not benefit from postdoctoral positions. This further illustrates that STEM postdoctoral positions are less about training up marketable skills and more about option value for remaining in academia."}, {"section_title": "Discussion & Future Work", "text": "In this paper, I examine how trends in the STEM labor market have changed over the past fifty years. Using the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) linked to the 1993-2015 waves of the NSF Survey of Doctorate time. In doing so, I identify key trends that span multiple fields of study. Additionally, this data set can be used to further study topics related to the STEM trainee labor market beyond the scope of this paper. Across STEM fields, I find that training time has increased significantly since the 1960's. At the same time, postdoctoral positions are becoming more commonplace -even in fields with strong industry ties like engineering. This is despite the declining probability of ever obtaining a tenure-track positions in that same time period -ranging from an approximately 14 percentage point decline in chemistry to as much as 36 percentage points in the biological sciences. In recent years, having postdoctoral experience does not significantly improve one's chances of obtaining a tenure-track job, with fewer than 20% of both new graduates and postdoctoral researchers transitioning to these positions. Rather, I find evidence that postdoctoral positions allow STEM Ph.Ds. to stay longer in academic research jobs -but not necessarily ones on the tenure-track. Compared to the absorbing states of permanent job types, in which individuals are unlikely to transition out of the job sector, temporary postdoctoral appointments allow STEM Ph.Ds. option value to transition into a new job sector. Although postdoctoral researchers are not more likely to enter a tenure-track position than new Ph.D. graduates, they are 2.5 percentage points more likely to remain in academia through non-tenure track positions. Like tenure-track positions, approximately 20% of non-tenure track positions spend the most work hours on basic researchwhich previous research has found is a preferred work activity of STEM Ph.Ds. (Agarwal and Ohyama 2013, Conti and Visentin 2015, Ganguli and Gaul\u00e9 2018, Janger and Nowotny 2016, Stern 2004 Conditional on transitioning to a tenure-track or non-tenure track position, postdoctoral researchers are also 2.4 percentage points more likely to take a position at a Carnegie-Classified high research activity institution compared to those who transition directly from graduate school. This indicates that those pursuing postdoctoral positions are not of lower ability than those transitioning directly from graduate school; rather, they may have a higher preference for academic research and thus be willing to wait longer for a permanent job. To retain the option value of remaining in academia, postdoctoral researchers pay an upfront opportunity cost. At an average salary of approximately $48,742, postdoctoral researchers are more than $20,000 less than the permanent job types. Five years post-graduation, individuals who start in a postdoctoral position earn approximately $8,000 less than those who start in a tenure-track position and approximately $37,000 less than those who start in an industry position. However, postdoctoral experience increases an individual's salary growth path, closing the salary gap between starting in a postdoctoral position and starting in a tenure-track position. This faster growth is yet another indication that the pursuit of postdoctoral positions does not indicate an individual's lower ability. Over a 30-year salary path, the internal rate of return for starting in a postdoctoral position over starting in a tenure-track position averages 4.8% across STEM fields. Given the option value postdoctoral experience provides, this relatively low opportunity cost may be worth it to STEM Ph.Ds. who are interested in academic research careers. Taken together, despite the lengthening training and declining probability of ever obtaining a tenuretrack position, STEM Ph.Ds. are still willing to pursue postdoctoral positions due to their option value for remaining in academic research positions -even off the tenure-track -at relatively low opportunity cost. One potential test for this mechanism is whether time in postdoctoral appointments lengthen in response to hypothetical or actual shifts in the academic market; this will be explored in future research utilizing hypothetical choice surveys or yearly funding shocks. The upfront opportunity cost also begs the question of which groups of STEM Ph.Ds. are able to afford the option value of postdoctoral appointments.

A Tracking of STEM Ph.D. Careers in Detail"}, {"section_title": "Tables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A.1 Career Paths Construction", "text": "This appendix details the methodology used to identify a SED-SDR individual's career paths across six job types and two employment statuses. It performs the methodology on the example individual Ph.D. whose true career path is given in Appendix Table A.1. Based on this true path, the individual fills out the job-related variables from each SED or SDR survey in Appendix Table A.2. Note that this data has been constructed for example purposes and does not represent an actual individual in the SED-SDR data. I start by identifying all individuals covered by the 1993-2015 SDR, matching to their SED responses using the variable refid and to their first weight observation wtsurvy. \u2022 Tenure-Track Academic (TT): In the SED, the individual's postgraduation plan is not a postdoc (as defined above) but is employment in a U.S. 4-year college or university, medical school, research institute, or university hospital. In the SDR, the individual is not in a postdoc but is either tenured or on tenure-track (as given by the variables facten and tensta). \u2022 Non-Tenure Track Academic (NT): In the SED, the individual's postgraduation plan is not a postdoc or tenure-track academic (as defined above) but is employment in a U.S. community college, U.S K-12, or a foreign educational institution. In the SDR, the individual is not in a postdoc or tenuretrack academic position but is employed in an educational institution (as given by the employment sector variable emsecdt). \u2022 Industry (ID): For both the SED and SDR, the individual is employed in the for-profit industry sector, for-profit business sector, or is self-employed. \u2022 Non-Profit (NP): In the SED, the individual's postgraduation plan is a not-for-profit organization or international organization such as UN, UNESCO, or WHO. In the SDR, the individual is employed in a non-profit sector. \u2022 Government (GV): In the SED, the individual's postgraduation plan is employment at a foreign government, U.S. federal government, U.S. state government, or U.S. local government. In the SDR, the individual is employed in the government sector. I also examine if individuals are not employed and hold the following non-employed statuses: \u2022 Unemployed (UN): There is no information on unemployment in the SED. In the SDR, an individual's labor force status is unemployed (as given by the variable lfstat). \u2022 Not in Labor Force (NL): In the SED, the individual's postgraduation status is not seeking employment (including being a housewife, writing a book, or no employment). In the SDR, the individual's labor force status is not in the labor force. To construct the career paths, I modify Ginther and Kahn 2017's methodology for measuring postdoctoral incidence over time to expand to different employment sectors. From the SED, I identify STEM Ph.D.s' immediate post-graduation status using the variables pdocstat. Individuals are considered to be in a particular job type the year of their graduation if they indicated they are returning to employment, have a signed contract, or are in negotiations for that job type. From the SDR, I utilize variables on their current job, 23 comparison to their previous job, 24 and retrospective postdoctoral experience asked of respondents in 1995 and 2006. 25 Because some variables impart more information about one's job type than others, I use the following hierarchy to fill in indicators for each job type in each year from 1945-2015: 1. New job: Individual is starting a new job (given by start date) in that year. In the case of unemployed or out of labor force, the last year worked was the previous year. 2. Postdoc retrospective: Individual stated they were in a postdoctoral position in the retrospective 1995 and 2006 data, as given by the postdoc start and end dates. Fill indicators for all years between the start and end years. 3. Current job: Individual is currently in this job type; fill indicators for all years up through starting year. In the case of unemployed or out of labor force, fill indicators for all years just up to the year last worked. 4. In same job type last survey: Individual states they were either 1) in the same job and same employer, 2) in the same job but had a different employer, or 3) had the same employer but different job as the last survey. Denote these as case 4, case 4.1, and case 4.2 respectively. Fill indicators for current job type up to last survey year. 5. Expected post-graduation job: Fill in job type for an individual's graduation year from their expected post-graduation job type, as given by the SED. 6. No other information, expected transition: If steps 1-5 have not given any information on an individual's job type in a particular year but have given information in the previous year, assume that individuals were in the same job type as the year had information."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ". No information expected: For years before completing the Ph.D. and after the last year surveyed, the individual contributes no further information about their job type, so replace indicators with missing. The example individual's indicators given in Appendix Table A.3. I consider the highest step in the hierarchy as the most accurate representation of whether an individual was in that job type in that year. Appendix Table A.4 gives the percent of indicators determined by each step. To estimate the number of years an individual is in a particular job type, I count one year for each year an indicator's most definitive step is steps 1-5 and a half year for each year an indicator's most definitive step is step 6. Transitions are defined by the new job type within two years of the last year spent in a different job type. As shown in Appendix Table A.3, the example individual is considered to have spent four years as a postdoc, four and a half years as a tenure-track academic, one year in non-tenure track, two years in non-profit, five and a half years in industry, two years not in labor force, and five and a half years in government. They have switched from a postdoc to tenure-track, tenure-track to non-tenure track, non-tenure track to non-profit, non-profit to industry, industry to government, and not in labor force to government. This methodology is able to capture the majority of the true career path; however, the example also illustrates limitations when individuals switch principal jobs between survey years or have employment gaps for a year or less.   Notes: This table shows the true career path of a constructed SDR individual. Column 1 gives the reference year, refyr . Columns 2-9 give job types, as abbreviated in Appendix A.1. A marked box denotes employment in that job type in that year; if an individual switches jobs but remains in the same job type, different jobs are denoted by switching the markings (X, Y, etc.). For example, the individual switches from one postdoc position to another in 1991, so the first postdoc job is denoted by X and the second is denoted by Y.  (3)  Table A.1.
