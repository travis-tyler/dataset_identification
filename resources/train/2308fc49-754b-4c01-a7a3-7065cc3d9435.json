Introduction"}, {"section_title": "List of Tables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Focus of the Report", "text": "The focus of this First Look report is on base-year contextual data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). This First Look is intended as a companion to the report, High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09): A First Look at Fall 2009Ninth-Graders (NCES 2011, which focuses on the mathematics assessment and student beliefs, expectations, and exposure to different mathematics and science courses. This companion report introduces the contextual data provided by ninth-graders' parents, mathematics and science teachers, school counselors, and school administrators. These sources provided information to address the fundamental research questions on which HSLS:09 is based. Data from HSLS:09 inform policymakers and researchers about if, when, and how students decide on secondary courses, choose among postsecondary options, and consider which career(s) to pursue. The study focuses on this complex decision-making process in general, but also places particular emphasis on this process within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Ninth-graders reported on their own experiences, expectations, plans, and attitudes, but other informants were critical to understanding external influences on students' choices. All contextual sources -parents, mathematics and science teachers, school counselors, and school administrators -answered questions on their demographic and professional backgrounds. The most knowledgeable adult about the ninth-grader's current experiences responded to survey questions through a self-administered online survey or with a telephone interviewer; most often this adult was the parent. The parent survey covers topics such as their expectations, aspirations, and preparations for their ninth-graders' futures, particularly in terms of their students' postsecondary experiences, such as college savings plans. School staff were asked to provide information on students' educational settings by responding to prompts about the general school and classroom. Therefore, their responses are not necessarily related to individual students. Students' mathematics and science teachers were asked to complete survey questions about their work history, work experiences, and school climate. The school administrator and the head school counselor (or another counselor, if there was no head school counselor or if that counselor was unavailable) also reported on their work history, work experiences, and school climate. School climate encompassed the central goals of the school, resources available for struggling and excelling students, challenges to student and school success, and discipline issues, as well as their own educational expectations for students and their perceptions of others' expectations and behaviors. Each of the four school staff surveys included the same set of school climate questions to allow researchers to triangulate the data and thus construct a more complete picture of the school. The purpose of this First Look report is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of selected descriptive information. Since this report is purely descriptive in nature, readers are cautioned not to draw casual inferences based on the bivariate results presented. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored. The variables examined here are also just a few of those that can be examined in these data; they were selected to demonstrate the range of information available from the study. These findings are examples of estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. The release of this report is intended to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data using more sophisticated statistical methods. Further information about the dataset and the methodologies used to collect and process the data can be found in the technical appendix to this report (appendix A) and, with greater detail, in the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328), available from the NCES website: nces.ed.gov/surveys/HSLS09.

The schools were sampled from public schools, including charter schools, and private schools enrolling both ninth-grade and eleventh-grade students in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. In 2009, fall-term ninth-graders were randomly sampled within selected schools to take a mathematics assessment focused on algebraic reasoning and to answer survey questions. All ninth-grade students in the sampled schools were classified as eligible for the study, including students with disabilities and English-language learners who may not have been capable of completing the survey instruments. 1 Table 1 profiles the HSLS:09 students. The base-year student data are nationally representative of ninth-graders in schools with both ninth and eleventh grades. The base-year dataset also includes 10 individual state-representative samples of students and schools. Approximately half the eligible selected schools participated, for a realized sample of 944 schools (56 percent weighted response rate; 50 percent unweighted response rate). Of eligible fall ninth-graders, more than 21,000 students participated, which is a response rate of about 86 percent weighted and 85 percent unweighted. Featured in this report, information was also collected from students' parents; mathematics teachers; science teachers; school counselors; and school administrators. The weighted and unweighted response rates at the student level for those respondents are as follows: parents (68 percent weighted; 67 percent unweighted); mathematics teachers (72 percent weighted; 76 percent unweighted); science teachers (70 percent weighted; 72 percent unweighted); school counselors (90 percent weighted; 90 percent unweighted); and school administrators (95 percent weighted; 94 percent unweighted). More information about the sample design can be found in the technical notes in appendix A. The survey weights were adjusted for list collection and questionnaire nonresponse, and the data were then weighted to yield national estimates that represent all ninth-grade students enrolled in schools in the United States that included both ninth and eleventh grades and their parents, school counselors, teachers, and administrators. The results of a nonresponse bias analysis conducted for the survey to inform the nonresponse weight adjustments are presented in appendix A. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 will occur in the spring of 2012 when most student sample members will be in the eleventh grade. Dropouts and early graduates will be followed and all participants will be asked to complete both the survey and an updated version of the mathematics assessment that reflects more complex material. The tests will be aligned so as to facilitate analyses of learning in mathematics. At this first follow-up data collection, participants' parents, school counselors, and school administrators will complete surveys that focus on the transition from the secondary to the postsecondary years. A brief postsecondary status update will occur in the summer/fall of 2013, asking students about their postsecondary options, choices, and financing plans for these choices. High school transcripts will be collected and coded in the fall of 2013/spring of 2014, and a second follow-up is planned for 2015, when most sample members will be 2 years beyond high school graduation.

All of the studies monitor the transition of national samples of young people from the high school years to postsecondary years, including further education, participation in the work force, and the assumption of other adult roles. The core research questions for HSLS:09 explore secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and the educational and social experiences that are related to these shifts. The HSLS:09 base-year data collection took place in the 2009-10 school year, with a randomlyselected sample of fall-term ninth-graders in more than 900 public and private high schools with both a ninth and an eleventh grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and survey online. Students' parents, school administrators, and mathematics and science teachers as well as the school's lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or on the Web. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 will take place in the spring of 2012 when most sample members will be in the spring of the eleventh grade. Dropouts and transfer students will be followed, as well as those who remain in the base-year school. A postsecondary update will take place in the summer of 2013, to learn about the cohort's postsecondary plans and decisions. High school transcripts will be collected in the fall of 2013, and a second follow-up will take place in 2015, when most sample members will be 2 years beyond high school graduation. Further information on study design and purposes can be found in chapter 1 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328)."}, {"section_title": "A.2 Instrumentation", "text": "Base-year instrument design for HSLS:09 was guided by a conceptual framework that takes the student as the fundamental unit of analysis and attempts to identify the precursor factors, such as motivation, beliefs, and interests that lead to academic goal-setting and decision-making. It traces the many variables -including perceived opportunities, barriers, and costs-that are associated with students' values and expectations and that factor into students' most basic education-related choices. The study design also acknowledges the importance of social context and the interaction between students and their families, teachers, peers, and the wider community. Base-year instrument design was also guided by the desire to develop computer-assisted research instruments. The student questionnaire was, for the first time in the history of the study series, electronically administered, as was the student assessment in algebraic reasoning. The contextual questionnaires as well-parent, teacher, school administrator and counselor-were designed for Web self-administration or computer-assisted telephone administration (CATI) by an interviewer."}, {"section_title": "A-1", "text": "Computerization of the instruments was desired for several reasons, including its contribution to higher quality data, and to support the accurate assignment of second-stage forms (a two-stage adaptive test was employed). Student Questionnaire. The content of the student questionnaire included both future locating information and substantive questions. The questionnaire elicited demographic information (for example, sex, race/ethnicity); language background; school experiences in the current and previous school year (including mathematics and science experiences and course enrollment). It also inquired into constructs such as mathematics self-efficacy and identification and high school, postsecondary, and career plans, among other topics. Parent Questionnaire. The parent questionnaire also included locating and substantive items. Substantive items covered household members and their roles and characteristics; demographic data; information on immigration status and language use; socioeconomic status (education, occupation, income); the student's educational history (including grade retention and change of schools); family interactions; parental involvement in the ninth-grader's learning; and plans and preparations for postsecondary education. Teacher (mathematics and science) Questionnaire. Teachers were selected by virtue of teaching an HSLS:09 student in mathematics or science. The teacher questionnaire collected background information about the respondent, including both demographic characteristics and educational and professional history. Mathematics and science teachers were asked to evaluate their mathematics or science department and to provide information at the classroom level. In part because of the fall timing of the survey (exposure to the student was comparatively low), teachers were not asked to supply ratings or evaluations of individual HSLS:09 students. School Administrator Questionnaire. The school questionnaire allowed for two respondents: the factual information sections (1-4) could be delegated to a knowledgeable staff member, but the final section could be completed only by the principal, because its content concerned the principal's background and beliefs. The questionnaire elicited information about school characteristics; the student population; the school's teachers; course offered; and the goals, beliefs, and background of the principal. Counselor Questionnaire. The counselor questionnaire sought information about school programs and practices, especially as they related to activities to transition students into high school, student programs, and course assignments. The majority of questions inquired about staffing and practices (e.g., counselor certifications and caseloads, basis for assignment to students), resources (enrichment programs, services for struggling students, dropout prevention programs, and so on), and mathematics and science placement (placement criteria for both ninth-graders and upperclassmen in both mathematics and science). Mathematics Assessment in Algebraic Reasoning. The mathematics assessment was designed to provide a measure of student achievement in algebraic reasoning at two points in time (ninth and eleventh grade). The test framework was designed to assess a cross-section of understandings representative of the major domains of algebra and the key processes of algebra. The test and item specifications describe six domains of algebraic content and four algebraic processes: The The assessment was administered by computer using a two-stage design. In the first stage, each student took a common 15-item Stage 1 router test. On the basis of Stage 1 performance, each student was routed to a low, moderate, or high Stage 2 test, each consisting of 25 items. Even though the item pool consisted of 72 items, students were only aware that they were taking a 40-item test. For linking purposes, 12 items were common to both the high and moderate Stage 2 tests and 5 items were common to both the low and moderate Stage 2 tests. The computer program included an online scientific calculator and allowed students to skip and return to items within each stage and to identify items for review within each stage before submitting their answers as finished. The scores used to describe students' performance on the mathematics assessment are based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The IRT model uses patterns of correct, incorrect, and omitted responses to obtain ability estimates that are comparable across the low-, moderate-, and high-difficulty test forms. Specifically, the IRT three-parameter logistic (3PL) model was used to calibrate the test items and estimate a student's ability. The 3PL model is a mathematical model for estimating the probability that a person will respond correctly to an item. This probability is given as a function of one parameter characterizing the proficiency of a given student and three parameters characterizing the properties of a given item-the item's difficulty, discriminating ability, and a guessing factor. The IRT model accounts for the three characteristics of each test question in estimating a student's ability."}, {"section_title": "A.3 Sample Design", "text": "In the base-year survey of HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process (table A-1). First, stratified random sampling and school recruitment resulted in the identification and contacting of 1,889 eligible schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 50.2 percent (weighted) or 50.0 percent unweighted response rate. The target population at the school level was public schools, including public charter schools, and private schools, providing instruction in both ninth and eleventh grades in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. The target population of students was defined to include all ninth-grade students who attended the study-eligible schools in the fall 2009 term. In the second stage of sampling, ninth-graders were randomly sampled from school enrollment rosters, with 25,206 eligible selections (or about 27 students per school)."}, {"section_title": "A-3", "text": "All students who met the target population definition were deemed eligible for the study. However, not all students were capable of completing a questionnaire or assessment. Students who, due to language barriers or severe disabilities, were unable to directly participate in the study were retained in the sample and contextual data were sought for them. Their ability to complete the study instruments will be reassessed in the first follow-up. Of the 25,206 eligible students, 24,658 students were classified as questionnaire-capable and 548 as questionnaire-incapable. HSLS:09 school and student samples are nationally representative, as well as state-representative for a subset of 10 states. For most purposes, the student is the unit of analysis. Data at the school, classroom, or home level may be attached to the student record as contextual data. Several contextual respondent populations were sampled. The school's head administrator comprises one such respondent group. The lead counselor (or the counselor most knowledgeable about the entering ninth-grade class) was identified (with the help of the school), and used as a source of school-level student contextual data. Mathematics and science teachers of HSLS:09 ninth-graders enrolled in the subject were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire. The final source of contextual data was the parent interview. The most knowledgeable adult about the ninth-grader's current experiences responded to survey questions through a self-administered online survey or with a telephone interviewer; most often this adult was the parent."}, {"section_title": "A.4 Results of School Recruitment and Data Collection", "text": "Table A-1 below summarizes the results of school recruitment and instrument completion by each component. 3 Among questionnaire-capable students (n = 24,658), some 21,444 completed the student questionnaire, and 20,781 completed the mathematics assessment. Thus 87.0 percent (unweighted) completed the student interview or 87.4 percent weighted. Likewise, 84.3 percent (unweighted) completed a mathematics assessment or 84.7 percent weighted. 4 Weighted estimates use the student base weight. Results reflect students who were enrolled in a mathematics course. 5 Weighted estimates use the student base weight. Results reflect students who were enrolled in a science course. Overall, about half the eligible selected schools participated, for a realized sample of 944 schools (56 percent weighted response rate). More than 21,000 students participated, or about 86 percent (weighted) of eligible selected fall ninth-graders (table A-1). While school cooperation rates were relatively low, important information about nonresponding schools was available from the sampling frame. In an effort to determine the characteristics of schools that did not participate in HSLS:09, such nonrespondent schools (or their associated districts) were also asked to complete a school characteristics questionnaire. This questionnaire gathered information about basic characteristics of the refusing schools, which were also collected in the school administrator questionnaire for participating schools. Among the 945 nonresponding eligible sample schools, a total of 623 completed questionnaires (66 percent) were received. Information was used to make nonresponse adjustments to the school weights. For more information on the derivation of the analytic weights, in particular the adjustments to the school weight, please see Chapter 6, Section 6.3.2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328). Nonresponse bias analyses were conducted to determine if unit nonresponse from any of the six interview data sources (student, parent/guardian, mathematics teacher, science teacher, school counselor, and school administrator) significantly increased the estimated bias for a set of population estimates. Weighted response rates for mathematics and science teachers as well as parents of the sampled students fell below 85 percent and thus, per NCES standards, were subjected to the bias analysis procedures. The remaining sources were also included for a complete evaluation of HSLS:09. Characteristics associated with the school (e.g., school sector, percent minority) and with the sampled student (e.g., race/ethnicity, sex) were used in the bias tests. Table A-2 contains a summary of the findings for the data components included in this report before and after the base weights were adjusted for nonresponse. For example, among the 60 tests conducted for student data, 18 percent were identified as having a significant level of bias before the weights were adjusted. This amount falls to almost zero once the weights were adjusted. The proportion of significant bias tests was largest for the school analytic weights (20 percent); however, the median absolute relative bias was reduced by over 6 percentage points. Overall the unit nonresponse bias analysis detected bias in a limited number of estimates generated with the nonresponse adjusted student weights, the home-life weights, and the mathematics enrollee weights (0 percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent, respectively) (see table A-2). Non-negligible biases were linked to the school and science enrollee weights and were primarily due to domains with relatively small sample sizes. Specific variables used in the unit nonresponse bias analyses were school sector; ninth-grade enrollment (Asian, Black, Hispanic, Other); whether a charter school; total and ninth-grade enrollment; number of full-time teachers; student to teacher ratio; Census region; school locale (urbanicity); grade span; whether school has a religious affiliation; whether school is a regular secondary; and for the student-based tables, student sex and race. Bias was more an after-adjustment problem for school and science weights than for student, home-life or mathematics course enrollee weights. Using the relative bias estimate (in which bias is expressed on a uniform scale across items) as the criterion, the school weight variables and the science enrollee weight variables with the highest remaining (post-adjustment) bias and were \"no religious affiliation\"; \"school is regular secondary: no\"; and \"student-teacher ratio >25\". The analysis procedure for evaluating nonresponse bias can be found in chapter 6, section 6.7, of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328). Tabular results for the unit nonresponse bias analysis are presented in appendix H, section H.1, of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328). These tables show unit nonresponse bias both before and after weighting adjustments. See table H-1 for school base weights, table H-2 for student base weights, table H-3 for the home-life (parent) base weights, table H-4 for the science course enrollee base weights, and table H-5 for the mathematics course enrollee weights. Bias significantly different from zero at the 0.05 level of significance. \"Before\" and \"after\" are in reference to the nonresponse weight adjustment. Of the students participating, approximately 98 percent were surveyed in in-school sessions, and 2 percent outside school. Parent and school staff surveys (administrator, counselor, mathematics teacher, science teacher) were designed for computerized administration in either of two modes-web-based selfadministration, or CATI (computerized self-administration)."}, {"section_title": "A.5 Weighting", "text": "Analytic weights are used in combination with software that accounts for HSLS:09 complex survey design to produce estimates for the target population, with appropriate standard errors. Five sets of analytic weights were computed for HSLS:09: a school-level weight, a student-level weight, two studentlevel weights associated with contextual data from science and mathematics courses, and a student-level weight for use with parent-supplied family and home contextual data. In this report, the student-level weight for use with parent-supplied family and home contextual data is used along with the two studentlevel weights associated with contextual data from science and mathematics courses. For more information on weighting see the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (Ingels et al. 2011). Tables 1 through 4 and tables 8 through 13 were weighted by W1PARENT. This weight is used to estimate characteristics associated with the HSLS:09 student target population and include adjustments for school and student nonresponse as well as parent nonresponse using student characteristics. 3 For tables 5, 6, and 7, ninth-graders' mathematics teacher estimates were weighted by W1MATHTCH. The mathematics teacher weight is used to produce subpopulation estimates for ninthgrade students enrolled in a mathematics course. The weight includes adjustments for school and student nonresponse as well as mathematics teacher nonresponse using only student characteristics. Ninthgraders' science teachers' estimates were weighted by W1SCITCH. This weight is used to produce subpopulation estimates for ninth-grade students enrolled in a science course. The weight includes adjustments for school and student nonresponse as well as science teacher nonresponse using only student characteristics."}, {"section_title": "A.6 Imputation", "text": "Imputation of values for missing items is also an important feature of the HSLS:09 data set. Despite the best efforts of data collectors, some questionnaire items remain unanswered. Completeness of some key student variables in HSLS:09 was also adversely affected by unit nonresponse at the parent level (for example, family income, parental educational attainment, and occupation, all critical components of the socioeconomic status [SES] index), or, more rarely, the failure of questionnaire completers to complete an assessment. Imputation addresses the problem of missing items. Advantages of using imputed values include the ability to use all study respondent records in an analysis (complete-case analysis) which affords more power for statistical tests. Additionally, if the imputation procedure is effective (i.e., the imputed value is equal to [or close to] the true value) then the analysis results are likely less biased than those produced with the incomplete data file. HSLS:09 variables in general did not suffer from high levels of item nonresponse. Nevertheless, a set of key analytic variables was identified for item imputation to facilitate complete-case analysis on data obtained from the participating ninth-grade students. Values were assigned in place of missing responses for 18 variables identified from the student and parent questionnaires through single-value imputation. Missing student ability estimates in mathematics (theta), the associated standard error of measurement (sem) for the theta, and socioeconomic status (SES) values derived from parent responses were replaced with five values using a multiple imputation procedure. Regardless of the method, indicator variables (flags) were created to allow users to easily identify the imputed values. 3 The use of different analytic weights may result in slightly different point estimates for the same variables within the dataset. The HSLS:09 First Look report, High School Longitudinal Study of 2009(HSLS:09): A First Look at Fall 20099th-Graders (NCES 2011, weighted the estimates by W1STUDENT. This weight is appropriate to apply in analyses of student-reported data. Because of the contextual focus of this report's analyses, this First Look report weighted the estimates by W1PARENT for parent-and student-provided information.

Other variables were classified as high risk and were suppressed from the public-use file.

Whether the statistical test is considered significant is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x 1 and x 2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups), and SE 1 and SE 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates."}, {"section_title": "A.9 Survey Standard Errors in This Report", "text": "Because the HSLS:09 sample design involved stratification, the disproportionate sampling of certain strata, and clustered (i.e., multistage) probability sampling, the resulting statistics are more variable than they would have been if they had been based on data from a simple random sample of the same size. Variance estimation is provided through two means: BRR (Balanced Repeated Replication) provided on both public-and restricted-use files and a Taylor series linearization (available on the restricted use file). The BRR approach to calculating HSLS:09 standard errors is recommended, although both methods give similar results. The HSLS:09 analyses included in this report used the BRR procedure to calculate standard errors."}, {"section_title": "A.10 Definitions of Analysis Variables", "text": "A list of definitions and sources for the variables used in this report is presented below.
