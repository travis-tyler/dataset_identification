Detecting AD at the earliest possible stage is vital to enable trials of disease modification agents and considerable efforts are being invested in the identification and replication of biomarkers for this purpose.\nSuch biomarkers currently include measures of tau and amyloid beta (Ab) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measures of Ab pathological load using positron emission tomography (PET). All these approaches are promising, although molecular imaging is currently a costly procedure available in relatively few centers and lumbar puncture is moderately invasive. Furthermore, repeated measures are problematical in both cases.\nBlood (plasma) on the other hand is a more accessible biofluid suitable for repeated sampling. This led many groups including ours to investigate the potential of a diagnostic signal in blood. Using a case-control study design with a gel-based approach (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) two proteins (complement factor H [CFH] and alpha-2-macroglobulin [A2M]) were observed as potential markers of AD [1] , both of which were subsequently replicated by independent groups [2, 3] . In the same study we observed changes in serum amyloid P (SAP), complement C4 (CC4), and ceruloplasmin, all of which have been implicated in AD pathogenesis [4] [5] [6] . However, case-control studies are problematical when there is a long prodromal disease phase. In such instances a large proportion of apparently normal controls already harbors the disease processes and hence may already have a peripheral biomarker disease signature. To overcome the limitations of case-control design, we searched for proteins associated with surrogates of disease severity (hippocampal atrophy and clinical progression), and identified Clusterin as a marker associated with both these surrogate measures [7] . Building on this \"endophenotype\" discovery approach we subsequently found transthyretin (TTR) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) to be associated with faster declining AD subjects and increased plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels related to increased Ab burden in the brain [8, 9] .\nThese studies, and those from other groups, have identified a set of proteins that might act as biomarkers relevant to AD. However such findings require replication, in large studies, ideally using samples drawn from more than one cohort source and using a platform that enables multiplexing. We therefore developed multiplex panels using our discovery proteins together with additional putative candidate biomarkers that have been implicated in AD and neurodegeneration (Supplementary Table S1 ).\nThe aims of the current study were (1) to validate a set of blood-based biomarkers in a large multicenter cohort with specified a priori outcome variables of the disease endophenotype measure of atrophy on MRI and of clinical severity and (2) to determine the accuracy of a multiplexed panel of disease relevant biomarkers in predicting conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia in a defined time period."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and clinical classification", "text": "Plasma samples from AD, MCI subjects and elderly nondemented controls were selected from three independent studies.

Standardized clinical assessment included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognition and for global levels of severity the Clinical Dementia Rating (ANM and KHP-DCR only).

The advent of high throughput multiplex platforms facilitates the replication of such findings and raises the potential of high throughput multiplexed markers for use in clinical practice and in clinical trials [21] [22] [23] . In this study we have used a multiplex antibody capture platform to determine if our putative biomarkers are associated with early disease stages and might have value as prognostic markers. Using MRI as a surrogate of disease pathology we identified a number of proteins that were associated with atrophy either early in the disease process (MCI) or in established dementia.\nThis approach of using MRI as a proxy for in vivo pathology has previously been shown to be useful in biomarker discovery, including in our study identifying Clusterin as a putative marker of disease [7] . In this study we identified RANTES, NSE, and transthyretin, in addition to Clusterin, to be associated with cortical atrophy in the MCI group, with Clusterin showing the strongest correlation with all brain regions assessed. The other proteins have previously been implicated in AD. RANTES, also known as chemokine ligand 5, is a protein known to have an active role in recruiting leukocytes into inflammatory sites. We find a negative association between RANTES and ventricular volume, suggesting a decreased level with increased disease related pathology; the opposite to previous reports in neurodegeneration [24] [25] [26] . One possible explanation might be that because we observe RANTES association with atrophy only in MCI and not in AD, perhaps a decrease early in disease process is followed by an increase. Similar findings have been previously reported for other proteins [27] and we also observe a similar relationship with NSE, the second protein we observe in association with brain atrophy. This protein is thought to be an indicator of acute neuronal damage [28, 29] and has been associated with AD in some but not all previous studies [30, 31] . We find a positive association between NSE and volume of hippocampus and whole brain in MCI subjects, but in the AD group we find a positive association instead with ventricular volume. This inverse relationship with atrophy in predisease and then positive correlation with atrophy in disease suggests to us, that like RANTES, NSE might be decreased in early disease stages (i.e. MCI) with a rebound elevation in established AD.\nIn established AD we observe a different set of proteins associated with disease severity as measured by atrophy on MRI, in line with this concept of disease phase specific biomarkers. A number of these belong to the group of apolipoproteins (ApoE, ApoC3, and ApoA1). We found these proteins were negatively associated with hippocampal, entorhinal cortical, and whole-brain volumes. The roles of apolipoproteins in neurodegenerative disorders have been studied extensively because the discovery that APOE was a major susceptibility gene for AD [32, 33] . In the peripheral system, ApoE serves in the transport of triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol into cells [34] . The literature on ApoE is conflicting with some groups reporting lower ApoE in AD [35, 36] , with others showing increased levels [37, 38] . ApoE plasma measurements derived from this study have been recently published and are in agreement with the findings from the North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which reports an APOE genotype effect [39] .\nOur present findings suggest that we have identified a panel of plasma biomarkers, associated with neuroimaging measures of disease, which may serve as readily accessible markers of early disease severity. Moreover, we identify a set of 10 protein biomarkers that can prospectively predict disease conversion from MCI to AD within a year of blood sampling. These results are supported by other evidence that plasma proteins can have a role in early disease detection, with inflammatory proteins in particular being identified as possible predictors of conversion from MCI [23, 40] . It is important to note that when attempting to compare such biomarker studies, the lack of standardized reagents, particularly antibodies may result in different outcomes reflecting technical differences between analytical platforms more than disease biology. Therefore our ability to replicate these proteins using an orthogonal approach (mass spectrometry in discovery, multiplexed immune capture in replication) makes these findings particularly powerful and robust. Moreover, combining MRI with protein measures did not improve predictive power in contrast to previous studies where CSF marker performance was improved in combination with MRI [41] . Although this study is built on findings from previous discovery-led and replicated findings, further replication will be needed. Ideally such replication should be in large, longitudinal, population-based cohorts. Such a study would be able to address potential confounds of the data reported in this study including site-specific effects and representativeness of the cohorts. Further studies will also be needed to address specificity. The markers we have identified are often altered in other disease areas-inflammation, cardiovascular, respiratory, dental, and others-and it will be important to distinguish the relative overlap and confounding by these diseases. However, although the protein participants in the panel we have identified are often altered in other disease states, these diseases are all different and therefore the panel itself may show specificity even if the participants do not. This remains to be determined. It also remains to be seen whether the panel we have identified is specific to AD or shows biomarker utility in relation to other dementia syndromes. Although we used an assessment protocol that we have previously shown is highly accurate in distinguishing AD from other dementias based on post-mortem confirmation, it will be interesting in due course to correlate the behavior of our panel to specific markers of dementia pathology such as biochemical or imaging measures of Ab and tau.\nIn summary, using a multiplexing approach we have validated a plasma protein panel as a marker reflecting disease severity and for predicting disease progression within three large multicenter cohorts. Such a marker set may have considerable value in triaging patients with early memory disorders, to other more invasive approaches such as molecular markers in CSF and PET imaging, in clinical trials and possibly in clinical practice.
