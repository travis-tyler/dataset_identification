Fatigue is primarily considered to be an energy disorder and a large proportion cannot be attributed to underlying diseases (4) . It has been hypothesized that age-related decreases in mitochondrial function may contribute to higher levels of age-related fatigue (5) (6) . The capacity for oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle is lower in older compared to younger adults; however, more recent evidence shows this difference varies across muscle groups and appears largely attributable to decreased physical activity (7-12). Peak aerobic capacity (VO 2 peak) also decreases significantly with age, independent of muscle loss and physical activity level (13) , and is considered a hallmark manifestation of mitochondrial disorders (14) . Hence, age-related decreased capacity for mitochondrial energy production may contribute to higher levels of fatigability via lower aerobic capacity. Little is known, however, about the etiology of age-related fatigue, particularly as it relates to mitochondrial energetics (5-6).\nFatigability, similar conceptually to exercise tolerance, is fatigue anchored to an activity of a specific intensity and duration (6) . Fatigability, as opposed to global fatigue, provides insight into the degree to which an individual is limited physically due to fatigue (6, 15) . The primary objective of this research was to determine if skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity determined by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31 P MRS), was related to higher levels of fatigability in older adults. We hypothesized that that those with higher compared to lower fatigability would have lower skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. We also hypothesized that physical activity would attenuate this relationship and VO 2 peak would act as a mediator."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Community-dwelling (n = 37) men and women aged 70-89 years from the Pittsburgh, PA area were enrolled into the Study of Energy and Aging Pilot.

Phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery after exercise was used to quantify rates of mitochondrial ATP production. 31 P MRS has been validated by animal and human studies showing that ATPmax varies in direct proportion to oxidative enzyme activity of healthy muscle (22) (23) and corresponds to mitochondrial content in human muscle (24) . ATPmax had good reproducibility illustrated by a high correlation (r = 0.92) 6 between same day repeat scans of 8 participants and Bland Altman analysis (Supplemental Figure 1 ).\nThe exercise protocol was performed in an MRI magnet (3T TIM Trio, Siemens' Medical System). Participants laid supine with the right knee (unless contraindicated) elevated at ~30 o .\nStraps were placed over the legs and a 2.5\" surface RF coil tuned to 31 P was placed over the quadriceps. Signal was collected by a hemisphere defined by the coil radius (1.25\"), which we previously confirmed using an image generated by a similarly sized coil (24) . Participants kicked repeatedly as hard and as fast as they could for two bouts (30s and 36s), each followed by a 6-minute rest. The protocol was designed to deplete PCr stores by 33-66% to ensure high signal to noise defining PCr recovery without inducing acidosis (pH < 6.8), which inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. PCr recovery rate (ATPmax) was measured after exercise until PCr returned to baseline levels.\nPhosphorus spectra were collected using a standard one pulse experiment to determine levels of PCr, ATP, Pi, PDE (phosphodiesters) and pH throughout exercise and recovery. PCr, Pi, PDE and ATP peak areas in the fully relaxed spectra were measured by integration using Varian VNMR 6.1C software (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Areas of the PCr and Pi peaks were expressed relative to the ATP peak (Supplemental Table 2 ). Previous analyses of human vastus lateralis muscle biopsies revealed that ATP content accounted for the range of PCr/ATP levels determined by MRS among participants aged 65-80 (24) . In contrast, PCr was stable (as was total creatine) and averaged 27 mM. Thus, as previously reported (16), we used 27 mM PCr to determine ATPmax. Changes in PCr and Pi peak areas during the tests were analyzed as previously described (25) (26) .\nSeven participants were missing ATPmax, four due to inadequate PCr breakdown or acidosis and three because of metal deposits or claustrophobia that precluded testing."}, {"section_title": "Determination of Muscle Size and Oxidative Capacity of the Quadriceps", "text": "MRI was used to determine quadriceps volume as previously described (27) .

Immediately following the walk participants rated their perceived exertion (RPE) using the Borg scale (6-20)\n(28) and were categorized as high fatigability (RPE \u2265 10) or low fatigability (RPE \u2264 9). This cut point was established in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which showed that this threshold is associated with substantially poorer physical functioning (15) . The same test was used for each person in order to compare fatigability levels across individuals for the same standardized task (5-6). Oxygen consumption was measured during the walk and mean VO 2 was calculated. Immediately following the test blood lactate levels were assessed by finger stick using a portable lactate analyzer.

Finally, adjustment for osteoarthritis had no effect on the relationship between either ATPmax or ATPmax\u2022quadriceps volume with fatigability."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The capacity for oxidative ATP synthesis, assessed with 31 P MRS (ATPmax and ATPmax\u2022muscle volume) was lower in older adults with higher levels of fatigability. To our knowledge, this is the first study to have examined the relationship between mitochondrial energetics and fatigability in older adults. The inverse association between ATPmax and fatigability is consistent with research showing patients with mitochondrial disorders possess lower levels of exercise tolerance than controls (29) . This is also consistent with data from mitochondrial gene ANT1-knockout mice, a model for chronic ATP deficiency, displaying lower exercise tolerance and higher fatigability compared to wild type (30) . Additionally, ATPmax and ATPmax\u2022quadriceps volume are highly related to aerobic capacity in older adults (31), as skeletal muscle ATP production is one of the two major components comprising VO 2 peak, and both decrease with age (13, 24) . Reduced cardiac output, the other major component of VO 2 peak, may also contribute to higher fatigability independent of ATPmax (32). Nonetheless, impaired mitochondrial energy production may be a specific factor that contributes to higher levels of fatigability via lower aerobic capacity.\nAnother key finding was that participants with high fatigability had to utilize a higher proportion of VO 2 peak to walk at the same speed compared to those with lower fatigability.\nThere are several mechanisms related to mitochondrial function to consider. First, it is possible that the source of energy, i.e., mitochondrial and glycolytic, to maintain walking speed was related to fatigability, however this was not reflected by blood lactate levels during steady-state walking. Second, impaired ATPmax may contribute to a reduced ability to replenish high energy phosphates (e.g. PCr) from inorganic phosphate (Pi) (33), leading to a buildup of Pi, which is associated with muscle fatigue (34). Additionally, it is possible that when mitochondrial energy production approaches maximum capacity or is depleted, a sensation of fatigue is elicited as a response (5). For example, Fiser et al. showed that those with slower gait-speed reached a significantly higher proportion of VO 2 peak and had higher RPE (i.e. fatigability) during a submaximal walking test (35) . Our data extend these findings by suggesting that mitochondrial function may be in the etiologic pathway of fatigability and ultimately slowed gait (16) . This is also supported by our finding that time to walk 400m was significantly slower in the high fatigability group. These data also advance the \"Energetic Pathway for Mobility Loss\" theory postulated by Schrack et al. (36) , which states that the maximum capacity for energy (VO 2 peak) decreases with age (13), restricting the availability of energy for everyday activities eventually leading to mobility loss in older age. Our data suggest that impaired mitochondrial function may contribute to lower availability of energy and VO 2 peak in older adults, which induces fatigability and may subsequently exacerbate decreased physical activity levels and mobility. The potential role of impaired mitochondrial function in age-related mobility loss is supported by the finding of Coen et al. in this cohort that lower ATPmax is significantly associated with slower usualpaced 400m walking time (16) . This is bolstered by two other studies showing that mitochondrial function is impaired in sedentary compared to active older adults (11) and that lower functioning older adults possess greater mitochondrial dysfunction compared to higher functioning (37) .\nFurther, fatigue is independently associated with lower SPPB scores and slower walking speeds (2) as well as a significant predictor of future functional decline (3). Thus, interventions aimed at improving mitochondrial energy production may be effective at lowering fatigability (exercise tolerance), resulting in sustainable increased physical activity levels and ultimately mobility in older adults. In order to establish directionality and causality, it is important to study the longitudinal relationships between age, physical activity, VO 2 peak, fatigability, mitochondrial function and mobility.\nThe relationship between ATPmax and fatigability was attenuated after adjustment for physical activity. This was not surprising as ATPmax is closely associated with physical activity (8) and we did not have a large enough sample to detect an independent relationship.\nMitochondrial dysfunction may be a contributor to, as well as a consequence of, age-related declines in physical activity. For example, mitochondrial dysfunction activates apoptotic pathways in skeletal muscle and activation of these pathways may contribute to sarcopenia (38) , which may result in decreased physical activity levels. However, more recent work shows that aged, compared to young, skeletal muscle fibers are more susceptible to mitochondrial mediated apoptosis independent of lower oxidative capacity (9) . Although decreases in physical activity likely initiate the process, lower ATPmax may exacerbate age-related decreases in physical 13 activity by contributing to the age-related loss of VO 2 peak and exercise tolerance (i.e. higher fatigability). Further, increasing ATPmax may be a mechanism by which physical activity can lower fatigability. These relationships warrant further longitudinal study.\nThis study had several strengths. Mitochondrial function was measured in vivo, which reflects actual mitochondrial energy production in the living skeletal muscle as opposed to energy production measured in isolated mitochondria from muscle biopsy (39) . Fatigability was measured following a standardized performance test, eliminating any contextual and recall biases associated with self-reported fatigability. This study also had limitations. The small sample size limited our ability to detect independent relationships. Thus, other benefits of physical activity that may lower fatigability could not be separated from higher ATPmax. Although fatigability was assessed following a performance test, a certain degree of subjectivity remained as participants rated their perceived exertion, as opposed to an observed deterioration in performance. This cohort of older adults was also relatively healthy and high functioning, thus it remains unclear whether mitochondrial function contributes to fatigability in lower functioning, more frail populations. However, it was encouraging that in a relatively homogenous cohort in regard to physical function, we saw relationships between ATPmax and fatigability.\nIn conclusion, we provide novel evidence showing that impaired mitochondrial function may be implicated in the etiologic pathway of age-related fatigability. Understanding the etiology of fatigability is vital to preventing and treating declines in physical function. Impaired mitochondrial function may lead to higher levels of fatigability by contributing to lower maximal aerobic or reserve capacity. Physical inactivity may initiate the process; however, improving mitochondrial function may improve fatigability, which may then increase physical activity levels due to improved exercise tolerance. The causal role of impaired mitochondrial function 14 and lower aerobic capacity in age-related fatigability needs to be studied longitudinally and in a larger population of older adults across a wider range of physical function."}, {"section_title": "FUNDING:", "text": "This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health (grant number 1RC2AG036594-01 and 1RC2AG036606)"}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:", "text": "Participants Notes: Values are mean \u00b1 (SD), RPE = rating of perceived exertion, ATP = adenosine triphosphate, * = significant difference between fatigability groups, p < 0.05 Table 3 Maximal mitochondrial ATP production defined as phosphocreatine recovery in the quadriceps, following an acute bout of exercise, measured by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, multiplied by quadriceps volume.
