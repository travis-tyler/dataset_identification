[{"section_title": "", "text": "Rural areas of the U.S. have been experiencing out-migration of young, educated adults, or \"brain drain\", for a long time. Theodore Roosevelt's 1907 establishment of the County Life\nCommission was due in part to concern about, \"the apparent tendency of the smartest and most promising young people in the countryside to move to cities\" (Danbom, 1995, 167) . But with increased attention to the role of human capital in economic growth brain drain issues are receiving a renewed emphasis today. Human capital and knowledge are key drivers of economic growth. A better educated workforce improves the ability of local businesses to adapt to change, process new information, adopt technology and respond to emerging market opportunities.\nHigher levels of human capital facilitate networking and the spread of ideas, heighten social capital and are associated with increased entrepreneurial activity and small business development (Barkley, Henry and Li, 2005) . Clustering of college educated workers may have spillover effects, enhancing a region's productivity and the potential for economic growth (Gottlieb and Fogarty, 2003) .\nA related body of research has contributed to a heightened interest in migration patterns of college-educated workers. Despite decades of research, the question of whether people follow jobs or jobs follow people remains unresolved. The traditional view held jobs, and hence business development, came first. More recently, particularly with the work by Richard Florida on the creative class, there is support for the alternative, that is, jobs follow people. After all, it is people who create businesses and therefore jobs. The thinking goes that if a state or region can attract or retain college-educated workers, job creation will follow.\nCertainly the concern about brain drain is not a uniquely rural problem. Studies document the out-migration of educated youth from cities like Pittsburgh and Cleveland (Hanson, et al, 2003; Gottlieb, 2001) . But for rural communities, both the incidence and the consequences of brain drain may be more severe. Regions that have lost population, like the largely rural Great Plains, tend to experience brain drain. There is a type of adverse selection at play, whereby the most educated people, who are also the most economically mobile, are the first to leave (Feser and Sweeney, 1998) .\nWhile the dense nature of cities generally provides a variety of employment opportunities for college-educated workers, rural areas suffer from a \"thin\" labor markets problem. Not only are the jobs fewer and far between, but a mismatch between labor demand for high-skills in rural areas and the skills of local educated youth contributes to out-migration from many rural areas (Mills and Hazarika, 2002; Huang et al. 2002) . The problem is only exacerbated for working couples (Costa and Kahn, 2000) . Out-migration from rural areas also imposes more immediate costs on the less mobile who are left behind. In a world of economies of scale, declining populations and dwindling tax bases make it increasingly difficult for rural communities to deliver public services efficiently (Kilkenny, 2009 ).\nDespite these challenges, brain drain from rural areas is not a given. Some rural counties are gaining in their share of college-educated workers (Gibbs and Cromartie, 1994; Artz, 2003) .\nThere is also evidence that many young people would remain in or move to rural areas if available job opportunities were comparable in type and pay to jobs in urban areas (Brown, et al. 1997; Mills and Hazairka 2004; Shields, Goetz, and Wang 2005) .\nGiven the critical importance of this problem for rural communities there is a surprising lack of information about the causes and consequences of rural region brain drain. This is not to say that states haven't tried to do something about it. From college scholarship programs to tax breaks for twenty-somethings to letter writing campaigns urging former residents to return, a variety of policies solutions have been proposed and implemented in an attempt to slow or reverse the tide of brain drain (Wirtz, 2003) . But it's unclear if any of these have been made a difference. Should communities and states try to keep their young educated residents from leaving the first place? Should policies target former residents? Should states attempt to attract more out-of-state students to their colleges in the hope that these students will chose to stay after graduation? A better understanding of the factors affecting rural residence choice of collegeeducated adults may help improve policy design and targeting.\nWe examine data on the residence choice of college-educated adults using a unique dataset resulting from a 2007 stratified random sample survey of 25,000 Iowa State University (ISU) Alumni graduating between 1982 and 2006. As a large Land Grant university in one of the more rural states in the U.S., ISU attracts a large number of students who were raised in rural areas. The survey asks respondents about where they were raised and where they resided after graduation in addition to a variety of questions about their careers subsequent to graduation.\nApproximately 5400 responses were received. In addition, the information from the survey has been matched to student records containing information about majors, coursework, extracurricular activities and residential status while at ISU.\nWe use the Economic Research Service's rural-urban continuum codes to define rural, including codes 6 though 9 as our definition of rural 1 . The most recent (2003) codes were used to define current residence status, while the 1993 version of the codes were used to define origin status for all but the most recent alumni.\nExplanations for rural brain drain focus on two primary drivers: economic opportunity and quality of life. To various degrees, rural areas of the U.S. lack both. Jobs, especially high skilled jobs are located predominately in cities. Quality of life, broadly measured by all the attributes that make a place attractive to live varies across locations (Black, Kolesnikova, and Taylor; 2009 While family and quality of life factors are important, they can be difficult to quantify.\nFurthermore, recent research finds that, particularly for young college educated workers, employment opportunity is the primary concern in choosing where to live (Chen and Rosenthal; Roughly three of every ten respondents were raised in a rural location, yet only one in ten currently resides in a rural county. Alumni who grew up in a rural location are more likely to currently reside in a rural county than those who were raised in urban locations. Three-fourths of rural residing alumni were raised in a rural location.\nOne of the main obstacles in stopping or reversing rural brain drain is the fact that young, single, college-educated people are the most footloose group in our society (Franklin, 2003) .\nNew college graduates face national job markets and enter professions in which experience is important for career advancement. Young people often move away from home upon graduating from college in order to find a suitable entry-level position. Relative to other workers, recent college graduates are less likely to be married, have children, or own their home, all factors which tend to increase the costs of moving and therefore reduce the likelihood of long-distance moves. These factors also influence the choice of metropolitan areas over more rural places. A recent Pew Research Center survey finds most young people prefer large cities (El Nasser,"}, {"section_title": "2009).", "text": "However, studies have shown that a prior migration experience increases subsequent mobility (for example, Faggian, et al, 2007) . Out-migration of younger college educated workers may be offset by net gains in older, more experienced college-educated workers (Hunt, 2009; Gibbs and Cromartie, 1994) . In the 1990s rural America as a whole experienced net losses of 20 to 29 year olds, but net in-migration of adults in their 30s and 40s (Johnson, 2006) .\nMigration decisions of adults in their 30s and 40s may be influenced more by 'quality of life'\nand family issues and relatively less by job market opportunities (Graves; 1979; Sandefur, 1985; Feridhanusetyawan, 1994; Peri, 2001; Von Reichert, 2002) .\nTo examine the location choices of alumni by age, table 2 breaks down the percentage of alumni raised in rural counties and currently residing in rural counties by graduation cohort. The most recent graduates have the greatest share of alumni currently living in a rural county. Some of this can be explained by the greater proportion of rural raised students in these cohorts. As noted in table 1, rural raised alumni are more likely to choose rural residences after graduation.\nTo account for this, we construct an approximate retention rate in the rightmost column by dividing the percent living in a rural county in 2007 by the percent raised in a rural county for each cohort. In essence, this measures the proportion of rural students who chose a rural residence after graduation. By this measure, it appears that conditional on growing up in a rural county, alumni in their 30s and 40s are somewhat more likely to currently reside in a rural area.\nA large proportion of migrants are repeat movers, and a significant fraction of repeat movers are return migrants (Kennan and Walker; . Attachments to particular places, whether in the form of accumulated knowledge or familiarity about a place, social or family ties, tend to increase the potential benefit of return migration (DaVanzo, 1988; Dierx, 1988) . The vast majority of respondents to our survey ( hometown and as such have had less time for their location specific capital to depreciate. They may also be more likely to require financial support from their parents. Between 11 and 13 percent of cohorts more than ten years out of college had returned to their home county. These data suggest that many recent graduates return home or stay in Ames upon graduating but later migrate away to other places. It does appear that older alumni are more likely to reside in a rural area conditional on growing up rural, but not necessarily in the same rural county in which they were raised."}, {"section_title": "Education", "text": "Anecdotal evidence from our interaction with rural raised students suggests that many choose their majors in at least in part because they intend to return to a rural area, perhaps the family farm, after graduation. One-quarter of alumni in rural counties have a graduate degree compared with 38 percent living in urban counties."}, {"section_title": "How do rural college graduate goals differ from their urban counterparts?", "text": "Given the typically higher returns to a college degree in urban areas relative to rural areas, the fact that some ISU alumni are choosing to settle in rural counties may reflect not only differences in their training and interests, but also differences in their attitudes toward work. Our survey asked respondents to rank a series of factors important in choosing a job or particular field in which to work on a Likert scale ranging from 1 representing \"not important at all\" to 5\nindicating \"very important\". Table 4 reports the mean responses for urban and rural residing alumni along with a statistical test to determine if the means were significantly different.\nOn average, rural residents ranked non-pecuniary goals such as carrying on a family tradition and building a business for children to inherit significantly higher than did urban residents. Rural residents placed greater importance on having freedom in their work, fulfilling a personal vision and following the example of someone they admired than their urban peers.\nThey were also more concerned about earning the respect of their friends. In contrast, urban residents rated the importance of high income or wealth and the creation of new products or ideas significantly higher than did rural residents."}, {"section_title": "How do rural college graduates differ from their urban counterparts in occupation and income?", "text": "For most working-age people, economic opportunity is of primary concern. Most of us earn a living by working, either for someone else or for ourselves and as a result, migration and Traditionally, the industries important to rural areas employed a large share of low-skill workers.\nGibbs, Kusmin and Cromartie (2005) estimate that low skill jobs comprised 42.2 percent of nonmetropolitan jobs in 2000, roughly one-fourth larger than the share in metropolitan areas (34.0 percent). However, they also find that the share of low-skilled jobs fell faster in nonmetropolitan areas than in metro areas. The authors contend that this trend is a consequence of rising job skill requirements across industries, due partly to capital-labor substitution particularly in manufacturing, but also to rising demand for professional, technical and managerial skills.\nThis suggests rising opportunities for some college-educated workers in rural areas of the U.S.\nCertainly, the fit between an individual's skills and training and the jobs available in a particular region is an important aspect of residence choice. In this section, we examine employmentrelated characteristics of alumni respondents and their relationship to residence choice."}, {"section_title": "Employment", "text": "The vast majority of respondents reported working at least part-time for themselves or someone else. A greater share of rural residents reported working part-time (9.8 percent for rural; 6.9 percent of urban residents). Alumni living in rural counties also had higher selfemployment rates: roughly 15 percent of alumni living in rural counties reported being selfemployed compared with 7.4 percent of alumni in urban counties.\nSurvey respondents were asked to report all the industries in which they had worked since graduation (table 5) . Two industries dominate rural alumni's employment experience; nearly a third of rural alumni reported working in agriculture while another 30 percent had worked in education. Urban alumni's employment experiences are more evenly distributed among industries.\nAlthough the industries varied, there was some overlap in the types of occupations held by rural and urban alumni. For both, the most common occupation was professional and technical, with sales and related occupations and service sector occupations ranking among the top five most common occupations on both lists. Occupations in farming, fishing and forestry ranked fourth highest for rural residents and chief executives ranked fifth. For urban residents, marketing and sales managers and computer and information systems managers rounded out the top five."}, {"section_title": "Self-Employment", "text": "Self employment can provide flexibility and a degree of independence in addition to a way for some people to remain in, or relocate to, a chosen location, frequently one close to where they grew up (Tosterud and Habbershon, 1992) . This option may be especially important for rural areas where high skill job opportunities are less common. In fact, previous research has found that, relative to metropolitan residents, non-metropolitan residents have higher rates of self-employment (Robinson, 2006) . Our data reflect this as well: 14.8 percent of alumni living in rural counties reported being self-employed, either full-time or part-time. This compares with 7.4 percent of urban alumni residents. Similar to the statistics for jobs held by rural alumni, the most common industry for rural business start-ups was agriculture. One-third of rural businesses started by ISU alumni were related to agriculture (table 6 ). The next most common industry for rural business startups was retail. At the time of the survey entrepreneurs who started businesses in rural areas were slightly more likely to still have ownership of their businesses than those in urban areas: 73.6% of rural businesses were still operational and owned by the time of the survey, 2.62% higher than urban businesses. However, it is noteworthy that rural entrepreneurs who closed, sold or passed down their businesses, tended to leave for urban areas. Of the entrepreneurs who left their rural business, 40 percent were living in urban areas at the time of the survey."}, {"section_title": "Income", "text": "One of the major explanations for rural brain drain is that urban areas offer higher returns to education than do rural areas. Kusmin, Gibbs and Taylor (2008) report that college graduates earn 23 percent less in nonmetropolitan areas even after controlling for personal characteristics. Table 7 reports average earnings for urban and rural residing ISU alumni by educational achievement, graduation cohort and college of degree. These data suggest that, on average, urban alumni earn 57 percent more than rural alumni. The earnings differential appears to widen with experience: for the youngest cohort of alumni the urban to rural income ratio is 1.16, while for those who graduated before 1991, the ratio is roughly 1.70. As suggested above, the demand for college graduates in rural labor markets is lower than in urban labor markets and is found in different industries. The bottom panel of table 6 shows average earnings for rural and urban alumni by the college of their degree. The smallest income gaps are seen in agriculture and human sciences (which includes education), the two most prevalent sources of jobs for rural alumni. While cost of living differences and a willingness to accept lower wages in exchange for living in a more desirable location may explain some of this rural-urban income gap, it is noteworthy that the majority of ISU alumni in rural areas work in industries where this earnings gap is lowest."}, {"section_title": "Explaining the choice of rural residence", "text": "Comparison of the characteristics of rural and urban residents provides some insight into is not necessarily the case the rural raised alumni are returning to their home counties.\nHolding a bachelor's from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences increases the probability of living in a rural location after graduation, while Engineering graduates are significantly less likely to live in a rural location. Having an advanced degree reduces the likelihood of choosing rural. Other personal characteristics also influence the choice of rural residency. The probability of living in a rural county increases with age and with being married.\nNon-white individuals are less likely to reside in rural counties.\nThere are significant differences in alumni career preferences related to the choice of a rural residence. Rural alumni place greater value on non-pecuniary career goals such as fulfilling a personal vision or building a business for children to inherit, while placing less emphasis on earning great wealth or developing new products. , 1982-1986 , the farm economy and presumably rural economic opportunity has rebounded. Furthermore, the periods in which the cohort effects are significant correspond to sharp increases in net farm income. The increased probability of choosing a rural residence might therefore be cyclical and not trending."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Policy Implications", "text": "These data reveal a number of interesting patterns relevant for understanding which Land\nGrant graduates choose to locate in rural areas. First, it is noteworthy that most ISU alumni stay in, or relatively close to, Iowa. This certainly contradicts the perception perpetuated in journalistic accounts that hordes Midwestern youth are moving to big cities like New York and Los Angeles. However, we do find strong evidence of brain drain from rural to urban counties.\nSeventy-five percent of rural-born alumni resided in urban counties in 2007.\nThere are a few strong predictors of which graduates choose to live in rural counties. The most likely rural alumni are rural born with degrees from the College of Agriculture. One note of caution here is that this finding may be unique to Land Grant Universities which attract a large number of rural-born students into their agricultural programs. Rural alumni place greater emphasis on non-pecuniary career goals than their urban counterparts. Another interesting implication of these data is that older alumni are somewhat more likely to live in rural counties, but not necessarily in the county in which they were raised. At the same time, interest in rural life appears to be increasing, at least conditional on the farm economy.\nThese data also show a large income gap between rural and urban alumni, which widens with experience and advanced degrees. Notably, the gap is fairly small for the most recent cohort of graduates and for fields in which rural labor demand is stronger, agriculture and human sciences.\nWhen it comes to the problem of brain drain, virtually all the attention is paid to location decisions of young (i.e. 22 to 29 year old), college educated workers. Frequently the focus is even narrower, considering only science and technology graduates, presumably the next generation of professionals in the nation's high growth industries. As a result, brain drain policy solutions tend to be college scholarship programs aimed either at keeping resident students in state for school or bringing non-residents students in. The hope is that at least some of these students will choose to stay in the state after graduation. This policy strategy prevails despite the fact that existing research on the location choices of college graduates suggests the link between the supply of and demand for college graduates within a state is relatively weak (Bound, et al, 2004; Groen, 2004) . Focusing all brain drain policy on keeping students in state to attend college misses the point that if they do not find a commensurate way to make a living in the state upon graduating they will leave.\nPolicies aimed at improving individuals' opportunities, like scholarship programs, tend to increase geographic mobility, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Our analysis suggests that given appropriate economic opportunities, whether working for someone else or creating one's own business, some college graduates are attracted to rural locations. Finding ways to foster economic and entrepreneurial opportunities for college graduates in rural communities could complement the current supply-oriented policies and ultimately lead to rural economic development. Not only did the alumni entrepreneurs in our survey create economic opportunities for themselves in rural counties, they provided more than 16,000 full time jobs for others as well.\nRecent research on rural business success finds that rural businesses have higher survival rates than similar urban firms . Successful promotion of rural entrepreneurship could trigger a virtuous cycle. As rural entrepreneurs achieve success, creating job opportunities and improving quality of life, fewer young educated people may be pushed to leave for urban areas, stemming future brain drain from rural to urban areas. Note: Alumni who are student, retired, homemaker or unemployed are excluded. The education achievements are exclusive. Alumni who have multiple degrees will be counted into groups according to their highest degrees. Doctor's degree is regarded to be higher, than a master's degree. Professional degree is regarded to be terminal. "}]
