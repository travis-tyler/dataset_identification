The data collection began in the 2010-11 school year, when the children in the sample were in kindergarten, and will continue through the spring of 2016, when most of the children in the sample are expected to be in fifth grade. This brief report provides information from the data collection conducted in the spring of 2014, when the majority of the students were in third grade. The ECLS-K:2011 provides information on students' status at school entry, on their transition into school, and on their progression through the elementary grades. The longitudinal nature of the ECLS-K:2011 data enables researchers to study how a wide range of family, school, community, and individual factors are associated with educational, socioemotional, and physical development over time. Information is being collected from the students, their parents and guardians, their teachers, and their school administrators. Information was also collected from their before-and after-school care providers in the kindergarten year. The ECLS-K:2011 is the third in a series of longitudinal studies of young children conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), within the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences. The other studies in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) program are the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). This report is intended to provide a snapshot of the children in the ECLS-K:2011 cohort who were in kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year and in third grade 3 years later during the spring of 2014. 1 Information is presented on selected child and family characteristics, such as poverty status, parental education, family type, and primary home language (table 1), obtained when the children were in kindergarten. Information is also provided on the children's knowledge and skills in reading (table  2), math (table 3), and science (table 4) in the spring of third grade, both overall and by the selected kindergarten-year child and family characteristics. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the results presented in this report. Although many of the characteristics examined may be related to one another, the complex interactions and relationships among them were not explored. It should also be noted that the variables examined here are just a few of the several thousand that can be examined in the ECLS-K:2011 data. The selected findings present examples of the estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. All comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. All differences reported are statistically significant at the p < .05 level and are at least one-fifth of a standard deviation in size. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons. Appendix A provides technical documentation for the estimates presented in this report, a glossary describing the variables, and general information about the study. Appendix B reports the standard errors for the estimates.

Westat, Inc., assisted with the design of the study and collected the data upon which this report is based. The students participating in the ECLS-K:2011 are being followed longitudinally from kindergarten (the 2010-11 school year) through the spring of 2016, when most are expected to be in fifth grade. This sample of students is designed to be nationally representative of all students who were enrolled in kindergarten or who were of kindergarten age and being educated in an ungraded classroom or school in the United States in the 2010-11 school year, including those in public and private schools, 1 those who attended full-day and part-day programs, those who were in kindergarten for the first time, and those who were kindergarten repeaters. The ECLS-K:2011 places an emphasis on measuring students' experiences within multiple contexts and development in multiple domains, including cognitive, socioemotional, and physical development. The study is designed to collect information from students as well as from their parents and guardians, teachers, schools, and before-and after-school care providers. The estimates in this First Look report are based on the data collected from students, in the form of direct assessments in reading, mathematics, and science, and on information collected from the students' parents or guardians during the kindergarten parent interview. The estimates pertain only to those children who attended kindergarten for the first time in the 2010-11 school year and who were in third grade in the spring of 2014. About 88 percent of children enrolled in kindergarten in 2010-11 were in kindergarten or an ungraded equivalent for the first time that school year and were in third grade in the spring of 2014. The remaining 12 percent includes children who were repeating kindergarten in 2010-11 or who were not in third grade in the spring of 2014, including children who were retained or advanced to a grade other than third or who were in an ungraded classroom or setting in the spring of 2014."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "A nationally representative sample of approximately 18,170 children from about 1,310 schools 2 participated in the base-year administration of the ECLS-K:2011 in the 2010-11 school year. The sample included children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. The ECLS-K:2011 cohort was sampled using a multistage sampling design. In the first stage, 90 primary sampling units (PSUs) were selected from a national sample of PSUs. The PSUs were counties and county groups. In the second stage, public and private schools educating kindergartners (or ungraded schools educating children of kindergarten age) were selected within the PSUs. Finally, students were sampled from the selected schools. The schools were selected from a preliminary version of the frame developed for the 2010 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which contained information about public schools that were included in the 2006-07 Common Core of Data Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey and private schools that were included in the 2007-08 Private School Universe Survey. The NAEP frame had not yet been updated and, therefore, was not final at the time it was obtained for use in the ECLS-K:2011. For this reason, a supplemental frame of newly opened schools and kindergarten programs was developed in the spring of 2010, and a supplemental sample of schools selected from that frame was added to the main sample of study schools. In the third stage of sampling, approximately 23 kindergartners were selected from a list of all enrolled kindergartners (or students of kindergarten age being educated in an ungraded classroom) in each of the sampled schools."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Fall and spring data collections were conducted in the 2010-11 school year, when all study children were in kindergarten; in the 2011-12 school year, when most study children were in first grade; in the 2012-13 school year, when most study children were in second grade; and in the spring of 2014, when most children were in third grade. This report features the data collected in the spring of 2014. The spring third-grade data collection included base-year respondents who attended schools within all 90 sampled PSUs. Due to the increased data collection costs associated with following students who transferred from their original sample school, in each round of data collection only a subsample of these students was followed into their new schools. The spring third-grade direct child assessments were conducted from March through June of 2014, with approximately 79 percent conducted in April and May of 2014. Information on the child and family characteristics used in this report (children's race/ethnicity, household poverty status, parents' highest level of education, family type, and primary home language) was collected through interviews with parents in the children's kindergarten year. Most parent interviews were conducted by telephone; however, they were conducted in person for parents who were unreachable by telephone or who preferred an in-person interview. The respondent to the parent interview was usually a parent or guardian in the household who identified himself or herself as the person who knew the most about the child's care, education, and health. The parent interview was fully translated into Spanish before data collection began and could be administered by bilingual interviewers if parent respondents preferred to speak in Spanish. Because it was cost prohibitive to do so, the parent interview was not translated into other languages. However, interviews could be completed with parents who spoke other languages by using an interpreter who translated from the English during the interview."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "The child assessment data presented in this report come from the spring third-grade collection. The weighted child assessment unit response rate 3 was 79.9 percent for the spring third-grade data collection. The overall response rate for the child assessment, which takes into account the base-year school-level response rate (62.7 percent), was 50.1 percent for the spring third-grade data collection. The household characteristic data, such as poverty status, parents' highest level of education, family type, and primary home language, come from the parent interview kindergarten waves of collection. The weighted parent unit response rates were 74.2 percent for the fall kindergarten data collection and 67.1 percent for the spring kindergarten data collection. The overall response rates for the kindergarten parent interviews, which also take into account school-level response, were 46.7 percent for the fall kindergarten data collection and 42.1 percent for the spring kindergarten data collection. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to determine if substantial bias was introduced as a result of nonresponse. To examine the effect of school nonresponse, estimates from the ECLS-K:2011 schools were compared to those produced using frame data (i.e., data from the Common Core of Data and the Private School Universe Survey). The differences in the two sets of estimates are very small, suggesting there is not significant nonresponse bias present in the data. To examine the effect of nonresponse for data collected through instruments that have a response rate lower than 85 percent, in this case the kindergarten parent interviews and the third-grade child assessment, estimates produced using weights that include adjustments for nonresponse were compared to estimates produced using weights without nonresponse adjustments. Additionally, for the parent interview data, estimates from the ECLS-K:2011 were compared to those from other data sources (for example, the National Household Education Surveys Program). The results of these nonresponse bias analyses also suggest that there is not a substantial bias due to nonresponse after adjusting for that nonresponse. The item missing rate for the variables in the analytic sample used in this report is generally low (less than 1 percent). The exceptions were poverty status in the spring of kindergarten, which has an item missing rate of 14 percent, and family type in the fall of kindergarten, which has an item missing rate of 8 percent. The item-level missing rates for parents' highest level of education were 2 percent for the first parent identified in the household and 3 percent for the second parent identified in the household. Even though the item-level nonresponse rate was relatively low, missing parent education data were imputed. This was done because parent education and other variables were used to create a measure of household socioeconomic status that is provided in the data file. More information on item-level missing data and hot-deck imputation can be found in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011 "}, {"section_title": "Data Reliability", "text": "Estimates produced using data from the ECLS-K:2011 are subject to two types of error: nonsampling and sampling errors. Nonsampling errors are errors made in the collection and processing of data. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample rather than a census of the population."}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Errors", "text": "Nonsampling error is the term used to describe variations in the estimates that may be caused by population coverage limitations as well as by data collection, processing, and reporting procedures. The sources of nonsampling errors are typically nonresponse, differences in respondents' interpretations of the meaning of survey questions, response differences related to the particular time when the survey was conducted, and mistakes in data preparation. In general, it is difficult to identify and estimate either the amount of nonsampling error or the bias that it causes. In the ECLS-K:2011, efforts were made to prevent such errors from occurring and to compensate for them where possible (e.g., by field-testing items and assessments, using survey questions that had been tested and used in previous surveys, conducting multiday assessor/interviewer training, holding assessor certification sessions, and monitoring assessor/interviewer performance and field data quality throughout the collection period). Another potential source of nonsampling error is respondent bias, which occurs when respondents systematically misreport (intentionally or unintentionally) information in a study. One potential source of respondent bias is social desirability bias, which can result when respondents provide information they believe is socially desirable or acceptable but that does not accurately reflect the respondents' characteristics or experiences. An associated error occurs when respondents give unduly positive reports about those close to them. For example, parents may give a better assessment of their children's reading ability than might be obtained from a direct assessment. If there are no systematic differences among specific groups under study in their tendency to give socially desirable or unduly positive responses, then comparisons of the different groups will provide reasonable measures of relative differences among the groups. The information in this First Look report is based on items from the kindergarten parent interviews and third-grade child assessments. Analysis of potential bias due to item nonresponse is typically conducted for those items with a response rate less than 85 percent. As noted earlier, most of the items used in this report had an item-level missing rate below 1 percent and none had a response rate lower than 85 percent. The child assessment data are not reported out at the item level, so it is not appropriate to discuss item-level nonresponse rates in this regard."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Errors and Weighting", "text": "The ECLS-K:2011 data are weighted to compensate for unequal probabilities of selection at each sampling stage and to adjust for the effects of school, teacher, before-and after-school care provider, child, and parent nonresponse. The sample weights used in the ECLS-K:2011 analyses were developed in several stages. 4 The first stage of the weighting process assigned weights to the sampled PSUs that are equal to the inverse of their probability of selection. The second stage of the weighting process assigned weights to the schools sampled within the selected PSUs. The base weight for each sampled school is the PSU weight multiplied by the inverse of the probability of the school being selected from the PSU. The base weights of responding schools were adjusted to compensate for nonresponse among the set of eligible schools. These adjustments were made separately for public and private schools. To compute the kindergarten base weight for each student in the sample, the school nonresponse-adjusted weight for the school the student attended was multiplied by the within-school student weight. The withinschool student weight was calculated separately for Asian/Pacific Islander (API) students and non-API students to account for the oversampling of API students. 5 For API students, the within-school student weight is the total number of API kindergarten students in the school divided by the number of API kindergarten students sampled in the school. For non-API students, the within-school student weight is the total number of non-API kindergarten students in the school divided by the number of non-API kindergarten students sampled in the school. The student-level base weight was then adjusted for nonresponse for different components of the study. The weights developed for use in the analysis of the data collected in third grade are derived from the kindergarten student base weight. The spring third-grade student base weight is the base-year student base weight adjusted for base-year nonresponse. The estimates in this report were weighted by W7C7P_20. This weight was computed from the spring thirdgrade child base weight adjusted for nonresponse to the data collection instruments that are the sources of information featured in this report to minimize bias in the estimates. That is, this weight is adjusted for nonresponse to the parent interview in the fall or spring of kindergarten and for nonresponse to the spring third-grade child assessments. In addition to properly weighting the data in this report, special procedures for estimating the statistical significance of the estimates were employed, because the data were collected using a complex sample design. A complex sample design, like that used in the ECLS-K:2011, results in data that violate the assumptions that are normally required to assess the statistical significance of results. Statistical tests of significance from sample surveys require information about standard errors. The standard errors of the estimates from complex sample surveys may vary from those that would be expected if the sample were a simple random sample and the observations were independent and identically distributed random variables. Using the statistical software Stata, the jackknife replication variance estimation method was used to compute approximately unbiased estimates of the standard errors of the estimates in the report. 6"}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance at the p < .05 level to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. When comparing estimates within categorical groups (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity), Student's t statistics were calculated. The formula used to compute the t statistic is where x1 and x2 are the estimates being compared and SE1 and SE2 are their corresponding standard errors. With sample sizes as large as that of the ECLS-K:2011, t-scores greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96 are significant at the .05 level of significance. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant. In this report, differences are considered substantively meaningful if they are at least one-fifth of a standard deviation in size. Therefore, only differences that are statistically significant at the p <. 05 level and are at least one-fifth of a standard deviation in size are reported. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Direct Cognitive Assessments: Reading, Math, and Science", "text": "In the third-grade data collection, children were assessed in reading, math, and science. The assessments were administered directly to the sampled children on an individual basis by trained and certified child assessors. The longitudinal design of the ECLS-K:2011 requires that the cognitive assessments be developed to support the measurement of change in knowledge and skills demonstrated by children from kindergarten entry through the spring of fifth grade. To that end, the majority of the items included in the third-grade assessments had been included in the second-grade assessments. However, to ensure that the assessments adequately measured the knowledge and skills of the children as they progress through school, new, more difficult items were added to the assessments in third grade and the easiest items, reflecting lower level firstgrade skills, were omitted. The ECLS-K:2011 reading, math, and science specifications were based on the frameworks developed for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Although the NAEP assessments are administered starting in fourth grade, the specifications were extrapolated down to lower grades based on current curriculum standards from several states and, for math, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. The frameworks necessarily cover content strands applicable to a range of content at different grade levels-for example, from number sense (i.e., basic knowledge of numbers) to algebra in mathematics. Content appropriate for most third-graders was included in the assessments used in the spring of 2014. While the assessments were designed to contain mostly items that assessed knowledge and skills at a thirdgrade level, easier and more difficult items were included to measure the abilities of students performing below or above grade level. The reading assessment included questions measuring basic skills (e.g., word recognition), vocabulary knowledge, and reading comprehension. Reading comprehension questions asked the child to identify information specifically stated in text (e.g., definitions, facts, supporting details); to make complex inferences within texts; and to consider the text objectively and judge its appropriateness and quality. The mathematics assessment was designed to measure skills in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and problem solving. The assessment consisted of questions on number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and patterns, algebra, and functions. The science assessment domain included questions about physical sciences, life sciences, Earth and space sciences, and scientific inquiry. Most sampled students participated in the cognitive assessments regardless of disability status or home language; however, there were some exceptions. Students whose Individualized Education Program (IEP) indicated that they should not participate in standardized assessments were excluded from the assessments. Also, students who required an assessment in Braille, students who required a sign language interpreter, and students whose IEP required them to be assessed using large-print materials were excluded from the assessments because the study did not provide these accommodations. Although these exclusions do result in the assessment data not being generalizable to students with these particular needs, this accounts for less than 1 percent of all students. To the greatest extent possible, other necessary accommodations were allowed (for example, allowing a health care aide to be present during the assessment). Unlike the kindergarten and first-grade data collections, a language screener was not used in third grade for children whose home language was not English. By the spring of first grade, nearly all children (99.9 percent) were routed through the assessment in English; therefore, the language screener was not administered beyond the spring of first grade. All children were assessed in English in the spring of third grade. For the third-grade rounds of data collection, the overall testing time for each child was expected to be approximately 60 minutes, with more time allotted for the reading assessment (30 minutes) than for the mathematics and science assessments (approximately 10-15 minutes each). In addition to the reading, mathematics, and science assessments, children's executive function was assessed, measures of children's height and weight were collected, and for a subsample of children information on hearing was collected. For a full description of the data collected from the child, please see Chapter 2 of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011), User's Manual for the ECLS-K:2011 Kindergarten-Third Grade Data File and Electronic Codebook, Restricted Version (Tourangeau et al. forthcoming). For the reading, mathematics, and science assessments, the ECLS-K:2011 employed a two-stage assessment in which children were administered a set of items appropriate to their demonstrated ability level rather than all of the items in the assessment. Although this procedure resulted in children being administered different sets of items, there was a subset of items that all children received (the items in the routing tests, plus a set of items common across the different second-stage forms). These common items were used to calculate scores for all children on the same scale. Broad-based scores using the full set of items administered in the kindergarten through third-grade assessments in reading, math, and science were calculated using item response theory (IRT) procedures. IRT is a method for modeling assessment data that makes it possible to calculate an overall score for each domain measured. IRT has several advantages over raw number-right scoring. By using the overall pattern of right and wrong responses and the characteristics of each item to estimate ability, IRT can adjust for the possibility of a low-ability child guessing several difficult items correctly. If answers on several easy items are wrong, the probability of a correct answer on a difficult item would be quite low. Omitted items are also less likely to cause distortion of scores, as long as enough items have been answered to establish a consistent pattern of right and wrong answers. This First Look report presents information on children's IRT-based overall scale scores in reading, math, and science from the third-grade data collection round. The IRT-based overall scale score for each content domain is an estimate of the number of items a child would have answered correctly in each data collection round if he or she had been administered all of the questions that had been included in the assessments for that domain in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and third grade. To calculate the IRT-based overall scale score for each domain, a child's IRT ability estimate (theta) is used to predict a probability for each assessment item that the child would have gotten that item correct. Then, the probabilities for all of the items fielded as part of the domain in every round are summed to create the overall scale score. Because the computed scale scores are sums of probabilities, the scores are not integers."}, {"section_title": "Glossary: Constructs and Variables Used in the Analyses", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reading, Math, and Science Scores", "text": "Reading [X7RSCALK3].

Parents provided information during the kindergarten year (2010-11). In the spring of 2012, the spring of 2013, and the spring of 2014, parents were asked to provide information on child's ethnicity and race if these data were missing or had not been confirmed by a parent in a prior round. Parent respondents were asked to indicate whether their child belonged to one or more of the following races: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In addition, each parent respondent was asked to identify whether his or her child was Hispanic or Latino. Hispanicity and race were used to create eight mutually exclusive categories: White, not Hispanic; Black or African American, not Hispanic; Hispanic, race specified; Hispanic, no race specified; Asian, not Hispanic; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, not Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native, not Hispanic; and Two or more races, not Hispanic. The data file includes the categories \"Hispanic, race specified\" and \"Hispanic, no race specified\" because some parents reported a race for their Hispanic children, while others did not.

Parent respondents first were asked to report their household income using a standard list of income categories. If a respondent reported a household income that indicated that the household was close to or lower than 200 percent of the U.S. Census Bureau poverty threshold for a household of its size, the respondent was asked to report household income to the nearest $1,000 (referred to as exact income). Poverty classification was determined using the reported income category; exact income, when necessary; and household size. Preliminary weighted 2010 Census poverty thresholds were used to define household poverty status. 7 Households with a total annual income below the appropriate threshold were classified as being below the federal poverty level. Households with a total income at or above 100 percent, but below 200 percent, of the poverty threshold were classified in a middle category (100 to 199 percent of the federal poverty level). Households with a total income at or above 200 percent of the poverty threshold were categorized as being at or above 200 percent of the federal poverty level. For example, if a household with two members had an income lower than $14,220, the household was classified as below the federal poverty level. If a household with two members had an income of $14,220 or more, but less than $28,440 (200 percent of the poverty threshold for a household of two), the household was classified at 100 to 199 percent of the federal poverty level.

If English was the only language spoken in the home, or if a language other than English was spoken in the home but the primary language of the household was English, a student was classified as coming from a home in which the primary language was English. If a language other than English was the primary language spoken in the home, a student was classified as coming from a home in which the primary language was not English, even if English was also spoken. In some instances, children lived in a home where more than one language, including English, was spoken, and the parent respondent could not choose a primary language. These children are coded in a third category indicating that a primary language was not identified. Children whose parents indicated they spoke more than one language equally are also categorized in the third category.
