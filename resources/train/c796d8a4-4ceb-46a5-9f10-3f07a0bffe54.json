[{"section_title": "APS March Meeting 2020", "text": "March 3, 2020 More women are in other STEM fields 5 20% women with physics bachelor's Compared to other fields in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), women are more underrepresented in physics. Across all fields in academia (not just STEM), women earned 57% of all bachelor's degrees, showing that women are over-represented among bachelor's degree recipients. Based on 2017 data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), women earned around 60% of bachelor's degrees in biological science, 50% of degrees in chemistry, 40% of degrees in mathematics, and 35% of degrees in astronomy. Women earned only around 20% of bachelor's degrees in physics, engineering, and computer science. The representation of women earning STEM doctorates tells a similar story. Physics, engineering, and computer science had the lowest percentage of women among doctorate recipients. Data was analyzed based on results from the 2017 Survey of Earned Doctorates distributed by the National Science Foundation.\nMarch 3 2020 Global Survey of Scientists Contractor: Employment resources \u2022 Women were significantly less likely to report having enough: \u2022 Equipment (73% of women had enough) \u2022 Technical support (69%) \u2022 Travel money (63%) \u2022 Funding (62%) \u2022 Clerical support (61%) \u2022 Employees or students (54%) 16 Overall, the majority of women (54%-73%) reported having enough resources. There were no significant gender differences for the following resources: office space, lab space, computing power, access to data, and access to literature. This is similar to our findings in the 2010 Global Survey of Physicists. It appears that even though women are performing a similar amount of employment activities as men in 2018, they still seem to report having less resources in their careers.\nMarch 3 2020 Global Survey of Scientists Contractor: Family influences \u2022 33% of women took a career break, mostly for family reasons \u2022 After becoming a parent, women were significantly more likely to: \u2022 Spend less time at work (43% of women) \u2022 Choose a more flexible schedule (42%) \u2022 Feel their career or promotion rate slowed (30%) \u2022 Change their employer or field (10%) \u2022 Become a stay at home parent (7%) \u2022 Get demoted or lose their job (3%)\nMarch 3, 2020 Qualitative analysis approach \u2022 Asked two questions: \u25aa \"What has helped you succeed in your career?\" \u25aa \"What have been the barriers to your career?\" \u2022 Read over 1,700 quotes and organized them into categories \u25aa Used inductive analysis processes \u25aa Includes only those who chose to respond 20 It is important to note that the answers to these two open-ended questions are not representative of everyone who did the survey. Not everyone chooses to answer these questions. During qualitative analysis, we read all the quotes from open-ended responses, and organized the content of those quotes into meaningful categories. In inductive analysis, categories are not defined before starting the analysis, and we did not create a list of categories in advance. Instead, we created categories or codes organically as we read each quote for the first time. This is a process called open coding, and is done to prevent our own assumptions from influencing the analysis. A single quote could be coded with multiple open codes. After coding each individual quote, we went over all the quotes again, revised them, and organized them into broader categories or themes. We show examples of how we did this process in the next slide.\nMarch 3, 2020"}, {"section_title": "APS March Meeting 2020 March 3, 2020", "text": "Minority women in physics 7 When comparing different racial/ethic groups, African American, Hispanic, and Native American women are underrepresented in physics. Out of all women earning physics bachelor's degrees in 2017, Hispanic women were 8% of bachelor's degree recipients and African American women were 4% of bachelor's degree recipients. Over time, the number of Hispanic women earning physics bachelor's degrees is increasing, while the number of African-American women has not changed much. These groups are underrepresented among physics doctorate recipients as well. Hispanic and African American women were 3-5% of female physics doctorate recipients in 2017. The number of Native American women were not reported in this figure due to small group sizes. We want to protect their identifiability. The number of African American women shown here may be influenced by changes in how the NCES asked race/ethnicity questions. Starting in 2008, NCES added a \"two or more races\" category to their questionnaire. African-American women selecting \"two or more races\" were not included in these numbers after 2008, which might explain the slight decrease in African American women shown in more recent years.\nWomen's representation in departments is increasing\nMore women hired into higher-level positions 9 Among new faculty hires in physics departments, more women are being hired into tenured, tenure-track, and permanent positions over time. In 2018, women were 32% of new hires, which suggests that women are being hired at higher rates than men. If they were hired at similar rates, women would be 20% or less of new hires, which is the percentage of women who earned physics doctorates in the past. Most respondents in the survey worked in academia (70%). On the survey, the gender question only included \"men,\" \"women,\" and \"prefer not to respond\" as options. Other gender identities were not included due to cultural reasons. In some countries, identifying as any other gender identity could lead to negative consequences, so the option was not included to protect at-risk individuals in those countries from being identified. Women are over-represented in this sample due to sampling methods. We used snowball sampling to recruit more women, and the percentage of women in the international physics population is probably lower than 37%. For all four variables, regressions showed that gender differences were significant even controlling for other factors. Overall, most people had positive experiences in their doctoral programs. Program quality: 87% of men and 84% of women rated their program as excellent, very good, or good Advisor relationship: 87% of men and 80% of women rated their advisor relationship as excellent, very good, or good My program treated everyone fairly: 76% of men and 63% of women agreed Other students were respectful of everyone: 84% of men and 72% of women agreed  50% of women and 49% of men served on conference planning committees. 75% of women and 81% of men supervised undergraduate students. Other non-significant gender differences in employment activities include: attended a conference abroad, conducted research abroad, served on a committee for a grant agency, served on a committee at an institution or company, acted as a leader for a scholarly association, served on a dissertation or thesis committee (not as an advisor), and gave a public talk or interview. These findings differ from our Global Survey of Physicists (2010) performed ten years ago. We asked the same exact question in the 2010 survey and the current survey. In 2010, men were more likely to report acting as a manager, journal editor, graduate supervisor, or invited speaker. We can think of two potential reasons why we no longer find gender differences in these survey items. 1) We have a different sample than before or 2) More women are doing these activities than 10 years ago.\n2011 PhD Plus 10 Project \u2022 1,860 mid-career physics PhD recipients from the classes of 1996, 1997, 2000, and 2001 \u25aa PhD programs in the United States \u25aa 45% working in academia, 34% private sector, and 15% government, and 6% in another sector \u25aa 14% female 19 This study contacted mid-career professionals who earned their physics doctorates 10-15 years prior to 2011 in the United States. We surveyed professionals working in multiple employment sectors to examine more diverse career experiences. Within our sample, most participants were male and worked in academia. In this analysis, we only compared men and women, and did not examine other gender identities.\nWhat types of success factors did they discuss most?\nWhat helped them succeed? (Ten most discussed success factors) Here I have listed the ten most frequent codes discussed by men and women. Interestingly, men and women mention very similar success factors. Both genders discussed the role of hard work in their success the most often, and reported the value of mentors, problem-solving, colleagues, flexibility, passion, persistence, education, and interpersonal skills. Men more often discussed how experience in certain fields (e.g. computer science, mathematics, physics, technology) helped them succeed, while women more often discussed how support from friends and family helped them succeed. Women also discussed how experience in certain fields helped them succeed, and men discussed how friends and family helped them succeed. These factors in success are important and valued by both genders, but one gender discussed them more often than the other. That is why these factors only appear in the 10 most frequent list for one gender and not the other. All 47 codes can be viewed in the online report in the appendix section here: https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/physics-phds-ten-years-later-success-factorsand-barriers-career-paths Men more often discussed not enough having enough interpersonal skills, and a lack of interest in their work. They also reported more organization-level issues, such as issues getting promoted (not receiving tenure or not being considered for management positions), working for administrators who don't support science, or navigating bureaucratic processes. Many discussed how their specialty or field is looked down on in their work environment. In certain academic departments, teaching or specific subfields in physics are not valued, while in certain industry settings, a background in science or research is not valued. Women reported more issues with a lack of resources, such as hot having enough staff, students, equipment, or others to collaborate with. They reported more difficulties working with mentors who were neglectful, gave bad advice, or unsupportive. They also reported more issues with gender bias in the workplace such as not being respected or seen as an equal by their colleagues, or being treated on a different standard than male colleagues. This was mostly reported in academic work settings. Once again, all these barriers were discussed by both genders, but with different levels of frequency. Therefore, some may appear in the 10 most frequent barriers for one gender but not another. All 40 codes can be viewed in the report online in the appendix: https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/physics-phds-ten-years-later-success-factors-andbarriers-career-paths"}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "In physics departments, the percentage of women among almost all faculty positions has increased over time."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": "16% of men and 33% of women reported taking a break in their career. 2/3 of women took a break for family reasons, \u00be of men took a break for non-family reasons. Men were also significantly more likely to report that their career did not change after having children."}, {"section_title": "Analysis example", "text": "Success quote: \"Support and collaboration with intelligent and generous colleagues\" Open code \u2192 supportive colleagues and collaborations Broader category \u2192 social support Barrier quote: \"There are not many jobs in physics in my current location\" Open code \u2192 difficulty obtaining employment Broader category \u2192 career opportunity barrier"}, {"section_title": "21", "text": "These examples show how we assigned categories to each quote. Open codes more closely represent what is described in the quote, and the broader categories indicate the larger themes the participants discussed. There were 47 codes for quotes about career success factors. The categories for career success factors were: career opportunities, education and career background, organizational support, personal drive, skills and abilities, and social support. There were 40 codes for quotes about career barriers. The categories for career barriers were: career opportunity barriers, education and career background barriers, gender/race/ethnicity barriers, organizational barriers, personal drive barriers, skill and ability barriers, and social barriers."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Looking at the broader categories, men more often discussed education, career background, and skills or abilities as success factors in their careers. Education and career background includes discussions about the quality of their graduate programs, their physics training, training in other scientific fields, and experience in previous jobs. Skills and abilities include various traits like problem solving, communication, teamwork, writing, presenting, programming, or research. Women more often discussed social support as success factors, including family, friends, mentors, colleagues, and students. Both genders reported personal drive as important factors, including hard work, persistence, and passion for their work. Overall, both genders seemed to attribute most of their success to personal factors like personal drive, skills, or abilities. They less often discussed outside factors like organizations in their success."}]
