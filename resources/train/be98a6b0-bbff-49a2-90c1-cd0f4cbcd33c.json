[{"section_title": "", "text": "The needs and capabilities of schools may differ; thus, schools implement a variety of practices intended to prevent and reduce violence (Peterson, Larson, and Skiba 2001). However, little is known about the prevalence of school practices and the extent to which they vary according to school characteristics. This Issue Brief (1) examines principals' reports of the prevalence of formal practices in public schools designed to prevent or reduce school violence and (2) describes the distribution of these practices by selected school characteristics. This analysis is based on school-level data reported by principals participating in the school year 2003-04 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), administered by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). 2 The estimates presented here complement those in the NCES report Indicators of School Crime andSafety: 2006 (Dinkes et al. 2006), which reported on the safety and security measures taken by schools in school year 2003-04. In addition to including updated estimates, this analysis reports on additional safety and security practices, such as the use of security officers at public schools, and a variety of other approaches intended to prevent and reduce school violence. There are many approaches designed to prevent and reduce violence in schools. However, this study examines (1) efforts to involve parents in preventing and reducing violence (2) safety and security procedures and (3) allowable disciplinary policies. 3 In addition to reporting the data by standard school characteristics, the study presents results by principals' self-reports of community crime. 4 Among efforts to involve parents, 59 percent of schools formally obtained parental input on policies related to school crime and 50 percent provided parental training to deal with students' problem behaviors. In addition, 21 percent of schools involved parents at school to maintain discipline (table 1). 5 For each of the following safety and security procedures examined, less than half of the schools used any one of the six procedures. Forty-five percent of schools had security officers or police present on a regular basis, 36 percent used one or more security cameras to monitor the school, 21 percent used dogs to conduct random drug checks, 14 percent required students to wear uniforms, 13 percent conducted random sweeps for contraband, and 6 percent performed random metal detector tests on students. In terms of the three disciplinary policies examined, 68 percent of schools allowed out-of-school suspension with no curriculum or services provided, 67 percent allowed transfer to a specialized school for disciplinary reasons, and 51 percent allowed removal from school for at least the remainder of the year with no services."}, {"section_title": "Differences by School Characteristics", "text": "School level. Primary schools were more likely than high schools to provide training for parents to deal with students' problem behaviors (55 vs. 38 percent) or involve parents at school to maintain school discipline (24 vs. 17 percent) (table 1). Four of the six safety and security measures were more common in high schools than in middle and primary schools. For example, a greater percentage of high schools than middle and primary schools used one or more security cameras to monitor the school (60 percent vs. 42 and 28 percent, respectively). In addition, a greater percentage of high schools than middle and primary schools had security officers or police present on a regular basis (72 percent vs. 64 and 34 percent, respectively). Differences were also found in allowable disciplinary policies by school level. For example, 85 percent of high schools allowed out-of-school suspensions, compared with 77 percent of middle schools and 60 percent of primary schools. Furthermore, a greater percentage of high schools than middle and primary schools allowed removal of a student from school for at least the remainder of the year (70 percent vs. 59 and 42 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Urbanicity.", "text": "A smaller percentage of rural schools than city schools provided training to help parents deal with students' problem behaviors (43 vs. 60 percent) or involve parents at school to maintain school discipline (17 vs. 31 percent). Schools in cities and urban fringe areas were more likely than rural schools to require students to wear uniforms (29 and 12 percent, respectively, vs. 5 percent). A greater percentage of city schools than rural schools performed random metal detector checks (12 vs. 3 percent) or had security officers or police present on a regular basis (51 vs. 38 percent). However, rural and town schools were more likely than city and urban fringe schools to use dogs to conduct random drug checks (31 and 32 percent vs. 11 and 16 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Level of crime.", "text": "Sixty-one percent of schools with students from high-crime areas had security officers or police present on a regular basis, compared to 39 percent of schools with students from low-crime areas. Schools with students from high-crime areas reported higher levels of all selected safety and security measures than schools with students from low-crime areas, with the exception of using dogs to conduct random drug checks. Drugs and weapons were provided as examples of contraband in the survey question."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "A specialized school was defined for respondents as \"a school that is specifically for students who were referred for disciplinary reasons. The school may also have students who were referred for other reasons. The school may be at the same location as your school.\" 3 Primary schools include those schools whose lowest grade is not higher than 3 and whose highest grade is not higher than 8. Middle schools include those whose lowest grade is not lower than 4 and whose highest grade is not higher than 9. High schools include schools whose lowest grade is not lower than 9 and whose highest grade is not higher than 12. All other schools with other combinations of grades have been omitted from this analysis. The Issue Brief series presents information on education topics of current interest. All estimates shown are based on samples and are subject to sampling variability. All differences discussed are statistically significant at the .05 level as measured by two-tailed Student's t tests (independent t tests for cross-sectional analyses); this means a difference is discussed only if the probability that it is due to chance (i.e., sampling variability) is less than 1 in 20. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. In the design, conduct, and data processing of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling error, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, or other systematic error.

Schools with 50 percent or more minority enrollment were more likely to involve parents at school to maintain school discipline than were schools with lower percentages of minority enrollment (30 vs. 13, 16, and 22 percent) 6 . Furthermore, 67 percent of schools with 50 percent or more minority enrollment made efforts to formally obtain parental input on policies related to school crime, compared to 57 percent of schools with 5 to 20 percent minority enrollment and 47 percent of schools with less than 5 percent minority enrollment. About one-third of schools (35 percent) with 50 percent or more minority enrollment required students to wear uniforms, compared to 10 percent or less of schools with smaller percentages of minority enrollment. Fifty-two percent of schools with 50 percent or more minority enrollment had security officers or police present on a regular basis, compared to 39 percent of schools with less than 5 percent minority enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This Issue Brief found that schools implemented a variety of school violence prevention and reduction practices and that some practices were more commonly used than others. In addition, practices differed by school level and other selected school characteristics. For example, high schools were more likely than primary schools to implement safety and security procedures, while primary schools were more likely than high schools to promote training for parents to deal with students' problem behavior. Also, schools in rural areas showed different patterns of practices than those in urban areas, with rural schools more likely to use dogs for random drug checks and less likely to use other practices-such as student uniforms, involving parents at school to maintain discipline, and random metal detector checks."}]
