[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) have consistently observed strong evidence of association with polymorphisms in APOE. However, until recently, variants at few other loci with statistically significant associations have replicated across studies. The present study combines data on 483,399 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previously reported GWAS of 492 LOAD cases and 496 controls and from an independent set of 439 LOAD cases and 608 controls to strengthen power to identify novel genetic association signals. Associations exceeding the experiment-wide significance threshold (a~1:03|10 {7 ) were replicated in an additional 1,338 cases and 2,003 controls. As expected, these analyses unequivocally confirmed APOE's risk effect (rs2075650, P~1:9|10 {36 ). Additionally, the SNP rs11754661 at 151.2 Mb of chromosome 6q25.1 in the gene MTHFD1L (which encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like protein) was significantly associated with LOAD (P~4:70|10 {8 ; Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.022). Subsequent genotyping of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r 2 w0:8) with rs11754661 identified statistically significant associations in multiple SNPs (rs803424, P = 0.016; rs2073067, P = 0.03; rs2072064, P = 0.035), reducing the likelihood of association due to genotyping error. In the replication case-control set, we observed an association of rs11754661 in the same direction as the previous association at P = 0.002 (P~1:90|10 {10 in combined analysis of discovery and replication sets), with associations of similar statistical significance at several adjacent SNPs (rs17349743, P = 0.005; rs803422, P = 0.004). In summary, we observed and replicated a novel statistically significant association in MTHFD1L, a gene involved in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway. This finding is noteworthy, as MTHFD1L may play a role in the generation of methionine from homocysteine and influence homocysteine-related pathways and as levels of homocysteine are a significant risk factor for LOAD development."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) [MIM 104300 ] is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairment affecting more than 13% of individuals aged 65 years and older [1, 2] and constitutes the most common form of dementia among older adults. While several major genes contributing to risk of Alzheimer Disease have been identified (APP [3] , PS1 [4] , PS2 [5] [6] [7] ), all but one (APOE [8] [9] [10] ) contributed predominantly to earlyonset forms of AD that cluster within families; other than APOE, few consistent association signals have been observed for late-onset AD (LOAD). Recent estimates of the heritability of LOAD fall between 60% and 80% [11] . However, while APOE e4-alleles elevate AD risk, only 50% of AD cases carry an APOE e4 allele, suggesting genetic factors elsewhere in the genome contribute to AD risk [12] .\nAt present, eleven studies have tested association with LOAD on genome-wide panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Most [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , but not all [23] , of these studies indirectly observed associations with APOE on chromosome 19q with strong experiment-wide statistical significance. However, only a few of the studies observed associations at other loci exceeded experimentwide statistical significance thresholds. A follow-up study [15] to Coon et al. [14] stratifying cases and controls by APOE genotype detected strong associations with GAB2 (MIM:606203) SNPs, and in follow-up work observed altered GAB2 transcript levels in vulnerable neurons, and an effect of GAB2 levels on tau phosphorylation; replication studies observed mixed results. In a family-based study of LOAD, Bertram et al. [17] observed four SNP associations exceeding adjusted experiment-wide thresholds for statistical significance, including one for the chromosome. Our group reported a SNP association with experiment-wide statistical significance on chromosome 12q13 [18] . A GWAS originating from the Mayo Clinic [19] identified a novel signal on the X chromosome in the gene PCDH11X (MIM: 300246), encoding a protocadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule expressed in the brain. Generally, these earlier reports have not been consistently replicated in other studies, possibly due to sample sizes that are substantially smaller than those of GWAS studies that have successfully identified genes for other complex disorders [24, 25] . Two large collaborative GWAS of LOAD examined many thousands of cases and controls [20, 21] and both identified novel association signals in the gene CLU (aka APOJ, MIM: 185430; Apolipoprotein J or Clusterin), as well as signals in CR1 (MIM: 120620, Complement Component Receptor 1) and in PICALM (MIM: 603025, Phosphatidylinositol-Binding Clathrin Assembly Protein), reporting some of the most consistent results for LOAD to date.\nEven with the increased sample sizes and improved statistical power to detect loci with moderate effect sizes, it remains unlikely that these studies, incorporating cases and controls from multiple samples with varying case/control inclusion criteria, have identified all loci with modest effect sizes in LOAD. We analyzed genome-wide association in a discovery dataset of 931 cases and 1,104 controls and performed replication analysis on the strongest associations (P,10"}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ") using genotype data from four existing studies totaling 1,338 cases and 2,003 controls. \n. Experiment-wide statistical significance for this association was observed with the addition of another 1,047 individuals in this study.\nWe did not observe associations with LOAD with experiment-wide statistical significance in any of the peak non-APOE signals identified in previous GWAS studies, including the APOJ/CLU SNP rs11136000 that was identified in both Harold et al. and Lambert et al. studies (analysis of this dataset reported elsewhere (Jun et al., in preparation)). Given the observed OR = 0.86 of rs11136000 for LOAD, in our sample of 931 cases and 1,104 controls, we had ,1% power to detect the observed effect at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for experiment-wide statistical significance, a = 1.03610 27 , suggesting that most significant associations of small or modest effect size would be missed in this study. The association of variation in PCDH11X and GAB2 was not observed in this dataset; the findings of these analyses are reported elsewhere [43] . In addition, we observed a strong association of the chromosome 12 SNP rs11610206 with LOAD, but not with genomewide statistical significance as observed in our previous GWAS [18] , suggesting that the findings of the Beecham et al. study, as with previous LOAD GWAS, may be subject to the ''winner's curse'' [44] .\nDespite a wealth of evidence for the role of chromosome 2 loci in Alzheimer's Disease, the chromosome 2q13 SNPs identified with experiment-wide statistically significant associations in the combined analyses, rs4676049 and rs17034806, do not fall in the vicinity of chromosome 2 regions of interest [22, 45] .\nBased on the patterns of studies emerging in other complex diseases, GWAS studies with sample sizes greater than the combined Lambert et al. and Harold et al. datasets may be necessary to validate associations observed in smaller GWAS studies and to identify susceptibility variants with more modest effects. This approach has been taken in type 2 diabetes, where a meta-analysis of 54,000 subjects confirmed multiple susceptibility Figure 1 .

Other approaches to identify new susceptibility variants are exploring the Common Disease-Rare Variants (CDRV) hypothesis, which aim to identify novel susceptibility loci for disease by assessing the aggregate effects of multiple rare variants in single genes on disease risk [46] .\nIn this genome-wide association study of LOAD, we identified a novel association with experiment-wide statistical significance in a gene with a potential biological role, MTHFD1L. We replicated this association in additional publicly-available genomewide association datasets, and observed statistically significant association with a similar effect size and direction at this SNP. In summary, MTHFD1L is an excellent candidate for LOAD on account of its involvement in folate-pathway abnormalities linked with homocysteine, a significant biological risk factor for AD.\n, extending models to adjust for APOE genotype (designated as the number of e4 alleles), age-at-onset in cases and age-at-exam in controls, and gender as covariates (Table S6 ).

SNPs adjacent to the APOE haplotype on chromosome 19 otherwise demonstrated the highest associations observed, with the peak association being rs2075650 with P~1:90|10 {36 , confirming the expected effect of APOE on LOAD risk in this sample. The most significant non-APOE SNP in our previous GWAS [18] (Table S3 ) was rs11610206 on 12q13 (45.92 Mb) with P~1:43|10 {6 ; in this study, this SNP was still strongly assoFciated with LOAD (OR (95% CI): 0.67 (0.54, 0.85); P~7:70|10 {4 ), but not with experiment-wide statistical significance.\nThe SNP rs11754661, located at 151.2Mb of chromosome 6q25.1 in the gene MTHFD1L, was significantly associated with LOAD (P~4:70|10 {8 ; Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.022).

We examined clustering plots from"}, {"section_title": "Author Summary", "text": "Studies looking for genetic variants across the genome that affect late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) have had little success identifying genes other than APOE. Here, we use an expanded set of AD cases and controls to improve our power to detect genetic variants driving LOAD risk. Analyzing 483,399 genetic variants across the genome in a discovery dataset of 931 cases and 1,104 controls, we found a strong association to the marker rs11754661 on chromosome 6 in the gene MTHFD1L, in addition to the highly replicated chromosome 19 APOE association. We genotyped adjacent variants on chromosome 6 in these same cases and controls and found these variants were also associated with LOAD. We replicated the association with rs11754661 and additional SNPs in MTHFD1L in a combined dataset of cases and controls from our laboratory and from publicly available datasets. This finding is important because the gene is known to be involved in biological pathways influencing levels of homocysteine, a significant risk factor for AD. Table 1 .

We found no evidence of a difference in genotype frequencies among controls across subsets by genotyping platform (Fisher's exact test P = 0.71) or by study center (Fisher's exact test P = 0.95, Table S4 ). We also examined differences in dataset characteristics including variation in age, sex, and APOE e4 genotype distributions, and found limited differences between subsets by study center, autopsy-or clinical-confirmation of case or control status, and by genotyping platform (Table S5 ). Subsequently, we examined the first hundred principal components generated from EIGEN-STRAT to determine if any of the principal components were associated with both differences in genotyping platform subset and disease status at P,0.05 as markers of potential systematic bias. While two principal components other than those used to adjust for population substructure showed association with both genotyping platform subset and LOAD, additional adjustment for these principal components did not change the strength of association between rs11754661 and LOAD (data not shown). Models further adjusting for age, sex, and APOE e4 carrier status (+/2) ( Based on the pattern of LD in the vicinity of rs11754661, we examined several haplotypes of MTHFD1L which included this SNP (described in Text S1) to identify potential markers for untyped variants associated with LOAD. Two haplotypes (the first comprising rs2073066-rs11754661-rs13201018, the second comprising rs2839947-rs11757561-rs2073066-rs11754661-rs13201018) both containing the risk-increasing A allele of rs11754661 had highly statistically significant associations similar to the genotypic association of rs11754661 (P~4:60|10 {8 and P~6:54|10 {8 , respectively) (Table S7) . Both haplotypes had similar frequencies (MHF) to the A allele of rs11754661 (MHF = 0.0696 and MHF = 0.0629, respectively).\nIn order to ensure that the association we observed at rs11754661 was not merely due to genotyping error, we genotyped four additional SNPs in MTHFD1L proximal to and in high LD (r 2 .0.8) with rs11754661.

MTHFD1L, which encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like protein, is involved in tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis, catalyzing the reversible synthesis of 10-formyl-THF to formate and THF, an important step in homocysteine conversion to methionine [26] . Elevated plasma homocysteine levels have been implicated in AD [27, 28] and other neurodegenerative disease including Parkinson's [29] , and have been recognized as a risk factor for pre-eclampsia [30] , diabetic complications [31] , and heart disease [32] . Interestingly, a recent GWAS of coronary artery disease (CAD) identified MTHFD1L as a CAD risk factor in both British and German populations studied [33] . Several potential mechanisms may explain this connection: hyperhomocysteinaemia may influence AD dementia by causing vascular alterations [34] ; it may cause cholinergic deficit due to toxicity to cortical neurons [35] ; several lines of evidence suggest that elevated homocysteine contributes to AD risk through increased oxidative stress [36] [37] [38] . On-going biological investigations are continuing to elucidate the pathways connecting elevated homocysteine with AD.\nMthfd1l protein has been reported to be decreased in the hippocampus in a mouse model of AD using a proteomic approach [39] . Homocysteic acid, derived from homocysteine and methionine, is elevated in these mice and treatment with antibodies to homocysteic acid reduced amyloid burden and inhibited cognitive decline in these animals [40] . B6-deficient diets lead to further increases in homocysteic acid in these mice.\nThat we observed an experiment-wide statistically significant association in MTHFD1L in addition to the associations of a number of APOE SNPs with LOAD risk is consistent with results from previous work. MTHFD1L is located on chromosome 6q25.1, near linkage signals observed in two prior genome-wide linkage studies of LOAD [41, 42] . The previous GWAS performed by our group [18] , from which nearly 1,000 individuals in the current study were drawn, observed a strong, but not experimentwide, statistically significant association between the same MTHFD1L SNP and LOAD at P = 2.01610"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics Statement", "text": "After complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained from all participants, in agreement with protocols approved by the institutional review board at each contributing center."}, {"section_title": "Ascertainment", "text": "Discovery dataset cases and controls were clinically ascertained through the Collaborative Alzheimer's Project (CAP) comprising the University of Miami John P.
