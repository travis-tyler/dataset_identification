Among these, apathy is one of the most common symptoms across all stages of AD [1, 2] , having negative impact on the progress of the individual's disease that lead to earlier institutionalization [3] , having a higher risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD [4] , and having faster functional [5] and cognitive decline [6] . Apathy is a disorder of the initiation, direction, and intensity of goal-directed behavior. It was initially defined by Marin [7] as a lack of motivation in behavior, cognition, and affect. Several lines of evidence coming from animal and pharmacological studies suggest that the pathophysiology of apathy could be at least partially explained by a dysfunction of the dopamine system. Dopamine appears to"}, {"section_title": "R. David et al. / Lack of Association Between COMT Polymorphisms and Apathy in AD", "text": "contribute more to the neuromodulation of incentive salience ('wanting') rather than to hedonic 'liking' or to 'learning' [8] . Additionally, several studies have reported that dopamine agonists tend to promote reward-seeking behavior, while dopamine antagonists tend to have the opposite effect [9] . Further, from a behavioral point of view, lack of initiative and interest in human apathy are close to the concept of 'wanting' in animal studies. This relationship must be considered carefully, however, since in animal studies, the term 'wanting' is used for concrete and particular stimuli such as food, drugs and their cues while humans subjects are dealing with more abstract and cognitively loaded incentives. Studies using functional brain imaging in humans suggest relationships between apathy and abnormal perfusion in several specific areas such as anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, and the related fronto-subcortical structures [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Considering the role of anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal regions in the reward system [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , apathy could be at least partially explained by a dysfunction of the dopaminergic system involving the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neural pathways. The role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of apathy is underlined by a recent study by Starkstein et al. [22] that found an association between apathy and increased Parkinsonism during the follow-up of AD patients, suggesting a common neural pathway for these two clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the benefits of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors in controlling motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease are well established [23] .\nCOMT is an enzyme involved in synaptic catecholamine inactivation that plays a role in the degradation of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. Several studies have reported relationships between changes in expression of COMT and neuropsychiatric disturbances or personality traits [24] [25] [26] [27] . More recently, Wang and colleagues found that a specific haplotype (rs4633-rs4680) of COMT was associated with several negative symptoms, including blunted affect and passive/apathetic social withdrawal, among subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia [28] . Because of the well-established pathophysiology of apathy involving the mesolimbic dopamine neural pathway and the role of COMT in the prefrontal cortex, we hypothesized that the presence of apathy could be associated with specific polymorphisms in COMT. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between apathy and the polymorphisms in COMT among Caucasian individuals diagnosed with AD.\n"}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sample", "text": "Nice/Stanford Cohort: 105 Caucasian individuals (age = 79.3 \u00b1 7.03 years; = 56/49; MMSE = 20.2 \u00b1 4.4) with a diagnosis of probable AD were recruited. This diagnosis was determined using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria [29] . The 105 participants in this cohort came from two sources: 63 were participants in an ongoing study at the Memory Disorders Clinic at the University of Nice School of Medicine and 42 were participants in an ongoing longitudinal study of AD at the Stanford/Veterans Affairs, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Core Center.\nAn additional 176 Caucasian individuals (age = 79.4 \u00b1 7.6 years; = 96/80; MMSE = 23.3 \u00b1 2.0) with a diagnosis of AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were also analyzed as a replication cohort.

As part of the protocol, neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [30] . The NPI was administered in a structured interview of a caregiver familiar with the subject. Participants were considered to have apathy if their NPI apathy domain score (frequency \u00d7 severity) was greater than three indicating clinically significant apathy [31] . Apathy was additionally assessed independently using a specific questionnaire for apathy, the Apathy Inventory (AI) [32] , designed to provide a separate evaluation of three dimensions of apathy: emotional blunting, lack of initiative, and lack of interest. Using previously established guidelines, participants with an AI total score greater than three were considered to have apathy [33] .\nIn the ADNI Cohort, apathy was assessed using the brief version of the NPI (NPI-Q) [34] . In this questionnaire completed by caregivers, each of the 12 domains of the full NPI is assessed by a single question (derived from the screening questions of the original NPI). Apathy was evaluated with the single question: \"Does he/she seem less interested in his/her usual activities or in the activities of others?\". Participants were con- sidered apathetic if the informant responded \"yes\" to this question."}, {"section_title": "Genotyping", "text": "DNA was extracted from saliva samples collected using Oragene DNA kits (DNA Genotek, Ontario Canada; DNA was extracted according to manufacturer's instructions).

Percentage of apathy according to the NPI/NPI-Q apathy cut-offs was respectively 49% in the Nice/Stanford Cohort and 32.4% in the ADNI Cohort.\nGenetic data for the 17 SNPs of interest were fairly robust, with call rates of 97.3% in the Nice/Stanford cohort and 99.1% in the ADNI Cohort. Comparison of genotypes distribution (Table 2) between the two cohorts, and with HapMap-CEU did not show major differences, indicating genetic comparability among the data sets. Examination of the association between presence of apathy and polymorphisms in COMT in the Nice/Stanford Cohort did not reveal any significant association when apathy was determined using either the NPI or the Apathy Inventory (Table 3) . Similar results were found in the ADNI Cohort with the NPI-Q.\nIn order to investigate how representative the seventeen examined SNPs were of the COMT gene (more than four hundred SNPs are referenced in gene region in NCBI Entrez SNP database), we performed an additional linkage disequilibrium analysis between all available in COMT gene region-SNPs (SNAP Proxy, http://www.broadinstitute.org). Twenty-four additional SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium at the r 2 = 0.7 threshold with the seventeen COMT SNPs available on Illumina chip.

David et al. / Lack of Association Between COMT Polymorphisms and Apathy in AD 159", "text": "NPI and the Apathy Inventory whereas only the single apathy item in the NPI-Q was used for the ADNI Cohort. Possibly because of a more vigorous ascertainment of apathy, the percentage of apathetic subjects was higher and closer to the commonly reported frequency of apathy in AD (around 55%) [37] in the Nice/Stanford cohort than in the ADNI cohort. Genotypes frequencies for the 17 examined SNPs were also slightly different between the two cohorts. Although all of the participants were Caucasian, variation in SNP frequencies have been observed in Caucasians of different ethnic backgrounds [38] . Nonetheless, there is little evidence for a single COMT polymorphism to explain the presence or absence of apathy in AD patients. Several authors have investigated the associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms and polymorphic variations in dopamine genes. Borroni and colleagues [39] tested the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and rs4680 (val/met, COMT) and observed a significant association with psychotic symptoms in AD. In the recent article of Wang et al. [28] , a significant association between blunted affect and rs4680 was found in a sample of 290 Chinese patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. In our study, however, we did not observe a correlation between rs4680 and emotional blunting in individuals with AD. We did, however, observe an association between emotional blunting and rs1544325 (chi-square = 8.1, df = 2, p = 0.018) but only in the Nice subgroup. This discrepancy could be explained by differences in initial diagnosis (schizophrenia versus AD) or ethnicity (the A allele frequency in rs4680 is 51.7% in Caucasians and 25.6% in Han Chinese, HapMap). No significant association was found between the apathy item of the NPI-Q and rs1544325 in the ADNI Cohort and might be partially explained by the selectiveness of the apathy question of the NPI-Q (ADNI Cohort) that only captures one dimension of apathy (lack of interest).\nAs recently reported by Gershon et al. [40] , the plausibility of cumulative effects of rare variants for explaining common disease risk is under current discussion. It is therefore possible, if not likely, that multiple rare SNPs may contribute to a phenotype such as apathy. We have a relatively small sample size, but did examine the association of select SNP pairs on apathy (rs4680/rs165656/rs1800706/rs1544325), which represent the best single SNP associations, as well as one SNP that we found to be associated with emotional blunting in the Nice group only (rs1544325). These SNP's were fairly independent as they had low linkage disequilibrium values (r 2 s < 0.5). None of the combinations, however, were significantly associated with apathy (p s > 0.3, Pearson's Chi-square test).\nThe relatively small sample size of our cohort and the number of COMT SNPs we examined (seventeen SNPs with twenty-four in LD, out of more than four hundred known SNPs for COMT) are additional issues that do not allow for exclusion of COMT from consideration as being possibly involved in apathy in AD, but our results do indicate that either the effect size of such a polymorphism is small or the minor allele frequency is low."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The pathophysiology of apathy in those with AD was not explained by single SNPs in COMT.
