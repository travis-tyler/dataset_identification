[{"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "In late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia (COVID\u201019) cases with unidentified causes have been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It is related to a positive stranded RNA virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV).\n1\n From the beginning, COVID\u201019 was reported to be epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where there was sale of local fish and live wild animals.\n2\n The subsequent evidence of clinician infection suggests that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can transmit from human to human.\n3\n Massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure may lead to death in severe cases, and the counts of lymphocyte, monocyte, leucocyte, infection\u2010related biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines and T cells are also changed in severe patients.\n2\n, \n4\n\n\nMany diagnosis and treatment strategies have been taken to prevent the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and isolation is the most effective way. Detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid or specific IgM and IgG in serum has become a convenient way to identify COVID\u201019. For hospitalized patients, drug treatment such as alpha interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate and arbidol, and convalescent plasma therapy may be potential options. Convalescent plasma therapy is mainly used for the severe and critical cases. In this article, we aim to describe the epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID\u201019/SARS\u2010CoV\u20102."}, {"section_title": "EPIDEMIOLOGY", "text": "So far, the COVID\u201019 patients of nine countries have surpassed 50 000 and they are American, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, The United Kingdom, China, Iran and Turkey in a descending order. The number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID\u201019 was higher than SARS\u2010CoV (more than 8000 confirmed cases and 800 deaths worldwide) and MERS\u2010CoV (2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths worldwide).\n5\n In a study of 99 COVID\u201019 cases, nearly half of patients (49) were clustered and had exposure history.\n6\n According to a survey conducted by Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on more than 40,000 COVID\u201019 patients, about 56% of the patients were men and the median age was 59 years with 87% 30\u201079 years of age, 3% 80 years or older and 2% under 20 years old.\n7\n, \n8\n The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3%, in which the CFR of the elderly and patients with pre\u2010existing comorbid conditions was higher. The CFR of over 70\u2010year\u2010old and over 80\u2010year\u2010old (including 80 years old) was around 50.8% and 14.8% of the total number of deaths, respectively. No deaths occurred in the group aged 9 years and younger.\n7\n The incubation period of COVID\u201019 was 1\u201014 days with mostly 3\u20107 days, and the maximum incubation period could reach 24 days.\n9\n A recent study constructed a model\u2010based analysis estimating the severity of COVID\u201019 from the cases of 38 countries. The results showed that the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death and hospital discharge was 17.8 days (95% CI, 16.9\u201019.2) and 24.7 days (22.9\u201028.1), respectively. The case fatality ratio in China was 1.38% (1.23\u20101.53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (6.4% [5.7\u20107.2], \u226560 years) and up to 13.4% (11.2\u201015.9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (4.5% [1.8\u201011.1] in those aged \u226560 years [n = 151]).\n10\n\n\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has strong transmission ability, and it has been occurred human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. The basic reproductive number (R0) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was estimated ~2.2 based on early patients and a subsequent study based on 75 815 individuals (from 31 December 2019 to 28 January 2020) estimated that R0 was 2.68.\n5\n, \n8\n Recent study from the Los Alamos National Laboratory has collected extensive individual case reports and designed mathematical modelling, which calculated the median R0 value as 5.7 (95% CI 3.8\u20108.9).\n11\n Therefore, the R0 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is rising with the increased number of confirmed cases and so far it has exceeded the R0 of MERS (R0 = 0.6) and SARS (R0 = 1).\n12\n Scientists have predicted the trend of COVID\u201019 development by studying its epidemic dynamics. It was indicated that Wuhan epidemic would peak around April 2020 and local epidemic across cities in mainland China would lag by 1\u20102 weeks in a study.\n5\n In another study, researchers estimated the epidemic peak would be on 17 February 2020 in China and an obvious rise could occur from 25 to 29 February 2020 overseas.\n13\n Asymptomatic cases with COVID\u201019 accounted for ~1% of the total number of patients and the viral load of asymptomatic patients was similar to that of symptomatic patients, which indicated that asymptomatic patients also had the potential to transmit virus.\n7\n, \n14\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is mainly transmitted by droplets, which invade the human body through contaminating the human conjunctival epithelium such as nose and eyes and cause infection.\n15\n In addition to droplet transmission, faecal\u2010oral spread is also a potential mode of transmission.\n16\n Although no studies have found COVID\u201019 in newborns, specific antibodies have been detected in some newborns,\n17\n, \n18\n which indicated the possibility of transmission from the mother to her baby. Due to the particularity of droplet transmission, close contact activities, such as family clustering, usually increase the possibility of infection.\n19\n, \n20\n To block the viral transmission by isolation, wearing masks and other ways of reducing close contact are recommended."}, {"section_title": "Viral genome information and viral origin ::: PATHOGENESIS", "text": "Since COVID\u201019 outbreak, the novel coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 causing the epidemic has been sequenced by worldwide scholars especially in China. A total of 9556 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome sequences have been uploaded in various global databases according to the data of the China National Center for Bioinformation 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019\u2010nCoVR) (Figure 1). Disclosure of the genome and amino acid sequence will contribute greatly to the viral classification and traceability, rapid nucleic acid detection of patients and understanding of the mechanism of viral infection and transmission. Especially, the clear viral sequence data could directly guide the selection of therapeutic agents and lay the foundation for subsequent vaccine and drug research and development.\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is composed of at least 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames) with the full length of 29 903 bp.\n21\n Its genome is similar to SARS\u2010CoV with a gene order 5'\u2010ORF1ab\u2010S\u2010E\u2010M\u2010N\u20103'. A large gene encoding a replicase (ORF1ab) is followed by 4 major structural protein\u2010coding genes: S (Spike protein), E (Envelope protein), M (Membrane protein) and N (Nucleocapsid protein). There are also at least 6 accessory ORFs.\n21\n, \n22\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the \u03b2 coronavirus and its sequence significantly differs from that of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, which have caused epidemics previously.\n1\n Sequence alignment displays that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has 79% and 50% identity with SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, respectively,\n23\n whereas 96.3% identity with a bat's coronavirus.\n24\n Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the closest relatives of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are several viruses originated from bats, such as Bat\u2010CoV RaTG3, Bat SARSr CoV\u2010ZC45 and Bat SARSr CoV\u2010ZXC21. Therefore, bats are assumed to be the original host of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. However, there should be an intermediate host, who transfers the novel coronavirus to human because the sequence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat virus Bat\u2010CoV RaTG3 has minor difference.\n23\n, \n25\n The suspicious intermediate host has been suggested to be the pangolin by Chinese scientists on the basis of genetic analyses, which has not been confirmed until now with the release of new pangolin coronavirus genome studies.\n26\n A recent study has found that the SARS\u2010COV\u20102 was easy to infect cats and ferrets, but weakly infectious to dogs, pigs, chickens and ducks, which could be important for the traceability of the SARS\u2010COV\u20102.\n27\n Multiple sequence analysis studies have shown that the genome sequences of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 exhibit more than 99% sequence identity.\n22\n, \n23\n, \n25\n As a typical RNA virus, the average substitution rate for coronavirus is 10\u22124 substitutions per year per site.\n28\n The low heterogeneity among sequences suggests that all these SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 originated from the same ancestor within a very short period.\n23\n Despite the low heterogeneity, the number of viral genome variants will consistently increase with the continuous spread of COVID\u201019. So far, 4007 variants have been identified and include single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), deletion, indel and insertion with the mutant numbers of 3951, 82, 10 and 20, respectively (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). A deletion of eight amino acid has been reported in viral polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) protein, encoded by ORF1ab gene of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The pp1ab protein is composed of 16 mature non\u2010structural proteins (NSPs) and seldom reported to have mutations previously. This mutant was isolated from a Japanese COVID\u201019 patient, who did not show critical symptoms.\n29\n Domenico group described the presence of two mutations of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, affecting the NSP6 (amino acid position 3691) and ORF10 adjacent regions (amino acid position 9659), respectively, and both mutations could confer lower stability of the protein structures.\n30\n Another two mutations of nt28144 in ORF8 and nt8782 in ORF1a of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 have been noticed to have higher mutation rate of 30.53% and 29.47%, respectively.\n31\n A study analysed 103 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomes and also found nt28144 mutant in ORF8. They classified the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus as type L (28144T) and S (28144C) based on the different amino acid of leucine and serine in nt28144. S type was indicated to be the ancestral version although the L type (mutation rate ~70%) was more prevalent than the S type (mutation rate ~30%).\n32\n L type was speculated to be more aggressive and contagious. By analysis of 160 complete human SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genomes, researchers from the University of Cambridge found three central variants distinguished by amino acid alteration, named A (8782T, 28144C), B (derived from A, 8782C, 28144T) and C (derived from B, 26144T), with A being the ancestral type according to the bat out\u2010group coronavirus.\n33\n The A and C types were found mainly in Europeans and Americans, whereas the B type was the most common type in East Asia.\nCurrently, the reported mutation rate of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is generally low and there is no evidence that viral recombination has occurred. Moreover, many countries have not published relevant virus genome information or only a small amount of genome information, which is obviously difficult to truly reflect the full picture of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 mutation. Consequently, whether the variants of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 could affect its reproduction and transmission need further studies to clarify.\nRecently, researchers have reported that they have successfully cloned and resurrected the novel coronaviruses using reverse genetics, a method of synthesizing viruses by cloning a known viral genome sequence. This method can provide researchers with infectious virus strains without valuable clinical samples and is an attractive alternative to obtain infectious virus strains.\n34\n\n"}, {"section_title": "The receptor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102: Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) ::: PATHOGENESIS", "text": "The envelope spike (S) protein is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity.\n23\n Although the sequence identity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV is only 79%, their spike proteins have a highly similar three\u2010dimensional structure in the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD),\n35\n, \n36\n which makes it possible that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, like SARS\u2010CoV, invades cells through the receptor ACE2. Viral infectivity studies using HeLa cells with and without ACE2 expression from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civets, pigs and mice reveal that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is able to use all ACE2 except that of mouse as an entry receptor.\n25\n To further understand the interaction of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and ACE2 receptor, scientists from the United States and China separately analysed the cryo\u2010electronic microscope (cryo\u2010EM) structures of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein\n37\n and ACE2 receptor, as well as the three\u2010dimensional structure of S protein RBD and the full\u2010length protein complex of ACE2 receptor.\n38\n Molecular modelling reveals that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RBD interacts more strongly with ACE2 receptor than that of SARS\u2010CoV.\n35\n Surface plasmon resonance analysis reveals that the affinity of human ACE2 protein binding to the novel coronavirus S protein is 10\u2010 to 20\u2010fold higher than that of ACE2 binding to SARS\u2010CoV S protein, which results in a stronger SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 transmission capacity.\n37\n These evidences strongly support that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infects host cells by binding ACE2 receptor.\nACE2 belongs to a type I membrane protein expressed highly in lungs, oesophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, intestine, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, cholangiocytes, myocardial cells, kidney proximal tubule cells and testicle, which will be preferentially attacked.\n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n COVID\u201019 transmission through faecal\u2010oral has been proved by evidences that diarrhoea and other alimentary system symptoms are the main manifestations of some patients\n6\n and the stool samples of patients with diarrhoea are positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid test.\n42\n The renal and testicle, highly expressing ACE2, may be potential to be invaded by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n43\n\n\nThe interaction between viral S protein and cell surface receptor ACE2 could activate the downstream renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system (RAAS) since ACE2 is one of the crucial components of RAAS (Figure 2). RAAS could be involved in the COVID\u201019 pathogenesis and could balance the RAAS by increasing ACE2 or blocking the interaction between AngII, and AT1/AT2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID\u201019.\n44\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Cytokine storm ::: PATHOGENESIS", "text": "It was found that before death, the level of neutrophil count, D\u2010dimer, blood urea and creatinine levels of COVID\u201019 patients continued to increase and the lymphocyte counts continued to decrease.
