[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "The 2014 Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) report Strengthening the STEM Pipeline: The Contributions of Small and Mid-Sized Independent Colleges demonstrated the critical role this sector of higher education institutions plays in preparing its students for success in obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This report takes the research one step further to explore the role of small and mid-sized institutions in preparing individuals historically underrepresented in STEM fields-specifically, women, blacks or African Americans, and Latino/Latina graduates-for further study and research. To address the research questions, bachelor's degree recipients from four major types of institutions-public nondoctoral, public doctoral, private nonprofit nondoctoral, and private nonprofit doctoral-were compared on several postsecondary education outcome indicators: persistence in undergraduate STEM programs, time-to-degree, post-baccalaureate employment and education outcomes, and earning a doctoral degree in a STEM field. The analysis was conducted using National Center for Education Statistics and National Science Foundation datasets that are nationally representative. Private nonprofit nondoctoral colleges-the ones most closely representative of CIC-show the highest persistence rates among women, blacks, and Latinos/Latinas in STEM fields within five years of first baccalaureate enrollment when compared to similar students at other types of institutions. Almost eight of 10 women who obtain STEM bachelor's degrees from private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions graduate within four years, a rate that exceeds all other groups of students at all other types of institutions. The data show highly positive assessments of interactions with faculty at private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions among historically underrepresented groups. And graduates from these institutions express levels of satisfaction with their undergraduate educations second only to bachelor's degree recipients from private doctoral institutions. Around 41 percent of graduates from private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions obtained graduate degrees, a higher rate of graduate degree attainment than from public institutions. Similar proportions of underrepresented minority STEM bachelor's recipients from private nondoctoral and public doctoral institutions held a graduate degree. In the realm of post-baccalaureate employment, approximately seven of 10 STEM bachelor's degree recipients from private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions were working in STEM or STEM-related occupations in 2015 (the most recent year for which data were available). This number is very similar to the 67 percent of STEM bachelor's holders from other types of institutions who were working in STEM or STEM-related fields."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Over the last several decades, numerous reports have made the case for cultivating a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce to meet the challenges of economic competitiveness (National Science Foundation 1982;National Science Board 1986;National Academy of Sciences 2007, 2010National Economic Council 2011). For the nation, STEM fields are widely considered the primary drivers of economic growth through innovation; for workers, STEM fields are the gateway to high-paying jobs of the future. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that employment in STEM occupations grew much faster than employment in non-STEM occupations over the last decade (24 percent versus 4 percent, respectively), and the growth of STEM occupations is projected to continue to outpace non-STEM occupations in the decade to come (Noonan 2017). Thus, developing a \"STEM-capable\" workforce is critical to sustaining the nation's competitive advantage in an increasingly tech-driven global economy (National Science Board 2018). Efforts abound to support research, policy, education, and training toward strengthening the nation's STEM capacity. In 2014, CIC released the report Strengthening the STEM Pipeline: The Contributions of Small and Mid-Sized Independent Colleges. This investigation offered important insights about pathways to success in STEM higher education by examining national data to uncover contributions across sectors of fouryear institutions. CIC researchers found that relative to other sectors, small and mid-sized independent colleges make substantial contributions in preparing students in STEM fields, particularly as indicated by such measures as: \uf0b7 Persistence and undergraduate degree completion rates in STEM fields \uf0b7 Time-to-bachelor's degree in STEM fields \uf0b7 Enrollment in graduate school following STEM bachelor's degree completion \uf0b7 Production of baccalaureates who go on to earn STEM doctorate degrees"}, {"section_title": "Underrepresented Groups in STEM", "text": "A crucial feature of a strong U.S. STEM workforce is that it fully leverages the nation's innovative capacity by engaging all segments of the population, including groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM fields (National Science Board 2018). The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2011) outlined several reasons why a strategy for increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields is fundamental to sustaining U.S. economic competitiveness. Other reports insist that an excellent and effective STEM education system must serve all students well (e.g., National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2011). Yet scholars at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) examined the STEM pathways of students who start their postsecondary education in four-year institutions and found that while interest in majoring in STEM fields has increased to the highest levels in more than 40 years, STEM bachelor's degree completion rates have stagnated and racial disparities persist (Eagan et al. 2014). Specifically, 52 percent of Asian American and 43 percent of white STEM aspirants complete a STEM bachelor's degree in six years, compared to only percent of Latino/Latina and 22 percent of black STEM aspirants (Eagan et al. 2014). The National Science Board (2018) reported that Latinos/Latinas, blacks, and American Indians or Alaska Natives together make up 27 percent of the age 21 and older U.S. population, but only 15 percent of those whose highest degree is in STEM and only 11 percent of STEM workers. Along the same lines, women earn about half of all STEM degrees, but their participation varies across fields. It is particularly low in high-demand fields such as computer science and engineering. Moreover, though women hold about half of all jobs in the U.S. workforce, they hold fewer than 28 percent of STEM jobs (National Science Board 2018). Thus, the persistent underrepresentation of women, African Americans, Latinos/Latinas, and other groups in STEM education and the workforce calls for robust efforts to support and expand viable pathways for increasing participation."}, {"section_title": "APPROACH", "text": "Building upon CIC's earlier findings about the contributions of small and mid-sized colleges and universities in preparing students in STEM, this investigation incorporates new data and disaggregates analyses to more deeply examine outcomes for women and underrepresented minorities. In particular, this study examines national data collected by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation to offer insights about key transitions along students' STEM trajectories by addressing the following research questions: 1. How do small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities compare with other types of institutions in terms of students' persistence to an undergraduate STEM degree after entrance into a STEM field of study? 2. How do bachelor's degree recipients from small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities compare with graduates from other types of institutions in their time-to-degree in the STEM fields? 3. How do bachelor's degree recipients from small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities fare in terms of post-baccalaureate employment and education outcomes? 4. How do small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities fare in preparing undergraduates who later earn doctoral degrees in STEM fields? Our research relies on descriptive analyses to address each research question and compare results for private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions (i.e., small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities) with three other types of four-year institutions: public nondoctoral, public doctoral, and private nonprofit doctoral institutions. All of the analyses are weighted so that the findings represent the population of interest 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate STEM Degree Production", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PERSISTENCE IN STEM AND INTERACTIONS WITH FACULTY", "text": "Following CIC's approach in 2014, researchers for the current study addressed the first research question by analyzing the persistence patterns of undergraduate STEM students using data from the National Center for Education Statistics' (NCES) Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS). BPS follows nationally representative cohorts of students enrolled in their first year of postsecondary education and collects data on course-taking, persistence and completion, transition to employment, demographic characteristics, and other indicators (Hill et al. 2016). The most recently completed BPS cohort, BPS: 04/09, consisted of 16,700 sample members who were originally surveyed at the end of their first academic year (2003)(2004) and were invited to participate in follow-up surveys at the end of their third (2005)(2006) and sixth (2008)(2009) years after starting postsecondary education. The current BPS cohort, BPS: 12/17, consists of 37,170 sample members who were initially surveyed in 2011-2012, with follow-ups in 2013-2014and 2016-2017(Hill et al. 2016). Researchers used data from both BPS cohorts to examine persistence of underrepresented students in STEM fields. However, due to differences in the survey questionnaire administered to the BPS 04/09 and BPS 12/17 cohorts, researchers used slightly different analytic approaches 2 for each cohort. Drawing on BPS 04/09, researchers examined the extent to which students who had enrolled in a STEM field between 2003 and 2009 persisted in STEM as of spring 2009, disaggregating the results by institution type in 2003-2004 and by selected demographic characteristics. Table 1 shows that students who started in public nondoctoral institutions had the lowest rates of persistence in STEM overall (43 percent), compared to public doctoral institutions (52 percent), private nondoctoral (56 percent), and private doctoral institutions (58 percent). Disaggregating the distribution shows that 61 percent of women who started in private nondoctoral four-year institutions persisted in STEM fields as of 2009, the highest rate for women across the institutional sectors. Fifty-eight percent of Latino/Latina undergraduates who started in private nondoctoral institutions persisted in STEM, compared to 40 percent of those who started at public nondoctoral institutions and 52 percent of those starting in public doctoral institutions. Table 1 also shows that among black undergraduates, the percentage who persisted in STEM fields after starting their education at private nondoctoral institutions was higher than those who enrolled at public nondoctoral and public doctoral institutions (45, 16, and 35 percent, respectively). Moreover, 17 percent of black STEM students who started at private nondoctoral institutions left postsecondary education without a degree, compared to 40 percent of those at public nondoctoral institutions, 26 percent of those at public doctoral institutions, and 31 percent of those at private doctoral institutions (Table 1). Drawing on the more recent cohort, BPS 12/17, researchers examined the enrollment status of students who had declared STEM majors during their first year (2011-2012), considering their last field of study three years after starting their postsecondary education. Table 2 shows that at this point, roughly 70 percent of students from private institutions (both nondoctoral and doctoral) and public doctoral institutions reported being enrolled in a STEM field, compared to 65 percent of those from public nondoctoral institutions. Breaking these results out by gender, 67 percent of women enrolled in private nondoctoral institutions were still in STEM fields, roughly the same percentage that persisted from private doctoral institutions. By comparison, 61 and 60 percent of women from public nondoctoral and public doctoral colleges and universities remained in STEM majors at this point (Table 2).   3 3 also presents persistence patterns for STEM majors in BPS: 12/17. In contrast to Table 2 that focused on persistence in STEM fields, the table shows the extent to which students who had declared STEM majors in their first year were still enrolled in their first postsecondary institution at the end of their third year. Data for private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions reveal that while six of 10 students remain enrolled at same institutions, about 17 percent opt to transfer to other institutions. This transfer rate exceeds that of all other institution types. Another finding worthy of more detailed research is the estimate that 62 percent of African American undergraduates left private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions without a degree. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution given the large coefficient of variation associated with it. In addition to persistence in STEM fields, researchers used the BPS to examine students' reported interactions with faculty. In particular, researchers summarized students' perceptions of whether their interactions with teachers at their first institution were more positive than negative. Table 4 shows that 94 percent of STEM students enrolled at private nondoctoral institutions agreed that their interactions with faculty at their first institutions were more positive than negative, compared to 81 percent of those in public nondoctoral, 85 percent in public doctoral, and 88 percent in private doctoral institutions. Moreover, female STEM majors at private nondoctoral institutions expressed particularly high agreement that interactions with faculty were more positive than negative. Specifically, 96 percent of women STEM majors at private nondoctoral institutions reported positive interactions with faculty, compared to 84 percent at public nondoctoral, 82 percent at public doctoral, and 85 percent at private doctoral institutions (Table 4, Exhibit 1)."}, {"section_title": "TIME-TO-BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN STEM FIELDS AND SATISFACTION WITH UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION", "text": "Researchers addressed the second research question by analyzing the timeto-degree patterns of undergraduate STEM students using data from the NCES Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). B&B follows nationally representative cohorts of bachelor's degree recipients to examine their postbaccalaureate education and work experiences, including such indicators as workforce participation, income and debt repayment, and entry into and persistence through graduate school programs (Cominole, Shepherd, and Siegel 2015). The most recent B&B cohort was drawn from individuals who received bachelor's degrees during the 2007-2008 academic year. The second followup study of this cohort, B&B: 08/12, included approximately 17,160 sample members who were surveyed four years after graduation (Cominole, Shepherd, and Siegel 2015). Similar to CIC's approach in 2014, researchers examined the time (in months) from initial enrollment in higher education to STEM bachelor's degree completion across institutional sectors but disaggregated the results to uncover potential differences in outcomes for women and underrepresented minorities. Table 5 shows that, overall, 64 percent of STEM bachelor's degree recipients who attended private nondoctoral colleges and universities completed their degrees in four years or less, compared to 24 percent of those who attended public nondoctoral, 42 percent who attended public doctoral, and 65 percent who attended private doctoral institutions.  In addition to time-to-degree completion, researchers used the B&B to explore STEM graduates' reported satisfaction with the quality of their undergraduate education. Table 6 shows that 94 percent of STEM baccalaureates who attended private nondoctoral colleges and universities were satisfied with the quality of their education, compared to 90 percent who attended public nondoctoral, 92 percent who attended public doctoral, and 95 percent who attended private doctoral institutions. Women STEM baccalaureates who attended private nondoctoral institutions were satisfied with their undergraduate education at a rate of 95 percent, compared to 93 percent of those who attended public nondoctoral, 92 percent from public doctoral, and 97 percent from private doctoral institutions. Nearly all black STEM bachelor's degree recipients and 90 percent of Latino/Latina STEM graduates who attended private nondoctoral institutions were satisfied with their undergraduate education (Table 6, Exhibit 2).  Appendix Table A1). Appendix Table A1 provides more results from the analysis of degree completion by years since STEM bachelor's degree, baccalaureate institution sector, and demographics. For example, 49 percent of mid-career individuals who received their STEM bachelor's degree from private nondoctoral institutions 11-20 years prior to the survey reference date held graduate degrees. Among this same group, 35 percent of those from public nondoctoral institutions, 43 percent from public doctoral institutions, and 53 percent from private doctoral institutions held graduate degrees (Appendix Table A1). To further unpack graduate education outcomes, analysis focused on the extent to which STEM bachelor's degree recipients completed an advanced degree in a STEM field. Those data are reported in Table 7, which shows that 29 percent of individuals who received their STEM bachelor's degree from a private nondoctoral college or university held an advanced STEM degree in 2015, compared to 23 percent of those from public nondoctoral, 27 percent from public doctoral, and 39 percent from private doctoral institutions. The employment outcomes of STEM bachelor's degree recipients provide important insights about the contributions of small and mid-sized independent colleges and universities in preparing underrepresented students for STEM careers. Appendix Tables A2 and A3 present a set of employment analyses-including employment status, occupation type and employment sector. Exhibit 4, which displays a subset of the information presented in Appendix Table A2, shows that 70 percent of employed bachelor's degree recipients who had attended private nondoctoral institutions and were working in STEM or STEM-related occupations in 2015. Similar percentages of STEM graduates from other institutional sectors worked in STEM or STEM-related occupations. Seventy-one percent of women and 67 percent of blacks who received STEM bachelor's degrees from private nondoctoral colleges and universities worked in STEM and STEM-related occupations, compared to 68 percent of women and 64 percent of blacks who received bachelor's degrees from public doctoral institutions (Exhibit 4). Exhibit 4. Percentage of employed STEM bachelor's degree recipients who were working in a STEM or STEMrelated occupation by bachelor's degree institution sector and demographics: 2015"}, {"section_title": "Employment Outcomes", "text": "Analyzing the employment sectors of full-time employed STEM bachelor's degree recipients provides additional context for understanding the contributions of small and mid-sized private colleges and universities. Exhibit 5, based on data reported in Appendix Table A3, shows that graduates from private nondoctoral colleges and universities tend to be more highly represented in the non-profit and education sectors than are graduates of other types of institutions. Around one in five female and/or African American STEM bachelors' degree holders from private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions worked in the private non-profit sector in 2015. When compared across institution types, it is clear that while the largest percentage of those employed in higher/other education are graduates of private nonprofit doctoral institutions (11%), a higher proportion of graduates of private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions work in higher/other education as compared to graduates from public nondoctoral and doctoral institutions. "}, {"section_title": "DOCTORAL DEGREE RECIPIENTS IN STEM FIELDS", "text": "To answer the fourth research question on the baccalaureate origins of STEM doctorate recipients, the analysis turned to the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). SED is an annual census of all individuals who receive a research doctorate from a U.S. institution in a given academic year, conducted since 1957. The SED collects information from doctoral recipients about their educational history, demographic characteristics, and post-graduation plans (National Science Foundation 2019b). The scatterplots in the exhibits that follow visualize doctorate degree holders in STEM fields from the point of view of their two major degree milestones: first, the number of bachelor's degrees in STEM fields, derived from institution-level data on baccalaureate completions between 1998 and 2007 from the U.S. Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and second, the number of STEM research doctorates, per baccalaureate institution, from the SED. These statistics combine to create an institutional-yield ratio, which is the number of STEM doctorate recipients per 100 bachelor's degrees awarded in STEM fields nine years earlier. The yield ratio normalizes comparisons across institutions so as to remove the impact of institution size. Only institutions from which 50 or more baccalaureate recipients received STEM doctorate degrees between 2007 and 2016 were included in the analysis. Institutions in the charts that follow, as well as the full tables that are included in the Appendix, are ranked on unrounded ratios. Appendix tables are designed to display the \"top 100 institutions\" for each combination of STEM baccalaureate and doctorate institutions. However, in cases where fewer than 100 institutions met the minimum threshold for data display (as reported in each table's notes), only the number of institutions meeting the threshold is listed. In cases where no institution met the threshold for display, asterisks only appear in the tables. Appendix Table A4 reports the distribution of 2007-2016 STEM research doctorates by the four institution types (public nondoctoral, public doctoral, private nonprofit nondoctoral, private nonprofit doctoral), with counts broken by gender and race/ethnicity. Exhibits 6-9 4 graphically depict the top 100 U.S. baccalaureate institutions that provide the pipeline for STEM research doctorates, with a special emphasis on the pipeline for women, African Americans, and Latinos/Latinas. The graphs array the baccalaureate institutional-yield rate along the vertical axis, with the 10-year total of research doctorate graduates from the same institutions graphed along the horizontal axis. In this way, the importance of small and mid-sized private nondoctoral institutions in producing STEM doctorates can be observed. Exhibit 6 highlights two outliers-Reed College and the University of California at Berkeley-to demonstrate the relationship between the two variables. Reed, while having many fewer graduates who obtained STEM doctorates than UC Berkeley, has a much higher institutional-yield ratio than the larger institution. Nearly 40 of every 100 Reed graduates in STEM fields went on to obtain a STEM PhD, compared to about 14 of 100 Berkeley graduates. Overall, ranked by yield rate, 69 of the top 100 baccalaureate institutions feeding STEM doctorate programs are from the private nondoctoral sector. Small and mid-sized private colleges and universities represent a similar proportion (75 of 100) of the baccalaureate pipeline for women doctorates in STEM fields (Appendix Table A6). Exhibit 7 points out this phenomenon, with a selection of women's colleges highlighted for their high rate of producing women STEM baccalaureates and doctorates. The remainder of this section focuses on 10 specific STEM doctorate fields within each demographic group (women, African Americans, and Latinos/Latinas). It refers to data tables found in the Appendix Tables A5 and higher."}, {"section_title": "Women in STEM", "text": "Of the 10 doctoral degree fields analyzed, the largest and most traditional STEM fields (chemistry, biology, life sciences, and physical sciences) are those in which the private nondoctoral sector excels as the training ground for future STEM doctorates granted to women. As measured by institution yield, 80 of the top 100 baccalaureate-granting institutions preparing female STEM doctorates in the life sciences are private nondoctoral institutions. Likewise, among female chemistry doctorates, small and mid-sized private colleges represent the baccalaureate origin of 19 of the top 20 yielding institutions (Appendix Table A10). At the other end of the spectrum, computer science (Appendix Table A12), computer science/mathematics (Appendix Table A26), engineering (Appendix Table A27), other types of institutions, such as private and public doctorate granting institutions, figure more prominently in the undergraduate preparation of female STEM PhDs. But even within this picture, small and mediumsized institutions perform well. For example, Swarthmore College and Wellesley College are ranked first and second in institutional yield among doctorates in mathematics and statistics; Cooper Union and Harvey Mudd College are similarly ranked among engineering doctorates."}, {"section_title": "African Americans in STEM", "text": "A review of the baccalaureate origins of STEM PhDs granted between 2007 and 2016 demonstrates the continued importance of HBCUs in providing the undergraduate foundation of the nation's African American STEM research doctorates. In fact, all baccalaureate-origin institutions listed in the tables for doctorates in the physical sciences (Appendix Table A29), computer science/mathematics (Appendix Table A30), and chemistry (Appendix  Table A9) and in tabulations on specific disciplines (Appendix Tables A19-23 and Tables A32-35), is the very limited role that private nondoctoral institutions play in preparing Latinos/Latinas for PhD studies in STEM. The pipeline of Latino/Latina doctorates in STEM largely starts and ends in the nation's largest public and private doctorate-granting institutions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Recommendations", "text": "This report demonstrates the continued importance of small and mid-sized institutions in strengthening the STEM pipeline, with a particular significance for women and underrepresented minority STEM baccalaureate graduates. Overall, on most indicators detailed in this report, small and mid-sized private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions outperform public nondoctoral and doctoral institutions, and are competitive with (although usually are second to) private doctoral institutions. Small and mid-sized private colleges and universities appear to play a significant role in producing female STEM baccalaureates and preparing female STEM degree holders for graduate study. For underrepresented minority students, private nonprofit nondoctoral institutions also contribute to STEM higher education, but this contribution varies across the different outcomes this report considered. Building on recommendations from the 2014 CIC report Strengthening the STEM Pipeline: The Contributions of Small and Mid-Sized Independent Colleges, which demonstrated the critical role that this sector of higher education institutions plays in preparing its students for success in obtaining graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, this report explored the role of small and mid-sized institutions in preparing groups that have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields-specifically, women, blacks or African Americans, and Latino/Latina graduates. Following on this research and analysis, we propose several recommendations to consider for future research and work in this space. Specifically, these recommendations might include the following: \uf0b7 There are almost no private nondoctoral institutions in the Top 100 U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions of 2007-2016 Latino/Latina doctorate recipients by institutional-yield ratio tables, despite a 90 percent satisfaction rate. Additional research on production levels at private institutions is needed to determine if Latinos/Latinas transfer from these institutions at higher rates than non-Latino/non-Latina students. Reviewing data from the National Student Clearinghouse may provide additional insight. \uf0b7 Findings on student transfer out of private, nonprofit nondoctoral institutions and African American attrition require additional scrutiny. While the data on African American persistence should be treated with caution, they may suggest the need to pay greater attention to policies to promote retention of African American STEM undergraduates in small and mid-sized colleges and universities. \uf0b7 More research from an intersectional perspective is needed. For example, do institutions play an even greater role for black women as compared to white women (or vice versa)? \uf0b7 The role of selectivity of institutions needs more consideration in this type of research. Are private institutions able to attract a more select group of students that come to institutions better academically prepared? This factor was not included in this body of research.
