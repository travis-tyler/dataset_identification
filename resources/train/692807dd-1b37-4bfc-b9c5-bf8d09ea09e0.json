[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "COVID-19 is a newly identified infectious disease of global importance for public health. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the group of giant single-stranded RNA viruses and is easily transmitted between humans. 1 Such high infectivity suggests animal origin. 2 Possible sources of infection include bats, snakes, minks, as well as asymptomatic human carriers who have not yet developed signs of infection. 1, 3, 4 Transmission is through respiratory droplets or fomites, but the airborne and orofecal transmission is also likely. 5 The course of the disease can range from mild (minor respiratory tract infection) to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with multiple organ failure, and death. 6 The most characteristic symptoms of COVID-19 are fever (in about 90% of patients), cough, and dyspnoea. 5, [7] [8] [9] The digestive tract may be an alternative route of infection, and the virus has been isolated from saliva and feces.

These pathogens can affect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as induce hepatic or renal damage, and neurological disorders. 1, 20 The most common are coronaviruses causing respiratory disease, and they belong to the group of alpha and beta-coronaviruses. Four of these (HCoV229E and HCoV-NL6 (alpha-coronaviruses) and HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 (beta-coronaviruses)) are commonly found in humans. 1 They are most commonly responsible for mild upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, or pneumonia. With a rapidly progressive clinical course of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and death are observed. 6, [21] [22] [23] Molecular studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 79% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-1, which confirms the high phenotypic similarity of both beta-coronaviruses. Moreover, they bind to the same receptor of the angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2); however, there are some differences due to amino acid mutations in some key domains of this receptor. 24 Short incubation period, droplet transmission, and asymptomatic course influence the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to high rates of transmission worldwide. 1, 25 Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is quickly mutated and recombined, resulting in new forms that can spread from animals to humans. 26 "}, {"section_title": "Epidemiology", "text": "Initially, SARS-CoV-2 was reported only in China, and the first cases involved a small area covering the Chinese seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province (December 2019). 25 However, the virus quickly spread throughout the world. About six weeks later, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the infection caused by this pathogen is a threat global public health. 27 Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affects all populations and poses a serious challenge to public health organizations. 28 "}, {"section_title": "Transmission of SARS-CoV2 Infection", "text": "As previously mentioned, acute complications such as life-threatening respiratory failure may occur in the course of many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. Although MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 have a higher mortality rate due to more severe complications than SARS-CoV-2, the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. 10, 29, 30 The main mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is via droplets, similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1; however, patients with COVID-19 present the highest viral load just before first signs or at the onset of clinical symptoms, which explains the rapid spread of the pathogen and the development of a pandemic. 23 This fact underlines the importance of rigorous infection control and the strict use of PPE (personal protection equipment). 10 Rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (much higher than observed in SARS-CoV-1) suggests zoonotic origin. 23 The most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV2 is bats, as well as other wildlife animals such as snakes or minks. [1] [2] [3] [4] The infection is spread primarily by respiratory droplets, as well as transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, the virus can be transmitted through contact with excretions and secretions of the infected patient. 12, 31 Individuals with confirmed disease, or who have had exposure with infected patients should immediately be submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com"}, {"section_title": "DovePress", "text": "Clinical Interventions in Aging 2021:16 44 quarantined. 32 Asymptomatic carriers present a dangerous route of transmission. A similar viral load is present in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which indicates the potential role of viral transmission by people without any clinical symptoms. 33 Therefore, any person exposed to an infected patient should be isolated, even in the absence of clinical signs.\nThe mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 (the time from the point of infection to the occurrence of the first symptoms) also influences the quick route of viral transmission; usually lasting 5 days [5.2 days (95% CI = 4.1-7.0 days) (n = 138), 34 5.2 days: range from 2.1 to 11.2 days (n = 8579)]. 35 The risk of infection diminishes 14 days after contact with an infected patient (this time corresponds with the estimated maximum incubation period). 36 Data describing the possibility of vertical infection are controversial. Zhang et al reported observations of 4 newborns which suggested the possibility of vertical transmission from mother to child. However, in infected newborns, there were no serious complications or need for mechanical ventilation or treatment in the ICU. Thus, newborns are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, but their symptoms are milder compared to adults. 37 Conversely, research by Liu et al describing 19 pregnant infected women did not confirm a mother-child transmission during childbirth. Besides, no perinatal complications of pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy or newborns were found. All newborns were born healthy and had no SARS-CoV-2 infection. 38 Therefore, the concept of vertical transfer of SARS-CoV-2 deserves further investigation. 37"}, {"section_title": "Disease Severity-Dependent Course of Infection", "text": "Patients with SARS-CoV-2 present a broad spectrum of symptoms, from mild/moderate infection to severe and rapidly progressive and life-threatening disease. 17, 18 Epidemiological data from the Chinese population show that about 81% of patients have mild symptoms (including mild pneumonia), and 1.2% of patients are asymptomatic. 39"}, {"section_title": "An Age-Dependent Course of Infection", "text": "The most vulnerable to infection is the senior group. The risk of an acute course of the disease increases with age, and patients over 60 years present the most severe complications. 15, 34 They are more susceptible to the infection than children, more frequently suffer from dyspnea, and rapidly progressive disease (ARDS, septic shock). As a result, the elderly are the most frequently hospitalized group of patients in intensive care units (ICU). 5, 15, 34 Studies of the Chinese population showed that patients with severe COVID-19 complications, were on average, seven years older than patients with mild symptoms, and more frequently present with higher comorbidities. 5 Physiological changes characteristic of normal aging, declining physical performance, malnutrition, cognitive decline, and depressive state explain this phenomenon. 40 It is worth noting that polypragmasia, due to overprescription of medication in the setting of poorly coordinated care, is more often observed in this group of patients. These factors increase the risk of drug side effects with a negative influence on overall health. 13 It is also worth emphasizing that the course of infection can be atypical in the elderly and patients with immunodeficiency, with a high risk of serious complications even in mild disease. 13, 15, 34 In children, the disease is usually mild or asymptomatic, 34 especially in neonates. 37, 38 In this group of patients coronaviruses cause fewer clinical symptoms and are rarely fatal. 19 In infants, the course of the disease is usually mild or asymptomatic. 37, 38, 41 In older children, COVID-19 may co-exist with other viral or bacterial infections and should be treated alongside SARS-CoV-2. 42, 43 Most children have documented home contacts, and the symptoms often appear quicker than in adult household members. Children, unlike adults, are less frequently hospitalized due to severe complications of SARS-CoV-2. 6 Thus, current data indicate that in the pediatric population, SARS-CoV-2 infection is rarely symptomatic and is less severe than in adults. 19"}, {"section_title": "Comorbidity-Dependent Course of SARS-CoV-2 Infection", "text": "Increased morbidity of COVID19 is observed in patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and COPD. 7 DovePress essential questions about the possibility of higher viral pathogenicity in this population. 14 Recently, vitamin D is widely discussed in the context of its positive influence on immune function.

Patients who were vitamin D deficient and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit during adequate supplementation of this vitamin. 44 "}, {"section_title": "Clinical Symptoms", "text": "The clinical signs may vary between different populations, due to the influence of environmental and genetic factors. The disease course may be mild or moderate. The virus typically affects the respiratory tract, and patients complain of fever, cough (most often dry), sore throat, fatigue, and malaise 5,7-9 (Table 1) . Dyspnea increases with the progression of the disease. Headaches and myalgia may also occur. If pneumonia develops, it can be mild and responsive to treatment, or severe requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. 5, 8 The disease infrequently begins with extra-pulmonary (eg, gastrointestinal) symptoms. Recent studies have confirmed the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the gastrointestinal tract (detectable on intestinal biopsy and fecal matter). 45 Angiotensin II receptors (ACE-2) enable the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung tissue and enterocytes in small intestines; this explains symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. 46 ,47 Viral genetic material has been found in the stool, and elimination time from the gastrointestinal tract is more prolonged compared to the respiratory tract. 12,31 SARS CoV-2 infection can also lead to direct damage to intrahepatic bile ducts due to the high expression of ACE2 receptors on 59.7% of cholangiocytes. For comparison, these receptors are present only on 2.6% hepatocytes. 48 SARS-CoV-2 has also been confirmed in the saliva and thus can be a potential route of infection. 45 Therefore gastroenterological symptoms may co-exist with upper respiratory tract symptoms and may account for further transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through the digestive tract. However, side effects of medications used for anti-viral treatment should always be excluded. 49 Thus, the oral route may be an alternative way of transmission, especially with exposure to infected wild animals or asymptomatic carriers. 4,23 SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause loss of smell, which is observed in 20-60% of patients with the confirmed disease (data according to the European Rhinologic Society). Moreover, this often occurs before fever and can be the predominant sign of infection. 50 A multicentre study of the 417 infected patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 showed that almost 86% of patients present with olfactory dysfunction, and 88.0% reported dysgeusia. These symptoms were more common in women. Sensory and olfactory disorders were present before other symptoms in 11.8% of patients. 51 "}, {"section_title": "Clinical Interview", "text": "History of presenting symptoms and travel history must be elicited in order to estimate the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The resolution of inflammatory infiltration is found in approximately 25% of cases, while 25% of patients do not show significant changes on imaging studies. 9 Pulmonary infiltration is the most common sign on chest CT. It is usually described as bilateral spotty shadings or ground-glass changes. 5, 9 They are bilaterally distributed, more pronounced in the periphery, and are most often noted in more than two lobes. 9,53 However, they are similar to that of other coronaviruses infection, such as SARS-CoV-1 21 and MERS-CoV. 22 CT imaging is essential in recognizing and monitoring pulmonary changes in COVID-19. Chest CT may be more sensitive (98% sensitivity) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection than RT-PCR (71% sensitivity). 54 In the early stage of the chest X-ray may be present slight and patchy shading more strongly expressed in the peripheral part of the lung. In advanced disease, numerous infiltration and consolidative modifications on both sides are observed. CT usually shows spotty bilateral shadowing, mainly in the peripheral part of the lung; however, milky-glass shading or interstitial changes (>80% of patients have more than two lobes involved) are also detected. 5, 8, 9 Molecular Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 Infection Biological Material\nThe complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is available; thus, genetic material may be isolated from lower and upper respiratory tract samples. Specimens may be obtained from the saliva, feces or blood (in sepsis). 11, 31, 45, 49 Thus, a variety of specimens (such as nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, tracheal extracts, lung tissue, blood, and feces) can be taken for viral RNA detection.\nThe most common method for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 is swabbing nasopharyngeal or oral cavity. 55 PCR is most sensitive if the material is obtained from the lower respiratory tract (usually aspirate from the trachea or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)). 29, 56 The possibility of detecting viral RNA by RT-PCR in a single nasopharyngeal swab is not high; therefore, tests should be repeated. 11, 57 The accuracy of the PCR assay increases with repeated sampling giving rise to a lower number of false-negative results. 18 Samples should not be taken from the nostrils or tonsils. Swab sticks should be sterile and made of synthetic, non-cotton material. Sputum (if occurring in the course of the disease) may be used for virus detection, but should not be induced due to the increased risk of infection by aerosol.

However false-negative result might also present and can result from sampling before or after the highest viremia, various sites of collection (PCR is less sensitive for a nasal swab than for a nasopharynx swab), inappropriate material collection for swab tests, which leads to the breakdown of genetic material, improper transport destroying the viral nucleic acids, eg, inadequate temperature, sample contamination, and incorrect performance of the RT-PCR assay. 55, 56 With a positive RT-PCR test and minor symptoms, quarantine, as well as symptomatic treatment, is indicated. 61 The RT-PCR analysis should be repeated if symptoms worsen or new symptoms characteristic for SARS-CoV-2 infection appear. 45 Viremia increases along with worsening of clinical state, increasing severity of clinical symptoms (rising fever, dyspnea, sputum production, and weakness), and the progression of inflammatory changes in chest imaging studies. 60 "}, {"section_title": "Biochemical Study", "text": "During the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, several changes are observed in serum biochemistry.
