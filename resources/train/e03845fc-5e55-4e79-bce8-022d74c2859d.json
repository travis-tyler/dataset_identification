[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Hurricane Hugo struck the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on September 18, 1989, with winds greater than 240 km/hr (150 mph). The previous hurricane to make landfall on the island was Santa Clara in 1956. Unfortunately, no data is available on coastal and shelf response to major hurricanes before Hugo, so comparisons to previous storms are not possible. Natural coastal zone resources as diverse as offshore sand deposits, recreational beaches, and coral reefs were degraded by the storm. On an island where more than 8Sr;;1 of the population lives within 7 km of the sea and is dependant on the tourism that its beaches and coral reefs attract, it is necessary that a highquality scientific data base be made available to help formulate public policy regarding residential 92017 received 22 May 1992; accepled in ret-ision I June 199.'1 and commercial rebuilding along the coast, beach replenishment, and future utilization of marine resources. Information concerning offshore mineral resources, specifically sand and gravel for construction and beach replenishment, is of major importance because suitable onshore sources have been depleted (COMMITTEE ON PUERTO RICO AND THE SEA, 1974, pp. 88-89). Previous studies have discussed the impact of Hugo on Puerto Rico. RODRIGUEZ and WEBB (1990) discussed the immediate impact of the storm on the coastal resources. Aerial observations right after the storm suggested that a major portion of the Escollo de Arenas had been dispersed over the surrounding sea grass beds and that beach erosion occurred along several sections of the northeast coast. BUSH (1991) noted how the steep, rocky nature of the coastal zone, combined with low maximum storm surges, helped keep property damage at a minimum. However, crowding of buildings into coastal lowlands and poor construction quality worked to increase damage in places. A cooperative U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-Department of Natural Resources (DNR) of Puerto Rico project has been monitoring important beach and shelf resources for about 20 years. This report examines the impact of Hurricane Hugo on resources of greatest interest to that project, namely, the Escollo de Arenas, the largest known submerged sand deposit in eastern Puerto Rico, and on the beaches in the vicinity of San Juan. As a direct consequence of Hugo, the coastal 100m Figure 3. Aerial photograph of Ensenada Honda, Culebra, Puerto Rico taken on October, 1989.

The eye of Hurricane Hugo passed directly over St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and continued travelling in a WNW direction. During the morning of September 18, Hugo passed over the islands of Vieques and Culebra, and over the eastern and northeastern tip of Puerto Rico (Figure 1). Radar observations and satellite images revealed that the west side of the eyewall moved over land while the eastern side of the eye remained over water. Maximum winds at the San Juan metropolitan airport ( Figure 2) were measured around 1030 hr. By noon, barely six hours after hitting Vieques, Hugo was approximately 30 km north of San Juan with maximum sustained surface winds down to 123 km/hr (77 mph) with gusts to 147 km/hr (92 mph) and minimum sea level pressure of 957 mb (NOAA, 1990). The lowest surface pressure recorded on Puerto Rico during Hugo was 946 mb at Ceiba (NOAA, 1990). Hurricane Hugo caused tremendous damage to the development and infrastructure of eastern Puerto Rico. Over 80 percent of wooden structures were destroyed in Culebra and Vieques (FEMA, 1989). Thirty-thousand people were left homeless and property damage exceeded $1 billion. Thousands of boats were destroyed. Boat owners as far away as San Juan and St. Thomas took their vessels to Ensenada Honda, a legendry \"hurricane-proof\" bay at Culebra (Figure 1). Sustained southerly winds of 193 km/hr (121 mph) with gusts to 240 km/hr (150 mph) (GOLDEN, 1990) created a wave setup in Ensenada Honda estimated at greater than 4 m. Vessels 20 m and longer in length were carried up and over the coastal road with several sailboats ending up wedged under a bridge ( Figure 3). Results from computer simulations developed by NOAA called SLOSH models (for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) predicted a 2-3 m rise in sea level for Vieques Passage (MER- CADO, personal communication, 1989). Observations of storm-swash debris lines indicate that these levels were attained. At about 10:30 a.m, local time, the hurricane was reaching its maximum intensity in San Juan. At La Puntilla in San Juan Bay (Figure 2), a 0.73 m storm surge developed coincident with the predicted astronomical high tide of 0.61 m (Figure 4  occurred in November of 1982(NOAA, 1989). The SLOSH model hindcast a water level between 1.0 and 1.4 m above MLW for northern San Juan Bay. An interesting aside is that heavy rainfall was oflimited extent, and Hugo passed over the island very quickly; therefore, it was considered a \"dry hurricane\". Minimal flooding occurred away from the coastal zone because torrential rains fell only in limited areas over the northeast part of the island. Rain gauges in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands averaged between 12 and 23 em (5-9 in) ofrainfall with a maximum of34.41 em (13.55 in) in the mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico (NOAA, 1990)."}, {"section_title": "IMPACT OF HURRICANE HUGO ON THE ESCOLLO DE ARENAS", "text": "The Escollo de Arenas is an offshore sand and gravel deposit located off the northwest tip of Vieques Island (Figure 1). About 90 x 10 6 m\" of sand and gravel form a 6 km by 0.1-1.0 km shoal (RODRIGUEZ and TRIAS, 1989) regarded as an important potential economic resource. Water depths over the shoal generally range from 4 to 8 m, except near Vieques Island where the water shoals to 2 m. The bathymetry of Vieques Passage in the area surrounding the shoal is irregular. Isolated high areas are present and water depths generally range from 10 to 18 m. Tidal currents with velocities that commonly exceed 140 cmls maintain a wide variety of bedforms on the surface of the shoal (RODRiGUEZ, 1979). Sandwaves having wavelengths on the order of 100 m and amplitudes of 2 to 3 m are the most common bedform. Hurricane Hugo smoothed these bedforms and dispersed the sediment over the adjacent sea floor (  Figure 7. Storm-wave swash for six sites in Puerto Rico. Site location numbers are shown on Figure 1. Storm-wave swash is a combination of storm surge and wave runup. Storm surge was similar for the six sites, but wave runup varied as a function of coastal profile. Landward incursion of storm water is given by the values in parentheses at the top of each column. Coastal flooding was severe in low lying areas (sites 2, 3,4). Although storm wave swash was greater in steeper profile areas (sites 1, 5,6), overall incursion was less. of the Escollo, burying over 1 km 2 of seagrass beds. The algal plains along the western margin were also severely affected by the formation of large northeast trending \"blowouts\" or areas of deep scouring of the seagrass meadows. Vibracores taken three months after Hugo showed 5 to 10 em of sand deposited on the seagrass beds ( Figure  6). These results coupled with aerial photo-interpretation suggest an unrecoverable loss of between 10 and 20 x IOri m\" cubic meters of sand from the Escollo (worth more than $2,000,000 at current market prices). The loss is considered unrecoverable from a commercial standpoint because the sand was deposited as a thin layer on top of a muddy substrate typical of seagrass bed communities. Mining of that sand could cause resuspension of muds which could undoubtedly have detrimental effects to coral reefs in the vicinity."}, {"section_title": "HUGO'S IMPACT ON SAN JUAN'S BEACHES", "text": "The beaches and coastal development along the northern and eastern coasts were damaged by direct wave impact, sand overwash, undermining of structures, and local flooding. The degree of impact depended on the shoreline composition (rocky versus sandy stretches) and morphology, the degree of exposure to open sea, and the elevation of the backshore area. Wave run-up heights and incursion distances were measured using standard Impact of Hurrican e Hugoj ----~1 Figure 8. Aerial view of heavily overwa shed sect ion of Pi nones.

Coastal flooding around the island was augmented by hurricane-generated waves that reached maximum heights of about 4 m, The combination of storm surge and the wave runup caused severe coastal flooding in low-lying areas (Figure 7). The coastline in the San Juan area is compartmentalized into short sandy sections divided by rocky headlands. This report concentrates on three coastal compartments (from east to west): Punta Vacia Talega to Punta Cangrejos, Punta Cangrejos to Punta Las Marias, and Punta Las Marias to EI Boquer6n (Figure 2). Baseline beach profiles for these areas have been collected intermittently since 1984 (VELAZCO et al., 1986). Prior to Hugo, two-dimensional profiles measured shape of beach and distance from a fixed benchmark established at the landward edge of the backbeach area at 23 sites. New equipment utilized since Hugo allows three-dimensional measurement of beach volume changes. The new data is preliminary, however, so all references to beach profiles in this paper are to two-dimensional profiles and beach widths. Beach widths were determined as the intersection of an arbitrary datum (average elevation of the lower limit of the swash zone) with the beach profile . From 1984 to 1985, beach widths in San Juan eroded or accreted as much as 20 to 30 m in response to seasonal changes in wave height and direction (W EBB and V ELAZCO, 1991). However, the average rate of change in beach width over the 5 years studied ranged from 1-4 m/yr. Storm waves generated during Hugo destroyed ten beach profile benchmarks by undermining the structures that supported them. Subsequently, five of the benchmarks were reestablished. Of 18 beach sites profiled before and after the hurricane, eight stations experienced an average width loss of 4 m, two stations remained the same width, while eight stations were wider by an average of 7 m. All beach profiles were flattened by the storm waves making the beaches more vulnerable to overwash and flooding after the storm.  ,--~-___'T--\"\"T\"\"\"\"\"-__, The worst structural damage (qualitatively measured) occurred in areas that have been overwashed and flooded in the past by storm swells generated by extratropical storms. For example, the overwash pattern observed in the San Juan area after Hugo was almost identical to the storm wave swash from several winter storms as reported by FIELDS and JORDAN (1972)  cases, the overwash and undermining has been exacerbated by conflicts between natural processes and man-made structures. Follow-up profiling studies show that the im-pact of Hugo on beaches where the sand remained in the active beach system (documented here for 6 of 24 monitoring sites) produced only a temporary perturbation in the seasonal cycles. Longer term impacts are being felt on beach systems that were overwashed or on those that suffered major erosion of vegetated back -beach scarps. Where present, the scarps effectively become the shoreline during periods of heavy swell. As the scarps are further eroded, the development behind them becomes more vulnerable to coastal flooding. In general, overwash did not occur where the backshore elevations exceeded 3 m. Following is a detailed description of specific profile locations within the three coastal compartments in the study area ( Figure 2 Long-time residents of the Pinones sector state that overwash has been common in the area following removal of a massive dune system bordering the north side of highway 187 for fill in the 1950's. Without the protection of the dunes, even moderate energy waves have the potential to ov-erwash the road and deposit the sand in the mangroves of Torrecilla Lagoon . In 1986, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a 56,000 m\" artificial dune along a 300 m section of the road in order to mitigate the problem. The project cost approximately $300,000. In 1987, an extratropical storm generated swells that impacted the Pinones area, eroding a large portion of the artificial dune. Hugo completed its total destruction, carrying the remaining material landward. A total of over 500,000 m\" of sand was overwashed along the entire 1 km stretch of shoreline of coastal compartment 1 (BUSH, 1991). The thickness of the deposit exceeded 1 meter along several kilometers of Highway 187. In the aftermath of Hugo, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources used heavy equipment to return 46,000 m\" of the overwashed sand back to the active beach system. Whereas vegetation worked to restrict the landward extent of the overwash penetration, roads BARBOSA -BEFORE HUGO 100m t j Figur e 13. Aerial view of Barbosa Park (see Figure 2 for locat ion ).

Although the beach on the western flank of the point changed little (Playamar profile, Figure LlA), the sidewalk was undermined and the adjacent streets flooded. East of Punta Las Marias, the shoreline has retreated more than 50 meters since the 1930's. Hugo damaged the seawalls and gabions but did not cause extensive flooding or alter beach width or the profile significantly. Farther east, Hugo cut heavily into the berm behind Waldorf Towers (Figure lIB) destroying the sidewalk (Figure 12). In contrast, between the Playamar profile and the Waldorf Tower sites, a broad depositional beach withstood the storm waves with minimal amount of back beach flooding and no noticeable change in beach width and profile."}, {"section_title": "Punta Las Marias to El Boqueron", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Barbosa Park", "text": "Battered seawalls extend from Punta Las Marias to Barbosa Park preventing sand from overwashing but also from forming natural dunes.

To maintain the street clear of sand, the municipality regularly collects and transports the sand offsite.

Hugo caused sea level to rise to record levels, resulting in severe coastal flooding, and impacted the coast with 4+ meter waves. Considering the intensity of Hurricane Hugo, the impact on the shelf and coastal resources of the island was limited. The impact of these storm forces on the beach and coastal resources of Puerto Rico are: (1) Over 100,000 m'' of sand from the Escollo de Arenas was spread out over adjacent seagrass beds. (2) Hugo caused severe to moderate erosion of the beaches in the San Juan area. (a) Hugo created new backshore scarps, temporarily increasing the vulnerability of the coast to future high-energy (greater than 3 m swell) storms. (b) With the exception of major overwash deposits, it appears that most of the eroded material remained within the active beach system. (c) Most of the beaches have now returned to their normal, seasonally-fluctuating behavior. (d) New berms have formed with dimensions similar to those observed before the storm; the degree of protection to backbeach areas from moderate-energy (1 to 3 m swell) events is much the same as it was before Hugo. (3) Hugo devastated the coral communities of Culebra while inflicting minor damage to the corals of Vieques Passage. (4) More than a square kilometer of productive seagrass beds surrounding the Escollo de Arenas was uprooted and another 1 to 2 km\" were covered by sand. Other seagrass beds off the eastern and southeastern coasts were also affected."}]
