[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Prostate cancer screening using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is controversial. First, should one screen -at all? And if so -who, when, and how often? We summarized the currently available guideline recommendations of who, when, and how often to screen men in the general population for prostate cancer, and when prostate biopsy is indicated. Although there is much common ground, guideline groups and experts diverge on several pivotal points, for instance ages to start and stop. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA screening for all men during 2011-2012 [1] , whereas most other guideline groups and experts agree that screening should start in midlife and end before age 75 and take place after shared decision-making (SDM) between an individual man and his provider [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] (Table 1) .\nFor the past few years, the 'one-size-fits-all' concept for PSA screening appears to have been abandoned in favor of more risk-stratified approaches with the aim to optimize the balance between benefits and harm. Such approaches include better stratifying baseline risk and adapting rescreening intervals according to a man's age, general health, and PSA level [7] as well as using multivariable approaches to help biopsy decision-making including reflex biomarkers [6] or risk calculators [15] . MRI is also emerging as a potentially promising"}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We searched PubMed for the period 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2016 for articles in English language using the search words 'prostate cancer' and 'screening'. Both authors screened and selected the articles by title and abstract, and grouped the articles into the following categories based on the content from full-text screen: first, screening strategies -new data on risk-stratified screening, biomarkers, genetics, and costs; second, consequences of the USPSTF 2011-2012 recommendation; third, screening patterns; and fourth, SDM. Selected key papers from early 2016 were also included. [17] [18] [19] 20 && ,21 & ,22,23,24 & ]. The Finnish section of the ERSPC specifically studied screening failures, that is, those who died from prostate cancer despite being invited for screening. Although being the largest component of the ERSPC, there was no evidence of a reduction in prostate cancer mortality between the randomized arms -something that puzzled the scientific community. Possible explanations to an ineffective screening included nonparticipation, interval cancers, and the PSA cutoff. Correcting for nonparticipation indeed leads to a significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality with a hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.64-0.96). Removing interval cancers and lowering the PSA threshold had a less pronounced and nonstatistically significant effect on prostate cancer mortality [17] . This was confirmed by analyses on the entire ERSPC in which it was found that the number needed to invite and a novel metric -the number needed to overdiagnose to prevent one prostate cancer death -varied greatly between ERSPC centers mainly because of the differences in background risk and screening protocols; number needed to invite varied from 200 to 7000 and number needed to overdiagnose from 16 to 69 [18] . Furthermore, the previously found reduction of metastatic prostate cancer both at diagnosis and during follow-up [19] was confirmed and was found to precede the reduction in prostate cancer mortality by about 3 years [20 && ]. Additionally, even though few support population-based screening, the current alternative, that is opportunistic screening, might result in an even less beneficial harm-to-benefit ratio as compared to a purely PSA-based organized screening approach [21 & ,23,25]. The randomized prostate cancer screening trials mainly included Caucasian men and were population based, that is, men of African ancestry or men with a positive family history or, for example breast cancer gene (BRCA) carriers were not included or underrepresented. It is however suggested that men of African ancestry are at higher risk for dying from prostate cancer and should be screened at an earlier age or more intensely [26] . However, a higher lifetime risk of prostate cancer death is not automatically a license to start screening. The potential benefit of avoiding prostate cancer death should still be weighed against the potential risk of overdiagnosis. In case of ethnicity, this harm-to-benefit ratio does not differ from the example of Caucasian men [27 & ]. A strategy wherein men are stratified based on a baseline PSA value, and actively offered screening within the highest 10% of PSA, was shown to produce a better risk-to-benefit ratio as compared to stratifying men based on race or family history of prostate cancer [28] . Once screening starts, optimizing the harm-to-benefit ratio is crucial and this could be done using a multivariable approach, including all available relevant information [20 && , [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] ."}, {"section_title": "KEY POINTS", "text": "Screening reduces the risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer.\nMultiplex screening strategies are of proven benefit; genetics and multiparametric resonance imaging need further evaluation.\nMore research is needed to implement the current knowledge and identify the most optimal approach to engage in effective SDM about PSA in clinical practice.\nRates of PSA screening and overall prostate cancer incidence have declined following the USPSTF 2011-2012 recommendation against PSA. "}, {"section_title": "Monetary costs and costs for the individual and populations", "text": "During the past decade, we have seen plenty of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer emerge and many of them are now being proposed to be used in combination with one another and/or with clinical examination and imaging. However, the cost of screening, diagnosis, and treatment for prostate cancer can reach astronomical levels. In an editorial with the title 'Prostate Cancer Screening Biomarkers: An Emerging Embarrassment of 'Riches'?', Dr Eggener describes the challenge of choosing which biomarker to order and also points out that comparative effectiveness evaluations are critically important but lacking. In addition, the author points out that nowadays urologists have the availability of a large amount of tests and interventions, but that they are hardly aware of the costeffectiveness when ordering these tests [35 && ]. In a systematic review on the economics of prostate cancer screening, Lao et al. [36] argue that 'the decision-making for prostate cancer screening should be based on the cost per quality-adjusted life year rather than the cost per life year saved' and conclude that screening is not cost-effective. This conclusion is contrary to the cost-effectiveness analysis based on the ERSPC data, in which it is shown that prostate cancer screening can indeed be cost-effective, for instance when limited to two or three screens between ages 55 and 59 [37 & ]. However, correctly noted in [24 & ], focusing on cost-effectiveness should not lead to losing sight on the effectiveness of screening itself [38] .\nReviews on screening strategies Several reviews on prostate cancer screening strategies [39] [40] [41] [42] agreed on the fact that PSA-based screening, based on the evidence from populationbased PSA screening trials, reduces prostate cancer mortality, and also proposed that a more 'tailored' screening is needed to maximize early diagnosis of potentially aggressive but curable prostate cancer, while minimizing overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer. As such, screening should only be started after the process of SDM and while there are many promising biomarkers the strength will be in combining those into risk prediction models including outcomes of multiparametric MRI [16, 40] .\nIt is emphasized that active surveillance can serve as a well tolerated solution to avoid overtreatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer, whereas both radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy offer cancer control in young/fit patients when indicated [42] . In this context, it is worth mentioning that two of the largest active surveillance series published intermediate to long-term results in 2015. The Toronto series, with 993 men, median age 68 years, followed for a median of 6.4 years, used inclusive criteria and included men with very low-low-intermediate risk (T1c-T2a, PSA 10, age 70, Gleason score 6, or age >70, Gleason score 7), which embraced about 40-50% of eligible patients and the prostate cancer-specific survival was 98.1% at 10 years and 94.3% at 15 years [43 && ]. The Hopkins series, with 1298 men, median age 66 years, followed for a median of 5 years, used more restrictive criteria and included men with very low risk (T1c, Gleason score 6, PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm 3 , 2 pos cores, max 50% core involvement), which embraced about 10-20% of eligible patients and the prostate cancer-specific survival was 99.9% at 10 years and 99.9% at 15 years [44] .\nBiomarkers: prostate-specific antigen isoforms Numerous novel biomarkers for prostate cancer detection are now available and consist of serumbased, urine-based, and tissue-based assays that may supplement PSA testing, or even replace it. These are covered more extensively in another article in this issue. For the decision to perform a prostate biopsy for the first time, PSA-based assays such as the Prostate Health Index (PHI), percentage-free PSA (%f PSA), and the 4kallikrein panel (or the 4Kscore, which is a combination of four kallikreins and clinical data) test can be used [6] . For the decision to repeat biopsy PHI, %f PSA, and the 4Kscore, and the urine-based prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) [6] and TMPRSS2:ERG could be considered, as well as the tissue-based tests Confirm Molecular Diagnostics, Prostate Core Mitomic Test, and Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN). In addition, these tests can be combined with clinical data into so-called nomograms [45] . For instance, the Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS) combines PSA, PCA3, and TMPRSS2:ERG with the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculator [46] .\nEvidence is accumulating regarding the role of assessing a baseline PSA test to stratify future risk of life-threatening prostate cancer [47, 48] . A large study based on a multiethnic cohort of 2923 men, median age 58 years, were followed for 7.5 years for subsequent high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 7 or higher). It was shown that men with PSA 1 ng/ml were at 3.4% (95% CI 2.1-4.5) 10year risk of prostate cancer and 90% of these cancers were low risk, whereas risk was 39% in the highest PSA stratum (3-10 ng/ml). The authors therefore suggested that the rescreening interval could be up to 10 years for men with PSA < 1 ng/ml [47] .\nOn a similar theme, Boniol et al. [49] assessed the value of variation in PSA levels between two screening visits within 2 years in 31 286 men in the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO) with an initial value less than 4 ng/ml. The data showed that the risk of prostate cancer increased linearly with increasing PSA level at the second test. However, the variation in PSA was not associated with a higher Gleason score at the time of detection. This finding corroborates prior knowledge. It has previously been consistently shown that PSA rises [e.g. PSA velocity (PSAV) or PSA kinetics] do not increase the predictive accuracy above and beyond PSA alone [50, 51] , and it has been proposed that men with high PSAV should not be biopsied in the absence of other indications [52] .\nAmong the varying guidelines for PSA testing worldwide (Table 1) , there is no uniform consensus regarding the age to stop PSA testing and/or prostate biopsy. Many guidelines propose stopping routine PSA at age 70 or 75 and discuss the upper age limit in the context of general health and life expectancy, recommending no further screening for men with a life expectancy less than 10-15 years. Follow-up data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) suggest that men aged 75-80 years who have a PSA level below 3 ng/ml are unlikely to be diagnosed with a high-risk prostate cancer [53] . Long-term data from the Malm\u00f6 Preventive Project suggest that men aged 60 with a PSA level less than 1.0 ng/ml can possibly refrain from further testing [7, 54, 55] .\nBiomarkers: prostate cancer antigen 3 and genetics For the urine-based marker PCA3, more data became available but contradictory results on its diagnostic potential remain. Birnbaum et al [56] reported that the use of PCA3 added to the PSA test can reduce adverse screening outcomes. Referring men with PCA3 scores less than 35 for biopsy among men with PSA between 4 and 10 ng/ml retained 85% of lives saved while reducing false positives by almost 50% and overdiagnoses by 25%.\nYet, another study, part of the so-called IMPACT study, evaluated PCA3 in addition to PSA as a screening tool among BRCA1/2 carriers. However, the results did not provide evidence of additive predictive value of PCA3 in helping the decision to biopsy [57] .\nThe genetic epidemiology of prostate cancer is becoming better understood, including various mutational processes (such as E26 Transformation-Specific gene fusions; e.g. TMPRSS2:ERG or chromosomal rearrangements; e.g. PTEN loss) and germline variants [32] . Heritable BRCA2 and 1 mutations predispose to prostate cancer risk [29] , as do single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [30] . A long-term prospective cohort study of Nordic twins showed a heritability for prostate cancer of 57% [31] .\nWelch et al. [33] discussed cancer biology and screening methods by making inference from incidence data from SEER for prostate cancer and breast cancer. The authors speculated that whether the difference in incidence of metastatic disease at presentation is explained by different cancer dynamicswith prostate cancer fitting the Halstedian paradigm (with cancer arising at a single location, grows, and later metastasizes) or the Fisher paradigm (with cancer being a systemic disease already by the time it is detectable) -or the efficacy of two different screening strategies (a tumor marker versus anatomic imaging). If prostate cancer fits the Halstedian paradigm, it is particularly amenable to screening that allows for a stage shift, as shown in the ERSPC [20 && ,34], and thus detection at earlier stages. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to screen the genome for genetic variants, so-called SNPs. There are now almost 100 SNPs that have been found to be associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer. Despite evidence suggesting that these genetic variants can be used for improved risk stratification, they have not yet been routinely incorporated into routine clinical practice. Next to several original publications [58, 59] , Helfand et al. [60] reviewed their potential utility in prostate cancer screening and claim that it is possible that SNP analyses can help risk stratify men who have increased susceptibility and target PSA-based screening only to those men who are at increased risk. Same holds for SNPs that are strongly associated with PSA levels (so-called PSA-SNPs)."}, {"section_title": "Multiplex screening", "text": "Multivariable approaches to reduce the negative aspects of PSA-based screening have been proposed for many years. In a systematic review of 127 multivariable risk prediction models for PSA screening, also known as 'risk calculators', six met inclusion criteria: Prostataclass, Finne, Karakiewcz, PCPT, Chun, and the ERSPC-RC-3. A meta-analysis of these six risk calculators showed that they all improve the predictive accuracy of PSA testing, in terms of discrimination [61 && ]. However, calibration measures were poorly reported [62] . Smaller studies confirmed performance of multivariate prediction over a PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE)-based algorithms [63, 64] .\nAn interesting study on the theme multiplex screening published this year was the Stockholm-3 (STHLM3) trial from Sweden, in which Gr\u00f6nberg ], the PHI [66] and 4Kscore [68] as well as PSA followed by MRI in the G\u00f6teborg trial [16] , the STHLM3 test improved the specificity, increased the predictive accuracy of finding Gleason score 7 or higher (AUC 0.56, 95% CI 0.55-0.60 for PSA versus 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.60 for the STHLM3 test), and reduced the number of unnecessary biopsies (by 32%, 95% CI 23-39%) [65 && ]. The authors are to be congratulated for carrying out a major screening study, which is certainly a step in the right direction however, it is currently unknown whether the STHLM3 test really provides the so-needed major change in the balance of harm and benefit of prostate cancer screening.\nThere are yet no data on repeat STHLM3 testing or on outcomes such as prostate cancer mortality. In addition, it is difficult to grasp whether the addition of the SNPs is mandatory [69, 70] . As Lamb and Bratt [69] correctly point out, there are two kallikreinbased tests that are also capable in reducing unnecessary biopsies and selectively detecting high-grade disease, the PHI [66] , and the 4Kscore [68] , which may potentially be more cost-effective [69, 71] .\nRegarding the role of DRE as a screening tool, DRE has long been used to diagnose prostate cancer and it was shown in early screening studies that PSA outperforms DRE in terms of detecting organ-confined disease [72] . The major limitation with DRE is its subjective nature and its domain is limited to men with low PSA levels. Here the data are conflicting. Using data from the ERSPC Rotterdam study, Gosselaar et al. [73] showed that in men with PSA levels between 2.0 and 4.0 ng/ml DRE was of no additional value, and it potentially could avoid unnecessary biopsies but equally missed diagnoses of high-risk prostate cancer. Okotie et al. [74] confirmed this finding, but stated that delaying these diagnoses when only applying a PSA-based cutoff to trigger biopsy will delay diagnoses and threaten potential cure. As a result, guidelines disagree on whether to use the PSA test with or without DRE (Table 1) . However, when considering populationbased screening, DRE is not considered suitable because of its subjective nature."}, {"section_title": "Consequences of the USPSTF 2011-2012 recommendation", "text": "Prior to 2008, USPSTF gave prostate cancer screening a grade 'I' recommendation, that is 'insufficient evidence to recommend either for or against'. In 2008, this was changed to a grade 'D' recommending against screening men aged 75\u00fe, and in 2011 (draft recommendation) and 2012 they recommended against PSA for men of all ages [1] . This is in line with the Canadian Task Force [75] , but in contrast to the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines, which recommends SDM [2, 76] . The rationale for discouraging screening altogether is the USPSTF's concern that the harm of screening, that is mainly overdiagnosis and overtreatment, may not outweigh the benefits, that is reduced risk of metastasis and prostate cancer mortality [1] .\nThere ]. Two survey studies showed that there was awareness on the screening controversy, yet the majority of men still believed that screening saved lives and should be used despite the USPSTF recommendation [81, 82] . Jemal et al. [77 & ] examined the recent changes in stage-specific incidence and PSA-testing rates. The authors used SEER data on invasive prostate cancer incidence data from 2005 to 2012 and had the availability of 2013 incidence data from one registry (Georgia). Analyses showed that prostate cancer incidence rates started to decrease in 2008 and had the largest decrease between 2011 and 2012. Declines in incidence were only seen in local/regional stage disease. PSA testing decreased from 40.6% in 2008 to 30.8% in 2013 and was similar in men aged 50-74 and 75 years and older. Although these data cannot assess the full effect of the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, there is a decreasing trend in both incidence of low-risk prostate cancer and PSA testing. Sammon et al. ] similarly used the NHIS and found that prostate cancer screening rates declined significantly among men older than age 50 years after USPSTF 2012. However, a significant proportion of men continue to be screened despite a high risk of 9-year mortality, including one-third of men aged 75 years and older, suggesting that physicians may overestimate benefits and underestimate harm of screening in older men. Barocas et al. [83] found a 28% decrease in prostate cancer incidence in the year after the 2011 USPSTF draft guideline. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancer decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of nonlocalized disease did not change. Banerji et al. [84] analyzed the prospective database of 1726 patients undergoing prostate needle biopsies at Virginia Mason from 2004 to 2014 and found that patients in the post-USPSTF group had higher PSA levels (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be diagnosed with higher clinical stage and D'Amico highrisk prostate cancer (P \u00bc 0.036). Bhindi et al. [80] analyzed data of 3408 prostate biopsies performed at University Health Network (Toronto) and observed a decrease in detection of low-risk prostate cancer but found the sudden decrease in the detection rate of Gleason scores 7-10 concerning.\nWhether or not this will affect prostate cancer mortality rates remains to be seen. Do we already have solid evidence that more patients are actually starting to present with more high-risk and/or advanced prostate cancer since the USPSTF 2012? Well, there are opposing views. In a pro and con statement editorial, Dr Barry argues that the only way to assess the effect of the USPSTF recommendation is to look at prostate cancer mortality, which will take time, and furthermore, determining cause of death among men with prostate cancer can be difficult [85 && ]. Dr Nelson supports his pro statement by the observation that in the population prostate carcinogenesis is constant, as is progression of prostate cancer and instead the diagnosis of prostate cancer is now being delayed. Allowing a disease to progress before diagnosis means that it will be more advanced compared with earlier detection. This is a central tenet supporting all disease detection strategies and not just those for prostate cancer. Hence, stopping screening practices will undoubtedly affect rates of advanced disease at diagnosis and as such mortality [85 && ]. Prasad [86] similarly notes in an editorial that the pendulum has swung and Penson [87] argues that it might already have swung too far and that there is reason to be concerned. Instead of 'all or none' Penson proposes that we focus on accelerating the development of more individualized PSA screening strategies, for instance by quantifying baseline risk for high-risk using PSA in midlife or risk calculators [87] . Castle [88] says in an editorial that prostate cancer screening is 'far from perfect but that giving up PSA screening would be taking a 20-year step backwards in the prevention of prostate cancer deaths and might deny or scare off high-risk men who would clearly benefit', and similarly calls for implementation of more targeted risk-based strategies.\nThe USPSTF 2011-2012 recommendation was largely informed by data from the ERSPC and PLCO trials. However, the power of the PLCO trial to detect any difference in prostate cancer mortality between trial arms was limited, because PSA testing was already widespread in the USA during the course of the study [89] . Just recently, a reanalysis of PLCO data by independent investigators showed that men in the control group reported having had more cumulative PSA testing than men in the intervention group; the proportion of control participants who reported having undergone at least one PSA test before or during the trial was close to 90% [90] ."}, {"section_title": "Screening patterns, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, and family history", "text": "Worldwide, several articles [26,27 & ,91-99] studied screening trends and patterns in the community and in relation to ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, and disparity. They all came to the conclusion that uptake of PSA screening is strongly related to ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and level of education. This brings up the issue of what actually defines 'high risk' and data are conflicting. The role of family history of prostate cancer was examined within the PLCO trial (predominantly white men) whereby the authors suggest that men with a positive family history should be screened yearly with both DRE and PSA [100] . However, accumulating evidence, including data from the Korean heart study [101] , BLSA, and Malm\u00f6 studies, now suggests that the baseline PSA level in midlife is a stronger predictor of a future diagnosis of lethal prostate cancer than both family history [28, 102] and race [28] , which begs the question: why not obtain a baseline PSA to stratify risk in all men early in life? Vertosick et al. [28] argue that 'if a recommendation is made to screen early in men at high risk, a baseline PSA measurement at age 45 years would be a better method to identify men at high risk than family history or race'. Drs Carter and Albertsen [103] do not disagree with the authors, but argue that taking the history and informing a man who is black and/or has a positive family history about the pros and cons of PSA screening might be very different, than just ordering a PSA test on everyone of age 45. They also speculate that physicians will adapt the rescreening intervals to the PSA levels with closer monitoring of higher PSA levels and more spaced out measurements in those below the age median, but that starting screening at age 45 might result in unnecessary biopsies and treatment. On this point, Vickers does not believe that physicians would screen all men regularly at age 45-55 years, and notes that the recommendation is to have the same conversation with all men at age 45, rather than for instance recommending screening black men or those with a family history starting at age 45 and everyone else at age 55 [28] ."}, {"section_title": "Shared decision-making", "text": "SDM is a process in which an individual learns about the disease, the harms and benefits, alternatives and uncertainty of options, weighs his own values and preferences, and actively participates in the decision-making together with the clinician [104] . Most guidelines for prostate cancer screening emphasizes SDM [14] ; however, the 'how to' needs further study. How should we best engage in prescreening discussions [105] , what information should be given, and how should it be implemented in clinical practice? [13] The extent to which it is practiced in the real world is highly variable. Some authors propose that SDM for PSA screening should cover communication of four essential areas: the experts' opinions about the test; accuracy of the test; the need for treatment; and side-effects of treatment. However, this may be unrealistic to achieve in real life, as one study found less than 10% of respondents reporting that the patient-provider communication covered all four domains [106] . Furthermore, prescreening discussions correlate with PSA uptake [105] , either increasing or decreasing PSA screening rates depending on how the discussion about advantages and disadvantages go or how the decisionaid is framed; typically, decision-aids for prostate cancer screening reduces men's interest in PSA and makes them lean away from having the test [107] . The format can also play a role and based on several publications it is obvious that there is no one size fits all [108] [109] [110] [111] and that when confronted with the question to screen or not to screen, men want to know their risk and express acceptance to risk-stratified screening approaches such as more frequent screening if high risk and less frequent screening if low risk [112] ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In conclusion, the debate on prostate cancer screening has shifted from 'does PSA do any good?' to 'does PSA do more good than harm?'. Data emerging in 2015 and early 2016 has provided evidence on the question of how best to screen. New biomarkers, multiplex screening, and PSA-based risk stratification at early age can shift the ratio of benefits and harms. However, it is crucial that guidelines and readily available risk stratification tools are implemented into daily practice, in order to stop the misuse of the PSA test [113] . In this article based on the ERSPC data shows that screening works through a stage shift.
