Also, differences in the 8 number of sequenced genomes between countries and/or months make it difficult to identify 9 the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number 10 of cases are reported. We propose an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases 11 of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. 12\nFurthermore, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the temporal and 13 geographic distribution of haplotypes in the world. Using 171 461 genomes, we identify five 14 major haplotypes (OTUs) based on nine high-frequency mutations. OTU_3 characterized by 15 mutations R203K and G204R is currently the most frequent haplotype circulating in four of the 16 six continents analyzed. On the other hand, during almost all months analyzed, OTU_5 17 characterized by the mutation T85I in nsp2 is the most frequent in North America. Recently 18 (since September), OTU_2 has been established as the most frequent in Europe. OTU_1, the 19 ancestor haplotype is near to extinction showed by its low number of isolations since May. Also, 20\nwe analyzed whether age, gender, or patient status is more related to a specific OTU. We did 21 not find OTU's preference for any age group, gender, or patient status.

Several efforts to produce vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests to help in the fight 29 against SARS-CoV-2 are being mounted in a large number of laboratories all around the world. 30\nSince the publication on January 24 th of the first complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from 31\nChina (Zhu et al. 2020 ), thousands of genomes have been sequenced in a great number of 32 countries on all 5 continents and were made available in several databases. This marks a 33 milestone in scientific history and gives us an unprecedented opportunity to study how a specific 34 virus evolves in a worldwide context. As of November 30 th , 2020, the GISAID database (Shu et  35 al To complement these current classification systems, we consider that haplotypes description 43 and nomenclature could help to better track important mutations that are currently circulating 44 in the world. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes aids in understanding the evolution of the 45 virus and may improve our efforts to control the disease. 46\nTo perform a reasonable analysis of the worldwide temporal and geographical distribution of 47 SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, we need to take into account the differences in the number of 48 sequenced genomes in months and countries or continents. Thus, we first used a data set of 171 49 461 complete genomes to estimate the worldwide relative frequency of nucleotides in each 50 SARS-CoV-2 genomic position and found nine mutations with respect to the reference genome 51 EPI_ISL_402125 with normalized relative frequencies (NRFp) representing to be present in more 52 than 9 500 000 COVID-19 cases. After that, using a total of 109 953 complete genomes without 53 ambiguous nucleotides from GISAID we performed a phylogenetic analysis and correlated the 54 major branches with SARS-CoV-2 variants which can be classified into five haplotypes or 55\nOperational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on the distribution of the nine identified nucleotide 56 positions in our NRFp analysis. After that, we analyzed the geographical and temporal worldwide 57 distribution of OTUs normalized by the number of COVID-19 cases. Also, we attempt to correlate 58 these OTUs with patient status, age, and gender information. Finally, we discuss the current 59 hypothesis of the most frequent mutations on protein structure and function. All this 60 information will be continuously updated in our publicly available web-page 61\n(http://sarscov2haplofinder.urp.edu.pe/). 62"}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:", "text": "63"}, {"section_title": "Mutations frequency analysis 64", "text": "The GISAID database contains 171 461 genomes with at least 29 000 sequenced bases; from 65 these, 109 953 genomes do not present ambiguities (as of November 30th). With an alignment 66 of the 171 461 genomes, we performed a normalized relative frequency analysis of each 67 nucleotide in each genomic position (NRFp) (see material and methods for details). This 68 normalization was performed to detect relevant mutations that could appear in regions where 69 few genomes were sequenced ( Fig. S1 shows that no correlation exists between the number of 70 cases and the number of sequenced genomes). Using this NRFp analysis, we identified nine 71 positions estimated to be in more than 9 500 000 COVID-19 cases (more than 0.18 NRFp) ( Fig.  72 1.A and S2.A) plus many other mutations with NRFp between 0.00-0.18 ( Fig. S2 .B and S2.C). 73\nThe nine most frequent mutations (NRFp greater than 0.18) comprise seven non-synonymous 74 mutations, one synonymous mutation, and one mutation in the 5'-UTR region of the SARS-CoV-75 2 genome ( Fig. 1.A) . The three consecutive mutations G28881A, G28882A, and G28883C falls at 76\nthe 5` ends of the forward primer of \"China-CDC-N\" (Table. S1 ). Because these three mutations 77 are at the 5` ends, it is unlikely that those mutations greatly affect amplification efficiency. The 78 other six mutations do not fall within regions used by qRT-PCR diagnostic kits ( noted that combinations of those nine positions represent  87 five well-defined groups in the tree ( Fig. 1.B ). Using these combinations, we defined 5 88\nhaplotypes that allow us to classify more than 97 % of the analyzed genomes ( Fig. 1 (OTU_3 and  108 OTU_4), as shown in the maximum likelihood tree ( Fig. 1.B ). OTU_2 is divided into two major 109 branches, one that originates OTU_3 and another more recent branch characteristic from 110\nEurope (see below, worldwide geographical distribution of OTUs). 111\nOn February 16th in the United Kingdom, a SARS-CoV-2 with three adjacent mutations 112 (G28881A, G28882A, and G28883C) (Fig. S3 ) in N protein was isolated. These three mutations 113\n(together with those that characterized OTU_2) define OTU_3. The maximum likelihood tree 114\nshows that OTU_4 comes from OTU_2. OTU_4 does not present mutations in N protein; instead, 115\nit presents a variation in Orf3a (G25563T). Finally, OTU_5 presents all the mutations of OTU_4 116 plus one nsp2 mutation (C1059T). 117\nThese nine mutations have been separately described in other reports but, to our knowledge, 118 they have not yet used been used together to classify SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes during the 119 pandemic. The change of relative frequencies of those mutations analyzed individually showed 120 that just in few cases, mutations that define haplotypes described here appear independently 121 (Fig. S4 ). For example, the four mutations that define OTU_2 (C241T, C30307T, C14408T and 122 A23403G) rarely had been described separately and similarly with mutations that characterize 123 OTU_3 (G28881A, G28882A, G28883C) (Fig. S4) . Thus, in this case analysis of haplotypes will be 124 identical results that if we analyzed those mutations independently. 125\nThe fact that we were able to classify more than 97 % of the complete genomes data set ( Fig.  126 1.C) shows that, at least to the present date, this classification system covers almost all the 127 currently known genomic information around the world. Also, most of the unclassified tips 128 appear within a clade allowing us to easily establish their phylogenetic relationships to a 129 haplotype. Thus, at the moment this system can be of practical use to analyze the geographical 130 and temporal distribution of haplotypes during these eleven months of 2020. For convenience 131 we presented "}, {"section_title": "Worldwide geographic distribution of OTUs 134", "text": "Using our OTUs classification, we analyzed the worldwide geographic distribution during eleven 135 months of 2020. We began by plotting continental information in the ML tree of the 136 unambiguous complete genomes (Fig. 2 .A) and observed some interesting patterns. For 137 instance, all continents contain all OTUs; also, is relatively clear that most isolates belonging to 138 OTU_5 come from North America (Fig. 2.A) . Furthermore, the biggest branch of OTU_2 is almost 139 exclusively filled by genomes from Europe, is interesting to note that this branch also contains 140 genomes isolated in the last months analyzed showing its relatively recent appearance (see 141 below, the worldwide temporal distribution of OTUs). However, this approach does not allow us 142\nto evaluate continents with less sequenced genomes ( Fig. S5 .A), such as South America, Oceania, 143\nand Africa. Also, it is possible that fine differences can be found in the frequency of one OTU 144 concerning another in each continent. These differences are not observed at this level of 145\nanalysis. 146\nTo better analyze which were the most prevalent OTUs in each continent, we analyzed all the 147 complete genomes in the GISAID database (171 461 genomes). In this analysis, we compared 148 the mean of the frequency of OTUs normalized by cases in each continent of six randomly 149 selected groups of genomes (see material and methods for more details). 150\nThis approach more clearly illustrates that OTU_5 was the most prevalent in North America, 151 followed by OTU_2 and OTU_3, the least prevalent were OTU_1 and OTU_4 ( Fig. 2 .B). The first 152 genomes in North America belonged to OTU_1 (Fig. S6 ). Since March, North America was 153 dominated by OTU_5 (Fig. S6 ). OTU_5 has six of the nine high-frequency genomic variations 154 described (all except those in N protein) ( Fig. 1 analyzed presents an estimation of more than 50 % COVID-19 cases with a SARS-CoV-2 with the 169 three mutations in the N protein. We, therefore, believe that is important to more deeply study 170\nif exists positive fitness implications for these mutations. 171\nEurope presents an interesting pattern, it follows a similar pattern to South America, Asia, 172\nOceania, and Africa until July (Fig. S6) , with OTU_3 as the predominant. Then, in August, OTU_2 173 increased its frequency, and since September OTU_2 is the most prevalent in Europe. This could 174 be caused by the appearance of mutations in the background of OTU_2 (such as those described 175 in Justo et al. 2020) with greater fitness than those of OTU_3 or due to other effects (i.e., founder 176 effects) after the relaxation of lockdown policies. 177"}, {"section_title": "Worldwide temporal distribution of OTUs 178", "text": "A rooted tree was estimated with the 109 953 genomes data set and labeled by date (Fig. 3.A) . 179 Here, we can observe that OTU_1 is mostly labeled with colors that correspond to the first 180 months of the pandemic, expected due to its relation with the first genomes isolated. Clades, 181\nwhere OTU_2, OTU_3, OTU_4, and OTU_5 are the most prevalent, have similar distributions, 182\nwith representatives mostly isolated since April. The biggest branch of OTU_2 presents a very 183 specific temporal distribution with almost all the genomes isolated from September to 184\nNovember. 185\nTo gain more insight into these patterns, we estimated the most prevalent OTUs in the world 186 during each month of the pandemic following similar steps that those done for continents (see 187 material and methods for details). In this analysis, we did not consider December and January 188 that present all genomes except one belonging to OTU_1 and mainly from Asia ( Fig.S6 and S7). 189\nAnalysis using the data of February from North America, Europe, and Asia showed that OTU_1 190\ncontinued as the most prevalent in the world but with first isolations of OTU_2, OTU_3, OTU_4, 191\nand OTU_5 ( Fig. 3 .B). Analysis by continents showed that during this month Asia and North 192\nAmerica still had higher proportions of OTU_1, but in Europe, a more homogeneous distribution 193 of OTU_1, OTU_2 and OTU_3 was observed (Fig. S6 ). 194\nIn March, when the epicenter of the pandemic moved to Europe and North America, but cases 195\nwere still appearing in Asia, OTU_2, OTU_3, and OTU_5 increased their prevalence but OTU_1 196 remained slightly as the most prevalent during this month ( Fig. 3 .C). Interestingly, OTU_4 197 remained in relatively low frequencies ( Fig. 3 .C). This month contains the more homogenous 198\nOTUs distribution in a worldwide context, but with some OTUs more prevalent in each continent 199 (Fig. S6 ). 200\nDuring April, OTU_1 continued its downward while OTU_3 and OTU_5 increased their presence 201 ( Fig. 3 .D) probably due to its higher representation (compared to March) in several continents 202 such as South America, North America, and Europe ( Fig. S6 ). During this month, Africa showed 203 a high prevalence of OTU_2 (Fig. S6 ). We also witnessed the establishment of OTU_3 in South 204\nAmerica and OTU_5 in North America (Fig. S6 ). 205\nMay, June, and July showed a similar pattern, with OTU_3 as the most prevalent due to its high 206 frequencies in South America, Oceania, and Europe ( Fig. 3 S9 .B). 234\nUsing this limited data, we attempt to determine whether any OTU causes an asymptomatic, 235 mild, or severe infection more frequently. We look for significant differences between the 236 relative frequencies of the OTUs in total samples and samples with known patient information. 237\nIf we found differences, it would mean that some OTU could be more or less related to one type 238 of infection. Here, we analyzed just the month-continent combination with at least 45 genomes 239 with information of one type of infection and at least two times of genomes with any 240 information (for example Asia -February has 58 Asymptomatic genomes and 613 total 241 genomes). Ten combinations meet these criteria, one in the asymptomatic category, one in the 242 mild, and eight in the severe. None of the OTUs frequencies in samples with patient status 243 information were significative different from the frequencies in the total population of the 244 month-continent analyzed (Fig. 4) . Thus, we concluded that none of the OTUs are related to an 245 asymptomatic, mild, or severe COVID-19, at least in the populations analyzed. 246\nAge information was also analyzed in the same manner. In general, although some differences 247\nwere detected as significant, those were not consistently maintained between different 248 populations analyzed (Fig. S10 .A-J). Furthermore, none difference reaches a p-value less than 249 0.01 (Except for OTU_4 in North America). Since heterogeneity between countries information 250 is possible, we think that these small differences are more likely due to these heterogeneities 251 and we cannot strongly conclude that some age groups are more related to a specific OTU. 252\nAdditionally, a strong positive correlation between total relative frequencies of OTUs and 253 relative frequencies by age groups in month-continent was found, meaning that those two 254 frequencies are similar in most of the analyzed populations (Fig. S10 ."}, {"section_title": "K) 255", "text": "A similar approach was done using gender information, but in this case, due to the greater 256 quantity of information, we used more restrictive filter parameters. Thus, we selected country-257\nmonth combinations with at least 250 genomes with male or female information and two times 258 total genomes information (for instance USA -March has 2079 genomes from female patients 259 and 9287 genomes with or without gender information).

In the absence of P322, 298 the mutation P323L would probably be disfavored due to the flexibilization of the turn at the 299 end of helix 10.

It has been suggested that the D614G change in the S1 domain that results from the 304 A23403G mutation generates a more infectious virus, less spike shedding, greater incorporation 305 in pseudovirions , and higher viral load (Korber et al. 2020) . 306\nHow these effects occur at the structural level remains unclear, although some hypotheses have 307 been put forward: 1) We think that there is no evidence for hydrogen-bond between D614 and 308 T859 mentioned by Korber et al. 2020 , distances between D614 and T859 are too long for a 309 hydrogen bond (Fig S13.B) , 2) distances between Q613 and T859 ( Fig. S13 .C) could be reduced 310 by increased flexibility due to D614G substitution, forming a stabilizing hydrogen bond, 3) 311 currently available structures do not show salt-bridges between D614 and R646 as proposed by 312\nZhang et al. 2020 (Fig. S13.D) . al. 2020 showed that Orf3a preferentially transports Ca+2 or K+ ions through a pore (Fig S14.B ). 319\nSome constrictions were described in this pore, one of them formed by the side chain of Q57 320 (Fig. S14.C) . 321\nMutation G25563T produces the Q57H variant of Orf3a (Fig. S14.C) . It did not show significant 322 differences in expression, stability, conductance, selectivity, or gating behavior (Kern et al. 323 2020). We modeled Q57H mutation and we did not observe differences in the radius of 324 constriction ( Fig. S14 .C) formed by residue 57 but we observed slight differences in the 325 electrostatic surface due to the ionizability of the histidine side chain (Fig. S14.D) . Here, we present a complete geographical and temporal worldwide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 341 haplotypes from December 2019 to November 2020. We identified nine high-frequency 342 mutations. These important variations (asserted mainly by their frequencies) need to be tracked 343 during the pandemic.\nOur haplotypes description showed to be phylogenetically consistent, allowing us to easily 345 monitor the spatial and temporal changes of these mutations in a worldwide context. This was 346 only possible due to the unprecedented worldwide efforts in the genome sequencing of SARS-347\nCoV-2 and the public databases that rapidly share the information. 348\nOur geographical and temporal analysis showed that OTU_3 is currently the more frequent 349 haplotype circulating in four of six continents (Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America), result 350\nthat is in accordance with other studies (Mercatelli et al. 2020) that showed GISAID clade GR 351\n(that corresponds to our OTU_3) as the most prevalent in the world; however, they did not 352 report the currently predominance of OTU_2 in Europe (clade G for GISAID Although OTU_1 was the only and the most abundant haplotype at the beginning of the 361 pandemic, now its isolation is rare. This result shows an expected adaptation process of SARS-362\nCoV-2. This enunciate does not mean that SARS-CoV-2 is now more infectious or more 363\ntransmissible. 364\nIn the next months, these haplotypes description will need to be updated, identification of new 365 haplotypes could be performed by combining the identification of new frequent mutations and 366 phylogenetic inference. We will continue monitoring the emergence of mutations that exceed 367 our proposed cut-off of 0.18 NRFp and this information will be rapidly shared with the scientific 368 community through our web page (http://sarscov2haplofinder.urp.edu.pe/). This will also be 369 accompanied by a continuous update of haplotypes information. During the peer-review 370 process o this manuscript, we identify several other mutations near to the cut-off proposed that 371\nwere reported in Justo et al. 2020. 372 Using information of specific populations we showed no preference for patient's features (age, 373 gender, or type of infection) by OTUs. Thus, mutations that define those haplotypes do not have 374 a relevant impact on the severity of the disease neither are implied preferentially in infections 375 to males, females, or age. 376\nFinally, although more studies need to be performed to increase our knowledge of the biology 377 of SARS-CoV-2, we were able to make hypotheses about the possible effects of the most 378 frequent mutations identified. This will help in the development of new studies that will impact 379 vaccine development, diagnostic test creation, among others. 380 other biases are more difficult, if possible, to reduce or eliminate. 417"}, {"section_title": "Analysis of OTUs geographical distribution: 418", "text": "In this analysis, we randomly separate the genomes into 6 samples of 28 576 genomes each. 419\nGenomes in each sample was divided by continents and by months.
