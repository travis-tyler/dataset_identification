[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of school size in relation to the added-value of the Mandarin performance test. Data were collected from 5 th & 6 th Grades Mandarin academic tests, and a questionnaire. 3642 students and 158 principals were identified through stratified sampling from 158 primary schools in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China. The Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) was used to analyse the data. Findings demonstrated that: 1) There is a positive linear relationship between school size and the Mandarin added-value scores, therefore the value-added scores are greater. 2)\nUnder the condition of no-controlling background variable on the stated school sizes, students in the schools of more than 810 students got significantly higher added-value scores than their counterparts in the schools of less than 810 students. However, under the additional condition of controlling background variables, there is no such relationship between them. This study may help the educators and government improve Mandarin education in minority areas in China."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The influence of school size (school scale) has been central to the field of education research for half a century. In international studies, the school size is widely associated with the number of students and the school number. Considering the comparability between them, the school size concept will be used in demonstrating the empirical results here."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "China is a multi-ethnic country, where different ethnic groups have their own languages. In these autonomous regions, Mandarin is the second language which they learn in school. Mandarin can make ethnic minority students in China become more competitive and have more chances of employment. They start to learn how to speak, read, and write in Mandarin since their primary education. For most of these students, however, school is the only place where they can practice or communicate with each other in Mandarin. School is the most important factor here, a place for them to learn Mandarin. In addition, the influence of school size on students' Mandarin learning also cannot be ignored."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review--Effects of School Size on students' academic performance", "text": "The effects of School Size can be traced back to 1960s which have determined the results of the empirical researches on school factors including the school size influence on the students' academic achievement. The American scholar Kiesling et al. (1968) stated that there was a significant negative correlation between the primary students' school performance and high school size in New York school districts. After 20 years, especially in the primary stage, most empirical studies showed that smaller schools had more independent and positive effects on the student's academic performance than the larger ones. Since 1990, based on a large sample of empirical research, 57 studies were made on school size.\nThe research data used were generated by The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS: 88) . 9 out of these studies were related to primary school, however, no significant correlation between school size and students' academic performance was found (Saddoski & Willson, 2016) . In 1990, the studies conducted by Ebert et al.\ndemonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between them, which means that, the smaller the school is, the better the student's academic achievement is. In the previous literature of school size and academic performance, there were 19 studies related to high school. Bradley and Taylor et al. developed five studies (1998), and they identified that as the school size grew, students' academic performance and the annual increment soared. Evidence from Swakins et al's six studies indicated that an inverted U-shape relationship existed between the school size and the academic performance and the optimal school size was 1200 students. Before the inflection point of 1200 students, student's academic performance increased while after that point, a decline followed. Andrews et al. (2002) found from their eight studies that along with the growth of the school size, there was a trend of decline in the students' academic performance. In 2009, Kenneth published a paper based on the relationship between school size and students' social and economic background. Kenneth concluded that for primary schools, when most of the students were from disadvantaged or complex social and economic groups, the optimal number of students should be limited below 300; when the http: //dx.doi.org/10.15405/epsbs.2017.10.21 Corresponding Author: Yufang Bian Selection and peer-review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the conference eISSN: 228 students they serve are largely from the advantaged social and economic groups or of diverse backgrounds, the school size should be below 500 students. For high schools, most of the students were from disadvantaged or complex social and economic groups, the optimal number of students should be limited below 600; when the students they serve are from a diverse social and economic background or a single student groups, the school size should be below 1000 students.\nApparently, the abovementioned empirical research led to different results regarding the influence of school size on students' performance. The American scholar Jacob (2009) pointed out that the three factors attributed to the difference. First of all, there was a lack of unified definition of the core concepts in previous literature. For instance, the criteria of delimiting the school size, the critical path to distinguish large-size from small-size school, was not fully defined. Another example is the measurement of student's academic achievement. It was measured by the standardized test scores and graduation rates.\nThe measurement should be replaced by the current annual academic performance? Which one is more valuable? Second, in terms of data analysis method and its design, most researchers did not consider the characteristics of nested data, and they mainly use the traditional correlation analysis, regression, analysis and other methods. Finally, there are background variables that may affect the education fair. While studies did not usually control the background variables, some studies control socioeconomic variables; in the meantime, some studies also controlled other variables such as school regional, students' gender variables."}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "Although there was a large quantity of literature about the influence of school size on student's academic performance internationally, there are no research on the relationship between school size and Chinese ethnic minority students' performance in Mandarin learning.

Variables with imputed values were then transformed into an international metric using the OECD averages of 0 and the OECD standard deviations of 1. These OECD standard variables were used for a principal component analysis by applying an OECD population weight giving each OECD country a weight of 1000.\nWe use the method for a multi-layer Linear Model to process the data. Comparing it to the traditional regression method, it has a relatively weak statistical hypothesis, and it can make full use of the given information of different levels. It has the advantage of estimating more accurately and interpreting more reasonably. The multi-layer linear analysis software package HLM6.08 is the common tool to deal with nested data. In this research, we mainly use two main layers of linear model: the first layer level for the students, the second level for the school.\nIn the process of analysis, it mainly includes three models:\nModel 1-a: Null Model (Baseline Model for preparing):\nModel 2-a: Adding SCHSIZE into the Model: \n\u00b5 %# is the random effects of Level 2, the mean is 0, and the variance is \u03c4 %% ."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The influence of school size value-added scores to the school n Analysis about Null Model results and the relationship between school size and school valueadded scores", "text": "From the Null Model, we get the results and find the relationship between school size and school value-added score analysis as follows: From table 04, we can calculate that ICC = 27.932%, students' value-added scores about 27.932% of the total variation is caused by the differences between schools, and individual differences between students accounted for about 72.068%.\nBased on Model 1, we add school variables in Level-2 of Model 2, and we get the results as follows: "}, {"section_title": "233", "text": "In the Model 2-b, we add variables school size and school size square, and the results are as follows: (table 07) between school size and value-added scores (\u03b3 %/ = \u22120.241 * * ).

Schools with size 1-3 are significantly lower than those schools with size 4-6 on the added-value scores of the Mandarin competency tests. We didn't find a significant difference between schools with size 4-6, and there was no significant difference between schools with size 1-3 in the research either.

However, on the adding control variables condition, after we added the school district, the school social-economic status, the school teaching type into the school model, added gender, ethnic group, and family social-economic status into the student model, we found that there were no significant differences between different school sizes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The relationship between school size and Mandarin competency test", "text": "Research has shown that there is a positive linear relationship between school size and Mandarin scores, so the greater the school size is the higher the added-value scores are. While this result is incompatible with what the previous studies showed, it is consistent with other findings in this area. Schreiber (2002) studied the effects of school size, gathering students' scores of 1839 students in TIMSS test from 162 schools, and the result showed that larger school size is associated with higher academic achievement. In 2003, the research conclusion of PISA has also shown that there is a significant positive correlation between school size and academic achievement. Considering the status quo of the bilingual ethnic groups teaching in China, compared to the smaller schools, the immediate cause of larger-size primary schools' Mandarin performance may be better because it has better teaching conditions, students with a better status background, a higher amount of quality teachers, however, this still needs more evidence through further research. Focusing on the school size borderline, we found that it is consistent with the pursuit of increasing the educational efficiency and quality. In our research, for Mandarin added-value scores, under the nocontrolling variables condition, students' academic performance in schools of more than 810 students had significantly higher added-value scores than their peers in the schools of less than 810 students. This means that 810 students could be the borderline of Mandarin added-value, however, 810 is the minimum number of school size. But after adding the controlling variables (family social economic status, gender, ethnics into the student level; and we add school social economic status, school district, school teaching type into the school level), the borderline vanished. The result is very different from statement that 500 was the borderline.\nAlthough some valuable conclusions are obtained in this research, the present situation of bilingual education in ethnic primary schools in China is complex. Further exploration and discussion are needed.\nIn ethnic minority areas in China, the government tends to invest more on larger primary schools, so larger ethnic schools' educational conditions will be better than smaller ones with richer resources. This means that there are other factors that could mediate or moderate the relationship between school size and Mandarin added-value scores."}]
