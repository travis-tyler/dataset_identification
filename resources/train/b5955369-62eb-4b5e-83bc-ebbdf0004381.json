[{"section_title": "introduction", "text": "In 2014, it is estimated that there will be 1 665 540 new diagnoses of cancer and 585 720 deaths due to cancer in the United States, alone [1] . Surgery remains a mainstay definitive treatment of cancer and is the gold standard for treatment across many major cancer sites [2] . One-month mortality is used an important surgical quality metric and deaths within 1 month of the date of surgery are considered treatment related when quantifying operative mortality [3] . Reducing 1-month surgical mortality is a priority for providers and policymakers, and programs such as the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) have been developed to help achieve this goal [4] . Nevertheless, there are little data in the literature which elicits the incidence and determinants of 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery across all major cancer sites. Furthermore, although there is literature to suggest that there are disparities in surgical outcomes negatively impacting disadvantaged populations, few studies have examined the associations between sociodemographics and surgical outcomes among patients with cancer [5, 6] .\nIdentifying the nationwide incidence of and factors associated with 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery could inform policy decisions and allow for targeted interventions that aim to improve cancer survival and reduce sociodemographic disparities in adverse outcomes. We used the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to study a contemporary cohort of over 1.1 million patients to establish and determine the incidence and determinants of 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery for the 10 most common or most fatal cancers in the United States."}, {"section_title": "patients and methods patient population and study design", "text": "Sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) program collects and publishes cancer incidence, survival, and treatment data from population-based cancer registries; the 17 tumor registries encompass nearly 28% of the US population and capture \u223c97% of incident cancers [7] . Using the most contemporary release of the SEER database, we selected and studied a cohort of 1 110 236 patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2011 with localized nonmetastatic forms of cancers that are among the top 10 most commonly diagnosed or the 10 which cause the most cancer deaths annually in the United States (resulting in 15 total cancer sites: colorectal, esophagus, thyroid, breast, pancreatic, endometrial, ovarian, head/neck, prostate, lung, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, bladder, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and kidney cancer) [1] who received cancer-directed surgery of the primary site as a part of curative or radical treatment. Patients were not selected for the study if a diagnosis of cancer was made at autopsy, a prior malignancy was diagnosed, metastatic disease was present, one of the independent covariates defined below was missing, or if patients were not identified as having a surgical procedure categorized by SEER as cancer-directed.\nThe primary outcome of interest was death within 1 month of cancerdirected surgery. We were unable to use 30-day mortality following surgery since SEER codes survival time using month and year (based on dates of diagnosis and death) rather than reporting exact dates. However, given that SEER coding rules dictate that the date of diagnosis must precede any cancer-directed therapy (including surgery), we considered patients who died within the same month as diagnosis or in the subsequent month to have died within 1 month of surgery in our primary analyses. This method for obtaining 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery from the SEER database has previously been described [8] .\nThe independent covariates of interest were sex, race, marital status, income, educational status, residence, insurance status, and tumor stage. Tumor stage was determined using the AJCC 6th edition as provided by SEER [7] . Sex was classified as male versus female, race was classified as nonHispanic white versus non-white minority (African American, Hispanic/ Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, or other race), and marital status was classified as married versus not married as designated by the SEER program. Income (computed as median household income) and educational status (computed as the percentage of residents \u226525 years of age with at least a high school education) were approximated through use of county-level data by linking to the 2000 United States Census [9] . Both income and educational status were stratified by respective medians, creating high income (top 50th percentile) versus low income (bottom 50th percentile) and high educational status (top 50th percentile) versus low educational status (bottom 50th percentile) variables. Residence type was also determined by linking to the 2003 United States Department of Agriculture rural-urban continuum codes [10] . We analyzed insurance coverage as a dichotomous variable given that SEER does not provide information on the specific type of insurance coverage that patients have. Specifically, a patient was considered 'insured' if s/he was classified by SEER as 'insured,' 'insured/ no specifics,' or 'any Medicaid,' and patients were considered 'uninsured' if they were classified as such. Of note, the insurance variable was only available from 2007 to 2011 as provided by SEER and so the primary analyses capturing information back to 2004 were not able to include insurance status. Furthermore, all analyses detailed below that included insurance status had study populations limited to age <65 as SEER recommends exercising caution when using the insurance status variable among patients over 65 given that many who are classified as 'uninsured' are Medicare eligible. To minimize the potential error in our approach of designating patients who died within 1 month of surgery (i.e. a patient that was diagnosed and treated on the first day of 1 month who died on the last day of the next month), we completed sensitivity analyses where we very strictly redefined death within 1 month to be death within the same month as diagnosis (and not the subsequent month); these patients were diagnosed with cancer, received cancer-directed surgery, and died all in the same month. Multivariable logistic regression sensitivity analyses using this strict definition were repeated for all cancers. Furthermore, since cancer-directed surgeries for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are rare given that systemic therapy is the mainstay for the disease, we completed a multivariable logistic regression sensitivity analysis excluding all patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 30 669).\nAll P values were two sided. The threshold of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) for all analyses. This study was approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center institutional review board; approval was exempt."}, {"section_title": "results patient characteristics", "text": "Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics are displayed in Table 1 . Overall, 53 498 patients (4.8%) died within 1 month of cancer-directed surgery; 1-month raw unadjusted mortality rates by site are displayed in supplementary Table S1 , available at Annals of Oncology online. Notably, patients who suffered from 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery were 5 years older (on average) than patients who survived at least 1 month after cancer surgery and were more likely to come from counties with lower income and education levels (P < 0.001 in all cases), although differences were small in clinical magnitude. Furthermore, there were a larger proportion of patients with advanced T3 or T4 disease, males, non-white minorities, and rural residents among those who suffered 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery than among patients who survived beyond 1 month (P < 0.001 in all cases).\nfactors associated with 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery After adjustment for all sociodemographics, patients who were married, insured, or who had a top 50th percentile income or educational status all had lower odds of 1-month mortality from (Table 2) . Patients who were non-white minority, male, or older ( per year increase in age) or who had Tumor stage 4 disease all had a higher risk of 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery, with AORs of 1.13 (95% CI 1.11-1.15; P < 0.001), 1.11 (95% CI 1.08-1.13; P < 0.001), 1.02 (95% CI 1.02-1.03; P < 0.001), and 1.89 (95% CI 1.82-1.95; P < 0.001), compared with nonHispanic whites, females, younger patients, and patients with T1 disease, respectively ( On sensitivity analysis, when 1-month mortality after cancerdirected surgery was very strictly defined as death within the same month as diagnosis and surgery (and not in the subsequent month), the rate of 1-month mortality dropped to 3.3% (N = 36 273; supplementary Table S1 , available at Annals of Oncology online) and all associations remained nearly identical except for the protective associations between both insurance status and the top 50th percentile of educational status and 1-month mortality after cancer surgery [AOR 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-1.00; P = 0.05) and AOR 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.01; P = 0.35), respectively] (Table 2 ). Furthermore, when excluding patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 30 669), all of the aforementioned factors remained significantly associated with 1-month mortality after cancer surgery except for top 50th percentile educational status [AOR 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00; P = 0.21)] ( Table 2 ). Figure 1 displays forest plots for each of the sociodemographic determinants which were found to be significantly associated with death after 1-month mortality of surgery (marital status, insurance status, race, income, and educational status) by cancer site. These determinants remained significantly associated with 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery for most but not all sites ( Figure 1A-F) ."}, {"section_title": "discussion", "text": "Using a large national and contemporary cohort of over 1.1 million patients who underwent cancer-directed surgery, we found that 4.8% of patients died within 1 month of the operation. Patients who were married, insured, or who had a top 50th percentile income or educational status had 20%, 12%, 5%, and 2% lower odds of suffering from 1-month mortality from cancer-directed surgery, compared with patients who were not married, uninsured, or who had a bottom 50th percentile income or educational status, respectively. Furthermore, patients who were non-white minority, male, or older ( per year increase), or who had T4 disease had 13%, 11%, 2%, and 89% higher odds of suffering from 1 month of cancer-directed surgery compared with whites, females, and younger patients, and those with T1 disease, respectively. These associations remained nearly identical when strictly defining 1-month mortality from cancer-directed surgery as death within the same month as diagnosis [except for insurance status (P = 0.05) and educational status (P = 0.35)]. Furthermore, these associations remained significant within most of the individual cancer sites evaluated.\nThis study is the largest of its kind and draws attention to the concerning finding that nationwide, nearly 1 in 20 patients receiving cancer-directed surgery died within 1 month of the procedure. This result is higher than what has typically been reported in the literature, such as 0.3%-0.5% after radical prostatectomy [11] , \u223c3% after cystectomy [12] , and up to 8.1% after colorectal surgery [13] , but it is important to remember that previously published results mostly come from high-volumespecialized academic centers, while the data reported here represent what is going on nationwide. There is mature literature which has demonstrated that 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery is closely linked to hospital and surgeon volume; notably, it has been shown that low-volume hospitals have up to a 77% increased relative risk of 1-month mortality compared with high-volume centers after radical prostatectomy and absolute 1-month mortality rates can vary by nearly 30% (from 3.5% to 44.1%) after surgery for colorectal cancer [11, 14] . Furthermore, systems characteristics (i.e. high nurse to patient ratios, presence of complex medical oncology services, presence of positron emission tomography scanners) and hospital complexity (based on degree of clinical variety managed by hospital) have also been demonstrated to be independently associated with surgical mortality rates, with better outcomes in surgical centers with more resources and increasing complexity [15] . High-volume and -quality surgical centers are able to achieve low 1-month surgical mortality rates likely due to their ability to better protect patients from postoperative complications, as is demonstrated by lower readmission rates among high performing centers [16] . Given our results, it is clear that efforts need to be undertaken to reduce 1-month surgical mortality after cancer surgery and interventions should start by identifying underperforming hospitals which may be lowvolume, low-complexity centers with limited resources. As has been previously postulated, increasing resources and expanding systems capabilities at low-volume centers could lead to improved surgical outcomes.\nOur study also uniquely emphasizes the significant impact that sociodemographic determinants may have on surgical mortality outcomes among patients with the most common or deadly malignancies. The reasons for the observed sociodemographic disparities in 1-month mortality are likely layered and multifactorial. The results of this study may reflect differences in access to high-quality and high-volume centers, biology/genetics, social support, and differential treatment in hospitals [5, 17] . Furthermore, some authors have suggested that sociodemographic characteristics alone account for differences in surgical outcomes [18] , while others have suggested that differences in hospital quality and systems-level factors contribute to disparities in outcomes [17, 19, 20] . Although there is little consensus as to why disparities in surgical outcomes exist, most of the existing literature is congruent with respect to one particularly alarming finding: minority, low SES, uninsured, disadvantaged patients disproportionately receive care at lower volume/lower quality, underperforming centers [17, 18] . We hypothesize that disproportionate access to quality health care is the major driver of the disparities in 1-month cancer-directed surgical mortality observed in this study.\nThe findings that unmarried, uninsured, non-white, male, older, less educated, and poorer patients were all at a significantly higher risk for death within 1 month of cancer-directed surgery raise the possibility that poor outcomes after surgery may be a contributor to the poorer cancer-specific and overall mortality observed among these disadvantaged groups [1] . Although these results are congruent with other studies that have evaluated the associations between sociodemographics and surgical outcomes after cardiovascular and oncologic operations among Medicare patients [18, 21] , our study is unique in that it also included a large number of patients (N = 659 473; 59.4% of the study cohort) younger than 65 who are not yet Medicare eligible and demonstrates that these disparities are still highly prevalent among younger populations. Future interventions aimed at reducing surgical mortality and improving surgical outcomes among cancer patients should target these particularly vulnerable groups and the drivers of these disparities. Our results must be viewed within the limitations of the study. First, given the SEER coding methods, we were not able to precisely define 1-month surgical mortality and so our method of considering patients who died within the same month as diagnosis or in the subsequent month to have died within 1 month of surgery in our primary analyses may have included some patients that died up to 2 months after surgery. However, this extreme case scenario would require a patient to be diagnosed and treated on the first day of 1 month and die on the last day of the next month; statistically, most cases would be diagnosed around the middle of the month with some delay to surgery [8] . Nevertheless, after restricting analyses to death within the same month of diagnosis and surgery, the rate of 1-month mortality only decreased from 4.8% to 3.3%, and all associations remained nearly identical except for the protective association between the top 50th percentile of educational status and 1-month mortality after cancer surgery (Table 2) . Second, SEER does not provide information on comorbidity status or perioperative risk and so some the difference in 1-month mortality after cancer-directed surgery might have been due to differences in comorbidity or perioperative risk. However, we were able to control for age which is a significant predictor of surgical mortality and treatment selection should have taken comorbidity into account thereby reducing the likelihood that patients with adverse comorbidities were included in this cohort [22] . Third, there may have been delays between diagnosis and receipt of surgery among some patients (especially among those who received neoadjuvant therapies) preventing us from capturing all mortalities occurring within 1 month of surgery, since SEER only provides time from diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Yet, the 1-month mortality rates which we detected were near or above (and on the same order of ) those reported from top academic centers. Lastly, SEER does not provide site of care information, and we were therefore unable to analyze the data by volume or quality of center. Of note, linkage of SEER to Medicare may be able to address some of the limitations above; however, the results would have limited generalizability since SEER-Medicare studies only include patients who are eligible for Medicare. Despite these potential limitations, our study indicates that cancer patients from disadvantaged groups, namely unmarried, uninsured, non-white, male, older, less educated, and poorer patients, were all at a significantly higher risk for death within 1 month of cancer-directed surgery. Policy makers and health care providers should be aware of the poorer outcomes after cancer-directed surgery experienced among these disadvantaged groups and future interventions should target improving access to high-quality/-volume care. Efforts to reduce 1-month surgical mortality and eliminate sociodemographic disparities in this adverse outcome have the potential to significantly improve survival among patients with cancer."}, {"section_title": "acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful to Dr. Ashish Jha (Harvard School of Public Health) for his comments on this manuscript."}, {"section_title": "funding", "text": "This work was supported by David and Cynthia Chapin, the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Fitz's Cancer Warriors, Hugh Simons in honor of Frank and Anne Simons, and a grant from an anonymous family foundation.
