[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "During the last decades, the North Atlantic has been warming more rapidly than any other ocean. This relatively small part of the world ocean would be responsible for one third of the global heat content increase from 1955 to 1998 (Levitus et al., 2005). This anomalous heating corresponds to a temperature increase by 0.27\u00b0C over the upper 700 m, from 1955 to 2003. The continuous trend is difficult to analyse, because it is superimposed on multiyear oscillations. At regional scales, in situ data are often too sparse to get reliable estimates of longterm changes. Nonetheless, in the Bay of Biscay, many observations sources show strong temperature variations, both in terms of yearto year oscillations and decadelong trends (Koutsikopoulos et al., 1998;GarciaSoto et al., 2002, Goikoetxea et al., this issue). However, this interannual variability is not well quantified, its geographic distribution is still largely uncertain and its causes have yet to be identified. The Bay of Biscay is affected by various physical processes, which act on a wide range of space scales. The Iberian Poleward Current (IPC), flowing from the Spanish northwestern corner along the Cantabrian coast, brings warm water during winter, especially during Navidad years (GarciaSoto et al., 2002). Slope water eddies (\" swoddies\") are generated above various topographic (1\u00b0) is already available (World Ocean Database, hereafter \" WOD\", Levitus et al., 2005). In the present paper, we describe the variability of temperature in the Bay of Biscay, based on both the global model and the global data analysis. Our results provide a basis for future regional analysis and modelling at higher resolution. After introducing the observational and modelled datasets (section 2), we describe the observed temperature variability and assess the simulation reliability (section 3). The in situ and simulated temperatures are compared with satellite sea surface temperature over the last 20 years. The interannual variability is analysed using empirical orthogonal functions and related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (section 3.4). The in situ analysis and the simulation are used to describe the three dimensional structure of heat content anomalies and their propagation (section 3.5). Then, we compute a complete heat budget from the simulation, in order to estimate how advective processes, surface heat fluxes and turbulent mixing contribute to the heat content variability (section 4)."}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2.1.Global in situ analysis", "text": "As a reference, we use the global temperature analysis by Levitus et al. (2005), which was designed to estimate the World Ocean heat content and its decadal evolution. This dataset is based on in situ data of the World Ocean Database 2001, made available by the National Oceanographic Data Center. Approximately 7 millions temperature profiles are included in the WOD01 database and more than 300,000 profiles were added by Levitus et al. Over the global ocean, these measurements were mostly acquired by expandable bathythermographs (XBTs), mechanical bathythermographs (MBTs) and ocean stations (OSD). The remaining data was obtained from moored buoys (MRBs), conductivitytemperaturedepth sensors (CTDs), profiling floats (PFLs), bottle samples, etc. The horizontal resolution of the gridded dataset is 1\u00b0 and its time period ranges from 1955 to 2003. A pentadal analysis (5year sampling) is available down to 1500m, but we use the interannual analysis (1year sampling) which extends only down to 700 m. Thus, this study is focused on the upper and intermediate layers, from the nearsurface (5 m) to the permanent thermocline depth (700 m). Over this depth range, the 3D temperature fields contain 16 levels, with a thickness increasing from 10 meters near the surface to 100 meters below 300 m.

November 2008"}, {"section_title": "2.2.Global simulation", "text": "The simulation was designed within the DRAKKAR project (Drakkar group, 2007) and is based on the OPA/NEMO ocean model (Madec, 2008), using a Z vertical coordinate with partial steps and a linearised free surface (Barnier et al., 2006). We use the ORCA025 configuration (hereafter \"ORCA\"), covering the whole global ocean at a 1/4\u00b0 resolution. The horizontal grid is tripolar, with 3 pole singularities located over continents, and curvilinear. However, in the Bay of Biscay, the grid lines deviates from latitude and longitude lines by only a few degrees. Thus, the grid spacing is nearly constant, ranging from 16 to 22 km in both directions. The vertical grid is made of 46 vertical levels and contains 22 levels in the upper 700 meters, which are separated by 6 to 107 m. Constructing surface forcings for multidecadal simulations of the ocean is a challenge. Atmospheric reanalyses, such as ERA40 from the European Centre for Mediumrange Weather Forecast (ECMWF), are burdened by wellknown weaknesses regarding radiation and precipitations (Brodeau et al., 2008). We use a strategy proposed by Large and Yeager (2004), implemented in global model intercomparisons by Griffies et al. (2008) and adapted to ERA40 by Brodeau et al. (2008). Radiation is obtained from satellite data, precipitation from a composite product built from in situ and satellite data, and turbulent fluxes are computed using the bulk formulae of Large and Yeager (2004) combined with meteorological variables from ECMWF (air temperature at 2 m, air humidity at 2 m and wind speed at 10 m). One aim of improving atmospheric forcing is to minimize unrealistic relaxation of sea surface salinity towards climatology in models (Griffies et al., 2008); however in ORCA it has been found necessary to keep a relaxation to climatological salinity, with a timescale of 36 days in the top model layer (6 m), to avoid unrealistic drift in polar regions. River runoffs are provided by a monthly climatology, including 99 major rivers as well as coastal runoff (Dai and Trenberth, 2002). Note that over the Bay of Biscay area, only the Gironde and Loire rivers are explicitly represented in the runoff forcing. The simulation covers the full duration of the ERA40 reanalysis, from 1958 to July 2002, plus 2.5 additional years using the ECMWF analysis until the end of year 2004. The model outputs are averaged and saved every 5 days. The simulation is initialized in 1958 with the climatology of Levitus (1998) and undergoes substantial adjustment during the first years. For this reason, only the period after 1965 is considered in this paper. Although the simulation is not fully equilibrated (reaching equilibrium on the global scale requires centuries), the model drift in the upper layers of our region of interest seems moderate enough (at least, it does not override interannual variability). Temperature variability in the Bay of Biscay 4/43 21. November 2008 The model resolution does not allow a realistic representation of the Mediterranean water outflow at Gibraltar. Therefore, a relaxation to climatology has been added in the Gulf of Cadiz, in order to prevent temperature and salinity drifts in the Mediterranean water layer (8001200 m). This simulation has been designed to study basinscale variability and global changes, thus it does not resolve all the processes occurring over the continental shelf and slope. For instance, tides are not included in the model physics, so tidal currents, internal tides and associated mixing are not represented. Moreover, the model resolution does not allow to simulate properly coastal currents and crossslope transfers. In particular, the effects of mesoscale circulation and eddies are parameterised to a large extent by biharmonic viscosity and isopycnal Laplacian diffusion. Recently, Friocourt et al. (2007) have studied the seasonal cycle of circulation in the Bay of Biscay, from a numerical simulation based on the OPA model, with a finer horizontal resolution (~1/15\u00b0). Their regional simulation was forced with temperature, salinity and velocities from a NorthAtlantic model (Smith et al., 2000). We have verified that the ORCA global simulation represents water mass properties better than this regional simulation, by calculating profiles of temperature and salinity similarly to Friocourt et al., (2007) (their Fig. 2). The bias in deep temperature present in these authors' simulation is absent in ORCA and the properties at the Mediterranean Water level are much more realistic (not shown). The model circulation is compared with Friocourt et al. (2007) in section 4."}, {"section_title": "2.3.Global satellite SST analysis", "text": "A satellite data analysis is used to investigate the Sea Surface Temperature variability at high spatial resolution. The PathFinder version 5.0 analysis is based on AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) measurements from the NOAA series satellites, providing global fields at a 4 km resolution, for each day from year 1985 to 2006. These SST fields are altered by the vicinity of land, cloud cover and other atmospheric perturbations, what is indicated by a quality flag ranging from 0 (masked) to 7 (good). For our climatic, largescale analysis, selecting only the best quality data is preferable (K. Caisey, personal communication). Thus, we use the socalled \" cloud screened\" version, where only data with a quality flag of 7 are included. Also we use the monthly fields, obtained by averaging all available data within a given month at each grid pixel. Then these monthly fields were averaged for each year, in order to get yearly fields that are truly representative of the annual mean SST. This method is more reliable than using directly the yearly fields from the PathFinder analysis, for which the weight of each month depends on the amount of good quality Temperature variability in the Bay of Biscay 5/43 21.

For instance, in the Bay of Biscay where cloudy conditions prevail during winter months, the PathFinder yearly fields exhibit spurious warm anomalies for particular years."}, {"section_title": "Temperature variability", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "3.1.Interannual variations", "text": "We analyse the temperature evolution from the observations of the World Ocean Database (1\u00b0 resolution) and from the ORCA global simulation (1/4\u00b0 resolution). Annual mean values of temperature have been averaged over a rectangular domain, extending from 43\u00b0N to 50\u00b0N in latitude and from 15\u00b0W to the eastern coastal boundary or 1\u00b0W, thus including part of the English Channel ( Fig .1). Thus, this domain includes the whole Bay of Biscay and the near Atlantic area to the West. The bathymetry depth ranges from about 200 m over the continental shelf to more than 5000 m over the oceanic plain. This choice aims at investigating local processes in the Bay of Biscay, as well as remote processes occurring in the connected part of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Note that we implicitly separate the decadal and interannual timesscales, by presenting successively the trends (obtained by linear regression) and the annual residuals (obtained by removing the trend from the total anomalies). Both datasets exhibit a temperature decrease during the first part of the period, followed by a strong warming starting in the mid 1970' s ( Fig. 2). These two phases are clearly seen from the surface down to the maximum depth of the interannual WOD analysis (700 m). Over the whole 19652003 period, the warming trend dominates down to ~500 m in the observations and down t\u00f5 300 m in the simulation (Fig. 3a). In all layers, the warming appears weaker in the simulation than in observations. This warming is highest at 50 m, where the observed trend reaches 0.23\u00b0C/decade, equivalent to 0.90\u00b0C in 40 years, and the simulated trend reaches 0.10\u00b0C/decade, equivalent to 0.42\u00b0C in 40 years ( Table 1). The observed warming is slightly lower at the surface than at 50 m, suggesting that airsea heat fluxes attenuate the longterm trend in the surface layer (the uppermost 50 m or so). The simulated warming is roughly constant in the 050 m layer, thus the model partially reproduces this attenuation. The nearsurface temperature from WOD and ORCA is also consistent with the SST from the PathFinder satellite analysis (Table 2). Over the 19852003 period, the PathFinder satellite analysis leads to a SST trend of 0.37\u00b0C/decade, close to the value from the WOD in situ analysis over the same period (0.30\u00b0C/decade) and consistently higher than in the ORCA simulation (0.22\u00b0C/decade) (  (Mackenzie and Schiedek, 2007a,b). Both the initial cooling and the following warming are related to basinscale trends of ocean temperature. The subarctic gyre experienced a general cooling centred at 60\u00b0N, estimated to 0.13\u00b0C at 125 m depth during 194885 (0.04\u00b0C/decade) (Levitus et al., 1994). This was caused by a cooling and freshening of Labrador Sea deep waters since the early 1970' s, resulting in a deep water cooling over the entire subarctic gyre (Levitus and Antonov, 1995). However, the cooling could also originate from the subtropical gyre, as a SST decrease was observed over the Gulf Stream area, during the 1950' s and 1960' s (Rayner et al., 2003. After a few years, these cold anomalies would have entered the Bay of Biscay, producing the temperature decrease which culminates around 1975(Fontan et al., 2007. The subsequent warming trend would be related to an increase in air temperature over the whole North Atlantic intergyre area (Perez et al., 2000). In a wider geographic context, the mean temperature increase in the 0300 m layer of whole North Atlantic is estimated to 0.07\u00b0C/decade form 1955 to 2003 (Levitus et al., 2004). The warming is significantly intensified in the Bay of Biscay, where it ranges from 0.09 to 0.23\u00b0C/decade in the 0300 m layer (Fig. 3a). Strong oscillations are superimposed on the slow trends, with an apparent period of 6 to 10 years ( Fig. 2). Such quasidecadal oscillations were also documented by Levitus et al. (1994) in the North Atlantic Ocean and by Goikoetxea et al. (this issue) in the southeastern Bay of Biscay. Both the observations and the simulation indicate that the oscillations amplitude decreases rapidly with depth, from the surface down to about 400 m (Fig. 3b). The magnitude of the fluctuations is quantified by the standard deviation of annual residuals. At the surface, this RMS residual amounts to 0.33\u00b0C in the observations and 0.26\u00b0C in the simulation (Table 1). The fluctuation amplitude is divided by a factor two from the surface to the 200m depth and reaches a minimum at 400 m (0.10\u00b0C in WOD and 0.07\u00b0C in ORCA). Below the 400m depth, interannual fluctuations tend to increase significantly in intensity. Thus, these fluctuations are not only forced at the surface, but also generated internally in the intermediate ocean layers. In contrast, the decadal trend decreases quasi linearly from 50 m down to 600 m in the observations, and even deeper in the simulation (Fig. 3a). This suggests the warming tendency is generated in the mixed layer and counteracts a cooling tendency in intermediate waters."}, {"section_title": "3.2.Comparison between observations and simulation", "text": "The previous section has shown the observed trends and fluctuations are in good agreement Temperature variability in the Bay of Biscay 7/43 21. November 2008 with the simulation. To further confront the simulation with the in situ analysis, we compare statistically the two datasets (Table 3). The interannual mean bias (simulation -observations difference) is very low at the surface (lower than 0.02\u00b0C). This is expected, since the air temperature used to force the model is itself constrained by the observed SST. The bias is positive in the ENACW, down to ~500 m, and culminates to +0.28\u00b0C at 400 m ( Fig. 3c). At 600 m, the bias has a similar magnitude but an opposite sign (0.27\u00b0C). This is difficult to interpret, as the bias changes sign again in the Mediterranean Water, around 1000 m (not shown). Thus, the strong cooling obtained at 600 m in the simulation, until the end of the 1970' s ( Fig. 2d), may be due to a slow adjustment of water masses, rather than a climatic signal. The bias between satellite and in situ observations is acceptable: the PathFinder SST, available from year 1985, is cooler by 0.23\u00b0C than the WOD nearsurface temperature, while the simulation temperature is only cooler by 0.1\u00b0C over the same period (Table 2). The RMS difference ranges from 0.20\u00b0C in the mixed layer (0 to 100 m) to 0.13\u00b0C in the intermediate layers (around 400 m) (Table 3). Thus, as expected, errors are higher in the layers experiencing a stronger variability, but the agreement remains reasonable at all depths. When removing the linear trend, the RMS error on residuals remains around 0.15\u00b0C between 100 m and 600 m. Thus, a significant part of the misfit is due to underestimating the warming trend in the simulation. To put these results into perspective, we compare the PathFinder SST to the WOD analysis, during years 1985 to 2003 (Table 2): in this case, the RMS error amounts to 0.12\u00b0C, close to the ORCA simulation which leads to an RMS error of 0.13\u00b0C. Interannual variations are well inphase in the two datasets, as appears from the time series and the correlations (Figs. 2 and 3d, respectively). The time correlation of interannual anomalies ranges from 92% at the surface to 59% in intermediate layers (600 m), except around the 300m depth, where it falls to less than 50%. Between 400 and 500 m, the correlation is not significant (significativity lower than 95%). As noticed earlier, the simulated temperature at this depth differs considerably from the observations. When comparing the nonlinear part of the signals (residuals), the time correlation is slightly lower, ranging from 91% at the surface to 52% at 600 m, except between 300 and 500 m, where it drops to less than 50%. Over the period 19852003, the residuals from the PathFinder SST and from the ORCA simulation are correlated at 96% with the WOD near surface temperature, what proves the robustness of the SST interannual variations (Table 2) proportion of the interannual variability at the surface. In summary, the timeseries of observed and simulated temperatures averaged over the domain are fairly consistent at all depths, from the surface down to 700 m (Fig. 2). The biases between the ORCA simulation and the WOD analysis are lower than \u00b10.3\u00b0C ( Fig. 3c) and the RMS differences do not exceed 0.2\u00b0C. Interannual variability is well reproduced by the model: the maximum RMS residual reaches 0.26\u00b0C near the surface, versus 0.33\u00b0C in the observations (Fig.   3b). However, the decadal trends are underestimated by about 50%: the maximum value amounts to +0.10 \u00b0C/decade at 50 m, instead of +0.23\u00b0C/decade ( Fig. 3a). When considering SST, the overall agreement with the in situ data (in terms of bias, error and correlation) is satisfying for both the simulation and the satellite observations (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "3.3.Horizontal distribution of interannual variability", "text": "In the following analysis, we consider separately the horizontal distribution of interannual fluctuations (exhibiting a ~6year period) and longterm tendency (lasting over several decades). We focus on the 100m depth, which is characteristic of the most variable layer (0200 m), as shown above. The trend at 100 m (Figs. 4a and 4c) is positive over the whole domain and decreases in the southwestern part. In the WOD observations, the trend and standard deviation are largest in the English Channel, but the resolution is not adequate to study this region in details. Another maximum in the trend is found in the southeastern corner for WOD, while in the ORCA simulation, the maximum is located over the northern part of oceanic plain. The cooling in the southern part explains why the general warming is underestimated by about 50% in the ORCA simulation ( Table 1). The warming trend in WOD along the Cantabrian slope is consistent with an increasing trend in SST, demonstrated by several studies. Fontan et al. 2007 The nonlinear anomalies (Figs. 4b and 4d) exhibit a comparable distribution in WOD and ORCA, with a general increase from the deep plain toward shallower areas. In the WOD analysis, a clear maximum appears in the southeastern corner, similarly to the linear trend ( Fig. 4a). In contrast, in ORCA the maximum variability is located over the Celtic and Armorican shelves. A secondary maximum extends along the continental slope in the Navidad region in the simulation, but is not found in the observations. On the contrary, the minimum location roughly coincides in the observations and in the simulation, i.e. in the middle of the oceanic plain. The lack of a variability maximum offshore of northern Spain in WOD can be explained by the low resolution of the analysis: the narrow Cantabrian shelf is masked on the 1\u00b0 grid. On the other hand, we think that the absence of the main maximum over the Armorican shelf arises from an insufficient sampling of this shallow area in the database. Indeed, we compared the WOD analysis to a regional analysis with a higher resolution (0.1\u00b0) and including 50% of additional data, recently declassified by the French Navy (F. Vandermeirsch, personal communication). In this regional analysis, the temperature variability at 100 m clearly exhibits both a principal and a secondary maxima similar to ORCA. The existence and locations of these two maxima is consistent with GarciaSoto et al. 2002, who concluded that interannual variations of SST in the Navidad region is highly correlated with the Celtic Sea."}, {"section_title": "3.4.Modes of interannual variability and correlation with NAO", "text": "The previous section has demonstrated that interannual fluctuations are well represented in the simulation, whereas decadal trend is less reliable in terms of horizontal distribution and magnitude. Therefore, we now focus on variability at periods of one year to a decade, by removing the linear trend from the timeseries. The detrended temperature fields are then decomposed into their main patterns of variability, through an analysis of Empirical Orthogonal Functions. To compare the WOD observations and the ORCA simulation with an independent dataset, we perform the same analysis on the PathFinder satellite SST. "}, {"section_title": "3.5.Propagation of temperature anomalies", "text": "We now focus on how temperature anomalies, which can be linked to the variability modes described above, penetrate vertically and propagate horizontally. Most nonlinear anomalies are concentrated between the surface and the 100meter depth ( Fig. 7) and many are intensified at the surface, suggesting they may be generated by airsea heat fluxes. Although simulated surface anomalies are somewhat weaker than in observations, their timing and penetration depth are similar (Fig. 7b). The profiles of The origins of temperature anomalies can also be investigated by describing their zonal and meridional evolution. No clear meridional structure is found in the WOD analysis (not shown), probably due to its low resolution, thus we only show the zonal structures. We focus on the temperature averaged in the 0200 m layer, where the most intense anomalies occur (Fig. 8). Over this depth range, the warmest anomalies occur in 196667, 198990 and 1997, while the coolest anomalies occur in 197677, 1986 and 1994. These anomalies can be sorted in two types: 1 are warm or cool, occur in the eastern part, above or close to the shelf (Fig. 8a)."}, {"section_title": "Heat balance", "text": "As the ORCA simulation leads to a good agreement with in situ observations, in terms of annual anomalies of temperature change, we use it to compute the associated heat budget.

(2005) have estimated that 91% of the heat increase in the North Atlantic occurred in the 01000 m layer during the past 50 years."}, {"section_title": "4.1.Atmospheric heat fluxes", "text": "The Bay of Biscay is a region of weak net heat flux, with its zero isoline usually lying around 45\u00b0N in the Eastern Atlantic, depending on the flux dataset (Marshall et al., 1993;Large and Yeager, 2004). The surface heat flux distribution calculated in the ORCA simulation in the Bay of Biscay, includes both positive and negative annual mean values (Fig. 9a). The flux is positive (heat gain to the ocean) in the southwestern part, particularly along the western Iberian coast (up to 40 W/m\u00b2), where cold upwelled water is warmed at the surface. Positive values are also found in the Celtic Sea, with a much weaker intensity (10 W/m\u00b2). The flux is negative (heat loss for the ocean) in the northwestern corner (down to 30 W/m\u00b2 at 50\u00b0N/15\u00b0W), where surface water is cooled by air from subpolar regions. Weaker negative values (10 W/m\u00b2) are found over the Armorican shelf and offshore the Aquitaine and Cantabrian slopes. The interannual variability of the surface flux (Fig. 9b) is highest near the northwestern corner (up to 12 W/m\u00b2), above the North Atlantic Drift. The flux variability is also high over the Armorican Shelf and also along the Cantabrian coast, where SST is essentially controlled by upwelling conditions. In contrast, the surface flux is particularly stable in the southeastern corner. Over the whole 19652004 period (Fig. 10a), the domainaveraged net heat flux is almost neutral (0.1 W/m\u00b2). This mean value essentially results from a high solar radiation (134 W/m\u00b2) and strong heat losses through latent flux (66 W/m\u00b2) and thermal radiation (56 W/m\u00b2). The contribution of sensible flux (12 W/m\u00b2) is secondary, although not negligible. The interannual variability of the net heat flux (5.6 W/m\u00b2) is produced by a complex combination of all four components, as they all exhibit comparable fluctuations (Figs. 10b,c,d,e). However, the latent heat flux variability is about twice as large the other components. The net heat flux tends to increase during the whole simulation, with a rate of 0.14 W/m\u00b2/year, equivalent to +5.6 W/m\u00b2 from 1965 to 2004. Quasidecadal fluctuations result in two cooling periods, until 1975 and during the 1980' s, and two heating periods, first from 1975 to 1980, then from 1990 till the simulation end, with a magnitude about 4 W/m\u00b2 (Fig. 10a).

The lowest net heat flux occurs in 1986 (14 W/m\u00b2) and is caused by simultaneous weak solar radiation and strong latent heat loss. Conversely, the highest net flux occurs in 1997 (+12 W/m\u00b2), due to a maximum solar radiation and a low latent heat loss. Year 1986 also corresponds to the coolest temperature anomaly in the 0200 m layer (Figs. 2, 8 "}, {"section_title": "4.2.Simulated circulation in the upper layers", "text": "Before describing the heat transport, the modelled circulation needs to be validated. The Bay of Biscay circulation over the shelf and the upper slope is relatively wellknown (e.g. GarciaSoto, 2002), but in deeper layers and further offshore, currents are still poorly sampled. Thus, the ORCA circulation is verified against a regional simulation, performed by Friocourt et al. (2007), hereafter F07. We focus on the seasonal cycle of the simulated circulation, as its seasonal variability is much stronger than its interannual variability, especially over the slopes. Most features of the seasonal circulation obtained in the ORCA simulation are consistent with F07, despite a much lower model resolution. In order to facilitate the comparison between these two simulations, we averaged the current velocities in the same depth range (30160 m) and at the same phases of the seasonal cycle (Fig. 11). However, our climatological cycle was computed from 40 years, instead of 10 years in F07, and we present monthly means rather than daily snapshots, to get more robust pictures of the circulation. In the ORCA simulation, the slope current is directed poleward in winter, from Cape Ortegal to the Armorican slope at about 48\u00b0N. The poleward flow extends over the Aquitaine shelf and continues northward offshore Brittany. In early spring, the slope current starts reversing in the Cantabrian Sea, but it is still clearly directed poleward from the Basque slope to Goban Spur. In summer and autumn, the slope current flows equatorward, with only a small weakening offshore southern Aquitaine (~2\u00b0W Portuguese Current, as evidenced from observations by Martins et al. (2002). Note that part of this westward flow detaches from the shelfbreak and penetrates over the deep plain, then turns southward at about 12\u00b0W. This current detachment is even stronger in fall. The simulated seasonal cycle is in qualitative agreement with F07, although the equatorward flow in summer seems stronger. The ORCA circulation along the slope is also qualitatively consistent with observations discussed by Pingree and Le Cann (1990), Colas (2003) and Serpette et al. (2006). The good quality of the simulated currents along continental boundaries is probably due to the numerical schemes improvements discussed by Barnier et al. (2006). Over the abyssal plain, the monthly mean currents in the upper layer are as strong as along the slopes, but their seasonal variability is much weaker. The main current entering the domain is located between 47\u00b0N and 49\u00b0N (Pingree, 1993;Paillet and Mercier, 1997).

At the southern boundary (43\u00b0N), heat is advected within the slope undercurrent carrying Mediterranean Water in the 5001500 m depth range. This current consists in two veins, as the poleward current is located against the slope during summer and above the western flank of Galicia Bank (1112\u00b0W) during winter. In contrast, the upper slope current in the 0300 depth range transports heat southward in the annual mean (Fig. 12b).  Table 4 for the 19652004 period. In the study domain, the surface freshwater flux (including river runoffs) is small (~0.4x10 3 Sv). This flux is of the same order as the simulated elevation change, which is due to a small imbalance between evaporation and precipitations at the global scale. We have also estimated the input of heat due to the freshwater flux (in the model, the temperature of the precipitations and runoffs is supposed to be equal to the sea surface temperature). Although nonnegligible at the global scale (Griffies et al., 2008), this heat input is very small in our domain. Over the 40year period, the volume input through the western boundary (3 Sv) is balanced by 2 Sv of northward flow, 0.7 Sv of southward flow and 0.1 Sv of downwelling across the 800 m level (Table 4). Regarding the heat budget, the heat transport across the lateral boundaries consists in a strong import from the west (141 TW), which is redistributed through an export to the North (90 TW) and a twice weaker export to the south (45 TW) (see also Fig. 12b). Over the whole domain, the main heat input is provided by oceanic transports (+1.0 TW) and the main heat loss is caused by temperature diffusion (1.2 TW) (Table 4). During this particular period, a much lower loss is due to airsea exchanges (0.1 TW). The resulting heat deficit produces a heat content decrease within the domain (0.2 TW). This heat content change is the difference between the beginning of year 1965 and the end of year 2004. The average evolution of the heat content is better represented by its linear trend over the whole period. According to the heat content trend, the simulation leads to a weak cooling of the 0800 m layer (7x102 TW), due to a negative temperature trend below 300 m (Fig. 3a). This heat content trend corresponds to a domain averaged temperature decrease of 0.01\u00b0C/decade, while observations exhibit a significant increase (+ 0.07\u00b0C/decade). The heat balance is subject to strong modulations at decadal and interannual scales, what is demonstrated in the next section. 4.5.Heat budget variations over 40 years (1965 to 2004) The interannual variability of the heat transport (\" heat RMS\" in Table 4) at the southern boundary is twice lower than at the western and northern boundaries, as shown by the timeseries of Fig. 13a. Despite the low mean value of airsea flux, its interannual variations (3.8 TW) are higher than the total heat transport variations (2.4 TW). Therefore, the heat content interannual variations are primarily due to exchanges with the atmosphere and secondarily to exchanges with the surrounding ocean."}, {"section_title": "Timeseries of transports integrated across each three boundaries and in the 0800 m upper", "text": "Temperature variability in the Bay of Biscay 18/43 21. November 2008 layer are presented (Fig. 13.a). The transports at the western and northern boundaries are rather high during the 1970' s and 1980' s, then decrease during the 1990' s (see also Table 5). This decadal evolution may be associated with a deceleration of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, which feeds the NAD and its eastward extension toward the Bay of Biscay. The transport at the southern boundary only exhibits a significant increase in the late 1970' s and early 1980' s. Generally, both the northern and southern transports are anticorrelated with the western transport (correlations of 89% and 41%, respectively, significant at 99%), because of the horizontal recirculations. While horizontal and vertical heat transports exhibit large interannual variability, the net transport seems to vary on longer time scales (Fig. 13b). The heat balance fluctuates considerably in the course of the 40year long simulation (Fig.   13c). The total heat transport decreases regularly since the end of the 1970' s ( Table 5). The airsea flux increases steadily over the 40 years, becoming positive during the 19952004 decade. This decadal trend is masked by interannual variability in Fig. 13c, but is evidenced by the 5year smoothing in Fig. 10a. As a result, the heat content trend switches from a strongly negative value during the first decade (1.9 TW) to a lower, but significant, positive value during the three following decades (+0.42 TW on average from 1975 to 2004). This is consistent with the domain averaged temperature from in situ observations (Figs. 2, 7). The warming phase is not continuous over the last 30 years: a slight cooling is obtained during the 198594 decade and the warming is twice stronger during the 197584 decade than during the 19952004 decade. In addition to these slow trends, several extreme events are worth notifying. The highest total transport values are found from 1978 to 1990. The transport term becomes negative (heat export) only during a few years, due to either a decrease in the westerly import (in 1993 and 2000) or an increase in the northward export (in 1976 and 2003). The highest values of airsea flux are found during the last decade of the simulation (in 1994, 1997 and 2002), consistently with the increasing trend, and a few weaker positive peaks occur during the previous decades (in 1966, 1977 and 1981). Years 1966Years , 1997Years and 2003 (one year later) correspond to some of the warmest anomalies in the 0200 m layer (Fig. 8), thus likely to be forced by an anomalous heating from the atmosphere. On the other hand, years 1977 and 1994 correspond to marked cool anomalies, so they cannot be generated by the atmospheric flux. The most negative values of airsea flux occur in 1986, 1996 and 1969 (in decreasing order). Thus the 1986 cool anomaly, the lowest of temperature anomaly in the 0800 m layer (Fig. 7), would originate from a strong heat loss to the atmosphere. In 1969, the negative flux anomaly is partly compensated by a positive transport anomaly, so the upper Temperature variability in the Bay of Biscay 19/43 21. November 2008 layer does not cool significantly. In 1996, the heat transport is very weak, thus the heat content change exhibits ones of its lowest anomalies. However, the 0100 m layer warms during this year, probably because of an increased heat transport within the IPC, associated with the marked Navidad event in 1996 (section 4.1). At interannual scale, the lateral transport is anticorrelated to the vertical transport (correlation = 87%, significant at more than 99%), thus most heat anomalies transported across the lateral boundaries are advected to deeper layers. The total transport is partially anticorrelated to the airsea flux (correlation = 34%, significant at 97%), so part of the anomalies advected into the domain by lateral and vertical currents are evacuated at the surface toward the atmosphere (and conversely). However, the total transport is not the main driver of the interannual heat content variations, as both terms are only weakly correlated (correlation = 30%, significant at 94%). The surface flux is more strongly correlated with the heat content variations (correlation = 68%, significant at more than 99%), so interannual temperature fluctuations in the 0800 m layer are essentially controlled by airsea exchanges."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The DRAKKAR model, in its global ORCA configuration with at 1/4\u00b0 resolution, reproduces surprisingly well the interannual to decadal variability of temperature in the Bay of Biscay. At decadal time scales, the Bay of Biscay experienced a cooling phase until the mid1970' s, followed by a continuous warming. The simulation reproduces correctly these two phases, even if the rates of change are underestimated. The simulation interannual variability is well correlated with the WOD observations at the surface. The correlation is still significant and high (> 60%) down to the 200 m depth. This demonstrates that the DRAKKAR global model is suitable to provide boundary conditions for regional models, aimed at studying interannual to decadal variability in areas closer to the coast. The most problematic issue remaining for the Bay of Biscay is probably the representation of the Mediterranean Water. This water mass is better characterised in the ORCA simulation than in the simulations of Smith et al. (2000) and Friocourt et al. (2007). However, this performance has been achieved with an artificial relaxation to a climatology in the Gulf of Cadiz, which makes it difficult to represent the interannual variability of the Mediterranean Water. The WOD global analysis (Levitus et al., 2005) The ORCA simulation has been used to estimate a heat balance for the Bay of Biscay, in the upper 800 m and during the last 40 years. The horizontal heat transport has to be considered jointly with the vertical transport, as lateral convergence is compensated by downwelling. In the simulation, the interannual variability of heat content is mostly driven by the local airsea flux, and to a lower degree by advection. At decadal and longer time scales, the heat balance is more complex: the surface flux may play a damping role at these time scales. We find a large increase in the surface heat flux over the last decade (indeed, the flux produces is a net heating of 1.6 TW during the 19952004 decade, while it produces a cooling of 0.7 TW over the three previous   anomalies with the trend removed), dashed lines: linear trends (significant to more than 95%).

From left to right, the columns correspond to the mean volume budget, the mean heat budget and its RMS variation. Volume components are expressed in milliSverdup (1 mSv = 1000 m 3 .s 1 ) and heat components are expressed in TeraWatts (1 TW = 10 12 W). All quantities are computed as inputs to the oceanic domain. The horizontal transport is the sum of the transports across the three lateral boundaries (south, west and north). The total transport is the sum of horizontal and vertical transports. The diffusion term is obtained as the difference between the content change and the other budget terms. "}]
