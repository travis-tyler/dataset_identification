[{"section_title": "", "text": "This report uses data from the 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94) and the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/94) to examine the postsecondary experiences and outcomes of first-generation students relative to their peers. After an overview of the demographic, aspirational, and enrollment characteristics of firstgeneration and non-first-generation students, the report compares the persistence and attainment rates of each of these two groups. It then examines the labor market and further postsecondary outcomes of these students. The major findings are:1 First-generation students were more likely to be older, have lower incomes, be married, and have dependents than their non-first-generation peers (figure 2). First-generation students were more likely to enroll in postsecondary education parttime, and to attend public 2-year institutions; private, for-profit institutions; and other less-than-4-year institutions than their non-first-generation counterparts (table 4, table  3, figure 3). First-generation students were equally as likely to be taking remedial classes as nonfirst-generation students when they began their postsecondary education. However, there were differences by sector on this measure. At private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, first-generation students were more likely to be taking remedial courses than their counterparts whose parents had more than a high school education. At the same time, the proportions of first-generation and non-first-generation students at public 4year and public 2-year institutions taking remedial coursework did not differ significantly (table 9). First-generation students were more likely than non-first-generation students to say that being very well off financially and providing their children with better opportunities than they had were very important to them personally (table 11). First-generation students were also more likely to say that obtaining the amount of financial aid they needed, being able to complete coursework more quickly, being able to live at home, and being able to work while attending the school were very important influences in their decision to attend their particular postsecondary institution (table   11). 1All findings reported in highlights were taken directly from the report, where all comparisons are tested for significance. The report relies on data from the 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94), the longitudinal component of the NPSAS:90 survey, a nationally representative sample that includes students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from 4-year colleges and universities to less-than-2-year vocational institutions. The BPS:90/94 sample was limited to students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time during the 1989-90 academic year. The BPS cohort was subsequently followed up in 1992 and 1994, with the latter follow-up offering a wide range of information regarding student persistence and degree attainment 5 years after the beginning students initially enrolled in postsecondary education. For a more complete analysis of labor market and further educational outcomes among bachelor's degree recipients, the analysis of the BPS:90/94 data was supplemented by using data from the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/94). B&B:93/94 is a nationally representative sample of students who completed their bachelor's degrees in the 1992-93 academic year. The first follow-up survey was conducted in 1994, one year after graduation. The estimates (mostly percentages) presented in the report were produced using the BPS:90/94 and B&B:93/94 Data Analysis Systems (DAS). The DAS is a --iicrocomputer application that allows users to specify and generate their own tables. The DAS produces designadjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences shown in the tables. For more information regarding the DAS, readers should consult appendix B of this report.

For instance, in 1972, males aged 25 to 34:with a bachelor's or higher degree earned 19 percent more than their counterparts with only a high school diploma. By 1995, this figure had climbed to 52 percent.2 As the earnings gap between those who hold a bachelor's degree and those who do not has widened, the number of students enrolling in postsecondary education has grown. Between 1972 and 1995, the percentage of 16-to-24-year-old high school graduates immediately entering college increased from 49 to 62 percent.3 Individuals enroll in postsecondary education for many reasons, including intellectual, economic, and social considerations; however, the degree to which these reasons affect the decision to enroll varies among students. For many individuals, there is no question about their enrollment; such students typically have parents who are college educated and who view postsecondary education simply as \"the next logical, expected, and desired stage in the passage toward personal and occupational achievement.\"4 For others, enrollment represents a deliberate attempt to improve their social, economic, and occupational standing. Many of these students are the first members of their families to enroll in any education beyond high school. For these \"firstgeneration students,\" postsecondary education offers both opportunity and risk, since it represents a departure from family traditions.5 First-generation students often have family and background characteristics that are associated with risk for attrition. For example, they are more likely than their peers to be from lowincome families, have lower achievement (as measured by the Collegiate Assessment of Introduction Academic Proficiency), and have lower overall degree aspirations. They are also more likely to be older and to have dependent children than their non-first-generation counterparts.6 First-generation students also enroll predominantly in the 2-year sector.? While enrollment in this sector may be less expensive, some community colleges may lack the resources necessary to provide the special support services that first-generation students might need. Once enrolled in postsecondary education, first-generation students tend to work more hours off campus than their non-first-generation counterparts, complete fewer total course hours during their first year, and receive less support from family and friends for their enrollment.8 Finally, first-generation students are less likely to attain a postsecondary credential than their counterparts. Some research has used the concept of \"integration and cultural transformation\" to help explain the difficulties first-generation students face.9 Regardless of generational status, initial enrollment in postsecondary education is a time of great upheaval. Students must adapt academically and socially to their new institutional surroundings, and the extent to which they adapt can play a role in their postsecondary outcomes. Poor academic preparation, family responsibilities, and full-time work, for instance, can pose severe challenges to a student's ability to integrate into postsecondary institutional life. In addition to these social and academic adaptations, firstgeneration students face the additional task of cultural adaptation.w Specifically, there is a distinct element of \"cultural mobility\" associated with postsecondary enrollment, particularly if no other family member has had any postsecondary education.\" While many students have no trouble making this transition, others may encounter conflict between the cultures of their families/friends and their new college culture. How first-generation students negotiate these conflicts may influence their ultimate success. 6P.T. Terenzini, et al., \"First-Generation College Students: Characteristics, Experiences, and Cognitive Development,\" Research in Higher Education 37 (1) (1996): 1-22. 7In a study of community college students, Willett found that 80 percent of sampled 2-year college students came from backgrounds where no family members had earned a college credential. See L.H. Willett, \"Are Community College Students First-Generation College Students?\" Community College Review 17 (2) (Fall 1989): 48-52. In an analysis of the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94), it was found that 55 percent of first-generation students attended public 2-year institutions in 1994. See The Institute for Higher Education Policy, Policy Steps 4 (1) (Spring 1997): 1-10. 8P. T. Terenzini, et al., \"First-Generation College Students,\" 1996. \nIn order for postsecondary institutions to better understand the unique needs of firstgeneration students, more must be known about who they are and their particular enrollment experiences. The purpose of this report is to provide such information. The report begins by describing the background characteristics of first-generation students. Next, it looks at where firstgeneration students enroll and why they have chosen their particular institution, followed by an analysis of measures of academic and social integration within the institution. The third section of the report examines the postsecondary persistence and attainment outcomes of first-generation students relative to their peers, and the report concludes by describing their labor market outcomes. Finally, to measure the independent effect of first-generation status on persistence and attainment, a multivariate analysis was conducted to control for covariation."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data from the 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94) were used to examine the participation of first-generation students in postsecondary education. BPS:90/94 is the longitudinal component of the NPSAS:90 survey, a nationally representative sample that includes students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from 4year colleges and universities to 2-year and less-than-2-year vocational institutions. The BPS:90/94 sample is composed of students who enrolled for the first time in postsecondary education during the 1989-90 academic year; the cohort was subsequently followed up in 1992 and 1994. BPS:90/94 offers a wide range of information regarding students' academic and social experiences while enrolled, as well as their persistence and degree attainment 5 years after their initial enrollment in postsecondary education. BPS:90/94 was also used to examine the labor market experiences of first-generation students relative to those of their peers who obtained less than baccalaureate degrees (associate's degrees and vocational certificates). BPS:90/94 spans 5 years, which is too little time for an analysis of labor market outcomes among bachelor's degree recipients, given that a majority of them may have minimal post-degree labor market experience.12 Therefore, this analysis was supplemented with data from the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/94), a nationally representative sample of students who completed their bachelor's degrees in the 1992-93 academic year. The first follow-up survey was conducted in 1994, one year after graduation. B&B:93/94 provides information regarding students' immediate entry into the labor market, graduate education, or both (i.e., within 1 year after bachelor's degree attainment). 12An analysis of data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/94) revealed that only 36 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had completed their degree within 4 years of beginning postsecondary education.

Who Are First-Generation Students? First-generation students are defined as those whose parents' highest level of education is a high school diploma or less. In cases where parents have different levels of education, the maximum education level of either parent determines how the student is categorized. In this analysis, these students are compared with two other groups: those whose parent(s) have attended some college, but have attained less than a bachelor's degree; and those whose parent(s) have attained a bachelor's or an advanced degree. Almost half (about 43 percent) of first-time beginning students in 1989-90 were identified as first-generation (figure 1). For students not classified as firstgeneration, 23 percent had parents with some college experience, and 34 percent had parents who had attained a bachelor's or higher degree (table 1). First-generation students were less likely to be white, non-Hispanic, than their non-firstgeneration counterparts and more likely to be Hispanic (11 percent versus 5 percent) (figure 2). Compared with their counterparts, first-generation students were also more likely to be female (57 percent versus 51 percent) (table 2). *Students in other less-than-4-year institutions (private, not-for-profit; public, less-than-2-year; and private, not-for-profit less-than-2-year) are included in the total, but not in the detail because the sample sizes were too small. In addition, according to 1989-90 data, the families of first-generation students had lower family incomes than those of non-first-generation students. As an example, nearly one-quarter (23 percent) of first-generation students had family incomes in the lowest quartile, compared with 5 percent of students whose parents had attained higher educational levels.13 Meanwhile, 59 percent of non-first-generation students had family incomes in the highest quartile, compared with 18 percent of their counterparts (table 2). 13These income quartiles were based on quartiles defined in the NPSAS:90 data, which included not only beginning postsecondary students, but all first-year students. Since students in the BPS: 89/90 sample were more likely to be traditional, dependent, and have higher incomes than other first-year students, they were more likely to have family SES in the highest quartile. Who Are First-Generation Students?  Who Are First-Generation Students?  IThe category \"not married\" includes the following categories: single, never married; living as married, never married; divorced; widowed; and living as married, previously divorced. 2These income quartiles were based on quartiles defined in the NPSAS:90 data, which included not only beginning postsecondary students, but all first-year students. Since students in the BPS:89/90 sample were more likely to be traditional, dependent, and have higher incomes than other first-year students, they were more likely to have family SES in the highest quartile. In general, when surveyed in the 1989-90 school year, first-generation students were more likely to be older, to be married, and to have dependents than students whose parents had attained higher levels of education. For example, first-generation students were more likely to be 30 years or older (13 percent versus 3 percent), and less likely to be 18 and under (49 percent) than nonfirst-generation students (74 percent) (table 2). Consistent with their age differences, firstgeneration students were more likely than non-first-generation students to be financially independent (both with and without dependents), and more likely to be married (table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Characteristics", "text": "The results from this study show that first-generation students were more likely than other students to attend public 2-year institutions (51 percent versus 37 percent); private, for-profit institutions (15 percent versus 6 percent); and other less-than-4-year institutions (5 percent versus 3 percent) (figure 3).\" Students whose parents had any college education, on the other hand, were more likely to attend either public 4-year (36 percent versus 20 percent) or private, not-forprofit 4-year institutions (19 percent versus 8 percent) (table 3). II First-generation student CI Not a first-generation student 140ther less-than-4-year institutions include public less-than-2-year institutions (2 percent); private, not-for-profit less-than 2year institutions (0.3 percent); and private, not-for-profit 2-year institutions (2 percent). Despite the different functions of these institutions, there are too few cases in each specific type of institution for reliable analyses. Among all students whose parents had attended at least some college, there were no differences in the likelihood of attending a public 4-year institution between students whose parents had attended some college but had not completed a degree and those whose parents had earned a bachelor's or an advanced degree (34 percent and 37 percent, respectively). However, students whose parent(s) had attained a bachelor's degree were more likely than those whose parents had only some college to attend a private, not-for-profit 4-year institution (22 percent versus 13 percent) (table 3).\nFirst-generation students composed more of the student body at public 2-year institutions than either public 4-year or private not-for-profit 4-year institutions (51 percent versus 30 percent and 25 percent). Even higher proportions of first-generation students enrolled in private, forprofit institutions than at public 2-year institutions, as well as both kinds of 4-year institutions (figure 4). Consistent with their concentration at public 2-year institutions, first-generation students were much more likely than those whose parents had obtained more education (30 percent versus 13 percent) to attend part time during their first year in postsecondary education. Generally, as the level of parents' education increased, the likelihood of part-time attendance decreased (table   4). An examination of students' living arrangements reveals that first-generation students were less likely to live on campus (16 percent versus 40 percent), and more likely to live off campus First-generation student Not a first-generation student Private, forprofit *Students in other less-than-4-year institutions (private, not-for-profit 2-to 3-year; public, less-than-2-year; and private, not-for-profit less-than-2-year) are not included in the detail, because the sample sizes were too small. (39 percent versus 19 percent), than their counterparts whose parents had more than a high school education. As the level of parental education increased from a high school degree or less (16 percent), to some college (32 percent), to a bachelor's or advanced degree (45 percent), so did the likelihood of living on campus (table 5). Among students whose parents did not have bachelor's degrees, those whose parents had attended some college but had attained less than a bachelor's degree were no more likely than first-generation students to live with their parents (47 percent versus 45 percent, respectively) (table 5).  First-generation students, overall, were enrolled in different types of degree programs than non-first-generation students. Reflecting their greater likelihood of enrolling in less-than-4-year institutions, first-generation students were more likely than other students to be in certificate (22 percent versus 12 percent) or associate's degree programs (39 percent versus 30 percent), and less likely to be in a bachelor's degree program (23 percent versus 43 percent) (table 6). The likelihood of being in a certificate program declined as parental education levels increased from high school degree or less (22 percent), to some college (15 percent), to a bachelor's or advanced degree (10 percent). At the same time, the likelihood of being enrolled in a bachelor's degree program increased as the level of parental education increased (23 percent, to 37 percent, to 47 percent) (table 6). With respect to when students first enrolled in postsecondary education, first-generation students were more likely to delay their entry (46 percent versus 19 percent) than their counterparts whose parents had more than a high school education (table 7). First-generation students also differed from their non-first-generation counterparts in how they financed their education. In particular, they were more likely to receive financial aid, in general (51 percent versus 42 percent), and grants (42 percent versus 35 percent) and loans (22 percent versus 18 percent), in particular, than their non-first-generation counterparts (table 8). At the same time, students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher were less likely than those Enrollment Characteristics whose parents had some college but less than a bachelor's degree to receive any financial aid (39 percent versus 47 percent). With respect to specific kinds of aid, students whose parents had earned at least a bachelor's degree were also less likely than their counterparts whose parents had some postsecondary experience but less than a bachelor's degree to receive either grants (32 percent versus 40 percent) or loans (15 percent versus 21 percent) (table 8).\n\nPrevious research has indicated that first-generation students are often less academically prepared than non-first-generation students. Across all sectors, first-generation students did not differ from their counterparts in terms of the number of remedial courses they were taking (15 percent and 16 percent, respectively) (table 9). Yet this study revealed differences within different sectors of postsecondary education among first-generation and non-first-generation students on the need for remedial education in order to obtain adequate preparation for college-level work. At public 4-year institutions, there was not a significant difference between the proportions of first-generation and non-first-generation students who were taking remedial courses (table 9). At private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, however, first-generation students were more likely to be taking remedial courses. While there appear to be significant differences in the proportions of first-generation and non-first-generation students at public 2-year institutions enrolled in remedial coursework, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they were different. First-generation college students were also more likely to be working full time while enrolled in school. Compared with their counterparts, more first-generation students reported working full time while enrolled during their first year in postsecondary education (33 percent versus 24 percent) (table 10).  \n"}, {"section_title": "What Mattered to First-Generation Students", "text": "The following section examines the relative importance of various matters to firstgeneration and non-first-generation students. These measures fall into two general categories: those associated with professional/financial achievement and those associated with personal aspirations. Professional/financial achievement matters include being able to find steady work, being successful in one's line of work, becoming successful in one's own business, becoming an authority in a given field, being very well off financially, being a leader in the community, or influencing the political structure. Personal matters include getting away from a particular area of the country, living close to parents and relatives, having children, giving their own children better opportunities, and having leisure time to enjoy personal interests. Examining differences in how important these various factors are to first-generation and non-first-generation college students can shed light on how they might differ in their motivations for enrolling in postsecondary education. For each measure, students were asked whether the factor was \"very important,\" \"somewhat important,\" or \"not important\" to them. Compared with other students, firstgeneration students more often reported that factors related to financial security were very important to them personally. In addition, they were more likely than students whose parents had more than a high school education to say that \"being very well off financially\" was very important to them (61 percent versus 49 percent) (table 11). As a group, first-generation students and students whose parents had some postsecondary experience but less than a bachelor's degree were more likely than students whose parents had attained a bachelor's degree or higher education level to say that \"being very well off financially\" was very important to them (57 percent versus 47 percent). While first-generation students were not more likely than students whose parents had some college (85 versus 86 percent) to report that \"being able to find steady work\" was very important to them, both groups were more likely to report this as a very important matter than students whose parents had a college degre'e (81 percent). By contrast, first-generation students were less likely than their counterparts to emphasize measures related to having political power as matters of importance. In particular, they were somewhat less likely than students whose parents had more than a high school education to report \"influencing the political structure\" (15 percent versus 18 percent) or to report \"being a What Mattered to First-Generation Students leader in [their] community\" (20 percent versus 24 percent) as very important to them (table 11). While these last two differences were statistically significant, they are relatively small in terms of practical significance. According to first-generation student status, there were also several differences in the personal matters that students cited as very important (table 12). For example, first-generation students were more likely than other students to cite \"[giving their own] children better opportunities than [they've] had\" (85 percent versus 77 percent) as very important to them than nonfirst-generation students. Students whose parents had some college were no less likely than firstgeneration students (82 and 85 percent, respectively) to report this as a very important goal, but both groups were more likely than the group of students whose parents had a bachelor's or advanced degree to report this as an important matter (74 percent) (table 12). In addition, firstgeneration students were also more likely than non-first-generation students to report \"living close to parents and relatives\" (21 percent versus 14 percent) as a key matter of personal importance (table 12)."}, {"section_title": "Why First-Generation Students Chose Their Institutions", "text": "Students were also asked whether specific cost-related, location-related, and reputation/other-related reasons were very important, somewhat important, or not very important to them in their decision to attend a particular institution.

Cost-related reasons include obtained financial aid needed; other living costs were less; tuition and other expenses were less; and could finish in a shorter length of time. Location-related reasons include could go to school and work; could live at home; school was close to home; and school was far away from home.

First-generation students were also more likely to report choosing their institution because they could \"finish the course in a short period of time\" as a very important reason (35 percent versus 21 percent) (table 13). As parental education levels increased, the likelihood of students reporting financial aid (36 versus 29 and 22 percent) or finishing in a shorter time as a very important reason for attending an institution decreased as parental education increased (35 percent versus 25 percent and 19 percent) (table 13)."}, {"section_title": "Location-Related Factors", "text": "First-generation students differed from their non-first-generation counterparts in terms of the specific location-related reasons they cited as important in choosing their institutions.

In addition, when the average academic integration scores were examined, among all students, first-generation students had a lower average score (2.3) than non-first-generation students (2.5) (table 17). Differences in levels of academic integration according to first-generation status varied with the type of institution students attended.

First-generation students in public 2-year institutions also had a lower average index score for academic integration (2.1) than non-first-generation students (2.3), as did students in other less-than-4-year institutions (2.3 vs. 2.5). However, in other types of institutions, the average academic integration scores of both groups of students did not differ (table 17). "}, {"section_title": "Social Integration", "text": "In addition to having lower levels of academic integration, first-generation students also had lower levels of social integration in the college environment than their non-first-generation counterparts. As parental education increased from a high school diploma or less (17 percent) to some college (23 percent) to a bachelor's or advanced degree (33 percent), the likelihood of having high levels of social integration increased (table 18). In general, first-generation students were less likely than students whose parents had some college or had attained at least a bachelor's degree to have high levels of social integration (17 percent versus 29 percent), and more likely to have low levels (38 percent versus 19 percent). These general patterns also held when institutions were examined separately, except for students in private, for-profit and other lessthan-4-year institutions (table 18).17 As suggested earlier, these lower scores in social integration may be related to the fact that first-generation students tend to be older than non-first-generation students, and may have less time or interest in participating in these kinds of activities.\" Alternatively, cultural differences, such as the value that students' families place on attaining a postsecondary education credential, may influence the extent to which students whose parents have different educational levels choose to involve themselves in the institutional community. When the average social integration scores were examined, among all students, firstgeneration students showed a lower average level of social integration (1.9) than non-firstgeneration students (2.2) (table 19). Differences in the scores between these two groups of students varied according to the kind of institution attended. For example, in public 4-year and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, first-generation students had lower average index scores for social integration than other students (2.2 versus 2.3, and 2.4 versus 2.6, respectively). Firstgeneration students in public 2-year institutions also scored lower (1.8) than non-first-generation students (2.0). There were no measurable differences, however, between the average social integration scores of first-generation and other students at private, not-for-profit and other less-than-4-year institutions. While it appears that the index scores differ for students in other less-than -4year institutions, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they are different (table 19). 17First-generation students in public 2-year institutions were less likely to report moderate levels of integration than their counterparts (42 percent versus 55 percent). 18As with academic integration, there was an association between age and low levels of social integration. With the exception of the difference between the proportions of 25-29-year-olds and those 30 or older on low scores of social integration, as age increased, the likelihood of a low score on social integration also increased. Conversely, with the exception of a difference between those in the 25-29 and 30 or older age groups, as age increased, the likelihood of a high score on social integration decreased (BPS:90/94 DAS).

"}, {"section_title": "Persistence and Attainment", "text": "Whether or not a student attained a degree or was still enrolled in postsecondary education was strongly associated with his or her parents' education level ( figure 5). Over half (55 percent) of first-generation students had attained a degree or were still enrolled by 1994, yet first-generation students who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90  Persistence and Attainment were much less likely than non-first-generation students to have either attained a degree or to be enrolled in postsecondary education 5 years after their initial enrollment.19 About 44 percent of first-generation students had attained a postsecondary degree or certificate by the spring of 1994, compared with 56 percent of their non-first-generation counterparts; 11 percent of firstgeneration students were still enrolled at the time of follow-up, compared with 16 percent of nonfirst-generation students. Almost half (45 percent) of first-generation students had attained no degree and were no longer enrolled by follow-up, compared with less than one-third (29 percent) of other students (table 20). As parental education levels rose, so did the likelihood of persistence (i.e., attained or still enrolled), from 55 percent for first-generation students to 65 percent for students whose parents had some college, and to 76 percent for those whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher (table 20). With respect to the type of degiee attained, first-generation students .were less likely than other students to have attained a bachelor's degree (13 percent versus 33 percent) and more likely to have attained a vocational certificate (18 percent versus 9 percent). As parental education rose, the likelihood of students attaining a bachelor's degree increased markedly, while the likelihood of attaining a certificate decreased. On the other hand, the likelihood of having attained an associate's degree did not differ according to first-generation status (13 percent versus 14 percent) (table 20). Underscoring the strong association of parents' education level with students' persistence and attainment, there were also differences in persistence and attainment rates between first-generation students and students whose parents had some college experience but never attained a bachelor's degree. Students whose parents had some college experience but had attained less than a bachelor's degree were more likely than first-generation students to persist, to attain any sort of degree, to earn a certificate, and to earn a bachelor's degree (table 20). When differences in persistence and attainment were examined according to institution type, the results held for students who began at public 4-year and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. While a majority of first-generation students at these institutions had attained a degree or were still enrolled as of 1994 (66 percent at public 4-year and 71 percent at private, notfor-profit 4-year institutions), first-generation students from both types of 4-year institutions were less likely to have persisted overall than their non-first-generation counterparts. After 5 years, 34 percent of first-generation students from public 4-year institutions and 29 percent of those from private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions had no degree and were no longer enrolled, compared with 23 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of their counterparts (table 20). About one-third (34 19Since these students were interviewed only 5 years after they began their postsecondary education, not enough time had elapsed to determine if the students who were no longer enrolled were taking time off from school and planning to return to complete their education or whether they had decided not to continue. percent) of first-generation students in public 4-year institutions and over half (55 percent) in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions had earned bachelor's degrees after five years. Among those who began at both public and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, first-generation students were also less likely to have attained bachelor's degrees than were non-first-generation students. First-generation students were also less likely than students whose parents had attended some college but earned less than a bachelor's degree to have attained bachelor's degrees after beginning at public 4-year institutions (34 percent versus 46 percent). On the other hand, at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, first-generation students appeared as likely as these other students to attain bachelor's degrees (55 percent and 60 percent, respectively) (table 20). When examining proportions of students who had attained a degree or were still enrolled after 5 years, at public 4-year institutions, first-generation students were no less likely than students whose parents had some college but less than a bachelor's degree to either still be enrolled or have attained a degree (66 percent versus 71 percent). While they were as likely to have attained bachelor's degrees from private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions, first-generation students were less likely to either still be enrolled and have attained a degree after 5 years than students whose parents had some college experience but had not received a bachelor's degree (71 percent versus 79 percent). This suggests that from public 4-year institutions, first-generation students had similar persistence rates as students whose parents had some postsecondary education, but they may have been taking longer to finish. However, although they attained degrees at similar rates as their counterparts, it appears that first-generation students were less likely than students whose parents had postsecondary experience below a bachelor's degree to remain enrolled in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions. Among those who began at public 2-year institutions, after 5 years, first-generation students were also less likely than their counterparts to have attained degrees or to be enrolled in 1994 (46 1 percent versus 60 percent). While there were no significant differences in the proportions of students who earned any degrees (35 percent first-generation versus 40 percent non-firstgeneration), a lower proportion of first-generation students (11 percent) than non-first-generation students (20 percent) were still enrolled and working toward a degree after 5 years. However, there is some evidence that first-generation students may have transferred without a degree from 2-year to 4-year institutions in higher proportions than their counterparts.2\u00b0 Of all students who 20See U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, Second Follow-up (BPS: 90/94), Data Analysis System. Of all 1989 beginning postsecondary students, 35 percent had transferred to another institution by 1994. Of those who had attended more than one institution by the 1994 followup, 12 percent had earned an associate's degree and 4 percent had earned a certificate at the first institution in which they Persistence and Attainment had persisted in 4-year public or private, not-for-profit institutions until 1994, first-generation students were more likely than non-first-generation students (31 percent versus 25 percent) to have transferred during the previous 5 years. But first-generation students who had persisted in these institutions were no more likely than their peers to hold associate's degrees (8 percent versus 6 percent). This finding suggests that this particular group of first-generation students were actually still enrolled, but in a different postsecondary education sector, after 5 years. In comparing the persistence of first-generation students and their counterparts whose parents had some college experience but no bachelor's degree, first-generation students were as likely as members of this other group to persist and to attain any degrees. When beginning at private, for-profit institutions, a lower percentage of first-generation students (58 percent) than non-first-generation students (69 percent) had either attained a degree or were still enrolled after 5 years. While the proportions who earned certificates were similar among the two groups, almost twice as many non-first-generation students (15 percent) as first generation students (8 percent) had earned associate's degrees. There was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that the persistence of first-generation students differed from that of their non-firSt-generation counterparts in less-than-4-year institutions other than what was described above (table 20).21 In terms of the relationship across institution types and persistence and attainment, similar to their counterparts whose parents have any postsecondary education, first-generation students were more likely to persist when they began at 4-year public and 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions than they were from public 2-year institutions (table 20). This is consistent with findings in other studies demonstrating that undergraduates are more likely to persist at 4-year institutions than they are at 2-year public institutions.22 In light of research linking part-time enrollment status to a lower probability of persistence and attainment,23 it is also important to consider enrollment status when examining educational outcomes. Among those attending full time, first-generation students remained less likely than non-first-generation students to persist after beginning at 4-year public and 4-year private, notfor-profit institutions (table 21). On the other hand, first-generation students initially enrolled full  'Values for totals may not be within range of subgroup values due to missing cases on the subgroup variables. 2lncludes students enrolled in private, not-for-profit 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions and public less-than-2-year institutions.

Comparing across institution types, full-time first-generation students from public 4-year institutions had lower attainment rates (48 percent) than firstgeneration students from 4-year private, not-for-profit institutions (68 percent). While their persistence rates also appeared lower after beginning at public 4-year institutions, compared with 4year private, not-for-profit institutions (68 percent versus 74 percent), there was not enough evidence to conclude that first-generation students' levels of persistence by each type of institution were different (table 21). This finding suggests that first-generation students from public 4-year institutions may have been taking a longer time to finish their degrees. Full-time first-generation students from public 2-year institutions were as likely to attain degrees as their counterparts from 4-year public institutions. While it appears that first-generation students were less likely to persist when initially enrolling at public 2-year institutions than at public 4-year institutions (61 percent versus 76 percent), there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they are different. Consistent with the findings for all first-generation students, when controlling for fulltime enrollment status, first-generation students from 2-year public institutions were less likely either to attain degrees or persist than first-generation students from 4-year private not-for-profit institutions."}, {"section_title": "Labor Market Outcomes", "text": "As described earlier in this report, being well-off financially, being able to find steady work, and being able to give their own children better opportunities were more important to firstgeneration students than to those whose parents had bachelor's degrees. To examine whether degree attainment is an equalizing force in the occupational and social status of students who had completed their degrees by 1994, this section analyzes 1989-90 beginning students' occupations as reported in the 1994 follow-up survey. The labor market analysis was conducted separately for students who had attained subbaccalaureate credentials (associate's degrees and certificates) and those who had earned bachelor's degrees. BPS:90/94 data were used for subbaccalaureate students, and B&B:93/94 data were used for bachelor's degree recipients. A general analysis of employment outcomes for students who did not attain a degree and were no longer enrolled according to age was also conducted using BPS:90/94 data. For subbaccalaureate degree recipients and for those not seeking a degree, labor market participation was determined by their principal job in 1993, while for bachelor's degree recipients it was determined by their principal job as of April 1994. Measures of labor market participation included whether they were employed, their occupation, whether their occupation was related to their major, and whether they needed their education and training to get their principal job. For bachelor's degree recipients, starting salaries as of April 1994 were also examined after controlling for gender. The results of this study show that similar proportions of first-generation students who received certificates, associate's, or bachelor's degrees were employed as their counterparts with similar degrees (99 percent versus 91 percent certificate; 92 percent versus 87 percent associate's; 89 percent versus 86 percent bachelor's). On average, 89 percent of associate's degree recipients, 96 percent of certificate completers, and 87 percent of bachelor's degree completers were employed when they were followed up in 1993 or 1994 (table 22). Among associate's degree recipients, although it appears that first-generation students were less likely to report that they had taken a job unrelated to their educational training than other 54 53 students with similar degrees (21 percent versus 35 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that this was the case (table 22). Among bachelor's degree recipients, similar proportions of both groups of students reported that they could have obtained their job without their education (54 percent versus 57 percent). However, first-generation students were somewhat less likely than other students to report taking a job unrelated to their educational training (23 percent versus 26 percent) (table 22). Overall, when controlling for type of degree attained, there were no observed differences in occupation between first-generation students and their non-first-generation counterparts. Additionally, no differences were found in average annual salaries as of April 1994 among bachelor's degree recipients according to first-generation status: both first-generation and non-firstgeneration students earned roughly $23,000, on average (table 23).24 Although males had considerably higher salaries than females,25 when salaries were examined separately for male and female bachelor's degree recipients, there were still no differences in earnings according to firstgeneration status (male $26,339 versus $25,816; female $20,368 versus $20,753). While it appears that the average salaries of females whose parents have some college are higher than those of females whose parents have bachelor's degrees, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they are different. Among students who did not attain a postsecondary credential within 5 years and were no longer enrolled in postsecondary education, there were few differences in the employment attributes of both groups according to first-generation status, except for two characteristics. Firstgeneration students were more likely to report working in the craftsman trades (24 percent versus 17 percent), and were less likely to report working in a managerial occupation (13 percent versus 22 percent) (table 22). In this analysis, employment outcomes for students who received no degree and were no longer enrolled were also examined. This analysis further took into consideration age, because first-generation students tend to be older, and older individuals tend to have more experience in the labor market. Although no overall differences were observed in the employment rates of students who attained no degree and were no longer enrolled according to first-generation status after controlling for age, there were some occupational differences (table 22). Similar to the results found for all students who did not earn postsecondary credentials within 5 years, among those under 23 years old who had not attained a degree and were no longer enrolled, first-generation students were more likely than other students to be employed in the craftsman trades (27 percent versus 16 percent), and less likely to hold managerial positions (15 percent versus 22 percent) (table 22). Among those older than 23, first-generation students were more likely than other students to hold clerical positions (24 percent versus 12 percent), and more likely to be employed in the service sector (24 percent versus 10 percent) (table 22)."}, {"section_title": "Graduate School Enrollment", "text": "The final analysis in this study examined the rate of graduate school enrollment relative to parents' educational level. As of 1994, first-generation students were less likely than their counterparts whose parents had more than a high school education to be enrolled in graduate school (23 percent versus 30 percent) (table 24). Among students who did enroll in graduate school, there were also differences according to first-generation student status in the types of programs in which students enrolled. At the same time, however, the majority of students who enrolled in graduate study were in master's degree programs, where first-generation students were as likely as non-first-generation students to be enrolled (46 percent and 43 percent) (table 24). Within other types of graduate programs, students whose parents had more than a high school education were somewhat more likely than first-generation students to enroll in postbaccalaureate certificate programs (4 percent versus 2 percent), first-professional programs (10 percent versus 6 percent) and doctoral degree programs (6 percent versus 3 percent) (table 24). "}, {"section_title": "Influence of Demographic, Institutional, Enrollment, and Integration Characteristics on Persistence and Attainment", "text": "As described in this report, in addition to having parents who had never enrolled in postsecondary education, first-generation students have particular demographic, institutional, enrollment, and school integration characteristics that distinguish them from their non-first-generation peers. In order to measure the relationship of a single variable, such as first-generation status, to persistence and attainment, one must control for the effects of related variables. In this analysis, a weighted least squares regression model was used to measure how each of these various factors affected persistence and attainment. In the model, the dependent variable is defined as having attained any degree or being enrolled at the time of the 1994 follow-up survey. In addition to parents' education, the independent variables in the model included gender, age, SES, race ethnicity, and institutional type (4-year, public 2-year, and other less-than-4-year public and private, not-for-profit institutions). Whether or not students attended full time or part time and how integrated they were, both academically and socially, were also included in the model. Finally, the analysis was based on only those students who indicated when they began postsecondary education that their objective was to earn a credential (vocational certificate, associate's, or bachelor's degree). The regression coefficients were subsequently used to adjust the original estimates of persistence and attainment, taking into account the joint effects of all the independent variables (see appendix B for methodology details). The results of the analysis are displayed in table 25. The original (unadjusted) estimates of the proportion of students who had attained or persisted in 1994 are listed in the first column, and the adjusted percentages after controlling for the variation of all other variables are listed in the second column. Asterisks in these columns identify cases where the percentage of students in a given category who had attained or persisted is significantly different from that of the reference group (italicized). For example, part-time enrollment (unadjusted) was associated with lower rates of persistence and attainment than was full-time enrollment (48 percent versus 71 percent). This pattern held even after controlling for all other characteristics in the model (60 percent versus 67 percent, adjusted).  The initial finding that first-generation students were less likely than non-first-generation students to persist and attain a degree (57 percent compared with 73 percent), held even when controlling for the variation of other variables (62 percent versus 69 percent, adjusted). This finding suggests that first-generation status, independent of other background and enrollment factors with which it is correlated, has an effect on the likelihood of persistence and attainment."}, {"section_title": "Influence of Characteristics on Persistence and Attainment", "text": "Aside from the impact of first-generation status, the model also revealed some other findings related to student background characteristics. After controlling for the variation of other variables, it was found that first enrolling in postsecondary education at the age of 19 or older was negatively associated with persistence and attainment, compared with being 18 or younger (61 percent for those aged 19-24 and 62 percent for those aged 25 or older versus 69 percent for those aged 18 or younger, adjusted). Compared with being female, being male was also negatively associated with persistence and attainment (64 percent versus 67 percent, adjusted). In addition, when examining the relationships between raceethnicity and persistence, an initial negative association between being black, non-Hispanic and persistence and attainment, compared with being white, non-Hispanic, also held when all other variables were controlled for (57 percent versus 65 percent, adjusted). A positive association between being Asian-Pacific Islander and persistence and attainment, compared with being white, non-Hispanic, remained after taking into account the covariation of the other variables (76 percent versus 65 percent, adjusted).\nAn analysis of the relationship between institution type and the likelihood of persistence and attainment revealed that the initial negative association between being initially enrolled in a public 2-year institution, compared with being enrolled in a 4-year institution, also held when all other variables were controlled for (60 percent versus 70 percent, adjusted). However, first attending other types of less than 4-year institutions did not appear to have an effect on persistence and attainment, compared with attending a public or private, not-for-profit 4-year institution, after adjustment. particular levels of academic and social integration appeared to affect persistence and attainment. For example, the initial difference between low scores on academic integration and persistence and attainment, compared with moderate scores (51 percent versus 68 percent, unadjusted), remained (60 percent versus 67 percent, adjusted). Likewise, an initial negative relationship between low scores in social integration measures and persistence and attainment, compared with moderate scores, also held (59 percent versus 67 percent, adjusted) after controlling for the covariation of the other variables. On the other hand, although there initially appeared to be a positive relationship between high academic or social integration scores and persistence and attainment, after controlling for the covariation of the other variables, there was no evidence that high academic or social integration scores affected persistence and attainment relative to moderate scores.26 Finally, after controlling for all other factors, SES and persistence and attainment were not significantly related. Thus, it appears that SES alone does not have an effect on persistence and attainment, but may also be related to a number of other characteristics (including firstgeneration status, 2-year public institution attendance, and part-time attendance), which in turn negatively affect persistence and attainment. 26The results of the regression model did not change for the other variables when the academic and social integration variables were removed from the model (BPS:90/94 DAS)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This report describes the characteristics and experiences of first-generation college studentsi.e., those whose parents' highest level of education is a high school diploma or less. Many of the findings from this study were consistent with previous research about firstgeneration college students. In particular, this study revealed that first-generation college students had particular demographic and enrollment characteristics that distinguished them from their non-first-generation peers. They were more likely than their counterparts to be female, older, and independent. In addition, first-generation students were more likely than non-first-generation students to have dependents and lower incomes, and to be enrolled in 2-year institutions. While enrolled, they were more likely than their counterparts to be enrolled part time, receiving some form of financial aid, and working full time. Consistent with their lower incomes and increased likelihood of having dependents, first-generation students were more likely than non-firstgeneration students to indicate that in selecting an institution they were influenced by the availability of financial aid, the opportunity to finish coursework more quickly, being able to live at home while attending school, and being able to work at the school while enrolled. First-generation students were more likely than non-first-generation students to value improving their financial and professional status, which may reflect qualities such as their lower socioeconomic status and parental educational attainment. This study reveals that those firstgeneration students who completed degree programs appeared to achieve this goal. Five years after beginning postsecondary education, first-generation students who had attained certificates or degrees were employed in similar positions and earned comparable salaries to those of their counterparts whose parents had attended college. At the same time, however, first-generation students were less likely to complete their postsecondary education within 5 years. Compared with their non-first-generation counterparts, they were more likely to be enrolled part-time, attend public 2-year institutions rather than 4-year institutions, and have lower index scores on levels of academic and social integration, all of which were negatively associated with persistence and attainment after controlling for covariation of related variables.27 27As described in this report's earlier discussion about academic and social integration, little research has been conducted on the applicability of academic and social integration models to younger, more traditional, and older, less traditional, students. It should be kept in mind that the behaviors measured in academic and social integration may be more accessible and appealing to younger students, who are less likely to be first-generation.
