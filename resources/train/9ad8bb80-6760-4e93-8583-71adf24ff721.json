[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Barrier islands are dynamic environments because of their position along the marineestuarine interface. Geomorphology influences habitat distribution on barrier islands by regulating exposure to harsh abiotic conditions. Researchers have identified linkages between habitat and landscape position, such as elevation and distance from shore, yet these linkages have not been fully leveraged to develop predictive models. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of commonly used machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest, for predicting barrier island habitats using landscape position for Dauphin Island, Alabama, USA. Landscape position predictors were extracted from topobathymetric data. Models were developed for three tidal zones: subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal/upland. We used a contemporary habitat map to identify landscape position linkages for habitats, such as beach, dune, woody vegetation, and marsh. Deterministic accuracy, fuzzy accuracy, and hindcasting were used for validation. The random forest algorithm performed best for intertidal and supratidal/upland habitats, while the K-nearest neighbor algorithm performed best for subtidal habitats. A posteriori application of expert rules based on theoretical understanding of barrier island habitats enhanced model results. For the contemporary model, deterministic overall accuracy was nearly 70%, and fuzzy overall accuracy was over 80%. For the hindcast model, deterministic overall accuracy was nearly 80%, and fuzzy overall accuracy was over 90%. We found machine learning algorithms were well-suited for predicting barrier island habitats using landscape position. Our model framework could be coupled with hydrodynamic geomorphologic models for forecasting habitats with accelerated sea-level rise, simulated storms, and restoration actions."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Barrier islands are subaerial expressions consisting of wave-, wind-, and/or tide-deposited sediments [1] . These islands are found along portions of every continent, except Antarctica [2] , and provide numerous important ecosystem services including storm surge reduction, wave attenuation, erosion control to the mainland, habitat for fish and wildlife, carbon sequestration in marshes, vertical uncertainty within intertidal areas. Relative topography can be helpful for extracting dune habitats [21, 28, 33 ], yet elevation relative to storm water levels can also be a factor, as dunes can be eroded by high wave runup during storms [5] . Thus, elevation uncertainty analyses could also be used to evaluate the likelihood of areas depicted by a DEM being above a common extreme storm water level [28] . Data-driven, machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for identifying patterns and relationships in data; however, one potential issue is that they require the assumption that the data used to train the model is representative of the phenomena being modeled. Because change can sometimes occur rapidly on a barrier island, postprocessing could be used to ensure that spatially explicit habitat predictions match our expectations based on expert theoretical knowledge of the specific barrier island being modeled (e.g., for a high-energy barrier island we would not expect marsh to be located on the ocean-facing shoreline [34] ).\nHere, we build upon recent barrier island habitat model efforts by Foster et al. [16] , Halls et al. [21] , and Young et al. [19] to develop a habitat model for Dauphin Island, Alabama, USA. Our model incorporates elevation uncertainty for elevation-dependent habitat extraction and yields spatially explicit predictions of general barrier island habitats based on landscape position information such as elevation, distance from shoreline, and relative topography ( Figure 1 ). For our study, we explored three research questions: (1) how well can machine learning algorithms, such as KNN, SVM, and RF, predict contemporary barrier island habitats from landscape position information; (2) does the use of postprocessing routines, such as expert rules based on the theoretical understanding of a barrier island (e.g., marsh should not be located along the high-energy shoreline of the island), enhance model accuracy; and (3) how well does this model generalize to predict historical habitats (i.e., hindcast)?

For subaerial areas, the Monte Carlo simulation to create the probability surface related to intertidal areas used the assessment from intertidal and low-lying herbaceous areas, whereas the Monte Carlo simulation for the likelihood of being above a storm water level used the dune assessment. For submerged areas for both simulations, we used recommendations from Byrnes et al. [43] for the root mean square error of bathymetry data for nearshore waters, and we assumed bias was negligible. The lower and upper elevation thresholds for the intertidal probability surface were the lowest astronomical tide and the highest astronomical tide observed during the NTDE at Dauphin Island, respectively [44] .

We opted to use standard MATLAB model presets to avoid overfitting our model since our model was developed from a single snapshot of barrier island habitat data, and barrier islands are dynamic ecosystems that can change gradually from coastal processes including currents and tides or rapidly from episodic events such as storms.

Table 1 lists the variables used per model with rationale. As previously mentioned, the selection of these specific predictor variables was based on literature and our theoretical understanding of barrier island habitats. Figure A2 shows the unbiased relative importance from a random forest ensemble model with 100 learners. To illustrate how landscape position can influence barrier island habitats, we used the MATLAB Distribution Fitting application in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to plot univariate probability density functions for elevation and distance from the ocean-facing shoreline for the supratidal/upland habitats. For the probability density plots, we used non-parametric curves with bandwidths that best fit the data based on visual inspection.

For each cell, the majority habitat class of the 100 predictions was chosen as the final prediction. The intertidal zone and the supratidal/upland zone models were applied to each cell in the 10 m raster; however, to increase efficiency of the subtidal zone models, we made predictions for a 100 m raster and then converted these data to a 10 m raster using inverse distance-weighted interpolation.\nWe used the validation points to assess the overall, the producer's, and the user's accuracies for each class. For each assessment, we calculated a deterministic and fuzzy estimate for all accuracy statistics following guidelines by Congalton and Green [49] and Woodcock and Gopal [51] . The fuzzy accuracy estimate allows classification of: (1) exact match (e.g., woody vegetation in model results and orthophotography); (2) acceptable match related to landscape position and geomorphic setting (e.g., calling a location intertidal beach or water-marine along ocean-facing shoreline); and (3) unacceptable/error (e.g., intertidal marsh located on the high-energy, ocean-facing shoreline). Fuzzy accuracy is well-suited for assessing barrier island habitats because of dynamic transitions like open water classes and intertidal classes, which are dependent on water level.\nTo determine the best model per tidal zone (i.e., from the subset of models, which included the RF models and the top-performing KNN and SVM models), we used the tidal zone delineations from the contemporary 10 m TBDEM to extract the validation points that fell within the tidal zone. However, because the validation data were from the 1 m 2015 habitat map, there may have been some discrepancies between the reference labels within a tidal zone because of temporal lag and spatial resolution differences. Thus, we omitted validation points that had a reference label other than what would be expected in the tidal zone being assessed (e.g., we omitted points that had a reference label of intertidal beach from the supratidal/upland zone). Similar to Foody [52] , we used McNemar's test to assess whether there was a significant difference in model performance between the top-performing models per tidal zone (Table A5) .\nNext, we combined the best model per tidal zone and tested whether the application of a suite of post-processing routines enhanced model results. These included the application of a majority filter to reduce noise along with several user-defined constraints based on the theoretical understanding of barrier island habitats from the literature regarding elevation and X, Y coordinates [19, 35, 44] . For example, on non-fetch-limited barrier islands, emergent marsh vegetation typically occurs where wave energy is lower, whereas unvegetated intertidal mudflats or intertidal beach habitats are more common where wave energy is higher [34] . Therefore, intertidal marsh habitats found along the ocean-facing shore were changed to intertidal beach habitats. An additional example is that dunes are not expected to be sustainable at low-lying elevations, such as those below a common extreme storm water level [5] . Therefore, dune habitats that had a probability less than 0.5 for being above the extreme storm water level were recoded to barrier flats [28] . These rules were applied in a step-wise fashion (Table A6) . Some of the thresholds used were directly related to tidal datums (e.g., EHWS), whereas others, such as sink depth, were determined by trial-and-error with the final value being selected by visual inspection. We also explored whether the use of a four-pixel minimum mapping unit (MMU) impacted model performance. We selected four pixels as the maximum MMU based on visual inspection of results (i.e., small habitat areas can be lost if the MMU is too high). We used McNemar's test to assess whether there was a significant difference in model performance based on the level of model post-processing (Table A5) .\nLastly, we applied the final model to hindcast habitats based on the predictor variables developed from the CoNED TBDEM ( Figure 5 ). To validate the hindcast results, we developed a hindcast validation dataset with about 300 points per zone (n = 1029). These data consisted of stratified random points within each habitat model class. We assigned reference labels to the hindcast validation points through photointerpretation of the orthophotography and inspection of the TBDEM and probability surfaces, and we assessed deterministic and fuzzy map accuracies."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Similar to Young et al. [19] , we found that habitats on Dauphin Island were related to landscape position ( Figure 6 ). For example, these plots showed that beach habitat tended to be located near the ocean-facing shore and had a mode for elevation of around 1 m relative to MSL, whereas woody vegetation had a mode for elevation of just under 2 m relative to MSL and was further away from the ocean-facing shoreline. Collectively, these plots confirmed that landscape position variables were important predictors for supratidal/upland habitats on Dauphin Island.\nThe top-performing models for the subtidal zone using five-fold cross validation were coarse KNN, fine gaussian SVM, and RF (Table A2 ). For the intertidal zone, the top performing models using five-fold cross validation were weighted KNN, cubic SVM, and RF (Table A3) . Lastly, the top performing models for the supratidal/upland zone using five-fold cross validation were weighted KNN, quadratic SVM, and RF (Table A4) . With more robust model development (i.e., using 100 random permutations of the training data) and assessment using the validation data from the 2015 habitat map, the performances of all of the models were similar for the subtidal zone ( Figure A1) ; however, the coarse KNN model was selected for the subtidal zone based on visual inspection of the results. We did not run McNemar's test for the subtidal zone because each model had the same performance for the validation dataset. We found that RF performed the best for the intertidal and supratidal/upland zones ( Figure A1 ). For the intertidal zone, we found that the RF model had a higher accuracy compared to either the KNN or SVM model (deterministic accuracy: p < 0.001; fuzzy accuracy: p < 0.001; Table A5 ). For the supratidal/upland zone, we found that the RF model had a higher accuracy compared to the KNN model (deterministic accuracy: p < 0.05; fuzzy accuracy: p < 0.001), but the results were not significantly different from the SVM model (deterministic accuracy: p = 0.617; fuzzy accuracy: p = 0.126; Table A5 ).\nAs previously mentioned, these models were combined to create the contemporary model results. The combined contemporary model had a deterministic overall accuracy of 66.9% and a fuzzy overall accuracy of 80.3% (Figure 7a,b ; Table A7 ). The application of post-processing yielded a slight enhancement to the deterministic and fuzzy overall accuracies (Figure 7c,d ; Table 2 ). We selected the model with post-processing and a four-pixel MMU as the final model. This model had a deterministic overall accuracy of 67.5% and a fuzzy overall accuracy of 82.1% (Figure 7e ,f; Table 2 ). However, we did not find that the application of the MMU led to a negative impact on the results (Figure 7c-f) . We found that the results of various levels of post-processing were not significantly different for the deterministic accuracy results; however, the fuzzy accuracies of both the models with post-processing (i.e., with and without the minimum mapping unit) were higher than the model results that did not include post-processing (p < 0.001; Table A5 ).\ndeterministic and fuzzy overall accuracies (Figure 7c-d Table  A5 ). While overall accuracy is a helpful measure, it is also important to assess class-specific performance reported by the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy. For the final contemporary model, the top three classes with regard to deterministic producer's accuracy were woody wetland (83.9%), water-fresh (82.1%), and woody vegetation (71.5%). The three classes with the highest fuzzy producer's accuracies were water-marine (97.1%), intertidal beach (94.6%), and woody wetland (83.9%). The classes with the lowest deterministic and fuzzy producer's accuracies were intertidal flat (60.0%) and dune (66.9%), respectively. The three classes with the highest deterministic user's accuracies were water-estuarine (98.3%), woody vegetation (86.7%), and water-marine (81.4%). The three classes with the highest fuzzy user's accuracies were water-estuarine (98.3%), woody vegetation (90.4%), and intertidal beach (85.8%). The classes with the lowest deterministic and fuzzy user's accuracies were intertidal beach (10.2%) and water-fresh (63.9%), respectively. Figure 7a -f highlights the change in accuracy as a result from the use of fuzzy accuracy. For the final model, the use of fuzzy accuracy led to a median increase of producer's accuracy of 9.5% with an interquartile range of 15.2% (Figure 7e,f) , while the user's accuracy was more variable with a median increase of user's accuracy of 3.9% with an interquartile range of 40.3%. In addition to the use of fuzzy accuracy, we found that the model results were often enhanced when post-processing routines were applied (Figure 7 ; Table A5 ). Compared to the original model results, the three highest magnitude changes in deterministic producer's accuracy as a result of the user-defined rules were water-fresh (\u221214.3%), intertidal beach (+10.8%), and dune (\u22125.7%). As a result of the user-defined rules, the three highest magnitude changes in deterministic user's accuracy were water-fresh (+11.0%), woody wetland (+6.9%), and dune (+6.4%). Figure 8 shows additional evidence to support the use of post-processing by contrasting the western tip of Dauphin Island without post-processing ( Figure 8a ) and with post-processing (Figure 8b ). Besides the reduction in dune habitat, a few notable differences included the reduction of intertidal beach areas that were found behind beach habitat, introduction of estuarine ponds within intertidal marsh, and the reduction in the salt-and-pepper effect. When comparing the areal coverage per supratidal/upland habitat, we saw the overall comparison of percent difference per habitat class more closely matched the 2015 habitat map [28] . Figure 9a shows the final contemporary model prediction map. Overall, the model did generalize well for the hindcast with a deterministic overall accuracy of 77.8% and a fuzzy overall accuracy of 92.4% (Figure 7g-h; Figure 9b ; Table 3 ). With regard to deterministic producer's accuracy, the top three classes were water-marine (97.8%), water-fresh (97.4%), and intertidal beach (97.0%). The three classes with the highest fuzzy producer's accuracies were water-estuarine (99.5%), intertidal beach (98.5%), and water-marine (97.8%).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This effort builds on the work of Foster et al. [16] , Halls et al. [21] , and Young et al. [19] by using machine learning algorithms to develop spatially explicit predictions of barrier island habitat based on landscape position information. We found that the flexibility of machine learning algorithms makes them well-suited to predict barrier island habitats. In some cases, the individual parameters followed Gaussian distributions for particular habitats (Figure 6a,b) ; however, the distributions can become complex in the n-dimensional space (Figure 6c) . Furthermore, machine learning algorithms are not concerned with multicollinearity from the predictor variables that could be problematic for traditional models, such as multinomial logistic regression, but instead the main concern with machine learning is how well the model can generalize to new data [50, 53] . The deterministic overall accuracy for the contemporary model was just under 70%, and the fuzzy overall accuracy was just over 80%, whereas the hindcast deterministic overall accuracy was just under 80%, and the fuzzy overall accuracy was over 90%.\nOne challenge with the use of data-driven machine learning algorithms is that the algorithm can only learn relationships that are present in the training dataset. This can be problematic for dynamic environments, such as barrier islands, where habitat transition zones can change rapidly from the impact of an episodic event, such as a storm. The data-driven nature of machine learning algorithms underscores the need for a theoretical basis in the selection of predictor variables, as done with this study. Similarly, the results of a model can be assessed to ensure they comply with our theoretical understanding of barrier island habitats through post-processing routines similar to the ones we utilized. While the post-processing routines we used reduced the accuracies of some classes, the reduction was often associated with a minor increase in omission error. This tradeoff was justified by the overall positive increase in performance (Figure 7 ; Table A5 ) and overall comparison with habitat coverage (i.e., supratidal/upland) in the 2015 habitat map (Figure 8) . In order to reduce issues associated with the data-driven approach, future efforts could aim to augment time for space by developing additional training data from historical habitat maps paired with landscape position information. Additionally, details regarding precedent conditions relating to storminess could be added to such a training dataset using an approach similar to Mickey et al. [54] to characterize storminess for a period. While we used standard presets, a more robust training dataset would allow for model preset optimization. Additionally, variables that pertain to longer-term, larger-scale variables similar to the ones used by Gutierrez et al. [14] , such as island width and historical shoreline erosion rates, could also provide valuable information to improve barrier island habitat models.\nIn addition to utilizing post-processing to refine the models results, the use of fuzzy accuracy also helped better evaluate the performance of a model because of the flexibility to note uncertainties regarding the vegetative state of areas for a given time. For example, some areas were predicted to be intertidal marsh based on landscape position in the hindcast results, yet these areas only had sparse vegetation in the orthophotography used for validation and, at that time, may be more appropriately predicted as intertidal flat instead of intertidal marsh. In other words, an area could be predicted to be intertidal marsh based on landscape position, yet it may not be intertidal marsh at the time of assessment because it often takes time for habitat succession necessary for a marsh to develop [55] . Additionally, because of the data availability there can be a temporal lag between the acquisitions of lidar data used for model development and orthophotography used for model validation. Similarly, moving from a detailed habitat map [28] to a general model based on landscape position information required some generalizations for habitat classes. For instance, the barrier flat habitat model class ( Figure 3 ; Table A1 ) includes a wide spectrum of vegetation levels, from densely vegetated meadow habitat to sparsely vegetated barrier flat [28] . The reason for this type of generalization was because of the difficulty of predicting vegetation succession from a model with landscape position alone, as the vegetation state is largely controlled by exposure to abiotic factors such as inundation and overwash from storm surges. Future research is needed to explore how landscape position and temporal lag from disturbances impact the probability of an area being vegetated.\nWhile there are developed areas on Dauphin Island, we did not incorporate urban growth into our model. We assumed development was constant and excluded these areas from validation. Alternatively, this model framework could be used to predict potential habitat for developed areas based on landscape position. If a researcher is interested in integrating urban growth into this type of model framework, utilizing or calibrating an existing urban growth model, such as the SLEUTH model (Slope, Land cover, Exclusion, Urbanization, Transportation, and Hillshade) similar to Terando et al. [56] , may be desirable.\nWhile our model predictor variables were developed from high-resolution lidar DEMs (i.e., 1 m to 3 m spatial resolution), we opted to use 10 m as the spatial resolution to show how a model could be applied to forecast applications, which can have variable cross-shore and alongshore resolutions [15] . We expect that using a higher resolution model grid would increase the prediction performance for the dune class based on the increased ability to resolve relative topography from higher resolution data. If we were not focused on forecasting, the model framework outlined in this effort could be calibrated with high-resolution data. Similarly, while our effort focused on developing a model to predict habitats from a DEM alone, the landscape position information used in this study could be applied to machine learning algorithms for producing contemporary or historical barrier island habitat maps with remotely sensed imagery and lidar data.\nThe model framework presented here can be calibrated and extended to other islands. While our effort developed a single global model for Dauphin Island, future efforts may explore the utility of developing local models based on wave energy settings and habitat composition. For instance, the orientation of an island could be used as an indicator of the need for a separate model. Dauphin Island is generally parallel to the mainland (i.e., generally east to west), whereas portions of the island run from the northwest to the southeast (Figure 2) . Likewise, topographic state metrics could be used to develop meaningful model zones [18] using methods similar to that of Monge and Stallins [57] .\nThe advantage of developing a model largely based on information that could be extracted from a TBDEM is that such a model can be calibrated and used with numerical models for forecasting alternative future states of an island with accelerated sea-level rise and simulated storms. Landscape position-based habitat models can be coupled with hydrodynamic geomorphology models [15] that incorporate coastal morphodynamics and dune evolution. Collectively, these types of models can provide natural resource managers with tools for predicting the potential future states of these ecosystems with and without management actions (e.g., beach nourishment, dune creation or restoration, and marsh creation or restoration)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our first research question explored whether machine learning algorithms could be used to predict habitat on barrier islands based on landscape position information. We found that commonly used algorithms can predict barrier island habitats with acceptable accuracy and efficiency. The model performances among the KNN, SVM, and RF models were similar for the subtidal zone, but we opted for the KNN model based on a smoother transition from water-estuarine to water-marine. We found that RF was the best model for the intertidal and supratidal/upland zones. The deterministic overall accuracy for the contemporary model was just under 70%, and the fuzzy overall accuracy was just over 80%. For our next research question, we tested whether model performance was enhanced using post-processing routines. While this process introduced some omission error in certain classes, such as water-fresh and dune classes, the post-processing routines, collectively, tended to enhance the model results via increases in accuracy and overall comparison with habitat coverage from the source map used for training data development. For our last question, we explored how well the model would generalize to new data through a hindcast. The hindcast deterministic overall accuracy was just under 80%, and the fuzzy overall accuracy was over 90%. This model framework could be coupled with hydrodynamic geomorphology models that could incorporate coastal morphodynamics and dune evolution for forecasting alternative states of barrier islands with and without various management actions. It could also be used for producing contemporary or historical detailed barrier island habitat maps using remotely sensed imagery and lidar.
