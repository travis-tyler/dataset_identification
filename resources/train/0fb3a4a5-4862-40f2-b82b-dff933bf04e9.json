[{"section_title": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "text": "This report examines change and stability across two decades in the sociodemographic characteristics, educational experiences, and postsecondary outcomes of high school graduates with different occupational coursetaking patterns. Occupational coursetaking is part of the broader field of career and technical education (CTE), which also includes general labor market preparation and family and consumer sciences education courses. Historically, CTE and occupational studies provided low-achieving or academically disengaged students with courses that prepared them for immediate entry into the labor market. However, the expansion of new types of career education within magnet schools, career academies, and traditional high schools, and the increasingly accepted perspective that all students can benefit from training that improves their workplace skills, suggests that the older dichotomies between college-bound academic education and work-oriented occupational preparation are less salient. To examine whether this is the case, this report analyzes three high school cohorts-the graduating classes of 1982, 1992, and 2004-and compares their involvement in CTE and occupational courses, their academic coursetaking and achievement outcomes, and their initial postsecondary school and work experiences. We find that CTE, as measured by occupational coursetaking, has moved from being a clearly delineated vocational track for graduates headed to jobs immediately after high school to an exploratory program for an increasing proportion of both academic and general curriculum graduates. This shift from \"track to field\" involves smaller groups of graduates intensively studying an occupational area and larger groups of graduates earning a few occupational credits. It also coincides with shifts toward more academic coursetaking, improved academic achievement in math, and more involvement in postsecondary education for those with more involvement in occupational preparation. Before describing these findings further, the definitions and methodology for the report are explained."}, {"section_title": "Occupational Coursetaking and Academic Orientation", "text": "CTE participation can be measured a variety of ways, but perhaps the most consistent method is to examine coursetaking in occupational areas. While indicators of participation in specific types of training or education programs such as technical preparation programs or attendance at CTE high schools are valid measures of CTE participation, using coursetaking information (in this report, drawn directly from high school transcripts) permits distinguishing graduates within schools or programs and providing a common metric to compare graduates enrolled in programs or schools that may not be equivalent in terms of resources provided or overall experience. Occupational area courses are those that train students in specific labor market skills for work in fields such as accounting, construction, health care, and others. They differ from general labor market skills (such as keyboarding) that can be used throughout many occupations and from family and consumer science courses (such as home economics) which are intended to provide skills for private life. In this report, occupational courses are divided into 11 areas: 1. Agriculture and Natural Resources; 2. Architecture, Construction, and Science Technology; 3. Business; 4. Communications and Design; 5. Computer and Information Science; 6. Consumer and Culinary Services; 7. Engineering Technologies; 8. Health Sciences; 9. Manufacturing, Repair, and Transportation; 10. Marketing; and 11. Public Services. Using courses defined in these 11 areas, this report groups occupational coursetakers into one of four categories, which are classified into two broad groups, as shown in the exhibit."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit. Occupational Investment Categories", "text": "Noninvestor 1. Nonparticipant: fewer than 1 total occupational credits earned 2. Sampler: 1 to fewer than 3 total occupational credits Investor 3. Explorer: 3 or more total occupational credits, but no single occupational area with 3 or more credits 4. Concentrator: 3 or more total occupational credits in at least one area (i.e., may earn 3 or more credits in more than just one occupational area) Concentration in a single occupational area is a traditional measure of CTE involvement. By concentrating their studies in specific occupational areas, high school graduates may earn specialized skills that are valuable to employers and helpful in preparing for further postsecondary training and education. Such occupational concentration is an indication of sustained or in-depth preparation for work. However, CTE exploration-represented by taking 3 or more credits without concentration-may also serve to signal employers that a graduate is focused on developing occupational skills and may give graduates multiple options for work. Noninvestors (fewer than 3 total occupational credits earned) can be distinguished based on whether they had virtually no participation in occupational courses or had sampled a small number of them. In addition to occupational coursetaking, the credits students earn in academic subjects play a major role in shaping their postsecondary employment and educational opportunities. Traditionally, a focus on academic studies was seen as exclusive from CTE participation, and vice versa. However, because many states have raised academic requirements for graduation over the past decades, recent graduates with an occupational concentration may also have an academic focus in their other studies. Therefore, this report divides graduates into academic and general education groups, and compares occupational investors and noninvestors along this"}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Total credits earned in CTE courses and occupation-specific courses declined between", "text": "1982 and 1992; no differences were observed between 1992 and 2004. The number of CTE credits earned by graduates declined from 4.6 credits in 1982 to 3.9 credits in 1992, remaining stable at 3.8 credits among 2004 graduates. Occupational area credits made up the bulk of CTE credits earned by each cohort. Among specific occupational program areas, graduates earned fewer total credits in business; marketing; and manufacture, repair, and transportation. In computer and information science, however, the average number of credits earned increased from 0.1 to 0.4 between the 1982 cohort and the 2004 cohort. \u2022 The percentage of graduates taking occupational courses at low levels increased over time, while occupational concentration became less common ( figure A). At the same time that overall CTE and occupational coursetaking declined across graduating cohorts, graduates increasingly spread their occupational coursetaking across multiple areas of study. The percent of graduates earning 1 to 2 credits in occupational courses grew from 36 percent in 1982 to 42 percent in 2004, and the percent of graduates earning 3 or more credits (but without concentrating) grew from 16 to 21 percent during the same period. However, the percent of graduates earning 3 or more credits in one occupational area declined from 30 percent to 17 percent from 1982 to 2004. NOTE: Non-participants earned zero or less than 1 total occupational credits (Carnegie units); samplers earned 1 to less than 3 total occupational credits. Explorers earned 3 or more total occupational credits but did not concentrate in an occupational area. Concentrators earned 3 or more credits in at least one occupational area. Graduates with an academic focus earned at least 4 credits in English and 3 credits each in mathematics, science, and social studies; graduates with a general education focus did not meet these requirements. A Carnegie unit is equivalent to a course taken for one period each day for one full school year. \u2022 Comparing students with an academic focus to those taking a general education curriculum, we find that their CTE involvement has converged. In 1982, these two groups of students were very different in occupational coursetaking patterns. In 2004, they were almost identical. For example, 10 percent of 1982 academic focus graduates were occupational concentrators, while 33 percent of general education graduates were concentrators. In 2004, however, the percentages were 17 and 18 percent, respectively. \u2022 Increases in academic credits earned were associated with decreases in CTE or occupational credits earned. Each additional math or science credit earned by graduates was associated with up to 1 fewer CTE credit or 1 fewer occupational credit. However, tradeoffs between CTE or occupational credits and academic credits were weaker in 2004 compared with earlier years. For example, the effect of an additional science course on occupation-specific coursetaking in 2004 (-0.31) was less than half of what it was in 1982 (-0.71). (These results are based on bivariate regressions that estimate the average change in CTE or occupational area credits for each change in an academic credit earned.) \u2022"}, {"section_title": "The most common occupation-specific course in 1982 and 1992 was accounting 1, with 16 and 17 percent of graduates having earned credit in it, respectively.

A Carnegie unit is equivalent to a course taken for one period each day for one full school year. Although most occupational coursetaking groups made gains in terms of their initial postsecondary participation rates, they display varied patterns of increase (or stability) across the three studied time points. Rates for occupational concentrators increased steadily from 50 percent in 1984 to 58 percent in 1994 and 70 percent in 2006. The percent of occupational explorers and occupational samplers with initial postsecondary attendance increased from 1984 to 1994, but show no statistically significant differences between 1994 and 2006. Finally, the corresponding rates for occupational nonparticipants show no statistically significant differences between any of these points in time (in mid-to upper-80s in all years). The overall numbers from figure 4 are presented in table 20 along with distributions for academic focus and general education curriculum graduates. Gains in initial postsecondary participation rates were seen primarily among high school graduates with a general education focus: rates for occupational explorers with a general education focus rose from 59 percent in 1984 to 67 percent in 1994 (and remained steady at 69 percent in 2006); rates for occupational concentrators with a general education focus were 49 percent in 1984 and 50 percent in 1994, but had risen to 65 percent by 2006. Despite the gains made by occupational investors (especially by those with a general education focus), their rates lagged behind those of noninvestors at each studied time point. For example, rates for occupational concentrators were lower than those of occupational nonparticipants in 1984 (50 versus 84 percent), 1994 (58 versus 88 percent), and 2006 (78 versus 87 percent). Full-time Attendance Among College Attendees \u2022 Rates of full-time attendance were fairly stable over time for all occupational coursetaking groups; however, within each cohort, occupational investors were generally less likely to attend full-time than were noninvestors. Table 21 provides additional detail on the initial postsecondary experiences of these three cohorts by characterizing the enrollment intensity of high school graduates who attended a postsecondary institution. Rates of initial full-time attendance were stable over time for all occupational coursetaking groups, with the exception of one statistically significant difference (80 percent of occupational explorers attended full-time by 1984, while 86 percent of occupational explorers did so by 2006). Although enrollment intensity was, by and large, consistent over time within occupational coursetaking groups, there are significant differences across occupational coursetaking groups. Generally speaking, occupational investors who attended college were less likely to attend full-time than were noninvestors; for example, rates of initial full-time attendance for occupational concentrators were lower than those of occupational nonparticipants in all years (e.g., 82 versus 90 percent in 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Graduating Class", "text": "Non-participants Samplers Explorers Concentrators NOTE: Non-participants earned zero or less than 1 total occupational credits (Carnegie units); samplers earned 1 to less than 3 total occupational credits.

Occupational studies are part of the broader field of career and technical education (CTE), which also includes general labor market preparation and family and consumer sciences education. Historically, CTE (formerly known as vocational education) 1 has been treated as a separate component of the overall high school curriculum, providing low-achieving students with courses that prepared them for careers in non-college jobs (Hyslop-Margison 2001; Tanner and Tanner 1980). These courses, often taken at the expense of more advanced academic courses, typically provided little academic content or even challenge to students. Over the past few decades, however, there have been a number of policy and economic changes that have altered the scope and delivery of CTE: high schools have increasingly adapted their curricula to meet the demands and requirements of state and national testing regimes, most notably those imposed by the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation; CTE programs have been increasingly expected to integrate academic skills and concepts with occupational ones so that students are prepared for additional postsecondary training as well as the workforce; and the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-and technology-based one has placed a heightened premium on communication, computer, and quantitative skills. With these changes taking place, new cohorts of CTE students may increasingly resemble their academically focused peers in coursetaking patterns, high school experiences, and postsecondary destinations. Indeed, this process may already be reflected in the most recent groups of CTE students. To examine this possibility, this report uses national longitudinal datasets that track the secondary and postsecondary experiences of three cohorts of high school graduates-the classes of 1982, 1992, and 2004. These three studies provide information on the depth and extent of CTE participation, both independently and in relation to academic subjects; on the personal background of graduates; on high school experiences and achievement outcomes; and on initial postsecondary education and employment experiences. Key to the usefulness of this study compared with other studies of trends in CTE (Levesque et al. 2008;Silverberg et al. 2004) is the use of detailed high school transcript data that enables precise descriptions of CTE coursetaking. This report begins with a brief overview of changes in the CTE policy environment and the economy between 1980 and 2006. This will be organized temporally around the three cohorts 1 In 1998, the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act began the process of replacing the term \"vocational\" with CTE to emphasize the difference between new curricula that integrate academic and occupational skills and older curricula that focused on workplace preparation for non-college jobs. In addition to changing use among government agencies (e.g., Levesque et al. 2008), professional associations and research organizations have also revised their names to reflect the CTE nomenclature (e.g., the National Centers for Career and Technical Education and the Association for Career and Technical Education). to provide context for interpreting the results. In the next chapter, the three data sets and key measures will be described. Following this, the findings for five topic areas will be presented in separate chapters: participation in CTE, academic and occupational coursetaking, math achievement, initial postsecondary education, and initial postsecondary employment experiences. The report will conclude with a brief discussion of the key findings."}, {"section_title": "Background Three Cohorts and Three Different Environments", "text": "Since 1972, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has sponsored a series of longitudinal studies that examine the experiences, attitudes, and achievement of high school students and their transition to young adulthood, postsecondary education, and work. 2 This report uses data from the following three studies in this series: The three studies represent the graduating classes of 1982, 1992, and 2004. Across the three decades during which these studies took place, there were a number of educational policy and economic changes that have direct implications for students who concentrate in CTE. This section briefly details these changes as a backdrop for understanding change and stability in CTE at the student level-the focus of the present report."}, {"section_title": "The Class of 1982", "text": "Secondary education during the bulk of the 20th century was organized and largely functioned as a way to \"sort\" students into different life pathways, with the major educational distinction being between a college-bound and non-college-bound pathway. High school vocational education served to educate non-college-bound students with skills and training for the challenges that they would face when taking jobs in local factories, farms, and offices. Students were to be selected and narrowly oriented to industrial or agricultural training (Hyslop-Margison 2001). At the same time, postsecondary apprenticeships, industrial training programs, and college programs provided further education for occupationally oriented students, particularly through agricultural and mechanical schools whose historical mission was occupational training (versus not liberal arts studies that were often the province of major public universities or private colleges). Educational extension programs supported this postsecondary system by pushing agricultural training to rural areas where higher education access was limited. 2 The first study in the NCES series was the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS:72). Results from this study are not examined as part of the current report because high school transcripts were not collected from its sample of seniors. Therefore, a reliable and cohort-comparable determination about CTE participation is not possible from the NLS:72 data. In both the secondary and postsecondary settings, the educational model was one of training for efficiency and productivity in specific industrial, agricultural, and, less frequently, service jobs (including homemaking). Over time, and particularly as World War II facilitated increasing complexity in the labor market, the model of vocational training expanded to incorporate a broader set of occupations and to involve notions of long-term career preparation as well as more immediate skills development (Tanner and Tanner 1980). Organizations such as the National Education Association began to advocate for broad vocational curricula to develop employable skills among a range of students. During this period, and through the present day, arguments about the relationship between academic and occupational training-whether they should or should not be integrated, with the former being the commonly accepted position today-developed in full. The post-war economic environment that saw American industrial and financial dominance through the 1960s experienced sudden shocks in the 1970s, involving substantial changes to the international monetary regime, increased insecurity in energy supplies, and periods of low growth and high inflation (including economic recession during the first years of the 1980s). These experiences and the economic changes they ushered in, coupled with the revitalization of strongly competitive national economies in Europe and Japan, culminated in an overriding concern about U.S. student outcomes compared to international performance. The National Commission on Excellence in Education published the most high-profile report, A Nation at Risk (1983), exhibiting this concern. The report challenged the presumption that American schools could keep pace with a changing national and global economy and argued for increased academic course requirements for high school graduation as a remedy (Johnston and Packer 1987). The high school class of 1982 completed their secondary education and entered postsecondary work and educational life during this period of economic and educational transition. The concerns that prompted A Nation at Risk and other reports of its kind resulted in an increased emphasis on academics and, for CTE in particular, an increased focus on incorporating academic with occupational content. Nevertheless, the class of 1982 experienced most of their high school curriculum and any CTE under the older historical regime of occupational skills training and career preparation, with less emphasis on achievement in academic subjects. This group of graduates emerged as one of the last to experience a clear and sharp distinction between academics and career preparation, and emerged at the end of a difficult social, economic, and political period."}, {"section_title": "The Class of 1992", "text": "Following the economic challenges of the 1970s and new education policy efforts in the wake of A Nation at Risk, studies and reports continued to emphasize academic requirements while extending critiques of the weak workplace skills that students were obtaining through their education (Castellano, Stringfield, and Stone 2002; Murnane and Levy 1996; Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 1991). Like historical debates about education in general and CTE specifically, these debates helped produce new legislation mandating more academic skills training and introducing novel CTE programs. This new legislation, however, instituted greater changes than prior efforts. For most of the 20th century, federal legislation played a limited role in influencing actual CTE practices, because federal funds supplied to schools were generally minor. Federal involvement in CTE has roots as far back as the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, but a significant change in direction and involvement emerged with the passage of the Carl D. Perkins Act of 1990, commonly referred to as Perkins II. (The first Carl D. Perkins Act, or Perkins I, was passed in 1984, but had a more restricted scope and substantially less funding.) Perkins II required vocational programs receiving federal funding to place greater emphasis on both work experience and academic coursetaking. Technical preparation programs (or \"tech prep\"), envisioned as structured high school-to-community college educational sequences, were a major component (Parnell 1985;Prager 1994). The last 2 years of high school would focus on academics in applied and work-related settings, followed by enrollment in a 2-year postsecondary school, where students would develop the in-depth technical knowledge required for full-time work. Under this model, postsecondary courses would be aligned with high school courses. The academic emphasis in high school was also to be realized by integrating academic material with vocational applications. At the same time, the economic climate of the 1980s and early 1990s supported trends seen from the 1970s, particularly in a move away from labor-intensive industrial manufacturing and toward both personal/consumer service and professional service occupations. In contrast to the 1970s, however, the fall of Soviet-backed communism between 1989 and 1991 was accompanied by a revitalization of American economic preeminence, although international economic integration (i.e., globalization) also continued to grow and present both threats and opportunities to U.S. industries. Thus the high school class of 1992, as did the class of 1982, graduated toward the end of one economic and political era and the beginning of another. Educational policy and economic opportunities had both shifted substantially, yet the federal government had only recently begun to direct significant resources to CTE through the passage of Perkins II in 1990. The class of 1992 also came of age well after the mid-1980s push toward increased academic requirements for high school graduation, which might be expected to have affected both occupational and nonoccupational students."}, {"section_title": "The Class of 2004", "text": "Federal education legislation continued to play a large role in shaping CTE in the 12 years between 1992 and 2004. Perkins II was followed in 1994 by the School to Work Opportunities Act (STWOA). STWOA continued to emphasize academic goals but placed additional emphasis on providing high school students with relevant work-related experience, career awareness activities, and other work-based involvement. Career days, internships, schoolbased enterprises, and job shadowing were some of the work-related activities STWOA stressed. Four years later, in 1998, Congress reauthorized Perkins II as Perkins III, with a number of modifications. Perkins III sought flexibility so that the legislation could accommodate the varied educational reform goals that states were trying to implement. The Act funded programs that, among other things, involved parents and employers in vocational education efforts, developed the use of advanced technology in training, and provided professional development for teachers and administrators. Continuing emphasis was placed on ensuring that vocational students received rigorous academic instruction while at the same time providing students with work-related experiences. In addition to Perkins III, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act was signed into law in 2002. NCLB codified the move toward test-based accountability, particularly for schools serving students in grades 1 through 8. NCLB principles would find expression in a subsequent reauthorization of the Perkins Act (see below), but this legislation came too late (and was not specifically geared to reshape CTE) to affect the experiences of the 2004 class of graduates, most of whom were finishing their sophomore year as NCLB was instituted. The economic climate shaping the class of 2004 was perhaps the brightest experienced by any of the three cohorts studied here, with substantial economic growth in the late 1990s and generally stable labor markets and low inflation through 2004. The political climate was strongly shaped by attacks by radical Islamic terrorists on September 11, 2001, but unlike some prior political foci (e.g., concerns about the Soviet Union's technical advancements in the 1950s, or the rise of re-industrialized Germany and Japan in the 1980s), this element of broader societal concern did not result in substantial organizational or funding changes to the educational system."}, {"section_title": "Current CTE Policy", "text": "A final word is worth mentioning about educational policy changes subsequent to 2004. Perkins III was reauthorized by Congress in 2006, as Perkins IV. Following the passage of the NCLB Act, Perkins IV emphasizes even further the academic outcomes and the reporting and measurement of CTE outcomes. For example, Perkins IV frequently uses terms such as \"rigorous and challenging\" to describe the academic and technical instruction that it is designed to support; other language explicitly addresses the mathematics and science content that is often necessary for successful technical training. It also requires states to provide indicators of their postsecondary CTE program activities. Additional differences include greater emphasis on training and professional development for teachers and administrators and a reemphasis on the linkage between postsecondary and secondary curriculum such as requiring states to consult with postsecondary practitioners in developing secondary CTE programs. Governed by Perkins IV, the current federal climate supports a wide variety of both recurring and novel CTE programs and activities within the broader policy context of accountability (principally state reporting of CTE outcomes) and the backdrop of concerns about preparation for high-skill jobs in a globally competitive economy. Despite some changes, the policy goal that emerged in the early and mid-1980s-increasing academic achievement for CTE students-remains a focus of educational policy."}, {"section_title": "Goals and Organization of the Current Report", "text": "As noted, the goal of the current report is to examine change and stability across three decades among high school graduates with an investment in occupational studies. In particular, the report will try to answer the following questions: 1. Has participation in CTE changed over time? Has the composition of graduates who focus on occupational coursetaking changed over time? 2. What specific changes in CTE coursetaking can be observed? How do these changes relate to changes in academic subject coursetaking? 3. Have there been any changes in the academic achievement of occupational investors over time? How have any changes compared to the academic achievement of noninvestors? 4. What are the initial postsecondary educational and employment experiences of occupational investors, and how have they changed over time? Because of the shared content of the three studies that form the basis for investigation, special focus will be placed on the mathematics coursetaking and achievement of CTE students. These areas are both available for in-depth study across the three studies, and they represent particular areas of interest amidst an increasingly technological global economic environment. The rest of the report is organized into 7 chapters (chapters 2 through 8). Chapter 2 provides an overview of the data and methods used in the report. This chapter describes the general design and properties of the data that form the basis of this report and discusses the sample selected from each of these studies for these analyses. Because high school transcripts are the basis for the main variables, the organization and coding of CTE courses is described as well. Finally, chapter 2 discusses the decisions that result in the two major classifications used throughout the report: occupational investment and academic orientation. Chapters 3 through 8 present the substantive findings in five topic areas: participation in CTE, academic and occupational coursetaking, math achievement, postsecondary education, and postsecondary employment. Chapter 3, Participation in CTE, includes summary information about occupational coursetaking, occupational area concentration, academic subject coursetaking, and breakdowns of the percentage of graduates in each occupational coursetaking group and academic orientation group by student characteristics such as sex, race, and socioeconomic status, and by school attributes such as urbanicity and student body size. Chapter 4, Academic and Occupational Coursetaking, consists of two parts. The first presents information about the academic courses taken by occupational investors and noninvestors, with a special focus on math and science, as well as information on the most common CTE courses taken by all graduates. The second part of chapter 4 consists of an analysis of whether CTE coursetaking involves \"trading\" or substituting CTE courses for academic courses. Chapter 5, Math Achievement, documents changes in the math achievement scores of occupational investors and noninvestors. Because HS&B does not contain separate mathematics achievement scores, only NELS:88 and ELS:2002 (1992 and 2004 graduates, respectively) will be used in these comparisons. Chapter 6, Postsecondary Education, analyzes senior-year educational expectations and initial postsecondary education enrollment. This chapter and chapter 7 use data obtained about experiences in the first 2 years after graduation, because the full postsecondary record is not available for 2004 graduates at the current time. However, the first 2 years after graduation are a key transition period between high school completion and eventual postsecondary outcomes. Chapter 7, Postsecondary Employment, examines senior-year occupational expectations, senior-year work goals, and senior-year work experiences, in addition to information about first job type and number of months employed since graduation (for non-college attendees). Also, because certain occupational areas of CTE have traditionally been dominated by males or females, this chapter will examine the proportion of males and females whose first job is in a field majority-occupied by the opposite sex. Finally, chapter 8 concludes the main part of the report with a brief discussion of the key findings. Appendices provide additional information about the design and conduct of the three studies; the analysis methods used in the report; a glossary of variables; tables for the standard errors (measures of precision) of the estimates reported in the main text; findings from a multivariate achievement analysis that extends previous work on the class of 2004 to the class of 1992; and a listing of course codes in CTE, occupational, and academic subjects."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": "This chapter describes the overall purpose and design of the three studies used as the basis for this report, the samples selected from each study, the high school transcript data, the course taxonomy that identifies academic and CTE courses, and the definitions of the principal organizing variables used throughout the report (occupational investment and academic orientation)."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The three primary sources of data for the estimates presented in this report are part of a series of high school longitudinal studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics ( All three studies share similar designs that enable cross-study comparability; three features are key. First, all three studies began with a base-year cohort and subsequently surveyed that cohort at 2-year intervals, for varying numbers of follow-ups. The base-year cohorts of HS&B and ELS:2002 were each a nationally representative sample of high school sophomores; the base-year cohort for NELS:88 was a nationally representative sample of 8th-graders, but the sample was re-surveyed and augmented in the subsequent wave to obtain a representative sample of sophomores. Each study resurveyed its sample members in the spring term of the senior year of high school, as well as 2 years after graduation (the number and timing of other follow-ups varied among studies). In addition, each study gathered and systematically coded high school transcripts from a portion of senior-year sample members. Therefore, all three studies have survey data with matching time frames. Second, both NELS:88 and ELS:2002 survey designs and instruments were constructed to closely match, and at times replicate, procedures and items used in HS&B. Further, variables constructed for released datasets were designed to replicate composite variables available in each previous study. This includes constructed items such as mathematics test scores (available for NELS:88 and ELS:2002), attitudinal questions, questions about educational and occupational expectations, and questions about postsecondary experiences. In the high school transcript studies, coding of transcript courses and course information (e.g., standardized grade earned) followed similar procedures across HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002, with an eye to facilitating reliable historical comparisons. Third, each study enables the creation of an analytical sample representing a high school graduating class. For NELS:88 and ELS:2002, additional sample members were added to the senior-year follow-ups to ensure a nationally representative grade cohort of 12th-graders. For ELS:2002, this means that additional seniors were added to obtain a representative sample of the senior class of 2004; for NELS:88, additional seniors were surveyed to obtain a nationally representative sample of the senior class of 1992. HS&B was not \"freshened\" in a similar manner, but available variables on the HS&B dataset allow filtering the original sophomore cohort to identify a similar group of eligible seniors (see appendix A for more information). With appropriate filters for graduation dates, these senior-year samples are representative of the graduating class of their respective year. Specifically, the analysis sample from each survey was restricted to sample members who were public high school graduates in each senior year (regardless of when originally surveyed) and had a complete set of transcripts. Although each study includes students in both public and private high schools, all analyses in this report are based on public school students for whom the CTE legislation is most applicable. High school graduates were defined as sample members who graduated with an honors or standard diploma no earlier than September of the year prior to senior year (thus excluding a small number of early graduates) and no later than the end of the summer (August 31) of their graduating year (1982 for HS&B, 1992 for NELS:88, and 2004 for ELS:2002 graduates). A complete transcript was defined as one that recorded 16 or more Carnegie units, 4 with a positive, nonzero number of credits completed in English. These criteria for defining the analysis samples also served to make them comparable across the different years and studies. In the following sections, each study is described in further detail, and the specific samples used in the current report detailed. For additional information about each of the studies, see appendix A."}, {"section_title": "HS&B", "text": "The HS&B longitudinal survey was first administered in 1980 to a stratified, nationally representative sample of approximately 30,000 high school sophomores and 28,000 high school seniors from more than 1,000 high schools. Follow-up surveys were administered in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1992. This report used the 1980 sophomore cohort sample. As part of the first followup study, conducted in 1982, high school transcripts were collected for a probability subsample of 18,500 members of the 1980 sophomore cohort. For this report, the demographic characteristics of the 1982 graduates were drawn from the first follow-up data file, and their coursetaking information was drawn from the transcript data file; information about initial postsecondary experiences comes from the second follow-up conducted in 1984. The analysis sample included approximately 6,500 sophomores who graduated from public high schools in 1982 and had complete transcripts."}, {"section_title": "NELS:88", "text": "The NELS:88 base-year survey was administered in 1988 to about 24,000 8th-graders in more than 1,000 schools. The first and second follow-ups revisited the same sample of students in 1990 and 1992, when most of the 1988 8th-graders were in the 10th grade and 12th grade, respectively; then for the third and fourth times in 1994 and 2000, which were 2 and 8 years after their scheduled graduation from high school. Unlike HS&B, for each in-school follow-up (i.e., 1990 and 1992), the student sample was \"freshened\" or augmented to obtain a representative, cross-sectional grade-cohort (i.e., 10th-graders in 1990 and 12th-graders in 1992). In addition, as a part of the second follow-up, high school transcripts were collected for all students attending a subset of second follow-up schools selected for the transcript study. For this report, the demographic characteristics of 1992 high school graduates came from the NELS:88 second follow-up data file, and their coursetaking information from the survey's transcript data file. Information about initial postsecondary experiences comes from the third follow-up conducted in 1994. The analysis sample was drawn from the transcript sample.

Additionally, high school transcripts were collected from sample members who participated in either the base-year or first follow-up wave. Demographic information used in this report comes from the first follow-up data file; transcript information from the transcript file; and initial postsecondary experiences from the second follow-up survey. Of the approximately 10,500 public school respondents for whom transcripts were obtained, about 8,600 were identified as public high school graduates with complete transcripts."}, {"section_title": "Subject Area Classification", "text": "The high school transcript studies collected and coded course-by-course information from each sample member, including information such as course title, course grade, credit earned, year in which course was taken, and grade in which course was taken. Credits earned were standardized across transcripts, and courses with a failing grade assigned zero credits. Course titles were also coded into a standard classification scheme, the Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) codes. The CSSC codes are a set of six-digit numerical codes originally developed for the transcript component of the HS&B study. Since the collection of transcripts for HS&B, many changes have occurred in the high school curriculum, most notably the addition of computer/technology-based courses and increasing diversification among advanced courses, such as Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) courses for older subjects. The CSSC codes were updated for NELS:88 and ELS:2002 to accommodate these new courses appearing on transcripts. Because the CSSC codes represent a coding system (i.e., to identify the same courses even if transcripts use varying titles) and not an organizing scheme (i.e., defining which courses are part of the same subject or area of study), the National Assessment of Vocational Education worked to develop the Secondary School Taxonomy (SST) in 1987 as a means to classify subject areas using the CSSC codes. This taxonomy was itself expanded and updated in 1998 , and the CTE portion updated in 2008 . At its highest (most aggregated) level, the SST divides high school coursework into four distinct curricula: academic, career and technical education (CTE), enrichment/other, and special education. Special education courses are not included in this analysis. Enrichment courses include subjects such as physical education, religion, and military training; they are summarized initially but are otherwise not examined in the report. The academic curriculum contains six subject areas: mathematics, science, English, social studies, fine arts, and non-English (i.e., foreign) language. Finally, the CTE curriculum contains three subject areas: family and consumer sciences education (FCSE), general labor market preparation (GLMP), and specific labor market preparation (SLMP) or occupational education. FCSE courses prepare students for family and consumer roles outside the paid labor market. GLMP courses teach general employment skills that are not specific to one occupational area, such as keyboarding/typing, basic computer literacy, and general work experience courses. Occupational (SLMP) courses are designed to prepare students for work in a specific occupational field or for a related program of study in college. The SST contains a taxonomy of occupational courses, but for the purposes of this report, which include maintaining consistency with studies of postsecondary career choices, a career cluster taxonomy was employed instead . Subject areas in this taxonomy are mutually exclusive. Therefore, a course that is classified as an academic course cannot be classified as a CTE course (or vice versa). The career cluster taxonomy used in this report organizes occupational courses into one of 11 areas by combining some less-common courses into a single area (particularly public services courses, which include education, legal, and public safety courses) and separating other courses into separate areas (such as separating engineering technologies from architecture, construction, and science technology). The career cluster taxonomy comprises the following course areas: 1. Agriculture and Natural Resources; 2. Architecture, Construction, and Science Technology; 3. Business; 4. Communications and Design; 5. Computer and Information Science; 6. Consumer and Culinary Services; 7. Engineering Technologies; 8. Health Sciences; 9. Manufacturing, Repair, and Transportation; 10. Marketing; and 11. Public Services. The courses and course codes that comprise these subject areas are listed in appendix D. Because FCSE and GLMP courses are not linked to specific occupational and/or postsecondary pathways, this analysis focuses on the occupational component of CTE. Without an explicit connection to occupational programs of study encouraged in the recent CTE legislation, FCSE and GLMP courses are less central in understanding key trends in career and technical education."}, {"section_title": "Defining Occupational Investment and Academic Orientation", "text": "The main organizing variables for most tables in this report rely on classifications of graduates by (1) occupational investment and (2) academic orientation (academic or general education). This section describes the choices available in constructing these two variables and the definitions used in this report. Substantive discussion about occupational investment and academic focus is presented in chapter 3; the focus here is on definitional and methodological issues."}, {"section_title": "Occupational Investment", "text": "Student involvement in CTE can be measured in a variety of ways. Participation in specific CTE programs, enrollment in certain types of high schools, and coursetaking experiences may all be used, independently or jointly, to define CTE students. Programmatic participation or enrollment in high schools identified as vocational or technical has the advantage of being a straightforward, yes-or-no indicator of student involvement. However, variations across schools, districts, and states in the definitions, requirements, and practices of CTE programs or high schools makes it very difficult to ensure that a common standard for CTE student involvement is being applied. Gathering the information necessary to make such judgments would be an extensive task. In the context of the broader scope of the NCES high school longitudinal studies, such an effort was not made, and so information about schools' CTE programs and high school classification is limited to general questions posed to administrators or counselors (such as, \"does your school offer a technical preparation program?\") or inclusion of existing state-provided information about high school type (recorded in NCES' Common Core of Data). 5 Therefore, these two sources of information cannot be used to provide reliable judgments about individual student participation in CTE. Career and technical education coursetaking data may provide much greater detail about student participation in CTE. A list of specific courses, as is found on transcripts, enables the construction of measures that mark fine distinctions in the intensity of CTE involvement. The principal disadvantages with coursetaking information, however, are the difficulty of gathering and standardizing transcript information, and the lack of information about what other educational supports a CTE student might be receiving as part of his or her schooling (e.g., whether the student is engaged in a school-based business enterprise, or whether the student participates in [noncredit] apprenticeships or work training). 6 The first of these disadvantages has 5 The National Longitudinal Study of Youth in 1997 (NLSY-1997) provides a student-based, questionnaire-derived approach to determining CTE participation from programmatic involvement (see, e.g., Stone and Aliaga 2003). 6 An additional disadvantage is lack of information about the quality or content of labeled courses. Transcript information, by definition, includes only course titles. These titles may represent courses with varying content, teaching approaches, and instructional efficacy. In the context of occupational concentration, where the purpose is to been addressed in NCES' high school longitudinal studies: extensive efforts were made to collect high school transcripts directly from schools and school systems, to classify courses using standard coding schemes (the CSSC codes, discussed above), and to standardize the grades and credit measures provided on transcripts so that courses taken by students from different schools, districts, and states can be compared. Although the second issue, programmatic participation, is not explicitly captured by transcript information, some such participation is codified as earned credits and would, in fact, be captured on transcripts. Further, most programs involve substantial coursetaking components, so that coursetaking represents most of the program's commitment. These considerations make transcript data among the most valid and reliable indicators of CTE participation. The fine degree of data obtainable from transcripts presents other challenges, however. Students may be classed as CTE participants or occupational investors based on any given number of credits chosen, or CTE credits can be used in continuous form, without reference to a level that marks CTE versus non-CTE involvement (e.g. Hoachlander, Kaufman, and Levesque 1992). The latter may be most appropriate when analysis seeks to understand CTE as a component of a set of factors affecting secondary and postsecondary achievement and attainment-for example, when conducting a regression analysis whose procedures can use the full range of student variation in CTE coursetaking in its equations. For descriptive analysis, however, continuous measures may be problematic, because their representation as averages can mask substantial variation within the population and overstate the influence of outliers (i.e., particularly high or particularly low values). In addition, continuous measures that do not reference an agreed-upon level of CTE participation are less well suited to answering questions about explicit levels of participation and their influence. Policymaking and planning require common standards that can be measured across groups and jurisdictions, and here specific, concrete levels of coursetaking are most useful. Finally, a continuous measure of CTE coursetaking may neglect a crucial substantive distinction between students who take similar numbers of CTE courses: some students may spread CTE coursetaking among numerous types of CTE courses, while other students may concentrate their studies in a specific field. Concentration in a field of study may be particularly important for postsecondary work opportunities. A single continuous measure does not capture that distinction. In light of these considerations, this report measures CTE participation on the basis of transcript coursetaking and uses a comprehensive categorization of CTE involvement that (a) distinguishes levels of involvement overall and (b) distinguishes diffuse coursetaking from focused coursetaking in specific fields of study. Because this categorization is based on occupational coursetaking in the 11 areas described earlier, it also distinguishes occupationally relevant coursetaking from general labor market courses that may be as valuable to collegebound graduates as to workforce-bound graduates and from family and consumer sciences courses that may be of general interest to many students, and which may include coursetaking among students who do not plan to enter the labor force. identify a set of similar courses to distinguish occupational specializers from those without such specialization, some of these individual course content differences may be less salient. However, the impact of such variation on classifications of CTE participation is not currently well understood. Therefore, graduates are placed in one of four occupational coursetaking categories, which are classified into two broad \"investment\" groups, as shown in exhibit 1."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit 1. Occupational Investment Categories", "text": "Noninvestor 1. Nonparticipant: fewer than 1 total occupational credits earned 2. Sampler: 1 to fewer than 3 total occupational credits Investor 3. Explorer: 3 or more total occupational credits, but no single occupational area with 3 or more credits 4. Concentrator: 3 or more total occupational credits in at least one area (i.e., may earn 3 or more credits in more than just one occupational area) In chapter 3, detailed breakdowns of total CTE coursetaking, total occupational coursetaking, and occupational coursetaking concentration will be provided as a prelude to breakdowns by the occupational coursetaking categories listed above. Subsequent chapters will use the four-category classification in presentation of results. These categories and their labels derive from prior studies in CTE. Arum and Shavit (1995) used the terms \"samplers\" and \"nonparticipants,\" in addition to \"concentrator.\" \"Explorer\" and the broad groupings \"noninvestor/investor,\" in addition to the same definition of occupational concentrator used in the current report, are terms used in the 2004 National Assessment of Vocational Education report (Silverberg et al. 2004). The three-credit definition of occupational concentration is the historical definition used in several key NCES reports (Levesque 2003a(Levesque , 2003bLevesque et al. 1995Levesque et al. , 2000Levesque et al. , 2008, and therefore its use allows comparisons to results from other studies using the same definition. The main alternative definition for occupational concentration is a two-credit definition. 7 This definition may be appropriate because of the degree to which occupational and academic coursetaking is being increasingly integrated, and the degree to which occupational and academic skills are both seen as valuable, meaning that occupational concentration alone (i.e., even three or more credits in one area) may not be enough to signal potential employers about the level of preparation of graduates. Nevertheless, as will be seen in chapter 3, the spread of occupational coursetaking among more types of students means that such a two-credit definition likely includes many 7 Other values for occupational concentration may be viable, but suffer additional problems compared with either the two-or three-credit definition. Fractional definitions (e.g., 2.5 credits) could be a good alternative, but because the basic unit of instruction is a daily, year-long credit equivalent (the Carnegie unit), the opportunity for individual students to obtain fractional credits to meet this definition may be limited, and employers or postsecondary schools may find it less than appealing as a standard. Second, as will be shown in chapter 3, a higher credit threshold such as four credits implies that occupational concentrators must decide to pursue concentrations before entering ninth grade, or otherwise take multiple courses in a single area in a single year, which could be difficult given time constraints or the availability of courses. students who took two courses in a particular area out of interest or coincidence, rather than an intent to specialize or because of programmatic CTE involvement."}, {"section_title": "Academic Orientation", "text": "Academic coursetaking has also been used to distinguish CTE participants from nonparticipants. Traditionally, students have been divided into three groups: those with an academic (college-bound) focus, those with a general education focus but with a vocational focus, and those general education students without a vocational focus. Academic focus graduates would be those who earned a specified number of credits in each of several academic subjects; those who did not would be assigned a general education focus. Depending on the purposes of research or reporting, those with both an academic focus and occupational concentration, while expected to be few, could be placed in either the academic group or the occupational concentration-with-general education group. However, as indicated, academic orientation is not distinct from occupational concentration-a graduate could fall into both groups. The distinction also has less meaning as academic requirements for graduation have increased (requiring many occupational concentrators to increase their academic coursetaking) and occupational coursetaking has become more widespread (introducing more traditional \"academic focus\" students into occupational coursetaking and concentration), as chapter 3 will show. Finally, comparing graduates only in their level of occupational investment may miss critical differences between occupational coursetaking investors with an academic focus and those with a general education focus. Therefore, in the current report, most tables report results that identify both occupational investment and academic orientation, yielding eight groups: four groups of occupational coursetaking involvement crossed by academic focus or general education focus. As chapter 3 will show, most occupational investors are general education students, particularly in earlier graduating cohorts, and most noninvestors are academic focus students. However, the increasing overlap in these groups means that, in 2004, there were substantial proportions of graduates in the nontraditional groups. Distinguishing among these groups allows examination of whether graduates in these growing categories have different characteristics than graduates of traditional groups. To define academic orientation, we use the commonly cited \"New Basics\" standards outlined in the influential A Nation at Risk report (National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983). These requirements are \u2022 4 credits in English; \u2022 3 credits in math; \u2022 3 credits in science; and \u2022 3 credits in social studies. Other standards might be used to defined \"academic focus,\" but this definition is a widespread and historically significant one. However, one notable consequence of using this definition is that, because of its influence on policy and the timing of its publication between the 1982 graduating class and the 1992 and 2004 graduating classes studied here, there is a marked increase in the percentage of graduates meeting this requirement between the 1982 and 1992 classes. While 14 percent of graduates in 1982 met the academic focus requirements, fully 47 percent met them in 1992, although this declined to 40 percent in 2004. Another standarddeveloped by Levesque et al. (2008) and reflecting preparation for 4-year college enrollment-is used in chapter 4 to help provide another perspective on the academic orientation of graduates. This standard requires fewer total credits in science and social studies, but adds credit requirements in foreign language and specifies that credits in math, science, and social studies must include certain higher-level courses. A full description of the 4-year college preparation indicator is provided in chapter 4."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Methods", "text": "All numerical values in this report are estimates that account for the complex sampling characteristics of each of the studies. Weights were employed which accounted for differential probability of selection into the sample and adjusted for nonresponse (i.e., failure to answer questionnaires or otherwise participate once chosen as an eligible sample member). First followup transcript weights were used in all chapters: with the filter for graduates with complete transcripts, these weights adjust the estimates so they represent the national population of high school graduates in each respective study year (1982, 1992, and 2004). For parts of chapters 6 and 7 addressing experiences in the 2 years after graduation, second follow-up transcript weights were used, and estimates from this chapter likewise represent the national population of high school graduates. See appendix A for the specific names of weights used in the analysis for each study. In addition, analysis procedures used information about sample design to calculate measures of the precision of numerical values such as means or percentages. These measures of precision are called standard errors and help identify when two or more estimates cannot be distinguished because of uncertainty about the true value of the estimates. The analysis procedure used to calculate standard errors was the method of balanced repeated replication (BRR). See appendix A for more information on BRR. Because of the uncertainty surrounding estimates, some apparent differences between numerical values may not represent true differences in the population of students from which the estimate is drawn. Therefore, tests for the statistical significance of differences are required to ensure that any given difference is likely a product of more than sampling variation. All comparisons reported in the text have been tested to ensure statistical significance, unless a numerical value is reported individually or the text otherwise states there was no statistically significant difference observed. The statistical test used was Student's t test. The formula for this test is provided in appendix A. Standard errors for tables discussed in the text are provided in appendix B. Most analyses in this report are bivariate cross-tabulations (with filters for specific subpopulations such as academic focus graduates or non-college attendees, when appropriate). Some analyses reported in chapters 4 and the analysis in appendix C use regression techniques to estimate the association between an independent and dependent variable. These techniques are described in the sections presenting those results, and further detailed in appendix A. Because of the large numbers of estimates created by multiple groups and variables in any given table, not all statistically significant differences or substantively interesting comparisons can be discussed. To help standardize what findings are discussed, the following discussion sequence is used for each table: (1) first, changes over time within each occupational coursetaking group are discussed, with differences in trends within groups and across academic focus and general education graduates noted; (2) then each occupational coursetaking group is compared with others within each year, with text noting whether patterns holding in earlier cohorts continue to hold or change in later cohorts."}, {"section_title": "PARTICIPATION IN CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION", "text": "Given the changing federal role over time, and the changing political and economic contexts in which high school students complete their coursetaking, the major question concerning participation in CTE involves how CTE and occupational coursetaking have changed. In addition, the relationship between academic and occupational coursetaking may have changed over time, as may have the types of graduates involved in CTE. This chapter addresses these questions by describing high school graduates' participation in CTE courses and the background characteristics of occupational concentrators and nonconcentrators. Overall numbers of earned credits in academic, CTE, and occupational courses are presented first, followed by categorical breakdowns of occupational investment categories and academic orientation groups. Finally, the sociodemographic characteristics of graduates and the characteristics of schools they attended are presented, to provide a picture of types of students at different levels of occupational coursetaking involvement."}, {"section_title": "Occupational and Academic Credits Earned", "text": "\u2022 High school graduates earned, on average, about 4.5 more credits in 2004 than in 1982; this includes an increase in academic credits earned. Looking across the three cohorts, the average total number of credits high school graduates earned increased over time in two almost equal increments: 2.3 credits between 1982 and 1992, and 2.2 credits between 1992 and 2004 (table 1). Students not only took more courses, they took more academic courses: 1982 seniors earned 15 academic credits, compared with 17 among 1992 seniors and 19 among 2004 seniors. Over these two decades, graduates earned more credits in all academic areas except English (i.e., in mathematics, science, social studies, fine arts, and non-English languages). These changes are consistent with the policy changes recommended in 1983's A Nation at Risk, as discussed in chapter 3, and evidence from other sources (e.g., Shettle et al. 2007). "}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Total credits earned in CTE courses and occupation-specific courses declined between 1982 and 1992; no differences were observed between 1992 and 2004.", "text": "The number of CTE credits that graduates earned declined from 4.6 credits in 1982 to 3.9 credits in 1992, remaining stable at 3.8 credits among 2004 graduates. Occupational area credits made up the bulk of CTE credits earned by each cohort, and declines over time were most apparent in these courses. Whereas 1982 graduates, on average, earned 3.0 occupational area credits, 1992 graduates earned 2.4 credits and 2004 graduates earned 2.6. Among specific occupational program areas, graduates earned fewer total credits in business; marketing; and manufacture, repair, and transportation. In computer and information science, however, the average number of credits earned increased from 0.1 to 0.4 between the 1982 cohort and the 2004 cohort. In Chapter 4, further analyses examine whether there was a relationship between these changes (i.e., whether increasing academic coursetaking was associated with declines in CTE credits earned). Changes in the average total number of CTE credits earned can be seen in more detail in the percentage of graduates earning specific numbers of CTE and occupational credits, as seen in table 2. The percentages of graduates earning 5, 6, 7, or 8 or more CTE credits declined between 1982 and 2004, with most decreases occurring between 1982 and 1992. Similarly, the percentage of graduates earning zero CTE credits increased over time from 2 percent in 1982 to 4 percent in 2004. However, the percentages of graduates earning 1, 2, or 3 total CTE credits increased between 1982 and 1992, and remained higher in 2004: whereas 38 percent of graduates earned 1, 2, or 3 credits in CTE in 1982, 48 percent of graduates did so in both 1992 and 2004. The results are similar for overall occupational coursetaking, as shown in table 3: the percentages of graduates earning a total of 5, 6, or 7 occupational credits decreased between 1982 and 1992 (staying lower in 2004), and the percentages earning 1 or 2 total occupational credits increased between 1982 and 2004. Thirty-five percent of graduates earned 1 or 2 occupational credits in 1982, compared with 42 percent in 2004. These declines are also reflected in the percentage of all courses which were occupational. This measure provides a way of gauging involvement relative to overall course intensity. The percentage of graduates earning 15 percent or more of their total credits in occupational courses dropped from 40 percent in 1982 to 24 percent in 1992 and 22 percent in 2004 (table 4). The percentage of graduates earning more than zero to just less than 15 percent of their credits in occupational courses increased from 1982 to 2004 from 49 to 67 percent.

In 1982, for example, about 26 percent of graduates earned credits in 3 or more occupational areas (table 5). Although this had dipped slightly in 1992 (to 23 percent), in 2004, 33 percent of graduates had earned credits in 3 or more areas. "}, {"section_title": "Occupational Investment and Academic Orientation", "text": "The increasing spread of occupational credits across areas was driven by both declining percentages of occupational concentrators (focusing their studies in one area) and increasing percentages of graduates simply taking a small and diffuse set of occupational credits. Figure 1 shows this by presenting the breakdown of occupational investment into the four categories defined in chapter 2: nonparticipants, samplers, explorers, and concentrators. Nonparticipation in occupational coursetaking (less than 1 credit earned) showed no change between 1982 and 2004, although 1992 nonparticipation was higher than in the other 2 years. However, the percent of samplers (earning 1 to fewer than 3 occupational credits) and the percentage of explorers (earning at least 3 occupational credits, but with no concentration) both increased. Samplers grew from 36 percent of graduates in 1982 to 42 percent in 1992 (remaining higher in 2004), while the jump for explorers lagged and grew from 16 percent in 1992 to 21 percent in 2004. Occupational concentration (3 or more credits in at least 1 occupational area), however, declined from 29 percent in 1982 to 20 percent in 1992, falling further to 17 percent in 2004. NOTE: Non-participants earned zero or less than 1 total occupational credits (Carnegie units); samplers earned 1 to less than 3 total occupational credits. Explorers earned 3 or more total occupational credits but did not concentrate in an occupational area. Concentrators earned 3 or more credits in at least one occupational area. Graduates with an academic focus earned at least 4 credits in English and 3 credits each in mathematics, science, and social studies; graduates with a general education focus did not meet these requirements. A Carnegie unit is equivalent to a course taken for one period each day for one full school year. SOURCE: The trends in occupational coursetaking can be compared to trends in academic coursetaking. These trends are shown in figure 2. Academically oriented students grew steadily from 1982 through 2004: academic focus graduates were 15 percent of the 1982 graduating class; in 1992, this had increased to 47 percent, and continued to increase to 60 percent in 2004. Table 6 brings together occupational investment categories and academic orientation groups. The total values in table 6 repeat figure 1, but table 6 additionally provides breakdowns of occupational coursetaking by academic orientation group. In contrast to the totals, patterns for academic focus graduates were different than for general education graduates. Occupational nonparticipants declined over time among academic focus graduates and saw no change among general education graduates. The percent of samplers among academic focus graduates saw no change, while the percent of samplers among general education graduates increased from 34 percent in 1982 to 42 percent in 2004. The only similarity in patterns was observed among explorers, where the percent increased for both academic and general education graduates (standing above 20 percent for each group in 2004). Finally, occupational concentration among academic focus graduates increased over time, while decreasing among general education graduates. The overall effect of these different patterns was to make academic focus and general education graduates much more similar in 2004 than they had been in 1982 (at least with respect to occupational coursetaking). Among 1982 academic focus graduates, for example, 10 percent were occupational concentrators, while 33 percent of 1982 general education graduates were concentrators. In 2004, however, the percentages were 17 and 18 percent, respectively. Similar results are seen for each occupational coursetaking group. However, it should be noted that very few academic focus graduates were in any given occupational coursetaking category in 1982. This is shown in table 7, where the percentages for each year sum to 100. Of the eight groups formed by occupational investment categories and academic orientation, two were much larger than the rest in 1982: general education samplers and general education concentrators (29 and 28 percent of 1982 graduates, respectively). By 1992, however, the emphasis on academic coursetaking had begun the decisive shift away from general education graduates: academic focus samplers and general education focus samplers now shared the largest-group crown (21 percent of 1982 graduates each). And in 2004, each of the occupational groups within academic focus graduates was larger than all but general education samplers, with the largest group-academic focus samplers-now comprising a quarter of all high school graduates.  NOTE: Nonparticipants earned zero or less than 1 total occupational credits (Carnegie units); samplers earned 1 to less than 3 total occupational credits. Explorers earned 3 or more total occupational credits but did not concentrate in an occupational area. Concentrators earned 3 or more credits in at least one occupational area. Graduates with an academic focus earned at least 4 credits in English and 3 credits each in mathematics, science, and social studies; graduates with a general education focus did not meet these requirements. A Carnegie unit is equivalent to a course taken for one period each day for one full school year. SOURCE: Among both females and males, the percent of nonparticipants saw no change, the percentage of samplers and explorers increased, and the percentage of concentrators declined between 1982 and 2004 (table 8). However, the percentage of academic focus graduates who were samplers did not change between these two years for either gender, and the percentage of academic focus graduates who were concentrators did not change for females. Additionally, the percentage of general education graduates who were nonparticipants did not change for males between the first and last cohorts. Females were consistently more likely to be nonparticipants and less likely to be explorers, in all years and in both academic and general education focus groups. Males and females were no different in their rates of sampling or concentrating in 1982, but by 2004, more females than males were samplers (45 percent to 40 percent) and more males than females were concentrators (21 percent to 14 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Race/ethnicity \u2022 Every racial/ethnic group saw an increase in samplers and a decrease in occupational concentration over time.", "text": "Although the nominal changes in occupational investment within each racial/ethnic group were consistent with overall trends, only increases in sampling and decreases in concentration between 1982 and 2004 were consistently statistically significant for each group (except for Asian-American graduates, who saw no detectable change at any level of occupational investment). Changes within academic focus and general education graduates were similar across racial/ethnic groups, as well. Few consistent detectable differences were observed across racial/ethnic groups, in any graduating class. That is, there was little evidence that levels of occupational investment systematically differed by race or ethnicity. It is also worth noting that the proportion of the U.S. school-aged population that is White, non-Hispanic has declined over the last quarter century (Snyder, Dillow, and Hoffman 2009), and, therefore, Whites made up a decreasing share of each occupational coursetaking group except concentrators (where no statistical difference was observed) (not shown).

In contrast, the percentage of concentrators declined for both the lowest and the middle two SES quartiles, and the percentages of explorers and samplers increased for both groups, between 1982 and 2004. Trends within academic focus and general education graduates were similar to overall trends for the two lowest SES groups. Graduates from the highest SES quartile were less likely to be concentrators or explorers than their lower-SES peers, in all years (excepting explorers in 1982). While graduates from the lowest SES quartile were less likely than graduates from the middle two quartile group to be nonparticipants and samplers, and more likely to be concentrators, in 1982, there were no differences between these two SES quartile groups in 2004.

Likewise, nonparticipation did not change for any group between 1982 and 2004. Changes among academic focus and general education graduates were also similar to overall trends. In both 1992 and 2004, graduates from small schools were less likely to be samplers and more likely to be concentrators than graduates from large schools. For example, 21 percent of smallschool graduates were concentrators in 2004, compared to 12 percent of large-school graduates. Occupational concentration declined for graduates of schools in all locales (urban, suburban, and rural), and exploration increased for graduates of urban and suburban schools. However, despite a jump in 1992, the percent of suburban school graduates who were samplers did not change when 1982 is compared to 2004. Additionally, the percent of rural school graduates who were nonparticipants increased over time, from 15 percent in 1982 to 23 percent in 2004. In 2004, suburban school graduates were less likely to be samplers and more likely to be concentrators than either their urban or rural counterparts. The suburban versus urban or rural differences represent a change from 1982, when suburban school graduates were not statistically different from their peers in sampling and were less likely than rural school graduates to concentrate in an occupational field of study. "}, {"section_title": "ACADEMIC AND OCCUPATIONAL COURSETAKING", "text": "Chapter 3 presented information on the overall number of academic credits and career and technical education credits (both occupation-specific and otherwise) earned by high school graduates over time, and the proportion and types of students in each occupational coursetaking and academic orientation group. In this chapter, academic and CTE coursetaking is examined for graduates in each of the occupational coursetaking categories and across academic orientation groups. For the past three decades, concerns about graduates leaving high school unprepared for the world of postsecondary schooling or work have helped fuel increases in high school graduation requirements. For example, the number of states requiring 2.5 or more credits in mathematics to graduate increased from about 12 in 1987 to 28 in 2006; a similar increase was observed in science, with a smaller increase in social studies requirements (in contrast, English requirements among states have remained relatively steady in the past 30 years; Toye et al. 2006). As would be expected, these increases have been paralleled by documented increases in students' academic coursetaking over time (Dalton et al. 2007;Shettle et al. 2007). From the perspective of CTE and occupation-specific learning, one question is whether these increased requirements have made occupational investors (explorers and concentrators) more like noninvestors in the number of academic credits earned. Have occupational investors moved toward taking just the minimum academic requirements, or have they more fully committed to academic programs of study in high school? Prior evidence has indicated that CTE students increased their academic coursetaking at greater rates than non-CTE students did (Levesque et al. 2000); does this remain true for the class of 2004, as well? In addition to accumulating credits, how has the level of coursetaking (the highest subject attained, for example) among occupational investors and noninvestors changed over time? The level of advancement is particularly important for subject areas such as mathematics and science, where the clear delineation of subjects in a relatively ordered sequence can reveal the degree of preparation for postsecondary education or employment and training in quantitative and analytical reasoning . Finally, what is the general relationship between occupational and academic coursetaking? Do students substitute one for the other (i.e., do occupational concentrators avoid academic coursetaking in their pursuit of occupational specialization, or do academic subject requirements prevent occupational coursetaking)? Table 10 presents the average number of credits earned in specific academic subjects for occupational investors and noninvestors.

College preparation can be defined in multiple ways, including using measures beyond coursetaking, but here we examine the coursetaking profiles of graduates with respect to a set of admissions standards for 4-year colleges. These standards were developed on the basis of research into 4-year college admissions policies (Levesque et al. 2000). A graduate is deemed \"college prepared\" if he or she earned at least four credits in English; three credits in math at the level of algebra I or higher; two credits in biology, chemistry, and/or physics; two credits in social studies with at least one of those credits in U.S. or world history; and two credits in a non-English (foreign) language. Compared with the definition of academic orientation used throughout the tables and figures in this report (see chapter 2), this definition of college preparedness is somewhat more rigorous-graduates must have foreign language credits and must have credits in specific math, science, and social studies courses. However, the credit requirements are also fewer for math, science, and social studies subject areas, so some graduates defined as prepared for a 4-year college may not be defined as having an academic focus orientation. Despite this nonexclusivity, the 4-year college preparation definition represents a specific orientation for college that is useful to examine. Figure 3 presents the results. For occupational concentrators, for example, the college preparation rate increased from 2 percent in 1982 to 16 percent in 1992 and 32 percent in 2004. However, graduates with more involvement in occupational coursetaking were less prepared than their less-involved peers: in 2004, around half of both occupational nonparticipants and samplers were college prepared, compared with 38 percent of explorers and 32 percent of concentrators.

The three most common courses are presented for four categories of CTE coursesall CTE, family/consumer sciences education, general labor market preparation, and occupationspecific courses-and for each of the 11 occupation-specific areas in which occupational concentration could be achieved. The percentages represent the percentage of graduates having received credit in each course. 8 Table 13 shows the main CTE course categories, and table 14 shows the occupation-specific categories. Beginning accounting (\"accounting 1\") was in the top three of all CTE courses in both 1982 and 1992 (16 and 17 percent of all graduates having taken it in those cohorts, respectively), but was no longer represented in the top three in 2004 (table 13). Two computer courses were in the top three in 1992 and 2004: 29 percent of 1992 graduates had taken computer appreciation, and 13 percent of 2004 graduates had taken desktop computer application suites. Perhaps surprisingly, a basic food course (\"food 1,\" i.e. food preparation) was the second-most common CTE course among 2004 graduates, at 14 percent. The food preparation course was consistently in the top three of the family and consumer sciences education (FCSE) area, with between 12 and 14 percent of graduates taking this course, depending on the graduating class. Home economics was another perennial top-three FCSE course, although its popularity declined across cohorts. A family relations course and adult roles and functions course also appeared among the top three FCSE courses at various times. Because keyboarding is classified as a general labor market preparation (GLMP) course, it was consistently the most common GLMP course.

The two previously mentioned computer courses, also classified as GLMP courses, are in the top three in 1992 and 2004.

Because student time is limited, some occupational coursetaking may substitute for academic courses, especially among those who intend to concentrate in an occupational area, and some academic coursetaking may take away from opportunities to take occupational area courses. To examine this possibility, this section presents results from bivariate regressions (using ordinary least squares [OLS] regression-see appendix A for details) of academic credits earned on all CTE credits earned and occupational area credits earned. In a bivariate regression, the statistical relationship between academic and occupational courses is measured by a regression coefficient. 9 The regression coefficient indicates the direction and strength of the relationship between academic and CTE coursetaking or occupational coursetaking. In the regression models presented here, a positive coefficient indicates that each additional credit earned in an academic course is, on average, associated with an increase in occupational credits earned. The size of that increase is indicated by the size of the coefficient itself. The opposite is true as well: if the coefficient is negative, that indicates that for each additional credit earned in an academic course, on average, occupational credits earned declines by the size of the coefficient. If the coefficient were equal to 1, that would mean that each increase of 1 academic credit, on average, corresponds to an increase or decrease of exactly 1 occupational credit. A -1 (negative 1) coefficient would represent a perfect substitution or tradeoff effect. 10 Results from 10 total models are presented: five in table 15, and five in table 16. Table 15 shows the effect of academic credits earned on total CTE credits earned; table 16 shows the effect of academic credits earned on total occupational area credits earned. In both tables, five models are presented: four with a single academic credit predictor (total academic credits, total math credits, highest math credit earned, and total science credits), and one with both total math 9 An intercept is also estimated. The intercept, or constant, indicates the expected value on the outcome variable (here, CTE credits or occupational credits) when the independent variable (here, academic credits) is zero. Because the intercept value has no meaning in the current context (by definition, none of the sample members in the current study can have zero academic credits), only the regression coefficients are discussed. 10 In the models presented, no factors other than academic credits are included as predictor variables. Other student characteristics may account for relationships observed between academic and occupational coursetaking. However, the purpose of the current analysis is to explore the main relationship, not explain it; the bivariate regression results provide a useful summary of the unadjusted relationship between the two types of coursetaking. and total science credits earned in the model simultaneously. The last model helps to determine whether both math and science credits are associated with CTE or occupational courses earned, even after accounting for the effects of the other. \u2022 An increase in academic credits earned is associated with a decrease in CTE or occupational credits earned. In other words, all coefficients are negative, and all are statistically significant. The smallest effect is a coefficient of -0.13 in table 16 (in the combined math and science credits model of total occupational area credits in 2004). This coefficient indicates that each additional math credit earned reduces the average occupational area credit earned by about 1/8th of a credit. The largest effect is a coefficient of -0.97 in table 15 (the math credits model of total CTE credits in 1992). Similarly large effects can be observed in models of total CTE credits in 1982 (table  15). Each of these larger effects indicate that, in 1982 and to a lesser degree in 1992, an additional math or science credit increase was associated with taking 1 fewer CTE credit-a near-perfect relationship. In the combined model of math and science credits in table 15, the effects for math and science credits each are above half a CTE credit, suggesting that they have a cumulative and independent influence on total CTE credit coursetaking."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 Academic-CTE or academic-occupational course tradeoffs were weaker in 2004 compared with earlier years.", "text": "For example, the effect of an additional science course on occupation-specific coursetaking in 2004 (-0.31) was less than half of what it was in 1982 (-0.71) (table 16). Although the effects remain negative in 2004, the tradeoffs between academic and CTE or occupational coursetaking are much diminished. This result is in line with earlier descriptive information (chapter 3) showing that many more occupational investors also had an academic focus in 2004 compared with prior graduating classes. Overall, academic coursetaking is associated with diminished occupational coursetaking. It is important to note that this can be stated the opposite way, with a different implication: that occupational coursetaking is associated with diminished academic coursetaking. Although the statistical language of the models implies one causal direction, the results could support the conclusion that either (1) students make decisions about increasing or decreasing academic coursetaking, and therefore limit or expand the amount of time they have to enroll and earn credit in CTE or occupational area courses; or (2) students make the decision to pursue or avoid CTE or occupational area courses and therefore drop or make room for academic courses. Indeed, students may be making these choices simultaneously across a variety of subjects and courses, and the choice process may not be unidirectional but rather reciprocal (i.e., involving a continual evaluation of the balance of courses in their schedules). Regardless, the results from the regression results indicate that academic and CTE courses are not earned independently of one another, which is not surprising considering the historical distinction between academic and vocational tracks and the inherent limitations on students' time. Further research may shed light on whether the academic-CTE coursetaking tradeoffs are similar in magnitude to other tradeoffs that students may make across academic subjects or across academic, CTE, and enrichment/other courses simultaneously."}, {"section_title": "MATH ACHIEVEMENT", "text": "A central focus of state and federal education reforms in the past decade has been the establishment of accountability systems (i.e., the use of student assessments to hold schools and sometimes teachers accountable for progress in educational achievement). From an emphasis on coursetaking requirements originating from the 1983 A Nation at Risk report (whose calls for increased graduation standards were successful, as seen in chapters 3 and 4), standardized tests have taken center stage as the measure of educational success. This coincides with the shift toward concern about the academic performance of career and technical education students, particularly in light of global economic competition and the increasing value of technical and analytical skills in the labor market. To what extent is the academic performance of occupational investors on par with that of noninvestors? How has the academic achievement of occupational investors changed over time, both independently and relative to noninvestors' achievement? This chapter examines mathematics achievement and its relationship to occupational coursetaking in the graduating classes of 1992 and 2004. While mathematics knowledge and skills were also assessed in 1982, only the 1992 and 2004 math test results have been placed on the same scale. An overall mathematics score is examined for each cohort (results for proficiency levels representing specific levels of mastery are presented in appendix A). The overall math score is measured as a number-right score. Because students did not take every item in the math test item pool, an estimated number-right score was created using item response theory (IRT) scaling procedures; this score represents what the student would be predicted to score had he or she taken all 81 items in the original NELS:88 math test item pool. Therefore, scores range from 0 to 81. In addition to presenting the overall math scores for graduates in 1992 and 2004, the effect size for change over time is presented. Effect size is a measure that standardizes differences so that they are comparable across studies and can be judged in the context of other research findings. To standardize the raw differences, they are divided by a measure of the variation in scores, the standard deviation (in this case, a pooled standard deviation across 1992 and 2004 graduates). The result indicates how much scores differ relative to the range of scores found for the original metric.  provides guidelines for the magnitude of effect sizes, with 0.20 representing small effect sizes, 0.50 representing medium effect sizes, and 0.80 representing large effect sizes. In the context of secondary schooling, however, these guidelines are likely too large. For example, expressed as an effect size, the average annual math gain from grade 10 to 12 on a series of nationally standardized tests was reported as 0.075 (Bloom et al. 2008). 11 Calculations performed with ELS:2002 math scores suggest that the average annual gain across these two grades is larger, at about 0.17. However, this is still smaller than the Cohen \"small\" effect size. In the present discussion, effect size results are not identified as \"small\" or \"large,\" but a 0.17 effect size growth can be considered a benchmark, representing about a year's worth of growth in late high school mathematics among ELS:2002 sample members.

Occupational concentrators achieved a score of 45 in 1992 and 47 in 2004, for example. Table 18 shows the effect sizes for gains across the occupational coursetaking group, indicating that the effect size for occupational explorers and concentrators was particularly large-0.20 and 0.17, respectively, compared with 0.09 for samplers. The effect size results suggest that the mathematics achievement of occupational explorers and concentrators increased by about one year's worth of typical high school math growth in the 12 years between the studies.  Table 17 also shows mathematics score changes for academic focus and general education graduates. Changes in math score for each occupational coursetaking group were similar among general education graduates: nonparticipants saw no statistically significant change, while samplers, explorers, and concentrators saw increases in math score over time. However, among academic focus students of any occupational coursetaking group, only nonparticipants saw a change: in fact, a decline from a score of 57 in 1992 to 56 in 2004. \u2022 Thus, the overall changes in math scores for those with more occupational coursetaking involvement is driven by gains in scores among graduates with a general education curriculum."}, {"section_title": "\u2022 However, in both 1992 and 2004, graduates with more occupational coursetaking involvement scored lower than their peers with less occupational coursetaking (with the exception of explorers versus concentrators in 1992).", "text": "For example, in 1992, occupational nonparticipants scored 54 on the math assessment, compared with 45 for occupational concentrators.

Even if graduates concentrate in occupational areas while in high school and do not plan to obtain a 4-year degree, many of the most rewarding positions in any field require further training and more advanced skills than what may be learned in high school. Examining the expectations and initial postsecondary education experiences of high school graduates can help elucidate the areas of success and weakness in occupational investors' high school training. This chapter further investigates differences and similarities between occupational coursetaking groups by characterizing the educational expectations of three cohorts of graduating seniors; it continues by describing their initial postsecondary education experiences (first 2 years after graduation) in terms of whether they were enrolled after high school, their enrollment intensity, whether they enrolled in 4-year institutions, and the timing and pattern of their enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Senior-year Educational Expectations", "text": "\u2022 For all occupational coursetaking groups, graduates' senior-year expectations have shifted from lower to higher levels of education over time, although occupational investors still have lower expectations than noninvestors. Each of the three surveys used for analyses in this report include data on public high school graduates' educational expectations while in the 12th grade; distributions of these expectations are shown in table 19. Across all occupational coursetaking groups, these distributions have shifted from lower expectations in 1982 to higher expectations in 2004. For example, the percentage of graduates expecting high school or less, as well as those expecting only some college (less than a 4-year degree), was lower in 2004 than in 1982 for all occupational coursetaking groups. At the same time, the percentage of those expecting to earn a graduate or professional degree increased from 1982 to 1992, and again from 1992 to 2004, among all occupational coursetaking groups. This same general shift toward higher educational expectations (and away from lower expectations) can also be seen in both academic orientation groups. Despite this shift toward higher expectations, the educational expectations of occupational investors tended to be lower than those of noninvestors in each cohort. This can be illustrated by examining, for example, the modal expectation levels of 2004 12th-graders: the most commonly held educational expectations among occupational concentrators was some college or a bachelor's degree (reported by 28 percent and 30 percent of this group, respectively), and the modal expectation level for occupational explorers was a bachelor's degree (38 percent). The modal expectations for noninvestors, however, was for higher levels of education: occupational samplers expected graduate degrees (38 percent) and bachelor's degrees (36 percent), while the single most commonly expected education level among occupational nonparticipants was a graduate or professional degree (45 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Initial Postsecondary Education Ever Attended Postsecondary School", "text": "In addition to information on 12th-grade educational expectations, the longitudinal datasets used in this report include a wealth of data on actual postsecondary education experiences.

The corresponding rate for occupational concentrators was 50 percent in 2006, a significant increase from their rates in 1984 (35 percent) and 1994 (39 percent).

NOTE: Nonparticipants earned zero or less than 1 total occupational credits (Carnegie units); samplers earned 1 to less than 3 total occupational credits. Explorers earned 3 or more total occupational credits but did not concentrate in an occupational area. Concentrators earned 3 or more credits in at least one occupational area.

Otherwise the trends for each academic orientation group were similar to the overall population. As with their gains in initial postsecondary participation rates, the gains made by occupational investors in terms of first attendance at 4-year institutions did not overcome their lower rates compared with noninvestors: at each studied time point, the rates for investors lagged behind their noninvestor counterparts.

First, there has been a decisive shift among most high school graduates away from intense involvement in occupational coursetaking and toward academic coursetaking. Fewer graduates concentrated in occupational coursetaking by earning 3 or more credits in a single occupational area: in 1982, 30 percent of all graduates were occupational concentrators, compared with 17 percent in 2004. At the same time, but mainly between 1982 and 1992, graduates increasingly met the requirements originally set out in the 1983 A Nation at Risk report, earning four credits in English, and three each in mathematics, science, and social studies. The share of the graduating class meeting this requirement increased from 15 percent in 1982 to 60 percent in 2004. This overarching shift toward academic coursework did not mean that occupational coursetaking as a whole was abandoned, however. Indeed, the percentage of graduates earning at least 1 credit in an occupational course remained relatively stable over the three cohorts: 82 percent earned at least 1 credit in an occupational course in 1982, compared with 81 percent in 2004. And although the average number of occupational credits earned declined over time, this was primarily because of the decline in occupational concentrators. Occupational coursetaking actually became more widespread over these three decades, which is the second main finding of this report. Greater proportions of graduates \"sampled\" or \"explored\" occupational courses in later cohorts. Samplers, earning 1 to 3 occupational credits, grew from 36 percent of all graduates in 1982 to 42 percent in 2004; explorers, earning 3 or more occupational credits without concentrating their studies in a particular occupational area, grew from 16 percent of all graduates in 1982 to 21 percent in 2004. In combination with the shift toward academic coursetaking, the growth in lower-level occupational coursetaking indicates the merging of academic and occupational coursetaking involvement. Occupational samplers, explorers, and concentrators made up an increasingly larger share of all academically oriented graduates over time, while general education graduates with occupational involvement dwindled. To this extent, given the priority placed on academic requirements and the shift toward more and higher-level academic coursetaking, occupational coursetaking appears to have become more like an exploratory endeavor than a concentrated effort to prepare for a career immediately after high school. These trends have coincided with improved achievement outcomes (as measured by mathematics test score) and more involvement in postsecondary education. Occupational investors who had not focused on academic studies otherwise (i.e., general education graduates) earned more credits in math, science, and social studies in 2004 than 1982. And although increased academic coursetaking likely contributes to decreased occupational coursetaking (the number of academic credits earned rose over time, and the students taking more academic credits typically took fewer occupational or CTE credits), the relationship between the two weakened over time-academic coursetaking was not as closely associated with diminished CTE or occupational coursetaking in 2004 compared with earlier cohorts. Further, occupational investors were increasingly prepared for college and attended 4-year colleges at higher rates in later years. Occupational investors' postsecondary work experiences did not change substantially over time, however. While this study has strengths in terms of presenting nationally representative, crosscohort comparable results based on rigorous coding of specific courses taken, there are limitations on what the results can indicate. As noted in chapter 2, coursetaking is one dimension of high school CTE-the most important dimension, perhaps, but other factors such as participation in specific programs such as cooperative education, or whether the school is explicitly geared to serve CTE or occupational students as a vocational school, career academy, or similar, affect the experience of students and their likely outcomes. Further, because this is a study of high school graduates, there may be students with delayed graduation or who dropped out altogether who had different coursetaking experiences. The findings about the increasing academic readiness of occupational investors should be considered in this light. "}, {"section_title": "Appendix A.

The aim of these studies is to examine the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various stages in their educational careers and the personal and contextual factors that may affect that development. The high school longitudinal studies consist of three completed studies, one ongoing study, and one study currently being implemented. The completed studies comprise the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS:72), HS&B, and NELS:88. In addition, base-year, first follow-up, and second follow-up data are available for the ongoing ELS:2002, which is the fourth longitudinal study in the series. A new study, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), has also just begun. For the current report, HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002 serve as the primary sources of information. HS&B involved surveys of two populations: the senior class of 1980 and the sophomore class of 1980. Because of limitations on the types of data available from the 1980 senior sample, the HS&B sophomore study is used here (see below for further explanation).

Of the 17,590 eligible students, 15,360 completed a survey about their school and home experiences (for an 87 percent weighted response rate, based on eligible students). Of the 15,360 who completed the survey, 14,540 completed cognitive assessments in mathematics and reading (for a 95 percent weighted response rate, based on survey participants). Their parents, teachers, principals, and librarians were surveyed as well. First Follow-up Survey. In the spring of 2004, 14,710 of the originally selected sample members were reinterviewed (for a 95 percent weighted response rate). Some of the sample members were still in their base-year school while others had transferred to a new school or were not in school because they graduated early, dropped out, or were homeschooled. Similar to the base-year design, the first follow-up included a student questionnaire and cognitive test in mathematics. High school seniors in the base-year schools were typically surveyed and tested in group sessions at their schools. Seniors who had transferred to another school, dropped out, graduated, or entered a homeschooling situation were usually interviewed via telephone. Only students who remained in their base-year schools were administered the mathematics assessment. Test scores were imputed for transfer students. Transcript Study Design. Starting in the winter of 2004-05, almost 1 year after most sample members had graduated from high school, transcripts were requested for all sample members who participated in at least one of the first two student interviews (base year or first follow-up). The sample included 16,370 students, of whom transcripts were obtained for 14,290 students, for a weighted response rate of 91 percent. Transcript data were inputted into a courselevel file containing raw and standardized grades, length of course (e.g., year, semester, trimester), standardized Carnegie unit (i.e., credit), grade level at which course was taken, and a code for the course name (see Subject Area Classification, below). Second Follow-up Survey. In the spring and summer of 2004, when most sample members were 2 years removed from high school graduation, a subsample of respondents was surveyed again. The questionnaire investigated postsecondary education, employment, and life experiences, and included gathering of detailed data on postsecondary institutions attended and specific months of enrollment and employment. In addition, administrative records from federal student financial aid databases and other sources were linked to individual sample members at the student level.

The baseyear survey was conducted in the spring term of 1980. The study provided for a national probability sample of 1,015 secondary schools as the first units of selection. In the second stage, up to 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Schools with high percentages of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority students, alternative public schools, and private schools with high-achieving students were oversampled. The unweighted response rate at the baseline school level was 70 percent and at the baseline student level was 85 percent for the sophomore cohort. 12 Case weights were adjusted for nonresponse. As noted above, high school transcripts were gathered for a subsample of the HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort (in 1982, when most were seniors). For the transcript subsample of about 18,400 sophomore cohort members, transcripts were received for 16,000, yielding an unweighted response rate of 87 percent. Among this 16,000, about 6,800 were regular or diploma graduates (within the specified dates; see glossary) from public schools, and the final analysis sample (excluding those without complete transcripts) included about 6,500 sample members. NELS:88. NELS:88 differs from HS&B and ELS:2002 in that the first data collection phase began in the 8th grade rather than the sophomore or senior year; nonetheless, through a freshening procedure, NELS:88 generated nationally representative sophomore and senior cohorts as well. The data used in this report are from the second follow-up conducted in 1992 and the third follow-up conducted in 1994.

The unweighted response rate at the baseline eighth-grade school level was 70 percent for the initial school selections. Replacement schools were used to achieve a realized sample of 815 public and 237 private schools. The eighth-grade student questionnaire completion rate was 93 percent. Two years later, most students had dispersed to new schools; 99 percent of these schools cooperated. The unweighted first follow-up (1990) student questionnaire completion rate was 94 percent (unweighted). The unweighted second follow-up (1992) student questionnaire completion rate was 93 percent.

Several procedures are available for calculating the exact standard errors of estimates in surveys with a complex sample design, where the sample is stratified, clustered, and statistically adjusted to compensate for nonresponse. Weights are provided with each of the studies used in this report so that procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR) can be used to estimate correct, design-adjusted standard errors. Advanced statistical programs such as SUDAAN, AM, or Stata produce similar results. The analyses included in this report used Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) methods to calculate standard errors. This procedure involves creating multiple sets of estimation results based on replicate weights and utilizing the results to estimate a single standard error for the mean, proportion, or regression coefficient."}, {"section_title": "A.4.2 Statistical Testing", "text": "The statistical comparisons in this report were based on the t statistic. Whether the difference between two groups is considered statistically significant is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or proportions and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values (cv). The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. Analyses in this report use an alpha level of 0.05. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were used. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x 1 and x 2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the weighted means of observed sample members' values in two groups), and SE 1 and SE 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (a handful of comparisons in this report are based on dependent estimates), a covariance term was added to the denominator of the formula. For tests comparing correlated samples, the t statistic is: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared, se 1 and se 2 are the corresponding standard errors, and r is the correlation between the observed values of two variables. For either independent or dependent comparisons, adjustments (i.e., Bonferroni) for multiple comparisons (which increase the likelihood of a false positive, i.e. a statistically significant difference when, in fact, there is not one) were not conducted."}, {"section_title": "A.4.3 Ordinary Least Squares Regression", "text": "Analysis conducted in chapter 4 uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques to analyze the relationship between academic coursetaking and CTE coursetaking. In OLS regression, the statistical relationship between an outcome or dependent variable and one or more predictor or independent variables is estimated as a sloped line representing how much the outcome variable changes for each change in the predictor variables. The overall regression line has a beginning value (called an intercept, or constant) and one or more values (called coefficients) indicating how much the outcome increases or decreases per each unit change in the predictor variable(s). A positive coefficient represents an increase in the outcome variable for every 1 unit increase in the predictor variable; a negative coefficient represents a decrease in the same unites. The size of that increase is indicated by the size of the coefficient itself. This overall regression line represents the average relationship across all cases in the analysis. Differences between the average line and the actual value for a case are called residuals or errors, and cumulatively help provide measures of the \"fit\" or predictive power of the predictor variable(s) on the outcome variable. In symbolic terms, an OLS regression equation for a bivariate relationship is: where Y i is the outcome value for case i, \u03b2 0 represents the intercept, X i is the predictor value for case i and \u03b2 1 is its associated coefficient, and r i is the error (residual) term. The OLS procedure estimates these true values for the population and generates a measure of statistical imprecision (the standard error) which is used to test the statistical significance of the intercept and each coefficient. Also, it is assumed that r i is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a given variance; this assumption implies that there are no missing predictors that may bias the estimate of the coefficient(s). In the analyses presented in the text, only bivariate OLS regression is used. There may be other predictors which affect the outcome (CTE or occupational credits earned) and which, by not including in the model, bias the estimate for the academic credit effect or explain it entirely. In addition, because students are organized into classrooms and schools, this regression approach does not take into account correlations among students who are probably similar within classrooms and schools; these correlations may affect the results as well. The results for the chapter 4 OLS regression analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution."}, {"section_title": "A.4.4 Effect Sizes", "text": "In chapter 5, effect sizes are presented that provide a standardized metric for cross-cohort differences in mathematics achievement. Effect size is a measure that standardizes differences so that they are comparable across studies and can be judged in the context of other research findings ). To standardize the raw differences, they are divided by a measure of the variation in scores, usually a standard deviation. In this case, pooled standard deviations across 1992 and 2004 graduates are used. The pooled standard deviation is: Where \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 are the standard deviations of groups 1 and 2 (in the current report, the 1992 and 2004 cohorts), respectively. Effect size is then calculated as: where M 1 and M 2 are the means of the respective groups (the 1992 and 2004 cohorts). The result of this formula is an indication of how much scores differ relative to the range of scores found for the original metric.  provides guidelines for the magnitude of effect sizes, with 0.20 representing small effect sizes, 0.50 representing medium effect sizes, and 0.80 representing large effect sizes. In the context of secondary schooling, however, these guidelines are likely too large. For example, the average annual math gain effect size from grade 10 to 12 on a series of nationally standardized tests was reported as 0.075 (Bloom et al. 2008-this is calculated as the average of the grades 10-11 effect size of 0.15 and the grades 11-12 effect size of 0.01, p. 16). Calculations performed with ELS:2002 math scores suggest that the average annual gain across these two grades is larger, at about 0.17. However, this is still smaller than the Cohen \"small\" effect size. In the present discussion, reported effect sizes are not explicitly identified as large, medium, or small, but an appropriate benchmark for comparison is the 0.17 annual growth effect size from ELS:2002 math data. The annual growth effect size metric is a logical benchmark for growth or differences in achievement scores, and individual effect sizes in the text can be interpreted as proportions of the typical annual growth in mathematics. However, it should be noted that the field of effect size research in education contains a variety of alternative effect size formulas and interpretive approaches that may be appropriate."}, {"section_title": "A.5 Bias Analysis", "text": "A bias analysis was conducted to assess whether the ELS:2002 analytic sample for the occupational expectations analysis in chapter 7 was similar to the group of ELS:2002 respondents who replied \"don't know\" to the question about occupational expectations.

In terms of sex, non-Black race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, future goals, and mathematics performance, there are no detectable differences between the two samples.

Academic orientation. Sample members were classified into \"academic focus\" and \"general education focus\" groups. Classification of Secondary School Courses (CSSC) codes were taken from the course-level transcript files of each of the respective studies. Academic focus was defined on the basis of the credit minima listed below. Those not meeting these credit requirements were categorized as general education focus by default. See appendix D for specific courses counting toward each subject area. English: 4 credits Mathematics: 3 credits Science: 3 credits Social studies: 3 credits Career and Technical Education (CTE). Courses were classified as CTE courses based on a recent revision to the CTE taxonomy of the Secondary School Taxonomy (SST) . CTE courses are grouped into the categories of general labor market preparation (GLMP), family and consumer sciences education (FCSE), and specific labor market preparation (SLMP, but referred to as occupational area courses in the main text). \"Total\" or \"overall\" CTE courses or credits referenced in the main text are the sum of courses in all three of these categories. See appendix D for specific courses falling into each category. Occupational investment. Sample members were classified into one of four categories. The four categories were divided into two broad groups of two categories each: A. Noninvestor 5. Nonparticipant: less than 1 total occupational credits earned 6. Sampler: 1 to fewer than 3 total occupational credits B. Investor 7. Explorer: 3 or more total occupational credits, but no single occupational area with 3 or more credits 8. Concentrator: 3 or more total occupational credits in at least one area (i.e., may earn 3 or more credits in more than just one occupational area) Classification into these groups was based on only the CTE courses identified as occupational area courses (i.e., specific labor market preparation courses). Occupational area courses were placed into the 11 categories listed below. These categories reflect a \"career cluster\" organization of occupational area courses, which is closely tied to postsecondary employment and education classification schemes  Alternative occupational area classifications exist. For example, there is a 21-area occupational grouping available discussed in ; this is the most specific classification currently published. To determine if groupings of occupational areas influenced the distribution of occupational concentration (e.g., if more areas made it more difficult for a student to be classified as a concentrator, under the theory that the same number of courses would be spread across additional areas), a percentage distribution of highest number of occupational credits in one area was produced for both the 11-area classification and the 21-area classification for the ELS:2002 sample members. The 21-area classification applied to the ELS:2002 transcript data is, in practice, 20 areas; one coursetaking area was not represented on any student's transcript. The percentage distributions are presented in table A-2. There are approximately 2.3 percentage points fewer occupational concentrators (3 or more credits in one area) under the 21-area classification than the 11-area classification. Correspondingly, there are 3.1 percentage points more graduates earning 1 credit in any given area under the 21-area classification than the 11-area classification. However, there is a 0.8 percentage point fewer graduates earning exactly 2 credits in one area in the 21-versus 11-area classification. (All individual concentration levels represented by the rows are statistically significantly different across classifications, except for 0 credits, which does not change across classifications.) This suggests that results presented in the main report may be slightly different depending on the 21-area classification. However, given that this represents nearly a doubling of the number of areas, the effect may be considered substantively small. Fully 86 percent of those classified as concentrators under the 11-area classification would be so classified under the 21area classification, and a majority of the remaining 13 percent would likely be classified as \"explorers\" according to the exhaustive categories defined above, thereby keeping them defined as occupational \"investors\" in either schema. Another alternative to the occupational investment categorization employed in this report would use a continuous measure of occupational credits earned only. Further analysis shows how students classified under such a continuous measure fall within a concentration-based measure such as used to inform the occupational investment variable. Tables A-3 through A-5 present the percentage distribution of public school graduates by total occupational credits earned (a categorization of a continuous measure) and highest number of credits earned in one occupational area (a categorization of concentration) for each of the three cohorts studied in this report. The results show that substantial percentages of graduates who earn 4 or even 5 total occupational credits did not concentrate their studies (and that this percentage grew over time); that is, that a purely continuous measure would not substitute for a measure that includes a concentration measure, assuming the analytic utility of the latter. Additional research would be required to distinguish whether graduates at the same level of total occupational credits but with or without an occupational concentration have different or similar outcomes."}, {"section_title": "ELS:2002: F1RACE_R", "text": "Socioeconomic status (SES).

Only father's occupational prestige is used in HS&B (even if missing, mother's occupational prestige is not used, and the SES index is based on the remaining items). Family income was not available in HS&B, and a sum of household possessions was used as a proxy; in NELS:88, family income was used, but a sum of household possessions was used if family income was missing; in ELS:2002, only family income was used. Finally, in HS&B, student responses served as the source of information; in NELS:88 and ELS:2002, parent data were typically used, and student data used to supplement missing parent information. Further information about the components and differences across studies can be found in the technical reports for each of the studies, specifically Jones et al. (1983)  School size. Size of the student's senior-year school is divided into small (fewer than 1,000 students), medium (1,000-1,999 students), and large (more than 2,000 students).

Test specifications for the ELS:2002 assessments were adapted from frameworks used for NELS:88. The framework had two levels: content areas and cognitive processes. Content areas included arithmetic, algebra, geometry, data/probability, and advanced topics. Cognitive process areas included skill/knowledge, understanding/comprehension, and problem solving. The NELS:88 and ELS:2002 assessments were designed to maximize the accuracy of measurement that could be achieved in a limited amount of testing time while minimizing floor and ceiling effects, by matching sets of test questions to initial estimates of students' achievement from a routing test. Most test items in NELS:88 and ELS:2002 had multiple choice response options. Item Response Theory. The scores used to describe students' performance on the direct cognitive assessment are broad-based measures that report performance as a whole. The scores are based on item response theory (IRT), which uses patterns of correct, incorrect, and omitted answers to obtain ability estimates that are comparable across different test forms (Embretson and Reise 2000;Hambleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers 1991). In estimating a student's ability, IRT also accounts for each test question's difficulty, discriminating ability, and a guessing factor. IRT has several advantages over raw number-right scoring. By using the overall pattern of right and wrong responses to estimate ability, IRT can compensate for the possibility of a lowability student guessing several difficult items correctly. If answers on several easy items are wrong, a correct difficult item is assumed, in effect, to have been guessed. Omitted items are also less likely to cause distortion of scores, as long as enough items have been answered right and wrong to establish a consistent pattern. Unlike raw number-right scoring, which necessarily treats omitted items as if they had been answered incorrectly, IRT procedures use the pattern of responses to estimate the probability of correct responses for all test questions. Finally, IRT scoring makes it possible to compare scores obtained from test forms of different difficulty. The common items present in overlapping forms and in overlapping administrations (10th grade and 12th grade) allow test scores to be placed on the same scale.

This variable only applies to sample members who had no postsecondary education enrollment; it was not asked of postsecondary enrollees. Information about first job held after graduation and job at the time of the 2-year post-graduation survey was combined with information about sex composition of different occupations for ELS:2002 respondents. HS&B and NELS:88 did not code job types (when gathered) to codes that would enable matching to job sex composition data. ELS:2002 first and 2 years post-graduation job types were reported in F2ONET16 and F2ONETC6, respectively. These variables provided occupation type coded to 6-digit O*NET codes used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The codes in both distributions were matched to O*NET codes and levels reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (2006) in Women in the Workforce: A Databook. These data represent sex composition as of 2004, the graduation year for most ELS:2002 analysis sample members (some sample members could have graduated as early as the previous September) and corresponding to the year in which most sample members obtained their first job. Because national-level data on sex composition of different occupations is obtained by survey, not all occupations reflected in the ELS:2002 variables were listed with unique sex composition values in the BLS data. Rather, BLS collapsed some occupations into higher-level O*NET categories and reported sex composition for these collapsed groups as a whole. For ELS:2002 job types that were not specifically matched to BLS job types, the sex composition data was assigned to ELS:2002 job types on the basis of the higher-level BLS grouping data. Therefore the sex composition data for certain ELS:2002 occupations may be misrepresentative of the specific job occupied by the respondent. Occupations were coded as female-dominated if the point estimate from the BLS data indicated that women occupied 50 percent or more of the jobs in that occupation. Otherwise, the occupation was coded as male-dominated. Although BLS estimates have measurement error and a point estimate near 50 percent may in truth indicate either female-or male-dominated jobs, this method allows all occupations in the ELS:2002 data to be coded.

SOURCE: The following analysis extends the analysis of ELS:2002 data found in Bozick and Dalton (2013) to the NELS:88 sample used in this report (due to an non-comparable scale measure found in HS&B, the 1982 class is not examined here). In that analysis, Bozick and Dalton analyzed senior-year mathematics assessment outcomes for a sample from ELS:2002 who had graduated from public high schools in 2004. The analysis focused on the relationship between occupational coursetaking and mathematics outcomes. Fixed effects regression techniques were used to control for unobserved characteristics of sample members which might influence both their occupational coursetaking and their mathematics coursetaking; in this way, the background-independent effects of occupational coursetaking on math achievement could be estimated. The following discussion of fixed effects regression repeats the appendix discussion of fixed effects regression models in Bozick and Dalton. In conventional OLS (ordinary least squares) and conditional change regression models, control variables can be used to remove the effect of potentially confounding observed variables. However, if there are unobserved characteristics that are correlated with the key predictor variables and the outcome net of the observed controls, the estimated effects of the key predictor variables will be biased. Unlike OLS and conditional change regression models, fixed-effects regression absorbs both observed and unobserved potentially confounding time-invariant characteristics, and therefore provides the best linear unbiased estimate of the key predictor variables. In a fixed-effects model, these time-invariant characteristics are measured by a fixed constant \u03b1 i that differs for each individual i. The form of the model used in this analysis is "}, {"section_title": "X", "text": "where y is the mathematics achievement score for individual i at time t, t = time one interview or time two interview; OCC is the number of occupational credits for individual i at time t; ACAD is the number of academic credits for individual i at time t; X is a vector of time-varying control variables where time use, orientations toward schooling, and grade retention are measured for individual i at time t; YEAR is a binary indictor of the survey administration (0 = BY interview; 1 = F1 interview); \u03b1 i is a fixed constant that differs for each individual i; \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b4 1 ,and \u03b3 1 are parameters to be estimated; and \u03b5 is random error for individual i at time t. To estimate the model, each individual's mathematics achievement score at each time point can be expressed as a deviation from their mean score at each time point: In this differencing estimator, all time-invariant characteristics (\u03b1 i ) are eliminated because the difference will always equal zero, thus alleviating the problem of selection bias. Observed time-varying factors contained in X remove the confounding effects of time use, orientations toward schooling, and grade retention observed in the data. Any natural growth in mathematics learning overtime is controlled for by the time-varying measure of survey year (YEAR). The resulting estimates of coursetaking (\u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 ) will be unbiased as long as there are no unobserved time-varying characteristics influencing the relationship between coursetaking and mathematics achievement. In the following two tables, these methods are applied to a sample from NELS:88 who graduated from public high schools in 1992. Prior ELS:2002 results, as found in Bozick and Dalton, are repeated for comparison. Two mathematics outcomes are analyzed: the overall mathematics test score, and specific probability of proficiency scores that estimate the likelihood a student has mastered progressively more difficult mathematics skills and knowledge. The probability of proficiency scores for NELS:88, however, only measure four distinct levels of proficiency, compared to the five provided in ELS:2002 (a fifth level was added for NELS:88's senior-year assessment, but only four levels were calculated for the sophomore-year assessment; both years are required for fixed effects estimates). Both of these measures, as well as the occupational coursetaking and academic credits measures, are described in the appendix A glossary. Table C-1 shows the results using a measure of occupational coursetaking (credits earned in any specific labor market preparation area) while controlling for a separate measure of total academic credits earned. Table C-2 shows the results using a measure of the percent of all courses which were occupational. All models use imputed data (except for imputed information on coursetaking) and control for survey year, student time use, orientation to school, grade retention, as well as missing data at either time point. Only the regression coefficients for the main effects are shown here; other coefficients are available upon request. The NELS:88 results are remarkably similar to the ELS:2002 results. No statistically significant results for total occupational credits earned (controlling separately for academic credits earned) were observed, though ELS:2002's result for the fifth level of proficiency (not available in NELS:88) was statistically significant. Similarly, the percent of all courses that were occupational was associated with lower overall math test scores and less proficiency at level four, though no association was observed at lower proficiency levels. The brief conclusion that can be drawn from this extension to NELS:88 is that the effects of occupational coursetaking on mathematics achievement have been exceptionally stable between 1992 and 2004.
