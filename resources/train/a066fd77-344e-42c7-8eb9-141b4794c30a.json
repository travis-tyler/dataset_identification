[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION: NEED FOR QUANTITATIVE PHANTOMS", "text": "Over the past two decades, interest in the use of MR biological markers (or \"biomarkers\") to provide information critical to the development of novel therapeutic agents and improved clinical diagnostics has grown. Biomarkers (1-3) are objectively measured parameters that indicate the biological state, biological/pathobiological processes, or pharmacologic responses to treatment. Examples of MR biomarkers include tumor volume (4-6), brain volume (7) (8) (9) (10) , functional network connectivity (11) (12) (13) , isotropic (14, 15) or anisotropic (16, 17) water diffusion constants (18) , local metabolite concentrations (10, 15, 19, 20) , blood flow fields (21) (22) (23) , fat fraction (24) (25) (26) (27) , lung function (28, 29) , temperature (30) (31) (32) , and tissue elasticity (33, 34) .\nMedical imaging modalities are now expanding to include quantitative mapping of biomarkers in addition to qualitative imaging. Although quantitative mapping of biomarkers can greatly increase the amount, reliability, and comparability of the data obtained from medical imaging, it requires careful standardization of protocols and the development of phantoms (standard reference objects or calibration structures) to validate the accuracy of these in vivo measurements, and to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements across imaging platforms and time.\nDespite substantial recent advances in biomedical science, the process of developing more effective and safer therapeutics for patients has become increasingly challenging and costly (35) . Magnetic resonance biomarkers are one potential way to address these problems, such as in clinical trials that evaluate novel therapeutic agents or establish efficacy and/or safety for regulatory approval as a substitute for a clinical characteristic reflecting patient condition, function, or survival (i.e., surrogate endpoint). The expectation is that information provided by biomarkers will improve predictability and efficiency along the path from laboratory concept to commercial product (36) . Another motivation for the implementation of image-based biomarkers is their use in safe, noninvasive diagnostics replacing biopsy-based diagnostics. Examples include the use of MR elastography to diagnose and stage liver cirrhosis and fibrosis (34, 37) and dynamic contrast MRI to measure key tissue parameters of tumors (38) to assess the effectiveness of cancer treatment. Finally, the development of accurate and sensitive MRbased biomarkers may lead to physical diagnostics of conditions such as mild traumatic brain injury and many types of neural diseases for which there are no adequate physical diagnostics and which rely on neuropsychological assessment (17, 39) .\nAn important part of precision measurement of primary MR parameters is to develop rigorous definitions of the measurands. For example, the static magnetic field, B 0 , contains contributions from the scanner magnet and from diamagnetic and/or paramagnetic components arising from the radiofrequency (RF) coil assembly and sample under study. Although these effects are relatively small, the impact of their presence can be significant on image quality and quantitative parameter accuracy and precision. For high-performance quantitative imaging, careful definitions and recommended procedures for measuring such effects are required. Perhaps more importantly, careful definitions of the proton spin relaxation times are required. Although exponential relaxation of the proton magnetization is often observed, multiexponential or nonexponential relaxation can be present in many materials, including biological tissue. Different apparent relaxation times for complex materials are measured by different pulse sequences on different platforms (e.g., NMR spectrometer systems versus MRI scanners). Pragmatic definitions of apparent T 1 and T 2 relaxation times are required if one desires to use relaxation times as biomarkers of tissue type and disease processes.\nThe Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) established the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) (40) to address this issue by developing quantitative imaging protocols, phantoms, and technical standards documents, referred to as profiles. In addition, the National Cancer Institute established the Quantitative Imaging Network (41) to help validate quantitative imaging through the use of standard protocols and phantoms. The December 2016 issue of Tomography-A Journal for Imaging Research was devoted to the work of the Quantitative Imaging Network, which is bringing quantitative imaging methods into clinical utility, measuring response to therapy, and supporting clinical decision making during clinical trials (42) . The development of a standard system phantom by the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee is meant to support these efforts by establishing a procedure to develop MRI phantoms with traceable, validated, and monitored components.\nBiomarkers must provide quantitative measures of anatomical, physiological, and/or biochemical characteristics that are comparable over time, between subjects, between scanner locations, between manufacturers, across protocols, and across field strengths. Such comparisons can be difficult because of a variety of purely technical factors ranging from subtle variations in hardware performance influencing the MR signal to differences in hardware and software between and within manufacturers, differences in image acquisition and reconstruction protocols, and differences in data processing and analysis. As with any analytical instrument, regular quality assurance of the MRI scanner allows many of these factors to be characterized and, when feasible, considered when extracting quantitative measurements from the MR data. Existing phantoms are designed for accreditation (see Supporting Information) or for measurement of a single specific scanner property or for a specific application (see \"Application of Specific Phantoms\" section). Few of the existing phantoms contain SI-traceable components, few are monitored for long-term stability, and few have been validated by a national metrology institute (43, 44) . In this paper, we propose that a standard system phantom, with stable and traceable properties enabling evaluation of as many critical aspects of the MRI system as possible, would facilitate the use of quantitative MRI measurements as a biomarker."}, {"section_title": "SYSTEM PHANTOM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Resonance Quantities to Be Evaluated by the System Phantom", "text": "The system phantom should be designed to assess basic system parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), resolution, relaxation times, proton density, and geometric distortion, and to compare results across manufacturers, hardware and software versions, time, and physiologic ranges at 1.5 T and 3 T. A standard system phantom package requires, in addition to the physical phantom, standard imaging protocols, standard image analysis procedures, a full description of the phantom including field and temperature-dependent material properties, numerical description of the phantom to allow simulations, setup and imaging instructions, and a data archive to allow comparison of data and scanner assessment.\nThe American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom, described in the Supporting Information, was designed to partially meet the goals of a system phantom, but it has certain limitations. For example, certain measurements (e.g., section thickness and high contrast resolution) can only be obtained in one orientation. In addition, there is no organized long-term monitoring of the phantom components for stability. Over time, it is known that the acrylic will warp, which can render geometric components unusable (45) .\nHere we describe an MRI system phantom to meet the aforementioned goals, which will contain SI-traceable components, be monitored for long-term stability, and be validated by a national metrology institute. The system phantom can address several concerns with implementation of quantitative MRI, including system constancy and assessment of the data acquisition and analysis pipeline.\nThe following quantities can affect the accuracy or precision of measurement in MRI studies, and are candidate quantities to be evaluated by a system phantom. Some quantities such as B 0 , B 1 , and gradient nonuniformity are primary factors that affect other quantities, such as SNR, and slice profile. "}, {"section_title": "B 1 (Receive) Nonuniformity", "text": "With the increasing use of high channel count phased array and anatomy-specific surface coils for MR signal reception, B 1 receive (B \u00c0 1 ) inhomogeneity must be assessed and addressed. Characterized by spatial variations in image intensity and SNR, it confounds both the accuracy and precision of many quantitative MRI applications if not prospectively accounted for during parameter estimation. The validity of the reciprocity principle that allows B 1 receive nonuniformity to be measured from transmit nonuniformity (B 1 map) has been challenged at very high field strengths."}, {"section_title": "B 0 Nonuniformity", "text": "Assuming good shimming, the main magnetic field, B 0 , can generally be considered uniform over standard clinical imaging fields of view (FOVs). However, for extended FOVs (e.g., breast imaging), nontrivial deviations from uniformity can occur in the periphery. Susceptibility effects introduced by air-tissue interfaces or other nontissue materials (e.g., gadolinium contrast media) will also induce local changes in the effective B 0 field. For certain applications, such as proton-density fat fraction estimation, B 0 inhomogeneity causes spatially dependent phasing of chemical species signals, whereas for other applications, such as echo-planar imaging-based diffusion imaging, it can lead to geometric image distortion. The effective B 0 field can be mapped using multi-echo procedures, or indirectly characterized using proxy measures like SNR and image uniformity."}, {"section_title": "Signal-to-Noise Ratio", "text": "The SNR is known to be influenced by several system factors, such as resonance frequency, flip angle accuracy, transmitter gain, coil loading (fill factor) and tuning, scan parameters, slice profile and shape, scan acceleration (e.g., use of parallel imaging), image reconstruction method, postprocessing, and parameter fitting strategy. Quantitative measurement of SNR can give a general indication of the state of the imaging pipeline.\nTo measure SNR, a relatively large, uniform compartment of a phantom filled with a solution that has wellcharacterized, stable proton density and T 1 and T 2 relaxation times is recommended to properly follow the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) methods (48, 49) . This allows for the use of one of the four protocols described in the National Electrical Manufacturers Association standard MS1-2008 (R2014) to determine SNR (48) . The first two protocols use image subtraction from a pair of nominally identical images to determine image noise; these methods are sensitive to system drift artifacts and suggest that the images be obtained within a minimum of elapsed time. The third protocol uses a single k-space scan to produce two images, which are subtracted; this method reduces the sensitivity to system drift. The fourth protocol measures the noise on a zerosignal region outside the phantom. It is imperative to reference the SNR measurement method used to assess the data to allow comparisons. We do recognize that given the multiple goals of the proposed system phantom, it is space-limited, and therefore may not be able to include large volumes recommended for SNR measurements."}, {"section_title": "Image Uniformity", "text": "Ideal homogenous signal across the FOV can be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, B 0 , B 1 nonuniformities (transmit and receive), gradient linearity, eddy currents, and postprocessing. Image uniformity is also a general indicator of the performance of the imaging pipeline.\nFor measuring image uniformity, National Electrical Manufacturers Association methods in standard MS3-2008 (R2014) are recommended (50) . The method recommends a phantom that covers at least 85% of the specification area. The proposed system phantom should cover at least 85% of most head coils. The method also recommends that the fill solution have physiologic T 1 , T 2 , and spin density values. Multiple methods are outlined to calculate the image uniformity and assess the image contrast."}, {"section_title": "Gradient Amplitude", "text": "Inaccuracies in gradient amplitude can affect measurements of object size, which may be critical for studies requiring accurate registration. This parameter can be measured by comparing image measurements of phantoms with known properties."}, {"section_title": "Geometric Linearity", "text": "Geometric linearity can be affected either by B 0 nonuniformity and/or gradient nonlinearity. Gradient nonlinearity typically leads to geometric distortion and needs to be measured in all three axes. These nonlinearities are more pronounced at the edges of the FOV. Manufacturers apply at least a 2-dimensional gradient nonlinearity correction before image display, but this correction may not be sufficient for some applications (51) and can degrade image resolution (52) .\nTo assess the geometric accuracy for head size volumes, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MagPhan phantom (The Phantom Laboratory, Salem, New York, USA) can be used (53, 54) . Any phantom design for such application must make it possible to identify the phantom orientation from the image itself. This requires that there is sufficient asymmetry in the phantom or built-in fiduciary features to enable the orientation to be automatically determined. This can be in conflict with the design of a geometric distortion phantom, which requires a regular set of points. When using the ADNI phantom, the ADNI software should be used to assess the geometric distortions, to minimize any measurement variance caused by the use of varying analysis software packages (54) ."}, {"section_title": "Slice Position and Profile", "text": "B 0 variations, RF amplifier nonlinearities, and gradient nonlinearity problems can affect slice position and profile. Hence, accurate determination of the slice profile is required in MRI. The B 1 variation across the slice warrants accurate measurement of slice profile and slice crosstalk effects. Accuracy of slice separation is a related factor."}, {"section_title": "Contrast Compartments", "text": "Contrast response, such as T 1 , T 2 and proton density measurements, can be measured through any number of experiments and signal models. Contrast compartments allow testing of the entire measurement protocol, including data acquisition and analysis. These components can reveal issues from the scanner or acquisition and from the processing pipeline, such as an incomplete signal model.\nThe recommended system phantom should have three groups of at least 10 compartments. Within each group, a single parameter (proton density, T 1 , or T 2 ) changes in a manner that is as independent as possible with respect to the other two parameters. Care must be taken to ensure that all spheres required for geometric accuracy assessment using automated analysis procedures have appropriate signal characteristics on at least one specific pulse sequence and set of acquisition parameters. If the contrast compartments are temperature dependent, the temperature dependence should be measured, and temperature correction coefficients should be reported.\nIn the proton density group, at least 10 compartments in which the proton density varies linearly over the range of 50 to 100% relative to pure water is desired.\nIn the T 1 relaxation time group, at least 10 compartments in which the T 1 relaxation time varies linearly over the range of 100 to 2000 ms at 1.5 T is desired. The T 1 relaxation time values included should cover physiologic ranges at both 1.5 T and 3 T, including short relaxation times typically encountered intravascularly following the administration of gadolinium contrast media.\nIn the T 2 relaxation time group, at least 10 compartments in which the T 2 relaxation time varies linearly over the range of 20 to 200 ms at 1.5 T is desired. The T 2 relaxation time values included should cover physiologic ranges at both 1.5 T and 3 T.\nThe software should be open source to allow users to include their quantitative analysis for T 1 , T 2 , and proton density measurements. Software that enables researchers to use their own model for analysis encourages comparison of the acquisition and processing procedures for relaxometry. The software should include models for the recommended imaging protocol and allow for new relaxometry experiments and models."}, {"section_title": "High-Contrast Resolution", "text": "Point spread function, line spread function, or modulation transfer function could provide quantitative measures of spatial resolution (49) .

All components should be in the public domain, including the phantom design, solid models, and material properties. 2. The standard system phantom should allow characterization of bias and variance of most of the desired quantities listed in \"Quantities to be Evaluated,\" with the caveat that no single phantom will be optimal for all of the items listed. 3. No specific recommendation is provided with respect to spherical versus cylindrical geometry.\nGiven the large variety of MR coils, including multichannel head coils, breast coils, and knee coils, a system phantom design will never be suitable for imaging in all current configurations. 4. All filling materials should be well-characterized with respect to physical NMR properties and stability. No user-fillable compartments should be included to maintain consistent and traceable phantom characteristics. 5. The phantom should be handled easily and positioned by MRI technologists. A positioning device should be designed to allow the system phantom to be accurately and precisely positioned at locations off-isocenter, including the volume of a typical thoracic or abdominal cavity (z-direction) and coverage of the shoulders and/or hips (x-direction). It is recognized that this will require a manufacturer-specific design component or will require that the site can independently and reproducibly provide an appropriate surface upon which the proposed positioning device can be placed. 6. The basic imaging protocol duration should be less than 1 h. Although more in-depth imaging protocols may be included, the general use of the phantom will require fitting the image acquisitions into tight schedules. There should be an automated analysis of the measured data to encourage regular use of the phantom for quality control purposes. The algorithms must perform well over prescribed ranges of SNR and artifact levels (e.g., geometric distortion, B 1\nQuantitative MRI Phantoms Reviewnonuniformity). The software should have welldefined regions of interest to enable automated selection of signals of interest. 7. The system phantom should have cost commensurate with existing phantoms. A complex, expensive system phantom may have diminishing value. 8. The phantom should be easy and safe to ship (such as if the phantom is dropped), and any hazardous materials should be contained so that they would not leak and require hazardous clean-up. 9. The phantom should be robust, with at least a 5-year stability, ideally close to 10 years. 10. The phantom should have well-defined accuracy and SI-traceability of important properties, such as dimensional parameters and composition of contrast compartments, such as using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. A metrology institution should be enlisted to verify accuracy and monitor stability of the system phantom. 11. The design should allow for the development and implementation of automated evaluation software tools. For example, the orientation of the phantom should be uniquely determined from the images; it does not need to be known beforehand. Ideally, it should be possible to analyze the images even if the scans are partially truncated or incorrectly oriented in the FOV, as human error will lead to such issues, particularly in large multicenter trials. 12. The phantom should come with an open-source analysis package to allow consistent analysis of imaging data using common DICOM format. Alternative or more extensive analysis should be encouraged by including all information required for analysis, such as region of interest positions. The image analysis software must be able to read images in the DICOM file format and interpret information specific to each manufacturer, even from private tags that are sometimes required for analysis. The software should be open source to allow users to test new algorithms or fitting methods. 13. The phantom should come with required environmental monitoring, such as a thermometer, to adequately assess potential non-system/environmentdependent effects (e.g., temperature). 14. The image analysis software should allow for advanced/complete protocol analysis. The requirements may be different for a phantom used to detect whether a system is within manufacturer specifications compared with a phantom used for measurements to normalize or alter the actual data. 15. Certain features, such as the high-contrast resolution inset, should be compatible with other imaging modalities (e.g., CT, positron emission tomography, ultrasound) to have a single standard, when possible.

The phantom is used for measurements of SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio, and geometric distortion. The measurements allow correction of patient images with respect to tissue contrast and geometric distortion, as needed for segmentation and for volume measurements. The ADNI multisite study found several scanner errors, which may have been missed without central monitoring. Errors including misidentification of gradient hardware, disabling of autoshim, and miscalibrated laser alignment light, if undetected would have contributed to imprecision in quantitative metrics at more than a quarter of all ADNI sites (54).

The phantom was critical to the development and implementation of the QIBA DCE-MRI profile (3), which addresses all aspects of a DCE-MRI study, including data acquisition and processing. At the time of development, there were no other phantoms available to assess the contrast response of acquisition sequences across the range of tissue and vascular R 1 values encountered during a DCE-MRI acquisition, particularly at 3 T, while also assessing the effects of nonuniform sensitivity of phased array coils in abdominal imaging.\nThe RSNA QIBA DCE-MRI phantom (Fig. 1) is a multicompartment phantom consisting of a 36-cm-diameter, 15-cm-height cylindrical polycarbonate shell containing a set of 32 3.0-cm spheres in a uniform fill solution (71) . The spheres are doped with NiCl 2 to achieve T 1 values (Table 1) spanning the ranges expected in a vascular input function (VIF) compartment (VIF spheres) and in tissue (tissue spheres) during a typical DCE-MRI study. To appropriately load the RF coil, the phantom is filled with a 30-mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) solution in water.

At 0 C, the ADC values of PVP do not span the physiologic range; however, at higher temperatures (e.g., 37 C), the ADC values of PVP cover the full range of isotropic diffusion in the human body."}, {"section_title": "Diffusion Tensor MR Imaging", "text": "Anisotropic diffusion imaging characterizes the path of water molecule diffusion and is used to characterize brain injury (16, 17) . Several different approaches were used to mimic the anisotropic diffusion of water seen in the brain (80) (81) (82) ). An acrylic water-filled phantom with a grid structure was used to evaluate geometric distortions in functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (83) . The phantom provided accurate geometric information over the scanning volume for echo-planar imagingbased functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging of the human brain. The results suggest this phantom can reveal geometric distortions not easily detected by standard MRI phantoms. In another study, separate water phantom calibration experiments were conducted to accurately determine and correct eddy current-induced image distortions for in vivo diffusion anisotropy (84) . Further investigations examined the practicalities of using separate phantom calibration data to correct high b-value diffusion tensor imaging measurements by investigating the stability of these distortion parameters, and hence the eddy currents, with time (85) . Rayon fibers were used to mimic axonal bundles, crossing at 90 to validate q-ball imaging (86). Fieremans et al. used high molecular-weight polyethylene fibers, packed together tightly in heat-shrink tubing, to compare the experimental diffusion-weighted MRI and NMR results with Monte Carlo simulations of the apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and kurtosis (82) . Anisotropic diffusion and elastic properties of the brain were mimicked with Spandex fibers in a polyvinylalcohol hydrogel to simultaneously evaluate diffusion tensor imaging and MR elastography in a single reference object (87) . These fiber phantoms generate a porous structure that mimics the hindered space seen in axonal bundles; however, they do not also mimic the restricted water space. Glass capillaries have been used to simulate a restricted space for water diffusion, allowing comparison of different reconstruction techniques (88, 89) ; these phantoms lack the hindered water space and cannot easily create fiber crossings. Hollow polypropylene fibers have been incorporated into a phantom, allowing for fiber crossing and changes in packing density to create both a hindered and restricted water space (90). .

In all cases, guideline-driven quantitative thresholds exist to inform the need for therapy or intervention. The use of guideline-driven thresholds underlines a need for accuracy and repeatability to be assessed at a system level for phase-contrast MRI blood-flow measurements. Numerous efforts have constructed flow phantoms to mimic vascular territories and disease conditions (97) (98) (99) . These single-site \"in-house\" studies have reported the accuracy and precision of phase-contrast MRI to measure case-and site-specific regional velocity, bulk flow rates (velocity integrated over a region of interest), and net flow (temporally and spatially integrated velocity). Computational fluid dynamics, particle image velocimetry, and bulk flow transducers are typically used to validate the phase-contrast MRI flow-field measurements. However, no literature exists on a proven, robust, \"dynamic fluid\" phantom that sufficiently addresses all challenges associated with creating a reliable and reproducible fluid flow field for multisite use with proven test-retest stability.\nTo date, the most extensive studies have used static tissue phantoms. Static tissue phantoms can be used to study phase offset errors, an error postulated to have a large effect on the accuracy of spatially and temporally integrated phase-contrast flow measurements. The most comprehensive multisite effort to investigate phase-offset errors was undertaken by members of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group. Concerned that background phase offsets were a cause of flow-measurement inaccuracies in commercial MRI systems, the group designed a 10-site, 3-manufacturer, 12-system study (all 1.5 T) (100). The phantoms consisted of 10-to 15-L tanks of aqueous gelatin solution, which were doped with 5 mmol/L of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid to facilitate the measurement of small background phase offsets. Gelatin eliminated phase differences as a result of convection and motion-induced fluid currents. By assuming a worst-case error from spatial and temporal integration, an offset of 0.6 cm/s was chosen as a quality threshold (given the potential to cause a 10% error in a pulmonary to systemic shunt measurement). Noting that this was a worst-case scenario, 35 of the 36 uncorrected exams (three experiments per scanner) were found to exceed the quality threshold. A follow-up study in nine 1.5T scanners (involving three different manufacturers) used the same phantoms to understand the correlation of exam protocol parameters on phase-offset errors (101) . No generic protocol was found to generate acceptable offset values across all scanners (using a 0.6-cm/s quality metric). Both studies recommended post hoc corrections to improve accuracy of the measurements, although no universally accepted algorithm was recommended. Multisite temporal stability of background offsets was also examined with this phantom design (102).\nAlthough significant efforts established the importance of phase offsets with static phantoms, a need exists for a robust, dynamic phantom to replicate spatially and temporally varying velocities across a large range of magnitudes. In single-center, in-house studies, dynamic fluid phantoms were used to replicate pulsatile flow (103), stenosis geometries (104) , and other patient-specific geometries (105) . The most comprehensive multisite effort to date was initiated in 1999 by the Flow and Motion Study Group of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine in the Assessment of Methodology of Phase Mapping for Flow Measurement trial. A preliminary two-site report was published in 2005, which detailed the design criteria and plans for a dynamic-flow phantom capable of mimicking various vessels and FOV configurations (106) . However, there were no spatially and/or temporally resolved flow measurements with this flow phantom. The design of a robust dynamic fluidfilled phantom is challenging to implement across multiple sites for a multitude of reasons. Without significant effort (and cost), pump systems and control hardware must reside outside of the scan room (as a result of electromagnetic noise and ferromagnetic components). This means fluid tubing must be routed through waveguides to the control room, and plumbing connections must be repeatedly disassembled and reassembled, thereby risking joint failure, introduction of air bubbles, or catastrophic leakage in the scan room. Furthermore, the inlet conditions, position, and configuration of the assembly (e.g., head height and tubing length, compliance, resistance) will vary according to waveguide location and exam room layout. For these reasons, a dynamic fluidfilled phantom may suffer in terms of reliability and repeatability. The most promising alternative is a rotating gelatin disk phantom, whereby a large range of known velocities can be measured using a priori knowledge of the angular rotation and measurement position in relation to the axis of rotation. Challenges associated with fluid motion, leakage, and presence of air bubbles are mitigated. A few studies reported the use of such phantoms to test velocity and phase-contrast measurement methods (107) (108) (109) . This configuration compromises the ability to evaluate the effects associated with fluid flow in vessels and boundary interactions, including partial volume artifacts or the presence of turbulence, with robustness and cost effectiveness."}, {"section_title": "Breast Phantom", "text": "Breast MRI with quantitative methods is increasingly used for breast cancer diagnosis, staging, and monitoring. For these quantitative applications, it is important to understand and mitigate the sources of variability, such as fat suppression, variations in the left and right sides of the coil, and B 0 inhomogeneity across the large image volume. To address these issues, breast phantoms have been created for quality control (110), well-mixed fat and fibroglandular tissue (111) , and DCE-MRI in the breast (112) .\nThe University of California San Francisco and National Institute of Standards and Technology breast phantom design with flexible outer shell easily fits into different coils and is useful for clinical breast imaging techniques (43, 113 ). The phantom was tested using the sequences of a particular breast imaging clinical trial. The fibroglandular mimic exhibited target T 1 values of 1300 to 1400 ms and 1500 to 1850 ms on 1.5 T and 3 T clinical systems, respectively. Fat was suppressed using standard techniques, and PVP solutions mimicked the range of ADC values from malignant tumors to normal breast tissue (43) . The phantom does not include any dynamic components for DCE-MRI as other designs have (112) . Additionally, the T 1 and T 2 values of the PVP are not physiologic for breast fibroglandular or tumor tissue. One challenge of the two-phantom design is it requires twice the scan time to assess both sides of the coil. It is important to assess both sides of the coil, as one study found geometric distortion between the right and left coil sides of multiple platforms when using echo-planar imaging diffusion techniques (113) . A chest cavity model may need to be added to properly replicate the B 1 homogeneity challenges in breast imaging."}, {"section_title": "Proton-Density Fat Fraction Phantom", "text": "Quantification of fat in the body has many important applications in the liver, heart, and pancreas, as well as in skeletal muscle. Proton-density fat fraction (PDFF) is currently regarded as the most practical and meaningful MR-based biomarker of tissue fat concentration (114) . The PDFF represents the ratio of MR-visible fat protons to the total number of MR-visible water and fat protons.\nThe PDFF phantoms have been used to analyze the accuracy of MR-based PDFF techniques for liver fat quantification (Fig. 3) (115) . This phantom consists of separate vials with approximately 40-mL volume for each, and a different PDFF, typically in the range of 0 to 50% to reflect clinically relevant liver fat fractions. The vials store a gel mixture of peanut oil and deionized water, together with minute concentrations of additional substances to ensure mixture of the oil and water and to prevent spoiling. The PDFF phantoms have also been used to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of PDFF measurements across different sites, vendors, and field strengths (116, 117) .\nA further development to a PDFF phantom includes the need for it to reflect physiologically relevant relaxation (i.e., R \u00c3 2 ) rates. It is important that the R \u00c3 2 values for both the fat component and water component remain similar to one another, which has been measured in vivo (118, 119) ."}, {"section_title": "IMPLEMENTATION OF QUANTITATIVE MRI", "text": "For quantitative MRI to be widely adopted, a framework is required to ensure that the quantitative measures are comparable over time, between subjects, between scanner sites, and between manufacturers. The proposed system phantom and application-specific phantoms are one part of the framework, along with standardized protocols and data collection. With an established framework, quantitative MRI can be used to assess outcomes in clinical trials and for clinical diagnostics. In particular, clinical trials and clinical use of quantitative MRI can benefit from the use of a phantom in many ways, including protocol development, selection of RF coils, training of technologists, quality-control standards, standardized analysis, and correction of collected images, if necessary. This paper discusses the design process, requirements, and recommendations for a phantom to assess the performance and stability of an MRI system. In addition, we reviewed application-specific phantoms that are designed to evaluate the performance of a particular technique. In this final section, we discuss the implementation of quantitative MRI."}, {"section_title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging System Constancy", "text": "System constancy data should be tracked regularly at all MRI systems and especially those doing quantitative measurements. The described system phantom enables assessment of scanner performance over time (stability or constancy) for many parameters. For example, the system phantom can be used to track B 1 and B 0 nonuniformity, geometric nonlinearity, gradient amplitude, image uniformity, SNR, transmitter and receiver gain, receiver bandwidth, image ghosting, and eddy currents, using the methods described in International Electrotechnical Commission 62464-1 (49) . For any stability parameter, prospective criteria should be developed to generate a service call for \"out of specification\" results. Friedman and Glover present the advantages of a quality-control standard for evaluation and acceptance of a new scanner, benchmarks for comparisons with other MRI centers, monitoring system constancy through hardware and software upgrades, and planning of multicenter studies (45) ."}, {"section_title": "Standard Protocols", "text": "A clinical trial requires protocol standardization across participating sites to ensure that conclusions can be drawn from the data. The challenge is to minimize differences in effective acquisition parameters across sites for multicenter studies and across time for multicenter and single-center studies. This is confounded by varying hardware and software configurations within and across manufacturers' platforms. The implication for protocol standardization is that the actual scan protocol may be slightly different across manufacturers to get the same contrast-to-noise ratio required by the analytical technique.\nOne approach uses the strategy of ensuring that specific pulse-sequence parameters are identical, to the degree possible. The advantage of this approach is that it is easy to implement. The disadvantage is that subtle variations in implementation, which are not always known outside of the manufacturer, can cause significant changes in image appearance (e.g., contrast, artifact propagation). Further complications exist even within the manufacturers' platforms over time. Nevertheless, this should be a starting point for protocol definition and standardization.\nClinical use of quantitative MRI requires harmonization, and these efforts are led in part by RSNA QIBA. Clinical trials can build on the work of QIBA to create standard protocols for each technique. The QIBA profiles provide claim statements for quantitative imaging biomarkers within a specified clinical context. These claim statements indicate the reproducibility of the quantitative measurement as determined by existing literature and biomarker-specific groundwork projects. The QIBA profiles provide a list of requisite activities and associated actors to meet the claim statements, as well as assessment procedures to ensure proper quality assurance. These activities can include subject selection and preparation, image acquisition and reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. Profiles undergo a strict vetting procedure within QIBA, and then pass through the stages of public comment, consensus, technical confirmation, claim confirmation, and clinical confirmation, as the profile is adopted and thoroughly tested in the clinical environment. Physical phantoms and virtual phantoms (digital reference objects) are essential in QIBA profiles.\nAn appropriate phantom can be used to refine the \"identical\" protocols, such that the images obtained across platforms are equivalent. This process includes removing any postprocessing steps, which may not be readily apparent to the user. Once a standard protocol is established, all protocols should be provided in an electronic fashion to the sites, if possible, to minimize entry errors at the console. Each site should provide images of an appropriate phantom from the standard protocol as a qualification step to be included in a clinical trial."}, {"section_title": "Standardized Training of Technologists", "text": "The \"gatekeeper\" for image quality is the local technologist (radiographer, technician). It is recommended that uniform training be provided for all sites and that such training consider variations in hardware and software platforms. Such training can be accomplished at a group meeting, individual training visits to the site, and/or by video instructions that provide specific details of the study (e.g., positioning criteria). The phantom should be used to provide hands-on training, and the phantom images will allow the coordinating center to determine whether a site is ready to be included in a clinical trial."}, {"section_title": "Specific Image Analysis Procedures", "text": "A well-designed phantom is useful for developing analysis methods, evaluating how system-to-system error affects results, and correction of images for uniform analysis/error reduction.\nLarge-scale clinical studies of MR images often require the application of quantitative image analysis methods on data sets that were acquired by multiple sites. However, such methods are often developed on data sets from a single MR system vendor and/or scanner model. To evaluate the variability across different MRI systems, the methods should be tested and validated on data sets from multiple scanners with different properties using the same standard protocols.\nAll metadata (e.g., header information) received from clinical trial sites should be checked for protocol adherence. At the beginning of the study, acceptable deviations should be determined (ideally by evaluation of such deviations on the analytical procedure), and the ranges documented in the project manual(s). If a hardware or software upgrade generates parameters outside of the prospective criteria, the effect on analysis should be determined and decision made about whether to drop the site or accept the protocol deviation. If the deviation is acceptable, the initial range perhaps should have been broader. Ideally, all such parameter restrictions should be prospectively determined and based on the actual outcome measure. When feasible, \"electronic protocols\" should be centrally distributed to avoid errors associated with users translating information from written protocols into scanners.\nFor example, Chenevert et al. used an ice-water phantom to compare measurement of ADC across systems, including multiple manufacturers and platforms (120) . The images generated by one of the scanners appeared to have image intensity scaling that was not accounted for by most quantitative image analysis tools. Incorrect image scaling leads to measurement bias, and the scaling of images must be accounted for in the image analysis routine."}, {"section_title": "Future Implications", "text": "The use of MR-based measurements as biomarkers is a driver for developing a framework for quantitative MRI Quantitative MRI Phantoms Reviewadoption, and clinical applications will also benefit considerably from these developments. Of interest, a decade ago, quantitative imaging was seen as the future by the leaders of the radiology community, as reflected by the statement \"the RSNA remains committed to helping to transform Radiology from a qualitative to quantitative science\" (121) . With the advent of methods such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (122) and compressed sensing (123, 124) , quantitative MRI can now be performed in a clinically appropriate timeline; however, quality control with a quantitative MRI phantom is necessary to ensure the accuracy and precision of results. Such sequences and corresponding reconstruction methods develop behavior that significantly differs from that of \"classic\" MRI methods, and a system phantom can provide a way to rigorously characterize the behavior of these methods when standard image quality metrics like SNR are no longer valid. Looking forward, a comprehensive system phantom along with MR imaging acquisition (i.e., pulse sequence), reconstruction, and analysis software and quality assurance recommendations could be an accreditation program for quantitative MRI, similar to the ACR MR Accreditation Program currently in place for qualitative MRI."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Quantitative MRI enables noninvasive measurements of biomarkers pertinent to clinical trials and diagnostic tests. This paper, prepared by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Ad Hoc committe on Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance, describes the need for phantoms, previous standardization attempts, an overview of available phantoms, and the desired features of a system phantom for quantitative MRI. The system phantom is designed to be used for quality control (assessing system constancy) and with the intentions of comparing results across manufacturer systems, hardware and software, across time, and across physiologic ranges at 1.5 T and 3 T. The system phantom prototype was constructed (125) and later commercialized; both the prototype and commercial phantoms were used by the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Ad Hoc committee on Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance for studies of T 1 variation (126, 127) . The full manuscript describing the system phantom is in preparation. The improved accuracy and reproducibility of quantitative results through use of a system phantom should increase statistical power, patient safety, and efficacy and efficiency of clinical trials, and is a critical step toward the full potential of MR biomarkers.\nAny quantitative MRI phantom data need to be easy to analyze, to enable adoption by many different scanner locations and users. This is true both of a general system phantom and application-specific phantoms. It is therefore important that any phantom designed to characterize MRI performance meet certain requirements to be amenable for quantitative analysis. To allow regular quality control, a technologist should be able to position and image the phantom and import the images to the software package, and the analysis software should generate a report with the system status. Another benefit of the system phantom is that it can be used for comparative studies of processing strategies, such as those available from vendors or research groups for quantitative MRI signal models.\nIn this paper, we reviewed the application-specific phantoms developed for certain quantitative MRI techniques. Additional application-specific phantoms are still needed, such as for musculoskeletal techniques and the combination of MRI and positron emission tomography. The components and materials research for the system phantom can be used to develop application-specific phantoms, especially given the proposed modular structure.\nMRI system stability is required for implementation of quantitative MRI, especially to enable biomarkers for diagnostic use. A standardized MR system phantom will support the efforts of the quantitative MRI community, including RSNA QIBA and the National Cancer Institute's Quantitative Imaging Network. Research developments will be enabled by the system phantom, such as acquisition and modeling for relaxometry. A standard system phantom, with SI-traceable components that will be monitored for long-term stability by a national metrology institute, will further facilitate the use of MRI measurements as a biomarker. Most importantly, to support clinical use of quantitative MRI, such a phantom must be adopted by the user community and equipment manufacturers for regular use."}]
