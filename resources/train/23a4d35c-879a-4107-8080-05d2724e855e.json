The trend refl ects changes in the number of children in the population ages 4-6 and their enrollment rate. In 2001, the most common age of enrollment was 5 years old. Between 1977 and 2001, the distribution of kindergartners shifted from half-day to full-day programs. In 1977, a higher percentage of children attended a half-day than a full-day program (73 vs. 27 percent). By 1995, this distribution had reversed, and in 2001, full-day kindergarten was generally more common than half-day kindergarten, with 60 percent of kindergartners attending full day and 40 percent attending half day. Enrollment among 4-to 6-year-olds in kindergarten increased from 1977 to 2001, as did the proportion of students enrolled full day.

Total undergraduate enrollment in degree-granting postsecondary institutions has generally increased in the past three decades and is projected to continue doing so throughout the next 10 years. These increases have been accompanied by changes in students' attendance status, the type of institution attended, and the proportion of students who are women. In the next decade, full-time undergraduate enrollment is expected to increase at a faster rate than parttime enrollment, and 4-year undergraduate enrollment-which has also increased over the past three decades-is expected to increase at a faster rate than enrollment in 2-year institutions. Women's undergraduate enrollment, which exceeds that of men, is projected to continue growing at a faster rate than men's in the next 10 years. In the next 10 years, undergraduate enrollment in 4-year institutions is projected to increase faster than in 2-year institutions and women's enrollment is expected to increase faster than men's.
