The developed integrated statistical-experimental methodology could serve as a roadmap for investigations in other disorders.\nThe joint modelling of brain imaging information and genetic data is a promising research avenue to highlight the functional role of genes in determining the pathophysiological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, since genome-wide association (GWA) studies are essentially limited to the exploration of statistical correlations between genetic variants and phenotype, the validation and interpretation of the findings is usually non trivial and prone to false positives.\nTo address this issue, in this work we investigate the genetic functional mechanisms underlying brain atrophy in AD by studying the involvement of candidate variants in known genetic regulatory functions. This approach, here termed functional prioritization, aims at testing the sets of gene-variants identified by high-dimensional multivariate statistical modelling with respect to known biological processes, in order to introduce a biology-driven validation scheme. When applied to the ADNI cohort, the functional prioritization allowed identifying a link between TRIB3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3) and the stereotypical pattern of grey matter loss in AD, which was confirmed in an independent validation sample, and that provides novel evidence about the relation between this gene and known mechanisms of neurodegeneration. \\body Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology still remains largely concealed. In the anticipation of increasing prevalence of AD and other dementias, there is an urgent need for improving the understanding of the disease processes that underlie neurodegeneration. Whilst the knowledge about the genetic and environmental risks underpinning AD is steadily advancing, our understanding of how these factors interact to lead to the complex pathophysiology that results in dementia is less understood.\nAdvances in imaging technologies have led to non-or minimally-invasive imaging biomarkers that capture various aspects of the disease process including amyloid deposition [1] , tau pathology [2] , functional decline [3] and neuronal loss [4] .\nCombining such imaging information with genetic measurements -so called imaging-genetics -provides the means for investigating the effect of genetic variation on underlying biological mechanisms [5] .\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) query millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) individually for their association with either case-control status [6] or disease-specific quantitative phenotypes, e.g., in the case of AD, regional brain volumes [7] or brain amyloid burden [8] . Mass univariate analysis of genetic data is still the predominant method, in virtue of its ease-of-use and well-established theoretical framework, albeit suffering from significant limitations including the requirement for multiple testing, redundancies introduced by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the lack of analysis of epistatic effects (e.g., SNP-SNP interactions), which have to be explicitly modeled and searched for exhaustively [9] . Moreover, more than one quantitative phenotype can be derived from the available imaging data, e.g., dozens or hundreds of regional brain volumes, or hundreds of thousands of voxellevel metrics [10] . This potentially large number of genotype-phenotypes features of interest generally complicates the problem of reliably detecting statistical associations, and thus hampers the identification of disease-relevant genetic markers by purely statistical means.\nLimitations of classical mass-univariate statistical methods have in recent years been overcome by employing multivariate approaches to data analysis in the context of neuroscience studies [11] and GWAS [12] . Likewise, in imaging-genetics meaningful genotype-phenotype interactions [13] are captured by simultaneously modeling sets of genetic variants that are jointly associated with a given imaging phenotype [14, 15, 16, 17] . Multivariate GWAS have the potential to shed light on the complex genotype-phenotype relationship, and may thus highlight novel links between brain physiology and molecular and biological functions. However, although these methods have proven their ability to identify meaningful SNP combinations associated to brain imaging features, the interpretation and validation of the statistical findings remain very challenging tasks. These problems relate directly to the understanding of the functional role of sets of genetic variants, and to the difficulty of replicating the statistical results in unseen cohorts.\nWe approach this technical bottleneck by leveraging multivariate approaches to explore high-dimensional datasets and to generate hypotheses, which are subsequently tested in downstream experiments. High-quality databases of matched genotype and gene expression measurements such as GTEx 1 [18] and BRAINEAC 2 [19] facilitate the quantification of effects of SNPs on gene expression in numerous tissues, including various brain tissues. Typically, these databases are used to detail the effect of a genetic variant at the very end of an analysis pipeline and to garner evidence for molecular mechanisms of the genetic locus. However, functional information in 'convenience' databases can also be used at an earlier stage in the analysis in order to prioritize a few candidate hypotheses with a clear functional mechanism (e.g., expression quantitative trait loci; eQTL) for the validation phase and thus limit the multiple testing burden.\nIn this work we apply this novel investigative approach to study the genetic functional mechanisms underlying brain atrophy in AD. The framework is comprised of two steps: i) Statistical discovery. Candidate genetic variants are initially identified through data-driven multivariate statistical analysis of the matched imaging and genetics data. This is achieved by modeling the joint covariation between 1. The resulting small set of genetic loci, which are shown to modify gene expression, is then validated in an independent sample of 553 individuals from ADNI diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a proportion of whom progressed to AD.\nCompared to previous approaches our work (i) analyses the whole genome and whole brain in a hypothesis free fashion, i.e., without preselecting SNPs or brain regions and (ii) uses a functional prioritization step in order to select genetic loci for validation in an independent cohort.\nStarting from the initial ~1.1 million SNPs, the multivariate statistical analysis This study ultimately offers an illustration of the potential of effectively combining multivariate statistical modeling in imaging-genetics with recent instruments available from computational biology, to lead to novel insights on the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration. The components were very robust (100% reproducible) during the stability selection procedure (Supplementary Methods). The fourth and fifth components did not present any relevant locations (i.e., all bins have p<0.95) after stability selection for both the genetic modality and for the imaging modality."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model training and estimated components", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Genetic components", "text": "The circular Manhattan plot (Circos v0.96 [20] ) of Figure 2 shows the PLS weights and the selection frequency for the PLS genotype components, describing the importance of the genetic loci associated to cortical thickness variation for component In the genetic components 1 through 3 a total of 118 bins exceeded the selection frequency threshold (61, 50, 7 for component 1,2 and 3, respectively). From these bins 402 (196, 181 and 25) influential SNPs were extracted and annotated with 98 genes through the computational VEP analysis. The extended APOE locus comprising APOE and TOMM40 was selected as the highest scoring region in component 1. A total of 3,956 candidate SNP-gene pairs were considered for the GTEx-based eQTL analysis in six tissues. However, a few genes did not show sufficient expression levels in some tissues and these combinations were excluded from the analysis, resulting in 1,598 unique SNP-gene-tissue tests, of those 104 were significant at the Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold (p=3.1e-5) (Table S1) linking to 14 genes (Table S2 ; Figure S5 ): CAPN9, CRYL1, FAM135B, IL10RA, IP6K3, ITGA1, KIN, LAMC1, LINC00941, LYSMD4, RBPMS2, RP11-181K3.4, TM2D1, and TRIB3.\nThe independent validation of those 14 genes in the MCI cohort confirmed TRIB3 (p=0.0034) ( Table 2 ). Three additional genes were (close to) nominal significance: TM2D1 (p=0.053), LAMC1 (p=0.062), and RP11-181K3.4 (p=0.053) ( Table 2 ). Of note the top eQTL SNP for TRIB3 rs4813620 received a p=0.06175 in stage I of a large AD GWAS [6] . However, rs62191440, a SNP in strong LD with rs4813620 (D'=0.8469; r2=0.6559) in the European population [21] , received a p-value of 0.00601 ( Figure S6 ) and also constitutes an eQTL for TRIB3 in various tissues in GTEx including brain tissues cortex and caudate ganglia ( Figure S7 ). Interestingly, when estimating the PLS components on the sub-cohort of 279 training individuals with positive CSF amyloid (Table 1) we identified compatible validation results on the independent testing MCI group. Within this setting, TRIB3 still leads to marginally significant differences (p=0.0134) between progressing and stable MCI, although not significant after correction for multiple comparison (Table S3) .

TRIB3 is a pseudokinase which acts as a regulator of several signaling pathways. For example it can interact directly with Akt and inhibit the pro-survival pro-survival Akt pathway [22] . TRIB3 expression is induced during neuronal cell death [23] and recently increased levels of the TRIB3 protein were found in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta in patients with Parkinson's disease [24] . TRIB3 expression is stress induced and increases in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation; endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, and amino acid deprivation [23] . Although a role for TRIB3 in dementia has not been extensively explored, there are several aspects of TRIB3 function that have relevance to known mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease. TRIB3 can interact directly with P62 to modulate autophagic flux [25] , an important process in maintaining cellular homeostasis that is known to be disrupted in neurodegeneration [26] . Knockdown of TRIB3 modulates PSEN1 stability [25] and a yeast two-hybrid screen identified progranulin as a direct interaction partner of TRIB3 [27] . Intriguingly, it has recently been demonstrated that TRIB3 induces both apoptosis and autophagy in A\u03b2-induced neuronal death, and silencing of TRIB3 was strongly neuroprotective [28] . These links warrant further investigation for a functional role of TRIB3 in neuronal death in dementia.\nThese earlier findings align with our eQTL analysis where carriers of the minor allele show increased TRIB3 expression ( Figure S5 ), which potentially lowers the threshold to TRIB3 mediated neuronal cell death. TRIB3 expression was modulated by the identified SNP in various other tissues including the caudate ( Figure S7 ), a region affected in PD and Huntington's disease. A recent study of Trib3 expression in mice concluded that \"Trib3 has a pathophysiological role in diabetes\" [29] ; diabetes itself is a known risk factor for dementia [30] perhaps through shared metabolic processes with AD [31] . Interestingly, one of the three SNPs (rs1555318) selected in the PLS model and attributed to TRIB3 showed a strong association with type-2 diabetes in stage 1 of a large GWAS (p=4.4e-4; Figure S8 ) [32] . Other GWAS showed links between TRIB3 and information processing speed (p=1.7e-7) [33] and AD (p=0.006; [6] ). An earlier genetic study on AD in Swedish men found an association in TRIB3 as well (p=0.044; [34] ), which was replicated in a Canadian cohort (p<0.001 ; [35] ).\nLastly, TRIB3 was reported to physically interact with APP [36] and it shares numerous functional annotations for biological processes regarding lipid metabolism with APOE.\nThe functional prioritization component of the analysis successfully reduced the set of candidate genetic variants for the independent validation, however, this prioritization has a shortcoming: it hypothesizes that identified SNPs alter the expression of a nearby gene. Although, this scheme led to the identification of TRIB3 in the cortical thickness phenotype, it did miss a long-established AD risk gene: APOE. SNPs belonging to APOE (rs429358 and rs7412) were selected as highest scoring SNPs in component 1. However, none of them was detected as an eQTL and thus APOE was excluded from the downstream analysis. Other types of functional prioritizations based on exonic function prediction may have retained APOE and other genes in the pipeline. However, SNPs data typically features only a few non-synonymous exonic variants and their high frequency (MAF >5%) renders them unlikely to receive significant 'damaging' scores in these predictions. Thus, for this scenario the use of these function predictions would be limited.\nThe list of genes we identified contains other interesting candidates. For instance, IL10RA (interleukin 10 receptor subunit alpha) is a receptor for interleukin 10 (IL10), a cytokine that controls inflammatory response [37] . Carriers of the minor allele show increased IL10RA expression ( Figure S5 ) and Il10ra expression is increased in affected brain regions with increasing age and presence of AD pathology in transgenic mouse models of AD (MOUSEAC; [38] Figure S9 ). Moreover, a link between downregulation of IL10RA and TRIB3 in TRIB3-silenced HepG2 cells was reported in [25] , along with increased abundance of Presenilin 1, ApoE3, and Clusterin. Finally, blocking IL10 response was recently suggested as a therapeutic mechanism in AD [39] . A gene that showed a statistical trend in the validation sample was TM2D1 (TM2 domain containing 1), which is a beta-amyloid binding protein and may be involved in beta-amyloid-induced apoptosis [40] . Further, MEF2A (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2A), like APOE, was filtered out by the functional prioritization.\nHowever, MEF2A is a paralog of MEF2C, which is an established AD gene [6] .\nNoteworthy, bins covering MEF2C only barely missed the selection threshold in component 2 for further analysis (max p=0.926; Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Considerations", "text": "The experimental setting proposed in this study is based on the investigation of Splitting the available AD and CT subjects into discovery and validation cohort, would have dramatically reduced the sample size, thus increasing the uncertainty of the PLS findings.\nConcerning the number of components analyzed in the PLS model, we limited the study to the exploration of the first five eigen-modes. As shown in the experimental results, the stability of PLS parameters of the high-order components was generally quite low and did not lead to any significant results after permutation testing. For this reason, we believe that extending the analysis to higher-order components (e.g., components six to ten) would not change the proposed analysis and subsequent results.\nThe relevance assessment procedure proposed in this study relies on the choice of statistical significance thresholds, such as the 10% cutoff on the magnitude of the PLS weights, and p<0.05 for the selection frequency over the 1,000,000 folds. These thresholds were not optimized to maximize specific statistical outcome (e.g. the ratio between true and false positives). Indeed, the optimization of these parameters may lead to important methodological issues such as overfitting and selection bias [42] , and ultimately lead to poor generalization of the statistical findings. This is particularly true in the challenging setting proposed in this work, characterized by large dimensions and low sample size. For this reason, we chose to use standard cutoffs for significance assessment as a compromise between minimizing this important source of bias while still identifying meaningful genotype and phenotype features. Furthermore, we believe that the ultimate approach to assess the validity of the findings is through testing on genuinely independent data, such as on the MCI cohort proposed in this study."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This study illustrates the potential of effectively combining multivariate statistical modeling in imaging-genetics with recent instruments available from computational biology, to lead to novel insights on the disease pathophysiology.

Surfaces are then registered parametrically to achieve point-to-point correspondence by matching curvature and medial curve-based features [45, 46] "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Discovery", "text": "The joint relationship between the genetic and imaging modalities was investigated through partial least squares (PLS) modeling [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53] . Among the several PLS versions proposed in the literature we focus on the symmetric formulation of PLS computed through the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the cross covariance matrix ( Figure S1) [51, 52, 54] . Within this setting, the aim of PLS is to estimate the latent components that maximize the global covariance between the two input modalities. Each input feature receives a weight in the latent component that represents its relative importance for describing the global joint multimodal relationship. Analyzing these weights helps identifying SNPs that are linked to the patterns of cortical thinning in the brain.\nIn this study we applied a robust approach for the stable estimation and interpretation of PLS weights in genome-wide genotyping data, aimed at promoting sparsity (i.e., selecting only few features for simplified interpretation) and regularity (by aggregating SNPs within the same genetic neighborhood). This is achieved through a stability selection procedure in which the reproducibility and robustness of the PLS parameters is assessed through a split-half cross-validation based scheme on 1,000,000 repetitions of the models on randomly sampled subgroups (Figure 1 A similar procedure was employed to assess the importance of the phenotype component ( Figure 1 ). However, no regional binning was employed ( Figure 3 ).\nThe procedure was applied to assess the parameter reproducibility of the first five PLS modes; subsequent analyses were performed only on components with relevant genetic and brain regions (i.e., reproducible PLS weights with selection frequency >95%).

These weights are the ones contributing to the high selection frequency in the split-half procedure, and are representative of the significant variation modeled in the data. Focusing on the features associated with these weights allows us to restrict the functional prioritization on a SNPs subset of reduced dimensionality, by focusing only on the most representative elements.\nIn order to link SNPs to corresponding genes we used the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for GRCh37 (date accessed: 17 th October 2016) [55] with the GENCODE gene annotation.
