"}, {"section_title": "Academic Programs", "text": "Following adoption of the university's strategic plan (Phase I), the vision and mission statements became the standards to chart a new course for the university while ensuring that WSU remains dedicated to the livelihood of those who call Kansas home. WSU's academic colleges/units (College of Education, College of Engineering, College of Fine Arts, College of Health Professions, Dorothy and Bill Cohen Honors College, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, W. Frank Barton School of Business, Institute for Interdisciplinary Creativity, University Libraries) were tasked with clarifying and adopting strategies to support the overall mission. Phase II of the strategic planning process involved each of these core academic units (with the exception of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Creativity, which is just now being formalized). During the 2013-2014 academic year, each college and department was tasked with clarifying and adopting strategies that supported the overall mission by developing its own strategic plans. Other areas of the university such as Career Development and Online Learning also became active in the strategic planning process and adopted goals developed for day-to-day operations. As an essential educational driver WSU provides 58 bachelor and 57 graduate programs, with 77 percent of undergraduates and 55 percent of graduate students attending full-time. The university mission is supported through local, national and international partnerships, and WSU students achieve success through such endeavors as the Cooperative Education and Work-Based Learning program housed in Career Development. Many students gain experiences through these educational opportunities and are provided paid positions with local employers, thus helping to stimulate the local economy. Approximately 70 percent of WSU undergraduates remain employed in Kansas following graduation. WSU has one of the highest post-graduate employment rates in Kansas for those completing bachelor degrees in comparison to all other four-year Kansas universities. This demonstrates that the university is meeting part of its mission as an economic driver in the state, as well as a cultural driver with broad-based student opportunities. Likewise, WSU's international student population contributes significantly to the local diversity and economy when they choose to study here."}, {"section_title": "Student Support Services", "text": "WSU undergraduate and graduate students are provided support services that assist their academic needs while maintaining a clear focus on the mission of the university. Support services include: Academic advising through each academic college; OneStop for Student Services, launched in 2014, a centralized physical and virtual location for assistance with admissions, financial aid, records and registration; Housing through the Division of Student Affairs; Freshman year success through the Graduation Partnership, a focus of the WSU quality improvement initiative; Basic health care through Student Health Services; Governance, support and advocacy through the Student Government Association; Various campus activities organized and managed through Student Affairs; Personal and academic counseling through college advising offices and the Office of Student Success; Career counseling, career workshops and employment opportunities through the Office of Career Development and the Cooperative Education and Work-Based Learning program; Health and physical fitness opportunities including intramural athletics through the Heskett Center and Campus Recreation; and TRIO programs, a set of federally-funded college opportunity programs that motivate and support students from disadvantaged backgrounds in their pursuit of a college degree. Student satisfaction with WSU's student services staff was rated on the 2015 National Survey of Student Engagement at a mean value of 5.1 on a 7-point scale, where 1 is poor and 7 is excellent. Similarly, student satisfaction with other administrative offices was rated at 5.0 and academic advisers at 5.1. This information is measured on a biennial basis. In comparison to WSU peers, the mean value of satisfaction with student services staff was 5.0, satisfaction with other administrative offices was 4.8, and satisfaction with academic advisers was 5.1; WSU scored slightly higher on satisfaction with student services staff (5.1 compared to 5.0) and slightly higher on satisfaction with other administrative staff (5.1 compared to 4.8). These data indicate WSU is in alignment with its peers in providing satisfactory student services. Likewise, through May 2016, close to 90 percent of students have been satisfied with OneStop agents in terms of their ability to solve student issues or provide appropriate next steps."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Profile", "text": "From the perspective of WSU's mission to be an essential education driver and serve the greater public good coupled with its vision to be internationally recognized as the model for applied learning and research, the university community believes the profile of WSU's student body should mirror the surrounding college-ready population. The university strives to achieve a population at least as diverse as the local community. WSU students come from a varied range of traditional and nontraditional backgrounds, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, socio-economic statuses and academic abilities. The majority of undergraduate students at WSU are white non-Hispanic (62.6 percent). The next two major categories of race and ethnicity are Hispanic (10.3 percent) and black non-Hispanic (5.4 percent). Asian non-Hispanic students and non-resident international students comprise the next largest set of students (7.0 percent and 7.3 percent respectively). By contrast, in Sedgwick County, Wichita's surrounding county, the white population (78.7 percent) is higher than the university's profile, as are the black (9.2 percent) and Hispanic (10.8 percent) populations (persons 18 years old and older, including those not eligible for college attendance). First-generation students account for more than 40 percent of the WSU undergraduate population -the highest among all Kansas public universities."}, {"section_title": "1.B -Core Component 1.B", "text": "The mission is articulated publicly. 1.

The statements are published through its main website, in the undergraduate and graduate catalogs, and in campus signage. With an average of 2.2 million unique visitors each year, the university website is the primary method for disseminating and documenting the WSU mission. WSU's strategic plan includes the mission and vision statements, as well as key goals, plans and priorities. The plan document is readily available on the university website and is frequently presented in public forums by WSU's president, other university leaders, departments and programs. The plan has been summarized for wide, public dissemination in the booklet Real-World Ideas for Real-World Impact. Additionally, the mission and vision statements are articulated frequently through social media, newsletters (AY2015, 2016, 2017) university advertising, and in the WSU president's annual campus address every August (2013,2014,2015,2016). The mission is articulated further by programs and activities that have been and are being developed to carry it out. Mission, vision and core-value signage can be found in every major campus building and athletic facility. All divisions, colleges, departments and programs support the mission's core responsibilities of innovation and applied learning. The support is carefully tracked through alignment between college and department goals, and the university's mission and vision. This is assured through a review process in which colleges must demonstrate close adherence to WSU's mission (see program review assessments, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and annual strategic planning assessments, 2015, 2016). -1.B.2. -WSU works systematically to build its specific plans around the stated mission, vision, goals and priorities articulated in its strategic plan. Status reports on the strategic plan are issued by the president's office (2015,2016). Based on results achieved through the university's strategic planning process, several tangible changes have occurred that can be seen through the construction and revitalization of several campus buildings. The innovation university plans offer unprecedented opportunities to serve the public good by allowing educational opportunities through partnership with the community, business and faculty. This, in turn, provides students with abundant applied learning and research opportunities. WSU's National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR), which has a 30-year history of working with industry and university organizations such as Ennovar (the new Institute of Emerging Technology and Market Solutions), the Applied Psychology Research Institute and the Human Performance Lab, are taking the lead. New endeavors emerging as part of the innovation university initiative, such as WSU Ventures, the Ideas Lab and Shocker Startup, demonstrate a keen awareness of the importance of education, economic development and cultural growth inherent in WSU's mission. Seven goals drive the university's current strategic plan and further articulate the WSU mission. 1. Guarantee an applied learning or research experience for every student by each academic program. Work is just beginning to guarantee an applied learning or research experience for every student. As a baseline, 2015 data indicate 40 percent of all degree programs currently provide this experience. In 2016, the strategic planning steering committee operationalized plans to guarantee this experience for all students. WSU's program for undergraduate research grants is one example of how applied research is promoted. Sixty-seven undergraduate research grants have been awarded to students since FY 2013. Another example of how students may gain an applied learning or research experience is through construction of the engineering experiential building with a maker space where faculty, staff, students and community members will have the opportunity to work with practitioners in their fields to test ideas and gain real-world experience. (See 1.A.1. and 1.D.1.) 2. Pioneer an educational experience for all that integrates interdisciplinary curricula across the university. Innovative new programs such as the Honors Baccalaureate, an interdisciplinary degree, are early evidence of the university's commitment to this aspect of its mission. A new master's degree in innovation design aligns not only with the university's research focus, but the innovation university. It is housed in the new Institute for Interdisciplinary Creativity. 3. Capitalize systemically on relevant existing and emerging societal and economic trends that increase quality educational opportunities. The university's online expansion represents a commitment to increase quality educational experiences for non-traditional learners with 16 program offerings. Developing just-in-time academic programming can be found in the College of Health Professions' for-credit badge in public health. 4. Accelerate the discovery, creation and transfer of new knowledge. Innovation, research and entrepreneurship have always been at the forefront of university initiatives. After all, two WSU college students started Pizza Hut in 1958. WSU Ventures was formed in 2014 as the epicenter to encourage technology transfer at WSU. Intellectual property disclosures have doubled and span across multiple university departments (19 in 2014 to 41 in 2015). Patent applications have nearly doubled (seven in 2014 and 20 in 2015). Licensing agreements have increased significantly (one in 2014 and six in 2015). 5. Empower students to create a campus culture and experience that meets their changing needs. Students are empowered to be change agents and advocates for themselves and their peers through such means as service on university committees, on-campus employment, climate and other survey feedback, and the Student Government Association. With more than 200 student organizations to choose from, students can focus on special interests or causes that hold value for them or create a new organization if their needs are not met with a pre-existing organization. One student-led change initiative involved renovations to the Grace Memorial Chapel to be inclusive of a variety of faith practices, rather than being predominately suited to Judeo-Christian faiths. 6. Be a campus that reflects -in staff, faculty and students -the evolving diversity of society. WSU is committed to diversity among faculty, staff and students in ways that reflect the community around the university. WSU is the most racially diverse public university in the state, with 15.3 percent of its student body (as of Fall 2015) consisting of under-represented minority students. Recent hiring in the College of Engineering, for example, continues to expand in quality with 12 new faculty members in 2015, five of whom are women and two are Hispanic. The President's Diversity Council and offices of Equal Employment Opportunity (2014,2015), Tilford Commission, and Diversity and Inclusion are committed to improvements in this area. 7. Create a new model of assessment, incentive and reward processes to accomplish our (WSU) vision and goals. Faculty are re-evaluating tenure and promotion guidelines to better align with the university mission. The first step was the recent passage by the Faculty Senate of the UniSCOPE scholarship model. The rationale for this model is that the current system for recognizing and rewarding faculty scholarship shows preference for rewarding basic research and teaching over other forms of scholarship. Goal 7 calls for a new model that supports an understanding of other forms of scholarship and how they can be effectively integrated into the promotion and tenure process. WSU faculty believe scholarship must be understood broadly enough to adequately address the needs of the professions and the public. The next step is for all WSU colleges to revisit and redesign their tenure and promotion polices around the UniSCOPE model. -1.B.3. -WSU sets goals and objectives based upon its stated mission, vision and values. Further, individual colleges, departments and other units build goals and objectives to support the larger university goals. In this way, the mission, vision and values serve as crucial foundational documents. The mission -to be an essential educational, cultural and economic driver for Kansas and the greater public good -links WSU closely to the communities of Kansas and the Midwest region. It suggests inter-reliance between the surrounding community and the university, engaging business, industry, civic and government leaders to ensure that critical educational, cultural and economic needs of the surrounding community, region and state are met. Examples of how WSU links to its constituents include WSU South, West, and Old Town locations. WSU strives to offer educational and programmatic venues appropriate to the groups near these locations. Old Town is a natural fit with the university's mission to be an essential provider of educational services to Wichita. A number of its community-focused organizations are located there (or slated to be by 2017) including: KMUW Wichita Public Radio; Center for Management Development; Center for Economic Development and Business Research; Community Engagement Institute; Center for Combating Human Trafficking; College of Health Professions' Training and Technology Team; and Physician Assistant and Physical Therapy graduate degree programs. The focus of the guiding vision -that WSU be internationally recognized as a model for applied learning and research -is on serving students through an educational program designed to equip them to be ready to lead and engage on day one after graduation, in an ever-competitive global marketplace. This advantage is fostered through the Office of Career Development and employerbased learning opportunities in an innovation university. Honesty, integrity, personal responsibility, collegiality, knowledge creation and education are universal values that always have underscored the culture at WSU. To accomplish the university's strategic plan, the following values were adopted to guide the university's planning and priorities: (1) seizing opportunities; (2) success for all stakeholders; (3) diversity of culture, thought and experience; (4) adaptive approaches; (5) teamwork; and (6) positive risk-taking. These values call for a continued close working relationship between university faculty, staff and administration. This is evidenced by the way the university's mission, vision and values were developed in a community-wide effort, and the way in which various colleges and departments have continued to develop goals to support them. Further, the values emphasize WSU's entrepreneurial spirit in its approach to innovation, commitment to inclusion, and readiness to work creatively at addressing needs and opportunities that will benefit citizens in the Wichita area, Kansas and the Midwest region.\n-1.C.1. -Wichita State University's mission -to be an essential educational, cultural, and economic driver for Kansas and the greater public good -establishes a clear role for the university in a diverse society. The mission implies that building and sustaining a multicultural society is one of the university's priorities. WSU addresses this priority by welcoming broad diversity that will foster collaboration and grow innovation, reaching out not just locally but nationally and internationally. Further, WSU is committed to developing a campus community that reflects the diversity of its surrounding city and region as stated in Goal 6 -to reflect the evolving diversity of society -of the seven goals (see 1.B.2.) listed in WSU's strategic plan. In turn, those goals influenced the university's core values of seizing opportunities; success for all stakeholders; diversity of culture, thought and experience; adaptive approaches; teamwork; and positive risk-taking. One example of how WSU is addressing its role in a multicultural society is the recent establishment of the President's Diversity Council, an advisory and leadership team responsible for developing, overseeing and monitoring university-wide efforts to achieve WSU's commitment to diversity as a core institutional and educational value. Its mission is to promote collaboration and communication by bringing together representatives from constituency groups to actualize diversity goals and objectives. As such, the primary responsibilities of the President's Diversity Council are to: Facilitate the coordination of campus diversity efforts and encourage collaboration among groups working on diversity issues; and Serve as a consultative body for the president on diversity issues. Documentation of the council's work can be found in its minutes and includes activities such as university diversity open forums and participation in the strategic enrollment process. An LGBTQ climate study was conducted in 2015, which is now being used to inform the university, such as the need for single-occupancy restrooms and other types of programming. Other projects in the works include conducting a baseline university-wide climate survey fall 2016. -1.C.2. -WSU has developed benchmarks to guide its work to develop greater student diversity, drawing on the Kansas Board of Regent's Foresight 2020 goals (see also WSU priority matrix). To date, 15.3 percent of WSU undergraduate students are identified as under-represented minorities; that's an increase from 13.2 percent in 2010. Increasing the number of undergraduate certificates and degrees awarded to under-represented minorities is a priority goal for WSU as outlined in the performance agreement reported annually to KBOR. From an expected baseline of 258 annually, 301 were awarded in academic year 2014 and 302 in 2015. Sample initiatives to recruit, retain and graduate more under-represented minorities include: Spanish services through Office of Admissions personnel who oversee recruitment of ethnic minorities, with an emphasis on under-represented minorities; Multicultural visit programs and other ethnic minority outreach programming; Deploying recruitment representatives to schools in highly diverse Kansas communities such as Wichita, Garden City, Dodge City and Kansas City; Increasing recruitment scholarships for under-represented minorities (URM); Adding retention scholarships for disadvantaged students transitioning to their second, third and fourth year; and Transition programs for first-generation students and services through the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (see below), including a lavender graduation recognition for LGBTQ and ally students. WSU has several offices and programs dedicated to increasing and addressing human diversity, as well as supporting the diversity of faculty, staff and students, including those listed herein. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) has a new, more prominent campus home in the newly remodeled Rhatigan Student Center. The ODI seeks to cultivate and sustain an inclusive campus that strives for academic excellence by creating an environment that educates, empowers and mobilizes WSU students, campus and community. It creates and maintains connections with various groups on and off campus, and co-sponsors their events to provide the WSU community wider variety and better quality in multicultural programming. The Office of Disability Services (reports to the Office of Special Programs, see below) annually serves approximately 400 students with various disabilities. The office provides students, parents and faculty with a wide range of resources designed to help people with disabilities integrate into the campus community and succeed in their academic efforts. A new Title IX office (and coordinator) was established in 2016 to increase awareness of and compliance with Title IX regulations. The Title IX coordinator is a member of the President's Diversity Council (see also 2.A.). The University Libraries Gordon Parks digital collection showcases the artistic versatility of a prolific African-American artist and Kansas native son who achieved success as a poet, novelist, composer, film director, pre-eminent documentary photojournalist and fashion photographer. The bulk of the material documents the last three decades of his life and career. The Gordon Parks Papers formally opened to the public as part of the university's fall 2012 celebration of the centennial of Parks' birth. Use of the collection is incorporated into English 101 writing assignments. The WSU Ulrich Museum of Art holds a permanent collection of Gordon Parks' photography work. The Office of International Education is primarily responsible for all aspects of interaction with international students and scholars, providing two main areas of service: (1) support and assistance necessary to achieve personal, educational and professional goals; and (2) assurance of institutional compliance with U.S. immigration regulations that govern students' visa status. In addition to serving international students, scholars, faculty and staff, International Education serves domestic students through its Study Abroad program. Led by the Office of Academic Affairs, the Tilford Commission (named after late Graduate School dean Michael Tilford, a statewide promoter of diversity) is a campus-wide group of faculty, staff, students and administrators dedicated to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in all areas of the university community. The commission hosts faculty and staff development events, leads efforts to diversify curriculum and helps coordinate efforts across campus to address diversity-related issues. The commission is the primary entity on campus that advocates for and promotes the recruitment and retention of a diverse faculty and staff. Recent success is illustrated in the College of Engineering with the hiring of 12 new faculty members in 2015, five of whom are women and two are Hispanic. The Office of Special Programs administers 12 wholly or partially federally-funded TRIO and GEAR UP programs that provide comprehensive services to low-income, first-generation students, ethnic minorities, and students with disabilities from sixth grade through college graduation. WSU is a leader among other universities in the number of TRIO programs, several of which have been on campus for 50 years, including programs focusing on preparing students for careers in math and science, the pursuit of graduate education, veteran transitions, returning adult transitions, and students with disabilities. When combined, WSU's TRIO programs serve an average of 2,900 students annually, with GEAR UP programs serving an additional 4,350 students.\n\n-2.C.1. -\n-2.D. -\n-3.A.1. -\n\n-3.C.1. - The Kansas Board of Regents provides guidance to determine sufficient numbers of faculty for classroom and non-classroom roles -e.g., for curriculum oversight (see 3.A.1.) and assessing student performance in majors, as outlined in KBOR program review policy. Undergraduate programs are required to have at least three faculty members. Departments with master's degree programs have a requirement for an additional three, and doctoral programs require an additional two. Each department is responsible for ensuring it has a sufficient number of faculty per this policy. Programs that do not meet the minimum number of faculty are triggered annually and required to provide a justification and remedy for the trigger. Program review ensures that sufficient numbers of tenure-track faculty are available for all degree programs for all aspects of classroom and non-classroom activities. Programs that do not meet these requirements are triggered in the KBOR minima report, to which the university responds to KBOR by written explanation with input from program faculty. The number of triggered programs has decreased, as university administration has worked closely with each program and corresponding dean to fill gaps in expectations. For example, in 2015 there were 11 triggered programs for tenure-track faculty numbers. All had positions filled with nontenure-track faculty who had the relevant credentials and/or experience needed to teach in the program. The consolidated faculty report details the ages and number of faculty members employed at WSU to ensure continuity. The report includes the number of retirements, terminations and resignations of faculty members; the number of tenure appointments; the number and percentage of pay increases; counts by rank, sex and ethnicity; and a summary of full-time equivalent positions. These indicators help KBOR as well as the university monitor the number of faculty employed. Faculty counts are monitored to ensure appropriate coverage of educational offerings. In WSU's latest Higher Learning Commission annual institutional update, steady increases in full-time equivalent faculty have occurred with the most recent student-to-faculty ratio being reported as 18:1. The ratio has decreased over time, which is in line with WSU's peer institutions. Faculty and staff engage in a variety of non-classroom activities including serving as advisers to student organizations and judging student awards and competitions. -3.C.2. -WSU does not have contractual or consortia arrangements for academic programs; however, it participates in concurrent enrollment programs in local high schools. As part of the hiring or appointment process, anyone considered for a teaching position (on a WSU campus or in a high school) must go through a credentialing process. This process includes policy on minimum degree requirements or experience for appointment. Faculty teaching graduate courses must be nominated for an appointment to the graduate faculty. All teaching and graduate faculty (see teaching, graduate and concurrent faculty rosters) possess an academic degree relevant to what they are teaching and at least one level above the level at which they teach, except in programs for terminal degrees or when equivalent experience is established. In terminal degree programs, faculty may possess the same level of degree. When faculty are employed based on equivalent experience, departments provide appropriate documentation at the time of appointment or attainment. -3.C.3. - The general policy for evaluations is that all faculty, with half-time or more appointments, and unclassified professionals who have teaching responsibilities amounting to 50 percent or more of their workload are to be evaluated at least once a year regardless of whether they are in Academic Affairs. Lecturers who are appointed on a semester basis are evaluated at the end of each semester by the department chair. Detailed policies and procedures for evaluation of faculty/instructors are provided in Chapter 4, specifically section 4.22 of the WSU Policies and Procedures Manual. This policy includes information on who evaluates the faculty/instructor (department chair, with review by the dean and associate vice president for Academic Affairs in charge of administration) and how the evaluation is to be documented (see faculty activity record). If the faculty/instructor does not meet minimum expectations, a process is followed for remediation through the chronic low performance policy. For tenure-track faculty, policy calls for a seven-year probationary period. Leading up to the sixth year, an annual review of tenure-track faculty is conducted by the tenured members of the department. A record of performance documents progress toward consideration for continuous tenure. During the sixth year, faculty are reviewed for tenure and promotion (if applicable). Policy 4.18 details those review procedures. If tenure is denied, a terminal contract is issued for the seventh year. Chapter 4 of the Policies and Procedure Manual details the full list of policies associated with the tenure and promotion process. -3.C.4. -Professional development and continuing professional education are essential elements in an institution's quest for academic quality. Increasing effectiveness in teaching, research and service is expected of each faculty member. The institution has opportunities for faculty to obtain resources for professional growth. For example, and within the limits of its capabilities, WSU provides funds for travel to support professional development. Each fall and spring, the university research committee awards small grants to faculty who need support to initiate or complete a research project. Various offices offer programs directed at the improvement of faculty and staff performance. \n(3) new funding for substance abuse and mental health services; and (4) opening of a new residence hall with subsequent improvement in student satisfaction among residents. Documentation of co-curricular learning outcomes, as evaluated by Student Involvement, can be found in its latest assessment report (see 5.D.1.). For example, Student Involvement has found that more students desire volunteer and service-learning opportunities. In response, civic engagement programs have been developed with intentional focus to impact both student and community organizations. Academic Affairs partnered with Student Involvement to further develop servicelearning opportunities by providing fellowships for faculty to work with Student Involvement on the infrastructure needed to have a more robust service-learning program on campus. Highlights of various co-curricular activities sponsored by Student Affairs are listed below. The program provides exposure to different styles and philosophies of leadership and helps students in the transition from classroom to workforce. The Summer Leadership Institute, offered every summer, is a five-day experience designed for students to expand and evolve their leadership skills and abilities. Fifty students participate annually. New in 2016, students will be able to use some of these experiences to obtain an academic for-credit leadership certificate.\n-4.A.1. -Wichita State University regularly evaluates its academic programs to ensure that each department/program meets program goals, professional standards, institutional mission, accreditation expectations, learning outcomes and faculty qualifications. Each academic program is expected to establish assessment plans, per the university's assessment system, that outline how and when data are collected. The departmental committee for each program (usually consisting of faculty, students and community members) regularly analyzes and uses assessment data to ascertain program effectiveness and recommend improvements. Program review -overseen by the Office of Assessment in Academic Affairs -is bound to academic quality and allocation of resources within public universities governed by the Kansas Board of Regents. As stated in Program Review Policy, the primary goal of review is to ensure program quality by: (1) enabling individual universities to align academic programs with their institutional missions and priorities; (2) fostering improvement in curriculum and instruction; and (3) effectively coordinating use of faculty time and talent. Each degree-offering program is reviewed annually to ensure minimum requirements and is on a three-year cycle for a more in-depth review. Yearly data and three-year summary reports are then compiled into an eight-year report, which is submitted to KBOR. Hence, there is continuous review and evaluation of each academic department/program as overseen by faculty, deans, the university review committee and the provost. At each three-year review point, programs use feedback from the university review committee to make changes. Reviews have resulted in various changes (2012,2013,2014,2015,2016). Although all programs reviewed in these reports have been recommended for continuance, some have been required to submit additional information. Suggestions for improvement coming from any level of review are also addressed -e.g., a 2010 proposal to close the physics program and department (for low enrollment and degree productivity) and the move of gerontology (now aging studies and slated for closure for low enrollments) from Liberal Arts and Sciences. In these cases, it was ultimately decided to close the physics department and move the physics program to an expanded Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics. Gerontology was moved to Health Professions. One of the most encouraging findings is the improvements departments have made in their ability to effectively evaluate their programs. Evaluation rubrics indicate that departments are using data to make changes and overall making progress on program improvements. For example, from the 2013 program review most departments were deemed not meeting expectations for alignment of stated assessments with stated learning outcomes. From the most recent review 2016  As stated on the Registrar's web page, credit is evaluated upon admission to the university and includes evaluation by departments of coursework to be transferred to WSU for a degree (see sample degree audits).\nThe university regularly collects and reviews student learning outcomes guided by the Student Learning Assessment System and evaluation activities in Student Affairs. The processes include: A university assessment plan structured around evaluating the general education program; Program assessment plans structured around evaluating degree programs; and A student competency guide as adopted by the Division of Student Affairs to assess student engagement. The institution gathers data from a variety of sources (i.e., course outcomes, job placement, licensing exams as applicable) based on the university assessment plan, individual program assessment plans, and plans from Student Affairs (see above). University outcomes primarily relate to general education/Student Affairs outcomes, and program outcomes relate to each major at the departmental level. The learning outcomes associated with the general education program are evaluated annually by the general education committee (with representation from each college) and reported to the  \n-5.A.1. -\n-5.C.1. -Wichita State University engages in systematic and integrated planning as evidenced through its strategic planning process (see environmental scan and plan).

The institution's educational responsibilities take primacy over other purposes, such as generating financial returns for investors, contributing to a related or parent organization, or supporting external interests. 3. The institution engages with its identified external constituencies and communities of interest and responds to their needs as its mission and capacity allow. Wichita State University embraces its role and obligation to serve the greater needs of the Wichita community and the citizens of Kansas, as well as surrounding states, the nation and the world. The university meets its mission to serve the greater public good primarily by successfully preparing graduates who will contribute to economic and social progress at home and abroad. Hence, WSU's undergraduate and graduate programs make a substantial impact on the public good. Further, WSU's longstanding efforts in research, innovation and entrepreneurship serve to improve the human condition and advance social and economic progress. Goal 3 of WSU's strategic plan places special emphasis on the university's obligation to serve the public good through education: capitalize systemically on relevant existing and emerging societal and economic trends that increase quality educational opportunities. Through this goal and the mission itself WSU ensures it meets this criteria. The following examples illustrate WSU's commitment to the public good. WSU's innovation university initiative further demonstrates the university's commitment not only to being a provider of educational programs, but also an economic driver for Kansas and the greater public good. The innovation university will include: -An Experiential Engineering Building, supporting WSU's vision of being internationally recognized for applied learning and research, that includes engineering laboratories and a maker space, and provides extensive technological resources that can be accessed by students and the public to develop innovative new ideas and test concepts; -Partnership buildings, constructed with non-state funds by entities that will lease space to develop new products and services while integrating the talents and expertise of WSU students and faculty; -A law enforcement training center with the Department of Criminal Justice; -A new home for the W. Frank Barton School of Business; and -Infrastructure to support student housing, hotels and eating establishments. WSU Ventures demonstrates the university's commitment to public service and engages in three primary activities: protecting and licensing of WSU inventions; connecting industry with WSU researchers; and linking WSU researchers and technologies to start-up potential with investors and entrepreneurs. Ennovar emphasizes education, emerging technology, experiential learning, evolutionary research, exploration and engagement. Ennovar employs close to 40 engineering, communication and graphic design students, and is committed to strengthening WSU's reputation in research and technology to drive the economy of Kansas. According to a National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development survey, WSU ranks 36th among all U.S. universities in overall industry-funded research and development expenditures. WSU ranks first in industry-funded aeronautical engineering R&D expenditures, and is located in a metro area where these funds are most significant relative to the size of the local economy. WSU is one of six state universities governed by the Kansas Board of Regents. As a state research university, WSU adheres to policies set forth by KBOR that prevent the generation of financial returns for investors or the Regents, and the support of external interests not allowed by KBOR policy. -1.D.3. -WSU and its key constituencies across south-central Kansas are actively engaged with each other in growing and transforming the university. This has included broad community involvement in helping develop and shape WSU's mission, vision, values and goals. The engagement continues in the development of WSU's innovation university, an effort that involves the business community, civic and government leaders, and other members of the local community. Historically, WSU's academic programs and faculty have been engaged in local industry and community programs, providing expertise and service. Examples include: Research and expertise through the National Institute for Aviation Research to the local aircraft manufacturing industry; Dental and speech-language-hearing services provided by the College of Health Professions, often to local underserved populations; Industry research and specialized training in entrepreneurship, management development, real estate, airline quality and other areas through the W. Frank Barton School of Business; Arts and creative industry training through the College of Fine Arts; Training to local school districts, including Wichita public schools, the state's largest and most diverse school district, through the College of Education; and The summer program in Puebla, Mexico, an opportunity for students, teachers and other interested individuals to study Spanish, gain the invaluable experience of living in another country and earn college credit toward a degree or teacher certification. These examples provide a small sample of the magnitude of the university's community engagement with external constituencies. WSU maintains ongoing, dynamic relationships, business and international exchanges, and consultations with community, city, state and federal governments; corporate and educational leaders; and professional and civic organizations that reflect the university's commitment to serving the greater public good. Through these relationships WSU can increase the quality of its academic programs through mentorship, internships and employment."}, {"section_title": "1.S -Criterion 1 -Summary", "text": "The institution's mission is clear and articulated publicly; it guides the institution's operations."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The history of Wichita State University is built upon big ideas and a faculty, staff and student body who turn them into reality. For this reason, the university set out to create a bold new strategic plan -one that capitalized on WSU's uniqueness in a way that would leave a lasting impact on students, the city and the region. WSU fulfills Criterion 1 through a new mission and strategic plan that allows for better alignment with existing university activities. The strategic plan is aspirational and demonstrates that the university's pioneering spirit is alive and well. It is clearly articulated, and at its heart is a mission statement that indicates the university's desire to chart a new course for higher learning while it remains dedicated to serving as lifeblood to the region and doing its part to provide the highest quality of life possible to area residents. While WSU seems to have met Criterion 1, the university's future is not without challenges. Because of the swift adoption and implementation of the new mission and strategic plan, communication has been a challenge. Improved communication between administration, faculty, staff and students would help facilitate better understanding of the strategic plan and ways in which plan implementation can occur within optimal time frames. New monthly newsletters and annual updates by the president are meant to alleviate this issue.\nWichita State University is committed to ethical and responsible conduct and, therefore, is in compliance with Criterion 2 as evidenced by having in place: A full complement of policies that guide the integrity and ethics of its governing board, administration, faculty, staff and students as well as appropriate steps for due process; A governing board appointed by the governor (and defined by statute) that holds public meetings, and publishes meeting agendas and minutes; An office of internal audit that regularly audits functional areas for compliance with institutional, KBOR, state and federal policies; Publicly available documents that advertise WSU's admission/degree requirements and processes, educational costs, faculty and staff qualifications, and accreditation status; Policies and procedures that demonstrate WSU's commitment to freedom of expression and intellectual pursuits; and Mechanisms to ensure that faculty, staff and students use and apply knowledge responsibly and ethically.\nWichita State University demonstrates its ability to combine quality degrees with real-world, experience-based learning opportunities. From testing out a career to building a resume that will open doors, WSU students and graduates have access to resources needed to build the futures they want. This emphasis has been the focus of university work since the Higher Learning Commission's last site visit, as evidenced in WSU's new mission and strategic plan. Driven by its mission and strategic plan, WSU meets Criterion 3 by providing: Current and relevant undergraduate and graduate degrees, across all modes of delivery that are mindful of the human and cultural diversity necessary to help make students successful; A curriculum with a robust and effective general education program that emphasizes critical thinking, analytical reasoning and problem solving; Degree programs that emphasize collecting, analyzing and communicating information; mastering modes of inquiry and creative work; and developing skills adaptable to changing environments; Proven research programs where faculty and students contribute to the discovery and application of knowledge; A sufficient number of faculty and staff who are appropriately credentialed, current in their field of study and accessible to students; Excellent learning and support facilities to address student needs in terms of advising, libraries, technology, laboratories, practice sites, and effective use of research and information resources; and A well-rounded co-curriculum administered by Student Affairs. A focus for the future will be on: Improving concurrent enrollment processes and paying close attention to faculty credentialing requirements outlined by the HLC; Fully implementing an electronic tracking system for faculty and staff evaluations; and Continuing to strengthen advising processes through our strategic enrollment management plan."}, {"section_title": "WSU", "text": "has not yet achieved the diversity that it strives for among its student body, faculty or staff.

Such disclosures are made on the mandatory annual Declaration for Conflict of Interest and Time Commitment Form and the Supplemental Declaration of Financial Conflict of Interest. Organizational governance: The Office of the President maintains an organizational chart for the university. Faculty and staff senates each maintain web pages with definitions of their electorate, governance and responsibilities. Compliance: WSU is committed to maintaining easily accessible information online about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Title IX, and safety for students, faculty and staff, family members and guests. Pertinent information is published and distributed via email to students, as university mailings and fliers, and as part of numerous outreach initiatives.\nIn policy 3.06 and 3.19 of its Policies and Procedures Manual, Wichita State University reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an environment free of intimidation, fear, reprisal and coercion -one in which students, faculty, unclassified professionals and university support staff can develop intellectually, personally and socially. As stated under section 5.08 (Rights and Responsibilities of Faculty), the teacher is entitled to full freedom in research and, in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of the teacher's academic duties. The preamble for section 9.10 (Intellectual Property) outlines the purpose of WSU's Intellectual Property policy: \". . . to foster the creation and dissemination of knowledge and to provide certainty in individual and institutional rights associated with ownership and with the distribution of benefits that may be derived from the creation of intellectual property.\" The Policies and Procedures Manual outlines specific uses for university and non-university groups respective to First Amendment activities (11.12 and 11.13). The Kansas Board of Regents provides specific guidance in its manual for how students, faculty, staff and the general public may use WSU facilities. Faculty members who believe that their academic freedom has been compromised may address such action through the grievance process, which is designed to resolve internal disputes, assure careful consideration of personnel actions and complaints, and safeguard academic freedom. (See WSU Policies and Procedures Manual, chapter 5). WSU provides for the review of grievances filed by faculty members.

EO policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary procedural revisions become evident or as changes in applicable law require. For example, universities are now required to provide training to students on sexual assault and violence. This and other requirements triggered the university to further examine the best way to handle equal employment and Title IX issues. Subsequently, WSU has increased the resources dedicated to preventing and addressing discrimination over the past three years (e.g., new Title IX coordinator position, substance and sexual violence training program for students). Changes are summarized below. Prior to 2014, EEO and Title IX responsibilities were coordinated by the university general counsel's office. In 2014, the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Title IX was established and a fulltime executive director of EEO/Title IX was hired to focus on best practices, training and outreach, acquiring this responsibility from the general counsel's office. This new position reported directly to the president. In 2016, EEO and Title IX responsibilities were separated and a new full-time Title IX coordinator position was established to handle Title IX separately from equal employment issues. This allowed for better coordination of prevention (see quick reference guide) and awareness (see responsible employee and campus security authority letters) of sex-based discrimination. In 2016, the Office of EEO and Title IX was renamed the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX to emphasize the focus on addressing all discrimination issues, not just those related to employment. The EO director and the Title IX coordinator are direct reports to the president.

In its consideration of policies, it is guided by recommendations from the chief executive officers of each Regents university. Through deliberations and meetings, KBOR governs and coordinates certain activities of the entire public higher education system, including Wichita State University. KBOR coordinates functions of its 32 member institutions with regard to: Determining institutional roles, reviewing institutional missions and approving performance agreements for each institution; Developing a comprehensive plan for coordinating program and course offerings and locations, including transfer and articulation procedures; Developing a unified budget for state funding of state system institutions, distributing state and federal funds, and requiring accountability for use of those funds; Representing state universities and the Regents system before the governor and Legislature; and Collecting, aggregating and reporting common and institution-specific information documenting effectiveness of each institution in meeting its mission and goals.

All English 102 students spend significant time addressing ethical and effective research practices and are exposed to copyright concerns. The university also provides a fully staffed Writing Center, for documentation and research consultation, for all students. For transfer students, this is assured through WSU's course equivalency process (see also the transfer equivalency course look-up page). WSU employs SafeAssign Software, which is available for every university course via the Blackboard learning management system. SafeAssign allows faculty to easily calibrate the software to act as a learning tool for students to find instances of plagiarism in their own work that they mistakenly assumed to be effectively paraphrased or summarized, and then change that work until it is either sufficiently original, or clearly and appropriately cited.

Furthermore, the Board believes that public higher education has a mission to develop the moral reasoning abilities of students and to promote the importance of integrity in all aspects of student life, but particularly in academics. Therefore, it is the policy of the Kansas Board of Regents that student academic dishonesty not be tolerated on the campuses of the Regents institutions.\" KBOR policy requires that WSU implement and promote specific policies, procedures and programs that seek to: (1) identify prohibited academic conduct by students; (2) educate students, faculty and administrators with regard to the nature, impact and consequences of student academic dishonesty; (3) effectively report and seek to reduce such behaviors; (4) provide for due process for students accused of academic dishonesty; (5) set forth clear sanctions, ranging from reprimand to dismissal from the university, for students who have committed acts of academic dishonesty; and (6) implement a comprehensive and integrated plan to promote academic integrity among students, faculty and administrators. In response to KBOR policy, section 2.17 of WSU's Policies and Procedures Manual states that a standard of academic honesty, fairly applied to all students, is essential to a learning environment. The colleges have developed implementation plans of 2.17 to make sure students are aware of it. This information is also included in every course syllabus. Students who compromise the integrity of the classroom are subject to disciplinary action by their instructor, their department, their college and/or the university. Students who engage in academic misconduct are referred to the Student Conduct and Community Standards (SCCS) office for consideration of suspension or expulsion from the university as determined by the academic college or the vice president for Student Affairs. Policy 8.05 outlines the procedures and potential outcomes for such violations. Since WSU began tracking the data in fall 2011, 16 students have been reported to the SCCS office and one was taken through the student conduct process and later suspended.

The university assessment system outlines expectations for ensuring the currency of the curriculum, courses and performance levels including program review, assessment of student learning outcomes and student perceptions of their college experience. Faculty oversight: In reviewing and approving changes to curricula and course content (undergraduate and graduate), faculty start with action by a departmental faculty curriculum committee. Review and approval follow, by the department chair, the college curriculum committee, the dean of the college where the review starts, the university Academic Affairs committee (for undergraduate courses, if action affects multiple colleges), the general education committee (for changes relative to general education) and the graduate council (for graduate changes). Changes and approvals are documented on curriculum change forms. Faculty are expected to base suggested curriculum changes on needs and demands in the workforce and industry, and whether the change fits within the strategic plans of the university, colleges and departments. This requires input from external stakeholders, such as advisory committees and employers. When proposing new programs, faculty use the same curriculum change process but with additional reviews by the Faculty Senate for undergraduate programs and the Graduate School for graduate programs. Thereafter, the Kansas Board of Regents reviews and approves all new program requests, as was the case in 2015 when the Master of Innovation Design was approved. KBOR program review: All academic programs undergo a yearly cycle of program review as required by KBOR (to assure minimum number of majors, graduates, ACT scores and faculty), as well as a triennial cycle of self-studies prepared by program faculty for review internally. A university program review committee made up of faculty and staff from the Office of Academic Affairs reviews the self-studies. To ensure continuous quality improvement and set expectations for performance, all programs submit an intensive self-study to address their: -Centrality to fulfilling the mission and role of the institution; -Quality as assessed by the strengths, productivity and qualifications of faculty; -Quality as assessed by its curriculum and impact on students; -Demonstrated student need and employer demand; -Service provided to the disciplines, the university and beyond; and -Plans for improvement. Programs triggered by KBOR for low enrollment, graduates, ACT scores and faculty counts undergo an additional annual review to determine improvements. Student perceptions: On student exit surveys (n=9,419; 2013-2015 graduating classes; required participation for graduation), more than 80 percent of WSU students were satisfied or higher with their degree program, and with faculty instruction and feedback. Close to 90 percent of undergraduates were satisfied or higher with their level of competence in terms of content in their major and skills related to critical thinking, problem solving, oral and written communication, and collaboration and teamwork. In addition, 87.8 percent of undergraduate and 85.3 percent of graduate students reported their degree was or would be useful to them in their chosen career. Overall, satisfaction rates are high, but colleges and departments can drill down to program level and monitor their own satisfaction rates. This information is available in triennial program review reports, as well as university-wide student learning outcome reports that incorporate student perception data as an indirect way to measure student learning in the general education program. "}, {"section_title": "Measured Outcomes", "text": "\nThe undergraduate student learning outcome dashboard (2013,2014,2015,2016) indicates that students are performing at or near expectations on outcomes of critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills as measured by direct (e.g., Collegiate Learning Assessment, English 101 writing assignments) and indirect (e.g., National Survey of Student Engagement) measures. Program learning goals (outcomes) are found in annual KBOR reports (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016). Reports indicate that program learning goals are articulated and differentiated by credential level, e.g., in the mathematics, statistics and physics department report. -3.A.3. -\nData are collected in terms of delivery mechanism (or method) with 67 percent of course offerings falling into traditional face-to-face or hybrid formats (such as in-person lectures/labs), practica and clinical rotations); 8 percent online; 18 percent independent/directed study courses; and 7 percent internships or cooperative education. Faculty interaction occurs in all formats. Method examples include: (1) those showing similarities between online and faceto-face versions of the same course (criminal justice, curriculum and instruction, economics, geology, health sciences, international business, management, and theater); (2) co-ops and internships; (3) concurrent enrollment; (4) independent study; and (5) clinical work in distant settings (undergraduate nursing, graduate nursing, and physician assistant). Annual evaluations of WSU's concurrent enrollment program (e.g., 2013-2014) are reported to KBOR. In terms of grades, reports indicate concurrent enrollment students perform similarly to non-concurrent enrollment students. Online course data reporting is monitored regularly. The report indicates that, from FY 2007 through FY 2016, online learning at WSU increased significantly. For FY 2016, the number of online course sections offered increased by 25.9 percent, student credit hours increased 26.7 percent, and the number of students enrolled increased 24.6 percent. WSU expects continued growth because of the establishment of the Office of Online Learning and a strategic plan (2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018) to develop more online courses and programs. Comparing face-to-face and online formats, there were no differences in student grade outcomes in courses with a sufficient \"n\" (for comparison purposes) and the same content. -Student preparedness to be online students and availability of support services (Student Support, 40/48); and -What measurements, processes and policies are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of online programs (Evaluation and Assessment, 23/33). WSU's overall self-assessment score is 151/225, or 67 percent. The university's strongest area is Student Support because of (1) OneStop; and (2) dedicated online advisers who meet with students before they start an online program and continue that academic support throughout the student's college career. The second and third strongest areas are Institutional Support, and Evaluation and Assessment. These are areas for which WSU has been focusing efforts to ensure procedures, resources and assessments are in place to support online education adequately at WSU. Areas targeted for immediate improvement follow. -Course Development and Teaching and Learning: All existing online courses are reviewed according to Quality Matters minimum standards and training opportunities for faculty who are new to online teaching, or who have not had past adequate training. -Retention of online students: WSU has hired a retention specialist to monitor online student activity using Blackboard Analytics, develop intervention plans to help retain struggling students and create more online tutoring options. -Online community: To address social and student engagement, WSU is creating a virtual campus community for students to interact online outside of course areas in the Learning Management System. Data from various sources allow the university to monitor student performance in the classroom as well as preferences. In terms of performance, Blackboard Analytics allows WSU a number of parameters. For example, on average, students who log in frequently to an online class and access a greater percentage of class materials are more likely to get a better grade in the class. An online retention specialist monitors this closely and intervenes when appropriate. Data from the 2015 online student satisfaction survey analysis helped target improvement areas for WSU's online services and offerings, such as support for retention. The data has allowed the university to have discussions with colleges and departments about future plans for expanding online program offerings. WSU now has a better understanding of the types of online students (gender, age, class standing, college) taking online courses but not currently enrolled in fully online programs. This has helped to identify services for those students, such as an online writing lab, distance tutoring options and more course options for general education courses.

Program specific learning goals (outcomes) are identified in various ways on program web pages and other printed material including course syllabi (see syllabi template and other samples)."}, {"section_title": "Consistency of Quality and Learning Goals across Modes of Delivery", "text": "Delivery mechanisms: WSU offers courses and programs (1) on campus in traditional classroom and/or laboratory settings; and (2) in distance formats. Distance formats include online learning, practicum, internships, cooperative education and clinical rotations. Concurrent enrollment: WSU suspended this program at the beginning of the 2014-2015 academic year to reassess its delivery, cost and faculty credentials. After hiring a coordinator, the program was restarted during the 2015-2016 academic year with reduced tuition to high schools to be competitive in the market. Concurrent enrollment teachers were recredentialed based on new HLC policy. Online learning: Since receiving HLC approval to offer online courses and programs, the university has established an Office of Online Learning to monitor online expansion and quality. Online courses and programs follow guidelines recommended by HLC to use: (1) best practices for program assessment developed by the Online Learning Consortium; and (2) the Quality Matters Program to promote quality online course development and design. Prior to launching any program, market readiness research is completed (e.g., RN to BSN, dental hygiene completion program, criminal justice, aging studies [also an assessment of prospective students for aging studies], curriculum and instruction, general business administration, master of business administration, and women's studies). To assist with quality, an overall assessment of online courses (not necessarily part of a program) is completed on a semester basis. Additionally, periodic student satisfaction surveys help demonstrate improvement areas for online services and offerings. An online procedural manual is available to provide further guidance for faculty, staff and administrators in terms of professional development, intellectual property, faculty responsibilities, growth of online learning, and so forth. The Office of Online Learning is approved to offer distance education either through WSU's membership in NC-SARA or by obtaining authorizations or exemptions through individual states.

Annual reports (2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016) document the program's overall evaluation."}, {"section_title": "Mission and goals:", "text": "The general education program correlates in several ways with the university mission to be an essential educational, cultural and economic driver for Kansas and the greater public good. General education is the beginning step, with an overall goal of providing a well-rounded education that enables students to live rich, meaningful lives by developing an appreciation of the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences; an ability to intelligently follow and participate in current events; and a sensitive and learned appreciation of diverse cultures and ways of living. Educational offerings: WSU has a wide variety of educational offerings and degree programs, and general education requirements can be tailored to suit the interests of the student. The 42-hour general education program consists of three tiers. Tier 1. Foundation Courses (12 hours) covers fundamental skills needed throughout college. Tier 2. Introductory Courses in the Disciplines (21 hours) introduces students to the scope of human knowledge and inquiry. Tier 3. Advanced Further Study and Issues & Perspectives Courses in the Disciplines (9 hours) provides for more focused study on topics of interests found in Tier 2 courses. Degree levels: The general education program accounts for 42 hours of a minimum 120 credit hours toward a bachelor's degree. Depending on the major, and its college, students may be required to complete additional general education requirements, which can be found in the program brochure. Evidence of how the program articulates with degree programs can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog and on the university website for each major (see samples). The student degree audit system (i.e., Degree Works) allows students and their faculty advisers to complete ongoing degree audits to ensure all requirements are satisfied. Students are given the general education brochure upon entry to WSU during their initial advising appointment. The expected learning outcomes of general education are that students acquire knowledge in the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences; think critically and independently; write and communicate effectively; and use analytical reasoning and problem solving techniques. The purpose, content and outcomes are communicated to students during their first and subsequent advising appointments. Although a large percentage of WSU students complete portions of their general education at other institutions, it is expected that all students take equivalent WSU courses prior to graduation. For instate students from other institutions, the Kansas Board of Regents transfer and articulation agreements ensure the appropriate course is taken. For out-of-state students, WSU maintains a transfer equivalency web page to make sure out-of-state coursework is equivalent to WSU courses. Program monitoring: To determine the extent to which various courses contribute to the general education program, information is obtained from the instructors of record upon approval of their course regarding the way it addresses program goals and outcomes; how goals and outcomes are reflected in assignments; and what percentage of the grade is derived from assignments that directly relate to general education outcomes. One outcome (to gain a basic understanding of natural and social sciences, humanities and arts) is addressed in its structure, which requires students to take Introductory and Further Studies courses in various broad fields of inquiry. Reporting outcomes: The general education committee primarily uses the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) as a direct assessment of outcomes gained through the student's educational experience. Each fall and spring semester, a representative sample of entering and graduating students participate in the CLA, which is used, in conjunction with program review, to verify WSU's impact on learning outcomes and contribute to continuous improvement of university programs. Learning outcomes: Outcomes are reported using the assessment dashboard and an annual report (2013,2014,2015,2016) produced by the general education committee. Every fall semester, the committee assesses the data collected and, in the spring semester, submits a report to the Faculty Senate, whose members discuss the report with other faculty for approval. Approved changes appear in the next issue of the Undergraduate Catalog. Reports indicate that students are performing at expectation. Examples of changes are found in reports, e.g., the recent committee decision (based on the 2015 report) to develop a new first-year seminar. -3.B.3. - In addition to the skills and learning outcomes provided by the general education program, each degree program offered at WSU requires students to: (1) develop skills in collecting, analyzing and communicating information; (2) become proficient in modes of inquiry and creativity; and (3) establish skills that are adaptable to changing environments. Departments have identified courses in degree programs that collectively meet these three criteria (see sample program-level learning outcomes). -3.B.4. - In accordance with its mission, WSU strives to equip students with the educational and cultural tools they need to thrive in a complex world, achieve individual responsibility in their own lives, and develop effective citizenship in the local, national and global community. Many of WSU's educational offerings are related to human and cultural diversity. (See 1.C.) WSU offers a certificate in Tilford Diversity Studies, an 18-credit-hour program designed to benefit academic interests as well as career goals. Students who earn a Tilford Diversity Studies Certificate acquire an appreciation for diversity in the world and an understanding of privilege and oppression, learn to understand themselves and others disregarding stereotypes, interact successfully with others in personal and professional settings, and are prepared to take on leadership roles that include promoting diversity. The program was established in 2013, so only a small number of students have completed it to date. To promote diversity courses and the diversity certificate among students and advisers, in 2014 WSU created a course attribute, a code attached to courses that contain content related to diversity and designated as such by faculty members of the Tilford Commission. Students can view the schedule of courses on the WSU website, and customize or filter their search by variables, one being course attributes. Approximately 130 different course titles contain the diversity content attribute representing 30 different subject areas. About 5,000 students enroll in courses with diversity content annually, and in the most recent graduating class (AY 2015), 40 percent took one of these courses. The university also offers study abroad experiences that give students the opportunity to learn about other cultures and individual differences, develop confidence and independence, complete an internship abroad, and participate in service learning. WSU's three types of study abroad opportunities are: (1) exchange programs; (2) faculty-led programs; and (3) independent programs, providing students with various options for studying abroad. The number of students who participate in study abroad has gradually increased from academic year 2012-2013 to 2014-2015. Students for whom study abroad experiences are not appropriate or affordable can participate in a domestic exchange program through the National Student Exchange (NSE) -a consortium of nearly 200 accredited, baccalaureate-granting colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Through this program, WSU students may attend another participating college or university while paying WSU tuition. Similarly, students from other institutions can come to WSU on exchange. While nine students participated during the 2012-2013 academic year, the program grew to 17 for the 2015-2016 academic year. -3.B.5. -WSU is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a \"high research\" university. The university's location in the heart of Wichita -a mecca for aircraft manufacturing, health care and business -provides opportunity for applied learning and research to be infused throughout each student's educational experience. WSU has a rich tradition of providing experiential learning opportunities, and the new strategic plan reinforces this. By conducting research and internships with faculty in their fields, students gain real-world experience, allowing them to develop and apply critical skills. Students are not the only ones who benefit. Local businesses count on WSU research entities as a vital part of their business plan. WSU is ranked No. 1 among all U.S. universities in industry-funded aeronautical research and development expenditures, according to the National Science Foundation. This research is primarily driven by efforts of the National Institute of Aviation Research at WSU. NIAR conducts research for the purpose of advancing the nation's aviation industry, and to assist non-aviation industries that may benefit from aviation-related technologies (see university research reports from FY 2007, 2009-2010, and NIAR and other related reports from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011and 2014-2016. The university has multiple research centers and institutes, receives more than $50 million annually in externally funded research, and has more than 200 industry and government clients and research partners. In 2014, to help realize its strategic plan, WSU embarked on creating an innovation campus on the eastern half of the university footprint, where ideas and innovation can germinate, advance and connect to other ideas that previously did not seem to have connections. To ensure that research is being infused at the departmental level, each academic department is expected to evaluate the centrality of its mission to the university mission during the triennial program review process. This includes connecting the missions regarding a student applied learning or research experience. Documentation can be found in annual program reports (2012,2013,2014,2015,2016). All departments to date are on target or meeting expectations. SOAR (Shocker Open Access Repository) is the WSU institutional repository, a service of University Libraries. SOAR's purpose is to make the university's digital scholarship available to a global audience and serve as a reliable digital archive for faculty and student research projects. Undergraduate students are encouraged to participate in research, whether collaborating with faculty or engaging in original research. Each academic college offers research projects at the undergraduate level, and grants of up to $1,000 are available to support undergraduate student research. Examples of locally published research journals of faculty and student work can be found on the university's website. Every year, WSU hosts an Undergraduate Research and Creativity Forum (URCAF), an event that provides an opportunity to present scholarly and creative work to faculty and students, while competing for cash awards. Each student's project is presented under the mentorship of a WSU faculty member. The WSU Graduate School has a university-wide symposium every year to showcase graduate student research projects, known as the Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects Symposium (GRASP). The purpose of GRASP is to spread awareness on campus about research and scholarly projects being conducted, showcase world-class research to the wider community, and provide a forum for graduate students to practice presentation skills in research and scholarly activities. WSU also participates in the Capitol Graduate Research Summit, held in Topeka, Kansas. The annual event is organized through collaborative efforts between WSU, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas. The summit's main purpose is to provide graduate students an opportunity to display their research to state government, education officials and the general public. As the Kansas Legislature extends support for basic research funding to these universities, the summit provides researchers the chance to present the results of the investment in research. The TRIO McNair Scholars Program prepares first-generation, low-income and minority students for graduate studies, and provides research training and early scholarly experiences. Students may apply during their sophomore year. The program is composed of (1) the McNair Academy; (2) the Research Component; and 3 Business/commerce/economics research is conducted by faculty in the School of Business who specialize in areas such as the stock market, labor relations, real estate, entrepreneurship, human resource management, international business and finance, management, supply chain and branding. Faculty in the department of chemistry specialize in areas including biochemistry; organic, inorganic and physical materials; and analytical, bio-organic and medicinal chemistry. Research is focused on health, alternative energy and advanced materials. The criminal justice department produces textbooks and publications in research areas such as crime statistics, computer crime, homicide, human rights, policing, police behavior and training, and public policy issues. Research provides current information on communityoriented policing, specifically addressing the needs and issues of police agencies in Kansas and Nebraska."}, {"section_title": "3.C -Core Component 3.C", "text": "The institution has the faculty and staff needed for effective, high-quality programs and student services. 1.

Department, college and university travel support to professional meetings for faculty and staff has ranged from $2,569,000 to $3,344,000 between fiscal years 2007 and 2015. Principal investigators retain 5 percent of the indirect costs recovered on their grants. The home department receives 5 percent for the faculty members and the home college 10 percent. These funds are considered a reinvestment in the university's research capacity and are identified by university policy to be used for promoting research and scholarly activity. Small university-supported grants for multidisciplinary research and creative projects are awarded annually in the amount of $92,679 (average), each between $4,500 and $7,500. On average 21 faculty receive awards each year. A pre-tenure club to support probationary faculty meets monthly during the academic year. The online learning faculty/staff professional development group, aimed at maintaining and increasing the quality of online learning, is supported with $50,000 annually. Tuition assistance policy allows staff to take two courses each semester. Assistance provided to staff has ranged from approximately $66,000 to $216,000 between fiscal years 2007 and 2016. Developmental seminars, workshops and presentations for teachers (see 2014 and 2015 calendars and instructional design and technology options), researchers and staff are provided annually. Feedback helps shape the seminars. The Academy for Effective Teaching, made up of emeritus faculty and working in conjunction with Academic Affairs, fosters effective teaching by assisting in the development of good teachers and the rewarding of accomplished teachers. Sabbaticals are a reward for excellent faculty teaching and scholarship, and an investment in future productivity. Tenured faculty members are eligible for sabbatical leave after six years of continuous service. The Full Professor Incentive Review (PIR) program, initiated in 2000, provides a financial incentive and reward for continuous faculty productivity after the rank of full professor. -3.C.5. - Policies address instructor accessibility for students, including policies on classroom assignments, class time and lists, and attendance obligations (2.04). Per policy 2.05, members of the faculty post office hours extensive enough to provide ample opportunity for scheduled and unscheduled conferences with students. Every reasonable effort is made to maintain office hours as scheduled and announced. The online procedural manual documents the same expectations for online courses. Exit survey results indicate faculty are accessible, both at the undergraduate and graduate level. -3.C.6. - Staff position descriptions must be written and approved prior to advertising for the position, and are reviewed annually to ensure the description is current (completed by the supervisor during the annual evaluation). Most staff positions require some training within the university -especially on the enterprise reporting system, Banner, and specific internal processes. Staff are offered support and professional development similar to faculty, including opportunities to attend conferences, certification programs and in-depth institutes for specialized training. Staff are placed under two categories, unclassified professionals and university support staff (the university is transitioning to one staff category). Each has a senate that provides representation to the university administration and a voice on campus. Both senates provide opportunities to participate in service or volunteer projects as well as professional development. The Center for Management Development offers a variety of courses that employees can take to earn certifications in different areas. The Media Resource Center provides learning guides for Blackboard, mobile devices, using the video lecture tool Panopto, and teaching with technology. Through the Learn More program, the university holds a Technology Fair every year, where the WSU community discovers the many ways technology is being used on campus. The university offers tuition assistance to benefits-eligible, non-teaching employees who wish to further their education. The Office of Human Resources has created Talent Development Programs, which offer a variety of development options for employees. There are five programs: Advanced Leadership; Managing People; Administrative and Support Staff; Legal/Compliance; and Hiring Process. A 2016 survey of staff prioritized additional training needs. A plan to deliver such training will be finalized by fall 2016. Policies and procedures for evaluation of staff can be found in 6.07 (unclassified staff) and 7.14 (university support staff) of the Policies and Procedures Manual. Policy includes information on who evaluates the staff member (immediate supervisor, with review by the divisional vice president) and how the evaluation is to be documented (see form).

Activities include Greek life, Student Activities Council, Student Government, and campus recreation (see handbook and annual report). Student Involvement (2014, 2015, 2016) provides opportunities to participate in civic engagement, service-learning and more than 200 diverse student clubs and organizations. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion offers cultural festivities, speakers and film showings on campus, a mentoring program, and diversity and inclusion interactive training on various subjects. A calendar of events taking place on and around campus is provided each semester. The Office of International Education provides support and assistance for international students for their educational and professional goals, and ensuring institutional compliance with U.S. immigration regulations that govern the visa status of international students. Domestic students are served by International Education through the Study Abroad program; WSU has formal exchange agreements with 17 universities in other countries. Student Health Services offers health options to WSU students at little to no cost. Services include, but are not limited to, immunizations, injury and illness examinations, men's and women's health screenings, and laboratory and prescription services. Approximately 12,700 clinic visits occur annually and 7,000 students are reached through various outreach prevention events. The Counseling and Testing Center (CTC) provides personal counseling and psychological assessments, group therapy programs and testing services. The CTC houses the campus Prevention Services coordinator who provides outreach and education on issues relating to alcohol and drug use, sexual health, suicide prevention and body image, among other topics. Over 10,000 are served annually. The Student Conduct and Community Standards staff is responsible for protecting the rights, safety and well-being of members of the campus learning, working and living environment. This is achieved through providing an accountability process that is procedurally sound, legally compliant, developmentally focused and student centered for reviewing and responding to individual students' and student organizations' behavior. Campus safety resources are available for students, with a full-time university police department, an emergency operations plan, security escorts as requested, and the Shocker Alert System, which sends out email, text and other digital messages in the event of a campus emergency or closings due to weather conditions. WSU has 20 emergency call boxes placed around campus that connect directly to University Police, and a strobe light on top of the call-box pole will flash to indicate an emergency to others. As required by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Police and Campus Crime Statistics Act, WSU publishes an annual security and fire report. WSU has a university behavioral intervention team with a mission of providing a proactive and supportive multidisciplinary team approach to prevention, assessment and intervention for individuals or situations that may pose a threat to the safety and well-being of the university community. Students, faculty and staff can complete a Concerning Behavior Report form that is submitted to the team, which will take action as necessary. -3.D.2. -For students who do not meet minimum requirements for Math 111 or English 101, placement exams (mathematics, English) are available to determine which course they should begin with; both are needed for general education requirements. Similarly, a Spanish placement exam is used to place students in the appropriate Spanish class, and other subjects use placement exams the same way. Students are required to complete their foundational general education requirements by the time 48 credit hours are earned to ensure a solid basis for further learning. One of WSU's goals is to identify gaps between pre-K-12 completion and higher education expectations. Gaps are measured by identifying the percentage of incoming high school seniors who are in need of remedial courses. WSU is working with local high schools and has put in place the College Readiness Partnership Initiative to work with local school districts on college readiness issues. The early alert system Grades First was used for a short time at WSU, but did not provide as much data as the university needs to intervene at the appropriate time. A custom Student Early Alert System (SEAS) (2015, 2016) was developed to give faculty and advisers information about students who are at academic risk, based on attendance, assignments, participation and exams. At-risk students are sent an email by an instructor stating that they are being flagged as at-risk, and students can then meet with the faculty member or adviser to discuss the issue and take action to remove the at-risk indicator. Data indicate that use of SEAS changes students' behavior, with an average of 30 percent being removed from at-risk after a flag is raised by faculty. 73 percent of WSU students were assessed by SEAS in 2016, compared to 68 percent in 2015, which indicates increased adoption by faculty. WSU is a member of the Student Success Collaborative of the Educational Advisory Board (EAB). This tool is used to monitor students' academic behavior and provide them assistance in terms of degree completion. WSU has the ability to use an EAB-hosted interface that presents historical WSU student data and predicts whether a given student is on track to graduate. Campaigns can be conducted on various groups of at-risk students to intervene if they are not on track. A dashboard is used by colleges/departments to monitor progress. Academic advising responsibilities are assigned to each academic college for students who have a decided major. Undecided majors and non-degree bound advising is offered through the Liberal Arts and Sciences advising center and the Office of Adult Learning. Advising for graduate students is via the Graduate School by a faculty member. Each college has an advising syllabus (sample syllabus). Students can access advising in a face-to-face, telephone or online session, and are encouraged to see their adviser before enrolling each semester to ensure that they are on target. Results from the latest undergraduate exit survey indicate that 91 percent of students believed that their academic adviser was accessible; 92 percent agreed that their academic adviser was informed of the degree requirements; 90 percent agreed that the degree requirements were made clear; and, overall, 76 percent were satisfied or very satisfied with their academic advising. Similarly, for graduate students, 91 percent of students believed that their academic adviser was accessible; 93 percent agreed that their academic adviser was informed of the degree requirements; 91 percent agreed that the degree requirements were made clear; and, overall, 77 percent were satisfied or very satisfied with their academic advising. The results of the HLC student survey (undergraduate and graduate) show similar findings in terms of advising. The university has plans moving forward to further strengthen the advising experience, particularly for first year students. WSU's strategic enrollment management plan also address improvements in the advising process for all students. Online Learning provides advising for students enrolled in 100 percent online programs. Business, Education, Health Professions, and Liberal Arts and Sciences are the only colleges that have 100 percent online programs, and each has an adviser for those who are strictly online students. -3.D.4. -"}, {"section_title": "Technological Infrastructure", "text": "WSU uses Ellucian Banner, a university-wide enterprise reporting system that went live in 2006.

The institution collects and analyzes information on student retention, persistence, and completion of its programs. 3. The institution uses information on student retention, persistence, and completion of programs to make improvements as warranted by the data. The Quality Initiative, centered on the Graduation Partnership, is designed to impact WSU's longterm retention and graduation rates. The partnership aimed to enhance the student experience by: identifying academically at-risk students paired with pro-active advising, developing a robust freshmen orientation, deploying an early alert system, launching a revised first-year experience course (WSU 101), and increasing supplemental instruction. The university's commitment to educational improvement is furthered by KBOR's strategic plan (Foresight 2020), with a goal to increase retention and graduation rates of first-year, full-time freshmen 10 percentage points by 2020. Goals defined in the Quality Initiative and Foresight 2020 are fully aligned with WSU's mission and resource planning process, as well as the Higher Learning Commission's accreditation criteria. Overall goals and outcomes are appropriate to the scope of the mission and the university's capacity to accomplish it. WSU's commitment to a quality experience for students in their first year of enrollment includes continual improvement of policies, programs and services to facilitate academic success and personal growth; providing foundational educational experiences; creating a culture that supports first-year enrollees' aspirations; and encouraging students to engage actively in campus life. A requirement for freshmen to live on campus is one way of encouraging that engagement. The Graduation Partnership goals are to: Increase retention rate of first-time, full-time freshmen, 70 percent (2010) to 80 percent by 2020; Increase six-year graduation rate of first-time, full-time freshmen, 40 percent (2010) to 50 percent by 2020; and Develop metrics to measure and then increase graduation rates for transfer students, 10 percent by 2020.

Even areas not meeting targeted goals show significant improvement. Based on review of Quality Initiative reports, actions have been taken. These include the following. At the program level, the WSU 101 course was replaced with general education freshman seminar courses. These program-related seminars embed student success materials with engaging general education topics. The courses fulfill an introductory general education requirement and are taught by senior faculty. The change of early-alert procedures using GradesFirst to an in-house-developed Student Early Alert System (SEAS) requires faculty to intervene directly with students instead of referring them to student advising centers. Collaboration with student advisers is still encouraged but direct faculty contact with at-risk students appears to work better (2015, 2016). -4.C.4. -WSU data governance structure is based on best practice within higher education as defined by Educause and leading universities in data governance. The university community has three managed data systems from which to obtain information related to data for decision-making, planning and reporting: Business Intelligence and Predictive Modeling (BIPM); University Assessment Data System; and External Reporting Data. While largely dependent upon transactional databases (e.g., Banner), managed data systems are based on online analytical processing configurations designed for reporting and analysis, and include data customizations, aggregation, imputation, forecasting and simulations of data elements. Academic Affairs maintains these managed data systems. The mission of the Data Governance Council (DGC) is to provide oversight to systems to ensure data integrity, best practices in data management, reporting standards, information consistency and security access. The DGC is charged with identifying data and reporting needs related to strategic planning priorities and the sharing of business knowledge across divisions to ensure data and reporting optimization related to the latest business practices within units. The DGC provides compliance with HLC requirements related to institutional data used for accreditation. Retention and graduation rates are one of many key performance indicators (KPI) used at WSU for internal assessment and decision making along with reports to federal, state and outside third parties. As with all KPIs, validity (how accurately the measurement metric reflects the concept or dimension being measured) and reliability (the ability to repeatedly measure with consistency over time) are important. In terms of validity, working with subject matter experts in operational offices (e.g., Registrar, Financial Aid, Admissions, Finance), student-information-system (SIS) source tables and data indicators for identifying new student cohorts are verified and reassessed yearly. In terms of reliability, all SIS table modifications must be reviewed by the data management committee with daily audit reports providing alerts when new or modified data indicators that may impact new student indicators change. Tracking of new student groups is performed daily within the BIPM system as part of nightly data refreshes from the SIS. Once enrollment data are archived on the fall census, a period of review of available transcripts on new students to ascertain correct categorization is performed, and new student indicators are adjusted if needed. When transcript confirmation is complete, a review of all past enrollment is performed to catch any case in which a student has attended prior to current term (spans known enrollment data from 1901 to present). Confirmed new student cohorts are then entered for the fall census into the BIPM cohort table, which stores cohorts for every fall census from 1980 to present for reporting both internally and externally."}, {"section_title": "-Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness", "text": "The institution's resources, structures, and processes are sufficient to fulfill its mission, improve the quality of its educational offerings, and respond to future challenges and opportunities.

In FY 2017, the state's share of WSU's operating budget is 22.2 percent, and the remaining 77.8 percent is supported by a combination of tuition and fees, sponsored research release and overhead from sponsored research and public service grants, federal matching funds for work-study students, student housing funds, parking operations and WSU Foundation funds (see budgets, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017). WSU has obtained sufficient resources to meet operational needs by increasing revenues and prioritizing expenses, while maintaining program quality. To evaluate its success, the university benchmarks itself to peers using various financial ratios. WSU exceeds or is comparable in terms of these ratios. Its overall CFI has declined from 3.28 in FY 2014 (restated from 5.45) to 1.57 in FY 2015. A portion of this decline is due to the implementation of the GASB 68, which decreased WSU's net position by $32.1 million and a loss on disposal of capital assets during FY 2015 of $7.7 million. The remainder of the decline is evidenced in the transformation occurring on campus (e.g., new residence hall, Innovation Campus). The university has also made investments as part of the strategic plan (goal 5) to enhance student service including: $1.5 million for a OneStop location and call center, ongoing; $1.0 million for remote parking and shuttle service, ongoing; and $1.0 million for new police and parking vehicles, and staff to patrol remote parking lots. In the past two years, WSU has significantly increased long-term debt. In FY 2014, a new residence hall was constructed with the issuance of $64.9 million in bonds (see Kansas Board of Regents [KBOR] review and approvals, February and May 2013). In FY 2015, WSU issued $44.9 million in bonds for construction of the experiential engineering building on the Innovation Campus (see KBOR review and approvals, September and October 2014). In other examples of recent fiscal decisions, WSU has: Increased tuition and fees to levels more consistent with the prevailing rate among peers, and focused recruiting strategies to increase the proportion of non-resident students (see tuition/fee comparison to peers); Funded online programs through an online course fee; Continued fundraising by the WSU Foundation for financial aid for students, departmental support, faculty of distinction and targeted program enhancements; Launched a capital campaign project through the WSU Foundation to support a plan to build the Innovation Campus with a modern new business school (see latest results); Increased the level of funded research and public service grants; and Created initiatives to increase enrollment, and retention and graduation rates.

WSU also has educational access to a 4,700-acre Flint Hills ranch. A baseball practice facility has been built on the main campus, adjacent to Tyler Field at Eck Stadium. The campus has 82 buildings containing 3,243,808 gross square feet, a net assignable area of 2,209,798 square feet, and a current replacement cost of $862,051,662. A five-year capital improvement plan is submitted annually to KBOR for approval and forwarded to the Kansas Legislature for facility enhancement requests as prioritized in the campus master plan (see below). The capital improvement plan (with updates) is developed by the Office of Facilities Planning, based on coordination with university administration. Renovation of the Rhatigan Student Center, a project from the previous master plan, began in 2012 and was completed in August 2014. Renovation increased social space for student and faculty interaction, provided access to technology, and brought the building into compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. The Rhatigan Renewal was funded by student fees and private donations. The plan organized the campus into three general segments: Active Corridor; Academic Corridor; and Arts and Sciences Corridor. Because parking is always a concern, the plan includes construction of parking garages. It also includes room for expansion of athletics and recreational facilities, additions to academic buildings and residential housing, and more on-campus dining. Construction of a student dormitory at the center of the main campus began in 2013 and finished in fall 2014. Shocker Hall, the first residence hall built on campus since 1964, houses 784 students, primarily first-year, and includes a 400-seat dining hall and the Dorothy and Bill Cohen Honors College. A new technology transfer office, designed to move the products and results of university research quickly into the marketplace, is tasked with enhancing research, and developing the processes and infrastructure required to extend results of research into new inventions, innovations and technologies that can be marketed in collaboration with industry and private-sector enterprises. Plans for an innovation university were approved in 2014 and included buildings for public/private research initiatives, one of which would house the Barton School of Business. The first of these buildings (experiential engineering) is scheduled to be completed and occupied in fall 2016. Other priorities include increasing enrollment and improving the overall quality of academic programs. A major initiative aimed at significantly increasing enrollment includes targeted recruitment efforts in locations outside of south-central Kansas, such as other areas of Kansas and in states along the I-35 corridor.

Infrastructure planning has led to state-of-the-art technology for WSU. The wireless initiative provides a 100 percent wireless campus network that allows everyone on campus to connect to laptops or other wireless devices. To further protect the university's information infrastructure, a layered security approach has been implemented through virus protection for users who connect to the network. In 2006 the university moved from a mainframe-based computer system to a web-based Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system. Conversion to the Banner system was completed in 2007. In 2015 the university implemented Cognos BI (Business Intelligence), a software toolset for reporting, analysis, score-carding, and monitoring of events and metrics. During calendar year 2015, WSU entered into an agreement with the state network consortium KanREN to provide a fully redundant 100 gigabit network to the main campus, including the Innovation Campus, with full access to 100 GB planned for fall 2016.

An online catalog and curriculum management tool (CourseLeaf) is being implemented and should be fully operational by 2017. An improved travel processing system was implemented in 2014-2015 where the traveler/delegate enters required documents for which approvals are received and recorded electronically. Parking software was purchased in 2016 to better administer WSU's parking. The system being implemented uses license plate recognition to know if and when a vehicle is allowed to park in any given lot. The Information Technology Services division (ITS) has been instrumental in leading WSU through the technology changes of the past 50 years. Information technology culture on campus supports a distributed desktop environment focused on empowering users to access, store, analyze and report information in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The Media Resources Center (MRC) provides centralized support for new technologies to enhance effective learning environments, including the expansion of online learning and use of Blackboard.

This allocation becomes part of each university's state general-fund base budget. Each university may determine the use of the operating grant allocation, subject to KBOR guidelines. Under the operating-grant budget process, tuition rates must be approved by KBOR based upon university-specific recommendations. The governor and Legislature have approved \"tuition ownership,\" which permits universities to retain all tuition revenues. This has resulted in management flexibility over all university resources. except salaries and fringe benefits. During the fiscal year, several processes are used to monitor expenses and manage the current budget. Detailed departmental budget-to-actual reports are available for budget officers to execute and review on a monthly basis (FCD00106 -Organization Financial Report for GU funds, e.g., dental hygiene), but can also be executed daily. The Office of Financial Operations also monitors budget to actual by using the Banner finance system to stop processing of expenditures anytime there is non-sufficient budget for the expenditure. Restricted use cash deficits are identified on the FCD00105 -Organization Financial Report for RU funds (e.g., economics). Reports are available for execution by each budget officer on a daily basis, and the deficits are closely monitored by the Office of Financial Operations, which works with the department chair to correct the deficit. Budget review officers and vice presidents use summary reports by organization and division to easily identify variance between budget and actual within their units (FCD00200 -Organization Financial Summary, e.g., College of Education Dean's Office and the Division Summary). Full-time permanent positions are assigned position budgets. Monitoring of the position budget is accomplished at the department level with oversight by the University Budget Office using an online, real-time form in Banner (PWIEBUD). Throughout the year, the president meets with the executive finance team to review tuition cash flow and expenditures based on enrollment, as well as revenues and expenses from restricted use sources. The associate vice president for Finance and the University Budget director jointly prepare this information using data and reports within the Banner system and those listed above. The GU Cash Balance Projection report is an example of the information provided to the executive team. As issues are identified, action can be taken to resolve potential financial issues. For example, if the team identifies a shortfall in the tuition fund, budgets are adjusted and measures are taken to curtail spending to ensure cash shortfalls do not occur. In a recent example, after a review of restricted use cash balances (FCS00300 -RU Cash Balance by Fund Level 3), it was determined that action needed to be taken to correct a negative cash balance within the Advanced Education in General Dentistry residency program. This program relies mostly on restricted use funding for support, but for a variety of reasons income was not keeping up with expense levels. By identifying this situation prior to year-end, the executive team was able to agree on a plan to use contingency cash to cover the current year deficit and to implement an MOU with the department for repayment. In addition, the department took internal steps to change processes, recruit more residents and improve overall profitability of the unit. As a public university, WSU submits financial statements each year (2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015) to the auditor of the State of Kansas.

That includes the development of three phases: (I) a vision, mission and strategic goals; (II) individual plans for academic units, academic colleges, and Student Affairs programs; and (III) plans for enabler units that support Phase II plans. Phase I was completed in spring 2013, establishing the vision and mission. The mission statement established universal values that underlie behavior at WSU; a distinctive set of values unique and integral to accomplishing the strategic plan; and goals that promote student learning. The President's Executive Team used the initial strategic plan for resource allocations to improve student services and help WSU become a major academic institution of national respect. Phase II began in fall 2013 and was completed in fall 2014. Its focus shifted activity to university units that report to vice presidents. For example, within Academic Affairs strategic planning activities were transferred to college level. Each unit followed the same general process. A strategic planning steering committee was formed to gather information and develop the unit's vision, mission, goals and values to align with the new university vision, mission, goals and values. University employees of sub-units (departments/schools in Academic Affairs) were then tasked to develop strategic plans that aligned with plans developed by the unit's strategic planning steering committee. Since initiating Phase III in 2014 (and ongoing), the executive committees of each vice president have used data from their units to assist in evaluation of proposed initiatives and provide a framework for allocation of resources to best attain university goals. Alignment of resources (see example, FY 2017 budget proposal) is based upon careful, rational examination of existing programs to determine where university resources could be used in the most effective manner. (See strategic planning annual reports, 2015, 2016.) The transformation of the university, as guided by planning processes, has steered resources toward the creation of the Dorothy and Bill Cohen Honors College in FY 2014 (see FY 2013 budget compared to FY 2016 budget, honors planning documents) and an honors baccalaureate degree; expansion of online learning in FY 2014 (see FY 2014 budget compared to FY 2016 budget, online planning documents); increases in retention resources (see budget increases in FY 2016); a new OneStop in FY 2015 (see OneStop planning document); renovation of the Rhatigan Student Center in FY 2013 and 2014 (see student center planning documents); construction of Shocker Hall in FY 2013 and FY 2014; and creation of the innovation university in FY 2015 (see proposal and approval documentation). For example, within Academic Affairs, new budget requests are reviewed and approved by the provost and senior vice president prior to being vetted by other vice presidents and the Budget Committee. The linkage to assessment of student learning is provided through WSU's program review process. Each academic program is expected to plan in the context of review, which requires evaluation of program quality as assessed by its curriculum and impact on students. A recent example of how assessment of student learning has been linked to budgeting is the development of a new first-year seminar general-education course being piloted for entering freshmen. The course came about after determining that an existing first-year experience course (WSU 101) was neither achieving its educational purpose nor contributing to improvements in retention. The provost added new resources to develop the first-year seminar course beyond what was allocated to WSU 101. Giving additional resources to the forensic science program in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was a direct result of the program review process. The program has been triggered for low degree productivity since its development more than 10 years ago. Feedback from the program review in 2014, to develop a plan to increase the program's awarding of degrees, was recently implemented with the responsible department making the case for a new coordinator position in FY 2016. The Office of Assessment reports directly to the provost and provides regular updates on activities related to assessment of student learning by each program. For example, through program review and other activities, departments may determine that additional resources are needed to assess student learning. The Office of Assessment, as delegated by the provost, has funding available to assist departments in assessment activities with more than $30,000 annually allocated for this purpose. Thus, the linkage between assessment of student learning and planning and budgeting processes is documented by the provost. -5.C.3. - The strategic planning effort that started in 2012 was managed by a steering committee appointed by the university's president. The committee engaged hundreds of people -faculty, staff, students, business and community leaders, and the general public -to generate ideas, gather and analyze data, and interpret results. Data from discussions within the steering committee, town hall meetings, surveys of faculty, staff, students and alumni, and strategic planning retreats were distilled into a Strategic Planning Artifact report. This process continues through the work of the Strategic Planning Steering Committee responsible for monitoring the university strategic planning dashboard (2015,2016), facilitating the college annual review process, reviewing university goals, and reviewing tools and metrics for changes. -5.C.4. -WSU has processes for planning and the possible impact of fluctuations in revenue determined by the state economy as described in 5.A.5. Systematic reviews and monitoring of local, regional and global trends have allowed WSU to engage in a dynamic planning process to thrive in the complex fluid environment of higher education. Environmental scanning last occurred during the 2012-2013 academic year and assisted the university's leaders in understanding projected trends related to WSU constituents, as well as recruitment and retention, learning, excellence and research, as identified in the strategic plan. A major initiative that grew out of the environmental scan and strategic plan addressed the need to increase revenues to offset decreases in funding from the state. Growing enrollment was a primary method selected as increases in enrollment translate to increases in revenue. WSU consulted the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers for assistance with Strategic Enrollment Management planning in an effort to position the university for long-term enrollment success. The consultation has required the university to make decisions and create goals, strategies and tactics that match its mission, vision, strengths and challenges. This process is ongoing and expected to be forwarded to the president in fall 2016 for review and approval. The complete plan will be implemented thereafter to affect enrollments in 2017 and beyond. Environmental scanning occurs through data and feedback from advisory committees such as the WSU Foundation's National Advisory Council, whose 100 business and professional members are drawn from states across the nation. The council: Proves effective in keeping the university abreast of emerging trends in technology, demographic shifts and globalization, and WSU's obligations in a multicultural society; Selects a 21-member board that oversees and manages resources of the WSU Foundation, and meets twice annually; Uses focus groups to solicit input related to evaluation of specific segments of the educational environment, such as the impact of social, technological, economic and cultural trends on university giving by donors; student enrollment and performance; the impact of rising tuition on the public's perception of cost and quality; the feasibility of distance learning; and the uniqueness of WSU; and Provides university leaders with feedback, which is distributed to divisions and colleges. More specific evaluation takes place at the college and departmental levels. For example, classroom use and space utilization are annually reviewed (based on a fall census) to identify space and time concentrations that may hamper instructional activity. For fall 2015 the university had a 51.9 percent seat utilization. Greater concentrations occurred during morning classes (56.4 percent) with 9-11:30 a.m. Tuesday/Thursday being the highest activity. While current usage does not pose an issue with instructional delivery, during course scheduling departments are provided a report that helps identify classes with a history of high occupancy and suggests alternatives, including opening new class sections and adjusted time offerings. -5.C.5. -Driven by its own strategic plan and Kansas Board of Regents goals in Foresight 2020 (both focused on improving the economy and growing enrollment), WSU anticipates emerging issues in higher education partly by evaluating changes in technology, demographics, and national and global forces to stay abreast of future needs.

In the past 10 years (fall 2006fall 2015), the average age of undergraduate and graduate students has decreased by one year, and the percentage of undergraduates who attend full time increased to 77.2 percent of the student body in fall 2015 (full-time status is defined as enrollment in 12 undergraduate or nine graduate credit hours per semester). Currently, the average age of new freshmen is 18 years, and the average age of all freshmen (students who have accumulated fewer than 30 credit hours) is 20. These data reflect national norms with respect to the age of entering freshmen. Data also may reflect a trend developing in the WSU student population toward a younger, full-time student and away from past characterizations of the student body as older and largely part-time. The move to more restrictive admissions standards for the state's four-year institutions was instituted by the Kansas Legislature beginning in 2001. Subsequently, KBOR developed regulations and continues to modify them. Moving to a more selective process has affected the way WSU's admissions process functions, but it does not appear, from examining enrollment figures, to affect the achievement level of first-time students enrolled at the university. There have been minimal changes in entering freshmen ACT scores since qualified admissions were mandated."}, {"section_title": "Local, National and Global Forces", "text": "WSU recently conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study on bringing back intercollegiate football, a sport discontinued by WSU in 1986. Sparked by a desire to improve the on-campus student experience (goal 5 of the strategic plan), the specific focus was placed on the financial aspects of such an endeavor, with analysis of estimated revenues and expenses. Community-wide discussions will commence fall 2016 to determine interest and feasibility. Forces in the workplace have increased demand for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates. Spiraling technological advancements drive demand for engineers, scientists and mathematicians to fill vacancies in traditional STEM careers and fill a rapidly growing number of positions in an equally rapid growing number of new careers that demand technological skills. Kansas legislators and KBOR share an interest in increasing the level of technology competence in the Kansas workforce to meet anticipated future employment opportunities. This motivated a State of Kansas initiative to support engineering education in the amount of $105 million, divided equally between WSU, Kansas State University, and the University of Kansas for 10 years (2011-2021). Globalization of the economy has created a need to increase globalization of the local workforce and culture. No doubt, this need will likely shape WSU curricula and classroom learning experiences. degree completion, degree productivity in STEM fields, and research expenditures. Several initiatives are underway to address areas needing improvement, such as increasing student diversity and participation of non-traditional students."}, {"section_title": "Program Review", "text": "On a three-year cycle, each academic unit prepares a self-study using a standard reporting template and data provided by OPA. The reports then feed into the required review by KBOR. In the past 10 years, review has resulted in specific program modifications -e.g., a 2010 proposal to close the physics program and department (for low enrollment and degree productivity) and the move of gerontology (now called aging studies and slated for closure for low enrollments). Ultimately, the physics department closed and the physics program moved to an expanded Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics. Aging studies moved from Liberal Arts and Sciences to Health Professions."}, {"section_title": "Division of Student Affairs", "text": "Departments within the Division of Student Affairs engage in internal and external assessment initiatives. Each department determines its own assessment plan and selects or creates its own assessment tools. For example, each November Housing and Residence Life (HRL) participates in the ACUHO-I/Benchworks Resident Assessment, which provides HRL staff with information specific to the WSU campus in addition to comparing WSU's results to those of peer institutions. Results of this assessment have been used by HRL to evaluate resident assistant (RA) performance and help determine which RAs are eligible for rehire for the following academic year. Data have been used to help determine facility specifications for the Shocker Hall residential property, and future results will inform decision-making related to new residence halls. Many offices assess campus culture, behavior trends and needs, in addition to program access and satisfaction. Periodically, the Counseling and Testing Center (CTC) administers the American College Health Association College Health Assessment II (2010, 2012), which collects information on a variety of health-related topics including disease and injury prevention; alcohol, tobacco and other drug use; mental health; and nutrition and exercise. Results are used to determine areas of focus for education and outreach, changes in service options and delivery, and need for additional staffing, resources or departmental restructuring. For example, in 2010, results showed that WSU students were drinking and driving at a much higher rate than other college students nationwide. Significant efforts, including creating greater awareness of the Shocker Safe Ride program, were directed to changing these numbers with CTC prevention methods and efforts to change campus culture regarding alcohol use. When the survey was given two years later, numbers were substantially improved. The data inform topics selected for the Words for Wellness workshop series and were an integral part of the supporting documentation used to obtain a three-year federal suicide prevention grant in fall 2014. Since the last Higher Learning Commission reaccreditation, WSU has learned from operational experience via various consultants and applied lessons learned to refocus its mission (see Criteria 1), reshape university administration, develop new or modified existing programs, and add new facilities. university. The strategic plan is forging a new model of education that emphasizes applied learning and research; an innovation university is necessary to fulfilling that plan. It involves creating a welcoming environment where ideas and innovation can germinate and bloom, where people generate new ideas and advance them, and where they can connect ideas that previously didn't seem to have connections. Two examples of that welcoming environment include the creation of (1) Ennovar, the Institute of Emerging Technology and Market Solutions, where graphic designers, marketing and business majors, and computer science engineers are working together with companies such as NetApp, Social Networking Technologies and Dell; and (2) the Institute of Interdisciplinary Creativity, which provides a structure for new interdisciplinary degrees, certificates and other credentials (e.g., badges) to be developed, implemented, awarded and administered. Likewise, the interdisciplinary institute provides opportunities for faculty across campus to come together in a collaborative environment to develop academic programs and related research, and creative projects in support of innovation."}, {"section_title": "Retention and Graduation Rates", "text": "Increasing retention and graduation rates has been WSU's focus for the past several years, including the university's HLC Quality Initiative (see 4.C.). Based on relatively low rates, a goal was set to increase rates by 10 percentage points (freshmen retention from 70 percent to 80 percent, and six-year graduation from 40 percent to 50 percent) by 2020. The Graduation Partnership was developed to address this. To date, evidence indicates the university has made progress: The retention rate is 73.6 percent and the six-year graduation rate is 44.3 percent (weighted three-year rolling averages). The data are comparable to the university's peers. In 2013 WSU re-evaluated its scholarship program, subsequently refocusing and resizing to expand opportunities for prospective and academically qualified students. The goal of the merit scholarship program is to reward a wider range of students for academic excellence. Two key changes are: (1) refocusing WSU's scholarship programs so that students can pursue education with a renewable merit scholarship during a four-year period; and (2) eliminating the need for students to submit a separate scholarship application. All newly admitted (and qualified) students will receive a scholarship offer as long as money is available."}, {"section_title": "STEM", "text": "One of WSU's performance goals is to increase the percentage of STEM degrees conferred. The State of Kansas University Engineering Initiative Act of 2011 was created to increase the number of engineering graduates by almost 60 percent in Kansas over a 10-year period. The initiative directs the secretary of the Kansas Department of Commerce to work with KBOR, Kansas State University, the University of Kansas and WSU to develop a plan that targets engineering education efforts to fuel economic growth and business success in Kansas. The WSU College of Engineering has developed several initiatives to increase the number of graduates by increasing enrollment, while hiring additional faculty and developing new educational labs and other support networks. The college joined a coalition of more than 30 public, private and non-profit partners in Wichita to become one of seven winners of the 2014 national US2020 City Competition. The coalition will share $1 million in financial, consulting and staff support resources over the next year to launch STEM mentoring plans. The STEMpact2020 staff connects local STEM professionals with youth at schools and through youth-serving non-profit organizations. The focus is on under-represented groups (e.g., females, black non-Hispanics and Hispanics) in STEM fields and on local youth."}]
