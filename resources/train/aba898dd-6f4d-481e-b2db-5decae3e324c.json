[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "\uf020\nMatching 2,777 R&D firms in surveys conducted by the National Research Council between 1921 and 1938 with U.S. patents reveals that 59 percent of all firms and 88 percent of publicly traded firms patented. These shares are much higher than those observed for modern R&D firms. Industry, firm size and the location of R&D facilities relative to major cities are shown to be important determinants of the propensity to patent. The effect of these factors remained constant across the 1920s and the Depression years suggesting that the tradeoff between patent disclosure and secrecy did not change over time."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "he extent to which firms use patents to protect their intellectual property rights is a central issue in the economics of innovation. It informs our understanding of how firms appropriate the returns to research and development (R&D) and how policymakers think about patent systems as a mechanism for stimulating innovation. To address these issues, scholars have frequently used innovation surveys of firms to examine the link between R&D and patents in the United States, Europe and Japan. While each survey has given rise to nuanced results, the main findings from each suggest that patents are a relatively unimportant means by which firms seek to protect their knowledge assets, and that the use of patents varies strongly across industries. A large and influential literature has emerged from these studies. 1 Less is known about patenting behavior by R&D firms historically. This article presents results from a data collection effort that uses patents and major surveys of R&D establishments conducted by the National Research Council (NRC). Beginning in the 1920s and for several years thereafter, the NRC compiled information on the fields of activity and the numbers of research personnel for a comprehensive set of firms with industrial R&D facilities and it published these in volumes titled Industrial Research Laboratories of the United States. These data have been used by David Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg to describe the institutionalization of industrial research during the early twentieth century, but they have never been fully matched with patent data."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "I hand matched all 2,777 firms in the 1921, 1927, 1931, 1933, and 1938 surveys with patents granted in the United States, providing a profile of patenting activity linked to R&D firms during one of the most central phases in the development of U. S. innovation. 3 I analyze the data in two main ways. First, I measure the propensity to patent. I define a firm as patenting if it applied for at least one patent in the United States between 1921 and 1938 and the patent was subsequently granted. This provides a broad indicator of the use of the patent system by firms. I also allow for a closer temporal association between the patent application and the time a firm is observed in each survey by determining if a firm patented within a one year window of the survey year. I break down the patenting statistics by firm type (i.e., publicly traded), industry, and survey year and I also construct benchmarks using data on patenting by modern R&D firms. The data reveal strong variation in patenting by industry, which is similar to the results reported by scholars analyzing modern innovation surveys. However, compared to the modern samples, I find a more extensive use of patents by R&D firms in the past.\nSecond, using variables measuring resources devoted to R&D, the geographic location of R&D facilities relative to large cities, and industry of focus, I examine the drivers of the propensity to patent and their relative constancy over time. An attractive feature of the NRC data is that it covers drastically different macroeconomic environments: the expansion of the 1920s and the Depression of the 1930s. Innovation scholars often assume in their empirical work that the propensity to patent remains constant over time, without reference to hard evidence showing that the constancy assumption holds true. 4 If the propensity to patent varies over time, changes in patenting will be a highly imperfect proxy for changes in innovative activity. I examine cross-sectional variation in patenting and I also test for changes over time by comparing firms' patenting behavior in the 1920s and the 1930s. The results show that the determinants of the propensity to patent and the distribution of 2 Mowery, Emergence and Growth, \"Industrial Research,\" \"Boundaries of the U.S. Firm,\" and \"Development of Industrial Research\"; and Mowery and Rosenberg, Technology and the Pursuit and Paths of Innovation.

Despite the major upheaval of the Great Depression, firms still used patents to protect their intellectual property rights in much the same way as they did during the 1920s. The evidence implies there was no change in the relative role of patents versus secrecy."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND: INNOVATION SURVEYS", "text": "Patent data has long played a prominent role in studies of innovation and patenting activity by R&D firms during the 1920s and 1930s can be contextualized by a broad research program designed to elicit the value of patents as a measure of technological change. Jacob Schmookler's pioneering work in the 1950s and 1960s popularized the idea that patent statistics provided a more accurate measure of underlying inventive activity than qualitative lists of \"important inventions.\" 5 Subsequently, a large empirical literature developed using patents as a measure of inventive activity, including research by economic historians."}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Given concerns over the robustness of the relationship between patents and innovation, researchers began to investigate the effectiveness of patents for appropriating the returns to R&D.

He found that that the impact of patent protection on the initial development or commercialization of innovation varied strongly across industries. It was most important in pharmaceuticals and least important in office equipment, motor vehicles, rubber, and textiles. Mansfield also found that although the patent system did not spur innovation, it was important for appropriability. He concluded: \"firms generally do not prefer to rely on trade secret protection when patent protection is possible.\""}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "The Yale Survey of 1983, analyzed by Richard Levin and his collaborators, also investigated the impact of patents on technological development through direct correspondence with 650 R&D executives of publicly traded firms. As in Mansfield's study, the Yale Survey showed that patent protection did not drive innovation, but Mansfield's earlier finding that firms did not rely on alternative mechanisms to protect their intellectual property rights was reversed. Patents were shown to 5 Schmookler, Invention and Economic Growth. 6 See, for example, Sokoloff, \"Inventive Activity.\" 7 Prior to the recent digitization of United States patent records, the task of matching firms in the NRC surveys and patents would have been prohibitive. 8 Mansfield, \"Patents and Innovation, \" p. 180. be subsidiary to lead time, speed of learning, and complementary capabilities, such as sales and service, in appropriating the returns to R&D in both product and process innovation. The choice to maintain secrecy rather than to patent depended on how far public disclosure facilitated reverse engineering and \"inventing around.\" The survey results also revealed substantial interindustry differences in the propensity to patent, with patents being relatively more important than average in chemicals-related areas and in semiconductors."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "In 1994 the Carnegie Mellon Survey was administered and the main findings for firms with $5 million or more in sales are described in work by Wesley Cohen, Richard Nelson, and John Walsh. 10 With broadly similar results to the Yale Survey on the differential propensity to patent across industries, the study also highlighted an intertemporal shift towards other mechanisms for protecting intellectual property, especially secrecy. The finding that secrecy matters for R&D firms has been verified for Europe, 11 Australia, 12 and for Japan with respect to process innovation. 13 Moreover, this is not just an empirical observation. James Anton and Dennis Yao show theoretically that secrecy will be chosen in the case of breakthrough inventions if there is incomplete information about the extent of an innovation, patent protection is limited and imitation is facilitated by disclosure. 14 Despite their attractiveness, there are several drawbacks to the innovation surveys. Zvi Griliches remarked of the ordered responses for the effectiveness of patents in the Yale Survey: \"given the use of a scale of one to seven, I remain unsure about whether one person's response of five is equivalent to another's of four or six.\" 15 Furthermore, the surveys are undertaken for mostly publicly traded firms, yet small enterprises may be more likely to pursue formal intellectual property rights to signal the likelihood of profitable entry in order to acquire venture capital funding, or to engage in the market for ideas more generally."}, {"section_title": "16", "text": "The surveys also tended to be conducted for snapshot years, so they cannot be used to test the assumption economists often make in their 9 Levin et al., \"Appropriating the Returns.\" 10 Ibid. 11 Harabi, \"Technical Innovations\"; and Arundel, \"Relative Effectiveness.\" 12 McLennan, \"Australian Manufacturing.\" 13 Cohen et al., \"R&D Spillovers.\" 14 Anton and Yao, \"Expropriation and Inventions.\" For further research on the tradeoff between secrecy and patents, see, for example, Scotchmer and Green, \"Novelty and Disclosure\"; Gallini, \"Economics of Patents\"; Denicolo and Franzoni, \"Patents, Secrets\"; and Kultti, Takalo, and Toikka, \"Secrecy versus Patenting.\" 15 Griliches, \"Comments and Discussion,\" p. 825. 16 Hsu and Ziedonis, \"Patents as Quality Signals\"; and Gans, Hsu, and Stern, \"Impact of Uncertain.\" empirical work about the propensity to patent remaining constant over time.

However, the largest number of firms is observed in chemicals, and this industry accounted for the second highest number of total patents behind electrical equipment. Communications is one of the higher frequency patenting industries. Inventions such as cathode ray tubes used to create television images, could be easily reverse engineered, so patents and cross-licensing contracts dominated. The distribution of research workers and patents in this industry is skewed by the largest laboratory facility in the data set, Bell Labs, which was formed by AT&T in 1925 and had research employment of 3,008 in 1931. The auto industry accounted for a large number of patents and the average number of patents per firm was also high, indicating the large scale of resources devoted to innovation and the 46 Streb, \"Catching-Up.\" 47 Moser, \"How Do Patent Laws.\" 48 Szostak, Technological Innovation, p. 245.

Advances related to engines, brakes, transmissions, and automobile body shells, mark the 1930s as one of the most technically forward-looking phases in the industry's history. 49 During the early twentieth century, the auto industry also displayed a high propensity to patent.\nIndustries that patented in the 1920s tended to do so in the 1930s. Figures 4A and 4B are scatter plots of the propensity to patent by industries. Using both definitions of the propensity to patent, the industry-level observations fall close to the 45 degree line, with strong positive and statistically significant correlations between the series in excess of 0.8. Additionally, patenting behavior during the 1920s and 1930s is correlated with patenting behavior in the late twentieth century as illustrated in Figures 5A and 5B. These figures plot the propensity to patent against the effectiveness scores by industry for protecting product innovations with patents reported in the prominent study of Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh. 50 Despite differences in the underlying composition of the samples and the methods used to assess the use of patents by firms, the correlations are strong. The R\u00b2 statistics indicate that approximately 15 to 20 percent of the variation across industries in the effectiveness scores can be predicted by variation in patenting across industries more than 50 years earlier and this rises to between 20 and 24 percent when the outlying sector of medical equipment is excluded."}, {"section_title": "51", "text": "This evidence of long-run persistence over time in the propensity to patent is plausibly related to fundamental differences across industries in the types of technologies being developed, which in turn determines whether patenting or secrecy is considered by R&D firms to be the most appropriate mechanism for protecting new inventions."}, {"section_title": "ESTIMATION", "text": "To test for statistical differences in the propensity to patent, I organize the data into an unbalanced panel with i indexing firms, j industries, k regions, and t survey years. I estimate probit specifications where p is an 49 Raff and Trajtenberg, \"Quality-Adjusted.\" 50 Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh, \"Protecting Their Intellectual Assets,\" asked R&D managers whether patents and other appropriability mechanisms were effective in protecting innovations during the \"prior three years\" according to a five-point scale: 1) less than 10 percent; 2) 1 to 40 percent; 3) 41 to 60 percent; 4) 61 to 90 percent; and 5) greater than 90 percent. The list of firms they sampled was derived from the Directory of American Research and Technology, which is a similar compendium of firms with R&D facilities to the NRC's Industrial Research Laboratories of the United States.\n51 Note from Table 2 , the relatively small number of patents in medical equipment. This was a far more research intensive industry by the time of the Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh survey. indicator variable to identify firms that patented from those that did not. Firms are coded as patenting if they patented at any point between 1921 and 1938, and if they patented within a year of a survey."}, {"section_title": "52", "text": "I use year dummies for survey years to control for any differences in the propensity to patent specific to each year but not varying crosssectionally. I use region fixed effects to control for unobservables that vary over regions of the United States but not over time."}, {"section_title": "53", "text": "Specifications take the following form:\nI estimate parameters for the industry dummy variables, R, and for the vector of firm-level variables, X. At the firm level, I use indicator variables for publicly traded firms and balanced panel firms observed across all of the surveys. I also capture the geographic location of R&D facilities relative to large cities. Firms located in dense urban areas that are conducive to knowledge spillovers may be more likely to protect their intellectual property rights through patents because secrecy is difficult to maintain in such environments. Since the propensity to patent is an endogenously determined choice variable, the parameters are not causal estimates. Instead, the objective is to determine if the unconditional shares from Table 2 are robust to the introduction of firm-level covariates and to test if the estimates change across the macroeconomic environments of the 1920s and the 1930s.\nIn column 1 of Table 3A , the coefficients measure the change in the probability of observing a firm patenting in a given industry relative to the baseline industry (miscellaneous) with year and region fixed effects. Patterns in the coefficients are consistent with those from the unconditional estimates in Table 2 . The probability of a firm in the food industry patenting at least once between 1921 and 1938 is around 7 percent lower than in the baseline industry, whereas the patenting propensity is 23 percent higher in the machinery and machine tools industry. Figure 6A plots the 95 percent confidence intervals on the point estimates from columns 1 and 5, which shows these differences 52 The results are also robust to using count data models that specify the propensity to patent as a count of patents by R&D firms between 1921 and 1938 and within a one-year event window of the survey years. 53 Regions are specified as: North East: CT, ME, VT, NH, MA, and RI. 1931, 1933, and 1938 surveys. Industry variables are 0,1 dummies. The baseline industry is \"miscellaneous\" and the baseline year is 1921. Research labs is a count of the number of labs a firm operated and research workers is a count of research personnel employed, both of which are reported in the NRC directories. The balanced panel dummy is coded 1 for firms observed in every survey year and the publicly traded dummy for firms with a stock exchange listing. The big city dummy is coded 1 if a firm was located in one of the 100 largest cities in the United States. The p-values are from Wald tests of the difference between the coefficients. Robust standard errors clustered by region are reported in parentheses: \"a\" is for significance at the 1 percent level, \"b\" for the 5 percent level, and \"c\" for the 10 percent level.\nare robust to defining the propensity to patent using a one-year window around each survey year. Firms in eight industries exhibit statistically significantly higher propensities to patent than in food. The most precise estimates are for the electrical equipment industry, where the probability of a firm patenting at the bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals shown in Figure 6A is between 16 and 26 percent higher than in the baseline industry.\nColumns 2 and 6 add the firm-level variables, which all enter positively with coefficients that are statistically significant. Because the coefficients on the number of research laboratories and research workers are measured in logarithms, they can be interpreted as elasticities. Holding the number of research workers at its mean and controlling for firm type and location, the estimates imply that a doubling in the number of research labs a firm operated is associated with an 11 percent increase in the probability of patenting. A doubling in the number of research workers, holding the research laboratory variable at its mean, is associated with a 9 to 12 percent increase. Although the propensity to patent could be driven by large economies of scale in patenting and by smaller firms being more likely to utilize the patent system to protect their intellectual property rights, I find no evidence for these relationships in the data. That is, the propensity to patent appears to be linearly related to measures of firm size.\nThe coefficient on the balanced panel firm indicator implies that surviving firms were approximately 10 percent more likely to patent, while the coefficient estimates in columns 2 and 6 on the indicator for publicly traded firms imply a 25 to 31 percent increase in the probability of patenting respectively. The results do not disentangle whether these firms were more likely to patent, other things equal, or because they were more accomplished at innovating in the first place. But they do suggest Figure 6A , the first is estimated using the coefficient and standard error in column 1 of Table 3 and the second is estimated using the coefficient and standard error in column 5. Both are estimated without firm-level controls. In Figure 6B , the confidence intervals are constructed from the coefficients and standard errors in columns 2 and 6 respectively. Both are estimated with firm-level controls. The excluded industry category is miscellaneous.\nthat the scale of resources devoted to innovation is a robust predictor of the decision to patent. Similarly, the association between firms in big cities and patenting is positive and statistically significant, which is consistent with firms being more likely to protect their intellectual assets using patents in urban areas. Regional specialization in manufacturing peaked in the 1930s, so firms in the same industry were more likely to be geographically close to one another."}, {"section_title": "54", "text": "Chemicals research was clustered in New Jersey, Delaware, and New York, automobile industry research in Michigan, rubber in Ohio, and petroleum research in Texas, Oklahoma, and California. The New York metropolitan area was a central location for research in electrical equipment and communications. 55 Tacit knowledge moves more freely in clustered environments, which possibly constrained the ability to use secrecy rather than patents.\nWhen the estimation controls for firm size and other firm characteristics, the coefficients on the industry dummy variables change very little. The 95 percent confidence intervals shown in Figure 6B (including firm-level controls) are substantively the same as the intervals shown in Figure 6A , which are estimated without firm-level controls. The results suggest that the propensity to patent was highly industry specific.\nFinally, the coverage of R&D firms active during the 1920s and the 1930s provides a unique opportunity to assess the relative constancy of patenting determinants across quite different economic settings. In Table  3 , I estimate the propensity to patent separately for firms in the 1921 and 1927 surveys and for firms in the 1931, 1933, and 1938 surveys. I then assess differences between the coefficients using Wald tests. Out of 20 variables used in columns 3 and 4, only the coefficients on four indicate statistically significant differences in patenting between the 1920s and 1930s. The propensity to patent is lower during the 1930s in chemicals, rubber and plastics, machinery and machine tools, and for balanced panel firms. In comparisons of the coefficients in columns 7 and 8, only the coefficients on the dummy variables identifying firms in mineral products and publicly traded firms indicate statistically significant differences in the propensity to patent. In most industries, I find little evidence of 54 Kim, \"Expansion of Markets.\" 55 Perazich and Field, \"Industrial Research.\" changes in the propensity to patent across two of the most changeable decades in the twentieth century. Given the additional evidence presented in Figures 5A and 5B on the long-run persistence of differences in the propensity to patent across industries, the results likely are being driven by the nature of the technologies being protected and fundamental assessments across industries of the patent-secrecy tradeoff."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Modern innovation surveys have shown that industry of focus is a main driver of the propensity to patent but that in aggregate firms do not use the patent system extensively to protect their intellectual property rights. Summarizing this literature, James Bessen and Michael Meurer assert that, \"firms do not patent a majority of their inventions and about 15 percent of all R&D is performed by firms that obtain no patents at all.\""}, {"section_title": "56", "text": "Less is known about the relationship between R&D and patents historically. This article has presented findings from a comprehensive matched data set of patents and R&D firms active during a key phase of U.S. technological development. Similar to results reported for modern innovation surveys, I find strong evidence of cross-industry variation in the propensity to patent. But I also show that the patent system was used far more extensively by firms in the past. One implication is that patents may be a particularly useful measure of inventive activity in historical data sets of corporate R&D.\nAnother implication follows from the context in which the surveys were conducted. Data from the NRC surveys on the growth of research employment and the foundation of new laboratory facilities have been used to support the view that the Depression years were characterized by an important phase of new technology formation."}, {"section_title": "57", "text": "The new data matching R&D firms with patents reinforces this view. Notwithstanding sharp movements in major macroeconomic aggregates, patenting activity in the R&D sector as a whole was relatively unaffected by the economic shock of 1929 to 1933.
