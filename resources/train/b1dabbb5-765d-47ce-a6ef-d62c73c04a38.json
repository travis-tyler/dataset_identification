According to the world health organization, the number of patients having AD will double in 20 years. Neuroimaging studies performed on AD subjects revealed that brain structural alterations are advanced when diagnosis is established. Indeed, the clinical symptoms of AD is preceded by brain changes that stress the need to develop new biomarkers to detect the first stages of the disease. The development of such biomarkers can make easier the design of clinical trials and therefore accelerate the development of new therapies.\nOver the past decades, the improvement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to the development of new imaging biomarkers [2] . Many works Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

Some of them are based on regions of interest (ROI) to capture brain structural alterations at a large scale of analysis. The alterations of specific structures such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (HIPP) are usually captured with volume, shape, or cortical thickness (CT) measurements [17] . Other approaches proposed to study the inter-subject similarity between individuals from the same group at a voxel scale. Such methods commonly use voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM-based studies showed that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a key area to detect the first manifestations of AD [17] . Recently, more advanced methods have been designed to improve computer-aided diagnosis [2] . Among them, patch-based grading (PBG) framework [3] proposed to better analyze inter-subject similarities. PBG demonstrated state-of-the-art results for AD diagnosis and prognosis [3, 5, 13] .\nBeside inter-subject similarity approaches, other methods proposed to capture the correlation of brain structures alterations within subjects. Indeed, although similarity-based biomarkers provide helpful tools to detect the first signs of AD, the structural alterations leading to cognitive decline are not homogeneous within a given subject. Such biomarkers assumed that the structural changes caused by the disease may not occur at isolated areas but in several inter-related regions. Therefore, intra-subject variability features provide relevant information. Some methods proposed to capture the relationship of spread cortical atrophy with a network-based framework [16] . Other approaches estimate inter-regional correlation of brain tissues volumes [18] . Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) have been used to capture relationship between anatomical structures volumes [11] . Finally, some works showed that patch-based strategy can be used to model intra-subject brain alteration [7, 12] .\nThe main contribution of this work is the development of a novel representation based on a graph of brain structures grading (GBSG) combining intersubject pattern similarity and intra-subject variability features to better capture AD signature. First, inter-subject similarities are captured using patch-based grading framework applied over the entire brain. Second, intra-subject variabilities are modeled by a graph representation. In our experiments, we compare the performance of intra-subject variability features (i.e., the edges of our graph) with inter-subject pattern similarity features (i.e., the vertices). Moreover, we demonstrate the capability of intra-subject variability features to early detect AD and show that the combination of both features improves AD prognosis.

MCI is a presymptomatic phase of AD composed of subjects who have abnormal memory dysfunctions. In our experiments we consider two groups of MCI. The first group is composed of patients having stable MCI (sMCI) and the second one is composed with patients having MCI symptoms at the baseline and converted to AD into the following 36 months.

The number of bins is computed with the Sturge's rule [19] . For each vertex we assign a function \u0393 : V \u2192 R defined as \u0393 (v) = \u00b5 Hv , where \u00b5 Hv is the mean of H v .

In this work we used the Elastic Net regression (EN) method that provides a sparse representation of the most discriminative edges and vertices, and thus enables to reduce the feature dimensionality by capturing the key structures and the key relationships between the different brain structures (see Fig. 2 ). Thus, after normalization, a concatenation of the two feature vectors is given as input of EN feature selection method."}, {"section_title": "Details of implementation", "text": "PBG was computed with a patch-match method [4] .

Two classifiers were used to validate our method -a support vector machine (SVM) 6 . with a linear kernel and a random forest (RF) 7 . The linear SVM has a soft margin parameter, which was optimized in a range of 2 i , with i = {\u221210, 9, ..., 10}.\nAll features were normalized using z-score. In our experiments, we performed sMCI versus pMCI classification. The EN features selection and the classifiers were trained with CN and AD (see Fig. 2 ). As shown in [13] , the use of CN and AD to train the feature selection method and the classifier enables to better discriminate sMCI and pMCI subjects. Moreover, it also enables to get the results without cross-validation step and more importantly to limit bias and overfitting problem.

The original hippocampal grading (HIPP PBG) is used as baseline [3] . First, we estimated the classification performances obtained by each feature separately using SVM. Compared to HIPP PBG, vertices showed an improvement of the specificity while the accuracy and the sensibility did not change. Therefore, additional structures selected by EN did not improve results compared Fig. 2 . Scheme of the proposed GBSG pipeline. PBG is computed using CN and AD training groups. CN group is also used to correct the bias related to age. This estimation is applied then to AD and MCI subjects. Afterwards, the graph is constructed, the feature selection is trained on CN and AD and is applied to CN, AD and MCI. Finally the classifier is trained with CN and AD. to use HIPP only. On the other hand, the edges feature improved the accuracy and the sensibility but was less specific compared to HIPP PBG and vertices. These results indicate that relevant information is encoded within GBSG edges. Second, we evaluated the performance of combining vertex and edge features. GBSG provided the best results in terms of accuracy and sensibility. Moreover it improved the specificity compared to the intra-subject variability features. Finally, we compared SVM and RF classifiers to study the stability of our framework. The results obtained with both classifier showed the same tendency. The RF provided the best results with 76.5% of accuracy.\nThese results obtained with two different classification methods demonstrate the complementarity of inter-subject similarity and intra-subject variability features. Indeed, both information -level of structure degradations and global pattern of key structure modifications -are relevant.\nAfterwards, we compared our GBSG method using RF classifier with stateof-the-art methods on similar ADNI1 datasets. First, we included methods modeling inter-subject variability based on PBG within HIPP [3] , VBM [9] and an advanced PBG (aPBG) estimated over the entire brain [13] . Second, we included methods capturing intra-subject variability based on last deep learning framework [11] , multiple instance learning (MIL) [12] and integrative network of cortical thickness abnormality (ICT) [16] . We applied our GBSG on two definitions of sMCI/pMCI populations as defined in [9] and [13] to perform a fair comparison. Results of this comparison are presented in Table 3 . This comparison shows that best methods based on intra-subject or inter-subject obtained similar accuracy around 75% while our GBSG combining both reached 76.5% of accuracy. Compared to VBM on the same dataset [9] , our GBSG improved accuracy by 1.8 percent point. However, compared to aPBG [13] GBSG provided similar results on the same dataset. Finally, compared to the CNN-based method proposed in [11] our method obtained competitive performances. These results highlight the efficiency of combining intra-subject and inter-subject features.
