AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive amyloid b (Ab) pathology, tau-related pathology, and cell loss [2] . In particular, Ab pathology is characterized by progressive Ab plaque accumulation, starting in the isocortex several years before first cognitive symptoms arise, and interacting in a complex way with both brain activity and rising taurelated pathology [3] . In the context of manifest Ab plaques, changes in cortical activity occur, particularly in relation to slowly fluctuating ongoing (i.e., intrinsic) activity and intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Changes in iFC are detectable in vivo by changes in correlated blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations as measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).\nIn more detail, slow (,0.1 Hz) ongoing fluctuations of activity occur in the absence of a task and findings of coherence between these fluctuations across spatially distributed brain regions have led to the proposition of resting-state or so-called intrinsic brain networks (iBNs). A wide variety of primary sensory and motor, default mode, and \"attentional\" iBNs have been identified, which show high reproducibility [11, 12] . One such iBN is the default mode network (DMN), consisting of discrete regions of the bilateral parietal, prefrontal, and temporal cortices that show coherent hemodynamic fluctuations at rest [13] .\nAlterations in iFC within (intra-iFC) and between (interiFC) iBNs have been reported at various stages across the AD spectrum. With increasing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, both increases and decreases in intraiFC have been reported in AD [14] [15] [16] , alongside decreases in inter-iFC [14, 16] . In terms of specific iBNs, iFC changes within the DMN in AD have been extensively studied, showing disruptions both preclinically in Abpositive healthy control subjects [6, 17] and as a function of cognitive impairment [18] .\nHowever, the pattern of alterations in iFC within and between an extensive variety of iBNs across the whole AD spectrum of Ab positivity remains unknown.\nConsequently, the present study focused on three main questions: (1) How do changes in iFC within iBNs (i.e., intra-iFC) relate to cognitive impairment across the whole AD spectrum? (2) How do changes in iFC between iBNs (i.e., inter-iFC) relate to cognitive impairment across the whole AD spectrum? (3) How do these intra-iFC and inter-iFC changes relate to one another?\nTo test these questions, a sample (N 5 161) of multimodal imaging and neuropsychological data sets from Abnegative, Ab-positive preclinical, prodromal, and clinically manifest AD subjects were analyzed. Statistical analyses were restricted to Ab-positive subjects only to restrict the analysis to subjects on an AD-related trajectory of cognitive impairment. A spatial independent component analysis (ICA) was used to estimate iFC across eight iBNs in rsfMRI data. Scores of intra-iFC and inter-iFC were correlated with scores on a continuous measure of AD-related cognitive impairment and with one another."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc. edu).

When more than one rsfMRI or structural MRI scan was available, those that were acquired within 3 months of one another and met quality control measures were chosen. Subjects whose scans were more than 3 months apart were excluded (n 5 12). After visual inspection of the data, subjects were excluded because of imaging artifacts (n 5 20), field-of-view cuts (n 5 6), and excessive head motion parameters (n 5 2) (for exact criteria see subsequently). Patients identified as Ab negative (see Section 2.3.1 for identification criteria) were also excluded (n 5 31). Thus, a high-quality sample of 90 subjects was further analyzed, representing a range of healthy control subjects and the whole spectrum of AD-related cognitive impairment: Ab-negative healthy control subjects (HC2; n 5 20), Ab-positive healthy control subjects (HC1; n 5 9), early MCI (eMCI1; n 5 21) and late MCI (lMCI1; n 5 18), and AD patients (AD1; n 5 22). Healthy control subjects are in a preclinical stage in which there are no signs of depression, MCI, or dementia, with or without the presence of Ab accumulation (HC1 and HC2, respectively) [19] . MCI patients present concerns of memory decline but do not surpass the threshold of functional impairment to be classified as demented and do not show impairments in other cognitive domains; hence, these subjects present amnestic MCI. The ADNI database subdivides amnestic MCI into two stages, namely eMCI and lMCI, differentiated on the basis of the severity of episodic memory impairment [20] , assessed via the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed Paragraph Recall, Paragraph A only from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised) [21] .

After the first 10 functional images of every subject were removed, slice-timing correction for the removal of slice-dependent time shifts acquired during interleaved scanning was performed and rigid body correction for head movement through realignment to the mean fMRI image. No excessive head motion was identified (i.e., cumulative translation or rotation 3 mm or 3 and mean point-to-point translation or rotation 0.15 mm or 0.1 ). Framewise displacement was not different across groups of Ab-positive healthy control subjects, eMCI, lMCI, and AD patients (P . .05, ANOVA). The T1 structural images were coregistered to the mean fMRI image using rigid registration and segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and registered to the MNI stereotactic space with unified segmentation. Nuisance waveform regression of white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, head motion, and the averaged whole-brain signal were performed, following which the functional MRI images were normalized into the MNI stereotactic space using the same normalization parameters acquired previously, with an isotropic 3 ! 3 ! 3 mm 3 voxel size and smoothed with a 6 ! 6 ! 6 mm 3 Gaussian kernel [32] . Furthermore, our analysis was replicated on \"scrubbed\" fMRI data, in which movement-induced artifacts had been censored by the identification and exclusion of volumes possibly contaminated by movement [33] . This was conducted by the calculation of the root mean square of the translational and rotational head movement parameters. Volumes that exceeded a predefined threshold of the root mean square of such parameters (0.25 mm 1 2 standard deviations of all subjects) were excluded from further analyses [34] ."}, {"section_title": "iBN detection from rsfMRI data and analysis of relationship between iBNs and cognitive scores", "text": "iBNs were detected via group ICA from preprocessed rsfMRI data by a two-step procedure: first, independent NOTE. Subjects in our sample included both healthy control subjects and patients covering the whole spectrum of AD-related cognitive impairment: Abnegative healthy control subjects (HC2), Ab-positive healthy control subjects (HC1), eMCI1, lMCI1, and AD patients (AD1). Group comparisons: analysis of variance was conducted for all measures except sex (Kruskal-Wallis test).\niBN templates were defined in Ab-negative healthy control subjects via ICA, and then templates were used to analyze iBNs in Ab-positive subjects. More specifically, the detrended images of HC2 subjects were decomposed into spatially independent components reflecting iBNs via a group ICA [35] , within the Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT) (http://www.icatb.sourceforge.net). ICA extracts discrete temporally coherent patterns of activity between spatially distributed brain regions from the mixed rsfMRI signal [36] . Sixty-four components were estimated and analyzed using the Infomax algorithm and the Icasso software [37] with 40 runs to assess the reliability of the ICA algorithm. Multiple spatial regression analyses of the components were applied on network templates available online from a previous multicenter study [12] . The components were identified as iBNs based on inspection of the power spectrums and regression coefficient values, alongside visual judgment of anatomic accuracy. Eight components judged as reliably reflecting iBNs (i.e., showing strong anatomic accuracy, strong regression coefficients, and power) were chosen for further analysis (see Fig. 1 ). Then, for each subject, an individual independent component reflecting an iBN was derived via back-reconstruction as implemented in GIFT. The component was composed of the network's time course and spatial map of z-scores.\nOne-sample t tests on z-maps were conducted on all identified network components of HC2 subjects, from which network templates were created. These templates were multiplied with an averaged GM mask created from the segmented GM images derived from the structural MRI data of Ab-positive subjects only, binarized with a probability threshold of 0.4. This was conducted to restrict the network templates to the GM regions present in the Ab-positive subjects. ICA of preprocessed fMRI data of Ab-positive subjects was performed in the same way as for Ab-negative subjects, resulting in spatial z-maps and corresponding time Fig. 1 . Chosen intrinsic brain networks (iBNs). Across a data sample of cognitively normal amyloid b-negative healthy control subjects, eight independent components of fMRI data were identified as iBNs using previously defined templates [12] , shown as statistical parametric maps (one-sample t test P , .001, uncorrected, height threshold t 5 3.58, extent threshold k 5 100), overlaid on a high-resolution canonical T1 image from the MNI series.

One-sample t tests on z-maps were then conducted on the identified iBNs in all Ab-positive subjects, on which the network templates were overlaid to extract mean z-scores of intra-iFC for each iBN. Hence, scores of intra-iFC reflect the value of statistically significant standardized coherence in BOLD signal time series between any two voxels in the network, averaged across all possible voxel pairs within the network template. These scores were then inputted into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 22.0 (IBM corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) [38] for a partial correlation coefficient (r) analysis, controlling for age, sex, and GM atrophy, with scores of cognitive impairment (Pearson's, P , .05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).\nConcerning inter-iFC between iBNs, mean network time courses of pairs of networks, as calculated within the Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) [39] were correlated via Pearson's correlation, respectively. Pearson's (r) maps were transformed into z-maps using the Fisher's z-transform. Hence, scores of inter-iFC reflected the standardized value of correlation between the average BOLD time series of any two networks. These inter-iFC scores were then inputted into SPSS for a partial correlation analysis, controlling for age, sex, and GM atrophy, with scores of cognitive impairment (Pearson's, P , .05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).\nInter-iFC scores were also analyzed for partial correlative relationships with intra-iFC z-scores controlling for age, sex, and GM atrophy in an exploratory approach seeking to understand whether changes in intra-iFC are related to changes in inter-iFC along the AD dementia spectrum."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Intrinsic functional connectivity and cognitive impairment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Intra-iFC", "text": "Results showed a significant decline in iFC within all networks as cognitive impairment increased (see Table 2 , Fig. 2) .

With increased cognitive impairment, we found a general decline in iFC within all iBNs.

Despite this, they do support previous findings of reductions in inter-iFC between specific networks as a function of cognitive impairment [14, 16] and may indicate slight changes that occur in the connectivity between networks in AD, alongside the aforementioned intra-iFC changes.\nThese subtle decrements in inter-iFC were not significantly related to intra-iFC, suggesting that they may be markers of other reactive processes that occur in the brain with AD progression. Previous theoretical models have proposed a dynamic functional model of the resting brain that constantly fluctuates between various competitive states of iFC to achieve a resting state primed for optimal behavioral performance [40] . This leads to postulate that the subtle reductions in inter-iFC may be markers of the dynamic brain fluctuating through various states of iFC in an attempt to keep the resting brain in the most optimal state possible, given the challenges that the AD-affected brain faces, such as pathologic iFC patterns within iBNs."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's disease: A multiple network disorder", "text": "As a network involved in declarative memory processing [41] , the DMN has long been the focus of research into disrupted iFC in AD. However, it is clear from our results and indeed the results of previous studies that AD can be characterized as a disorder in which multiple iBNs, alongside the DMN, are affected [8, 9, [14] [15] [16] [17] 42] . Our results suggest that a global decrement in iFC within a broad range of iBNs can be observed with increased cognitive impairment in Ab-positive subjects. Recent findings [43] may offer some insight into this global iFC decrement in AD. Having been interested in the relationship between neuronal and hemodynamic activity, Matsui et al. found that the neuronal coactivations that represent iBNs are embedded in a frequent global sweep of activity across the entire cortex, neuronal coactivations that are followed by similar coactivations in hemodynamic signaling. Such findings suggest a reliance of the intrinsic functional connections that define iBNs on the initial global wave of neuronal activity and so an impairment in the global wave may lead to an impairment in the delicate timing of the neuronal and hence the hemodynamic coactivations (iFC) that occur within iBNs. This impairment, if indeed the case, would be expected to occur within iBNs across the entire cortex, rather than being localized to any one network. Calcium signaling has been found to be disrupted in mice models of AD [44] , and hence our findings and those of Matsui et al. may offer insight into how an impairment in neuronal signaling may be related to iFC impairments and subsequently cognitive impairment in AD."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The aim of our study was to identify changes in iFC within and between a wide range of iBNs across the entire spectrum of AD. Having used a cross-sectional sample of Ab-positive subjects to define the spectrum, a further study with a longitudinal design may better define the progression of iFC changes. One should also consider the role that other aspects of AD pathophysiology, such as Ab deposition, tau pathology, and vascular changes, may play in the progression of iFC alterations and cognitive impairment across the AD spectrum. Furthermore, although used as a standard measure to assess cognitive impairment in AD, the ADAS (Cog) scale has been criticized for lack of validity at various stages of AD. The scale has been found to be accurate for patients with moderate AD, whereas patients with MCI and mild AD have been reported to display ceiling effects. Similarly, patients in advanced AD stages with impaired language abilities have shown floor effects with this measure [45] . Thus, the ADAS (Cog) scale may not have been able to adequately define the progression of cognitive impairment in our sample. Finally, our regression of the whole-brain signal during rsfMRI data preprocessing may have induced artificial correlations in our data [46] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "With increased cognitive impairment along the AD spectrum, decrements in iFC within a wide range of iBNs can be seen, leading to a characterization of AD as a disorder of multiple networks."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary data", "text": "Supplementary data related to this article can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dadm.2016.11.006."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": "1.
