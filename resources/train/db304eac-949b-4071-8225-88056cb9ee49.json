In 1988-89, 34,319 Ph.D.s were awarded in all fields, more degrees than ever before, surpassing the peak of 33,755 in 1973. The combined fields of political science, international relations, and public policy accounted for 601 of these degrees. In the disciplines commonly thought of as social sciences, degree production in political science was exceeded only by economics in which 898 degrees were awarded; 435 degrees were awarded in sociology, 324 in anthropology, and 105 in geography. "}, {"section_title": "Ph.D.s Received by Women", "text": "Across all fields, women earned 12,510 doctorates-36% of all degrees and a 1 % increase over the past three years. In some major fields, and some social sciences, women account for more than half of the doctorates earned-receiving, for example, 56% of the doctorates in psychology, 58% in education, 59% in language and literature, and 51% in sociology. Twenty-seven per-cent of the degrees in political science, international relations, and public policy were earned by women. Nineteen percent of economics degrees go to women. The proportions for various social science disciplines, and for psychology, are compared in Figure 3."}, {"section_title": "Ph.D.s Received by Minorities", "text": "Among U.S. citizens, minority students earn 10% of Ph.D.s in all fields-4% (811 degrees) earned by African-Americans, 3% (624 degrees) by Asians, 2% (569 degrees) by Latinos, and under 1% (93 degrees) by American Indians. In political science, public policy and international relations, proportions of degrees earned by African-American and Asian students is slightly betteraccounting for 7% and 5% of degrees awarded. However, under 2% of political science degrees were awarded to Latino students. One Political Science includes political science and government, international relations and public policy studies.

Most of these degree recipients come from Asian countries. These patterns hold for the social sciences as well as academia as a whole. Almost one-quarter, 24%, of Ph.D.s in political science, international affairs, and policy were earned by non-U.S. citizens with temporary residence in the U.S. Sociology and geography show similar rates. Anthropology is the social science with the lowest rate of foreign students-10%; economics is the highest with 40%."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Graduate Experience", "text": "The NRC report documents many other features of the graduate experience. Elapsed time from B.A. to Ph.D. in political science is 10.5 years, with 8 years actually registered. As a rule, time spent earning the Ph.D. is greater in the social sciences than physical sciences, where elapsed time is 7.3 years and registered time is 6.1. The most prolonged graduate experience remains anthropology, with 9 years time registered for the degree. Comparison among many fields is shown in Figure 5. The median age of political science doctorate recipients is 33.8 years, equal to the median for all Ph.D. recipients (the youngest are chemists at age 29; the oldest are education doctorates, at 41). The median age of women earning their Ph.D. in political science is 33.4; of men 34.0. Finally, the NRC study reports on sources of support for doctoral study. Data are aggregated broadly by field; social sciences, including psychology, are grouped together. Over half of all doctoral recipients in social sciences (53%) rely on personal resources, including loans, to com-plete their degree-compared to 14% in the physical sciences, 16% in engineering, 25% in life sciences, 48% in humanities, 77% in education, and 54% in fields such as business. In turn, degree recipients in the social sciences complete their studies holding the largest median level of debt of any field. The median level of debt for social science graduates is $11,100, compared to between $6,800 and $7,700 median level of debt for all other non-business fields. Subsequent articles in PS will report on trends in many of these areas since 1980, particularly addressing women and minorities in political science and sources of support for study in the field. "}]
