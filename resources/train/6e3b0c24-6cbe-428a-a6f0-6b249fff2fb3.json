Emerging evidence links this heterogeneity to differences in the underlying biomarker and neuropathology profiles. Recent neuropathology studies have sought to formalize one aspect of this variability by defining AD subtypes on the basis of the different relative densities of pathologic tau deposits in cortical and hippocampal regions of participants with equivalently staged AD.\n1,2 These categorical Murray-Dickson subtypes, called hippocampal sparing (HpSp), typical AD (tAD), and limbic predominant (LP), were associated with differences in age at diagnosis and death, clinical presentation, and rate of antemortem clinical progression, with individuals with the HpSp variant being younger, more commonly showing an atypical clinical presentation, and declining faster. 1, 2 In vivo brain atrophy measurements have shown varying anatomic patterns and degree of atrophy across participants, with increased cortical atrophy in a subgroup associated with more executive dysfunction reminiscent of the HpSp subtype. [3] [4] [5] Moreover, a withinparticipant comparison demonstrated that the ratio of cortical to hippocampal volumes (HVs) from antemortem volumetric MRI (vMRI) correlates with the postmortem tau neuropathologic variant. 6 The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that measures of regional cortical and HV, measured in vivo from vMRI, can be used to define disease subtypes with phenotypes consistent with those based on tau neuropathology and that these features would prospectively predict differential clinical presentations and rates of clinical decline in participants with AD, explaining part of the variability in symptomatology and progression.\nMETHODS Participant sample. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc. edu). Appendix e-1 and table e-1 at Neurology.org, http://www. adni-info.org, http://adni.loni.usc.edu, and previous reports [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] give more information.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. Written informed consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and procedures were approved by site-specific Institutional Review Boards for the Protection of Human Subjects.\nWe selected amyloid-positive participants with AD from ADNI, diagnosed as previously described (http://www.adni-info.org), with baseline 3-dimensional T1 magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo vMRI scans (n 5 229). Amyloid positivity was defined as having a CSF b-amyloid (Ab ) ,192 pg/mL on the University of Pennsylvania assay. 21 If CSF was not available, a 18 F-florbetapir-PET cortical standardized uptake value ratio .1.11 based on the University of California, Berkeley quantification was used. 22 This cohort was used to define the AD subtypes and to assess baseline demographics, age at onset, memory, and executive function. 23, 24 In addition, the mean hypometabolic convergence index (HCI), 25 a measure of the severity of an AD-like hypometabolism pattern on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET provided in the ADNI database, was assessed.\nTo characterize longitudinal changes, we also evaluated a subcohort of participants with AD with 2-year clinical follow-up scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, 13-Item Subscale (ADASCog 13 ), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), executive and memory composite, and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ). These tests were administered as previously described (http://www.adni-info.org). The rate of change in these scales was estimated as the slope of change from baseline to the 2-year visit, including all intermediate visits. Longitudinal analyses were completed only for those who had complete data (at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months), including n 5 100 for CDR-SB and FAQ, n 5 99 for MMSE and memory composite, n 5 97 for executive function composite, and n 5 88 participants for the ADAS-Cog 13 . Those excluded from the longitudinal analysis for missing data (n 5 119) were not different from those included except they had a higher baseline ADAS-Cog 13 and a shorter disease duration and were more likely not to be non-Hispanic white (p , 0.05, data not shown).\nCSF measures. CSF amyloid and tau analytes were collected and processed as described 15 and downloaded from the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging site (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).\nvMRI analysis and endpoints. Volumetric measures were calculated from the 3-dimensional T1 images with FreeSurfer (version 5.1). Specifically, left and right gray matter volumes (GMVs) from lateral frontal (caudal and rostral midfrontal, pars opercularis, pars triangularis), superior temporal, and lateral parietal (inferior parietal, superior parietal, supramarginal) cortices in both cerebral hemispheres were summed to provide a measure of bilateral cortical total volume (CTV) 1, 6 (appendix e-1, Freesurfer Regions). HVs were also summed to create a bilateral total. Both the CTV and HV measures were preadjusted for the effects of intracranial volume, scanner strength (1.5T vs 3T), age, and sex with b coefficients estimated with a regression model estimated on all amyloid-negative, stable, cognitively normal controls from ADNI (see appendix e-1, Pre-adjustment Formula for Volumetric Measures). The residual values for CTV and HV were then used to calculate the HV:CTV ratio (see appendix e-1, equation 3).\nDefinition of AD subtypes. In the original presentation of the subtype algorithm, the HpSp, tAD, and LP subtypes were defined with a 2-step procedure based on the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) counts in the hippocampus and cortical regions. 1 In our study, the HV:CTV ratio was first split (stage 1) at the 25th and 75th percentiles. Participants with HV:CTV ratios below the 25th percentile were provisionally designated as having LP MRI (HV:CTV ratio #0.0408, n 5 57); those with HV:CTV ratios above the 75th percentile were provisionally designated as having HpSp MRI (HV:CTV ratio $0.0501, n 5 57); and the remainder were considered to have tAD MRI (n 5 115). In a second step (stage 2), only participants with HpSp MRI whose HV was greater than the median adjusted HV (median 5 5,726.20 cm 3 ) and CTV was less than the median adjusted CTV (median 5 128,916.82 cm 3 ) were considered as definitively having HpSp MRI (n 5 33). Furthermore, only participants with LP MRI whose CTV was greater than the median adjusted CTV and HV was less than the median adjusted HV were retained as having LP MRI (n 5 38). The remainder of participants were reclassified as tAD MRI (n 5 158). Note that in our study, designations are reversed to reflect that MRI volumes decrease with disease severity, in contrast to counts of NFT pathology, which increase. Figure 1A displays the relative hippocampal to cortical atrophy in the 3 subtypes.\nBecause a single-step procedure would be logistically simpler to operationalize and because in a direct comparison of antemortem MRI to postmortem pathologic subtypes the simple ratio of hippocampal-to-cortical GMW was found to significantly predict the postmortem neuropathologic tau subtype, 6 we also assessed the subgroups obtained after stage 1 only of the algorithm. figure 2C ), but the HpSp MRI subtype scored worse on the executive function composite (table 1 and figure 2D ). The FDG HCI, an index of AD-like hypometabolism, was different between atrophy subtypes, with HpSp MRI showing a greater hypometabolic pattern ( figure 2B ).\nLongitudinal analyses. Mean follow-up time was not different across groups (table 1) . Subtype category was associated with 2-year decline on the CDR-SB, FAQ, ADAS-Cog 13 , and MMSE (table 1 and figure  3) but not in the memory or executive function composite scores. In post hoc comparisons, the Figure 2 Relationship between baseline atrophy subtype and subsequent 2-year change in clinical and cognitive measures Regression analyses. Finally, we examined associations between HV:CTV and clinical phenotypes. At baseline, HV:CTV was not associated with any of the global scales (MMSE, ADAS-Cog 13 , CDR-SB, or FAQ) or the memory composite score but was associated with the executive function composite score, for which a higher HV:CTV ratio (reflecting increased cortical relative to hippocampal atrophy) was associated with poorer executive function ( figure  3A and table 2 ).\nThe HV:CTV ratio was also associated with 2-year change on the CDR-SB, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog 13 , with higher HV:CTV ratio associated with a faster rate of decline ( figure 3 , B-D, and table 2). Two-year change in the FAQ was not associated with either HV:CTV or any demographic variable, while 2-year change in the memory and executive composite scores was associated only with age and sex, respectively (table 2) .\nWhen HV and CTV were entered into the models as additional independent predictors, each was each independently associated with baseline CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog 13 , and MMSE scores, with decreased volumes associated with an increased CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog 13 and decreased MMSE scores (table 2) . CTV alone was independently associated with the baseline FAQ score and the executive function composite (and in this case HV:CTV was no longer significant), with decreased CTV associated with increased FAQ and reduced executive function score (table 2) . Both CTV and the HV:CTV ratio were independently associated with the baseline memory composite, with a lower CTV and lower HV:CTV ratio associated with poorer memory (table 2). In the assessment of 2-year change and with HV and CTV included in the model, the HV:CTV ratio remained significantly independently associated with increasing clinical dementia severity (CDR-SB), with an increased HV:CTV ratio associated with a faster increase in CDR-SB score (table 2) . Two-year change in ADAS-Cog 13 score was independently associated with both CTV and HV (table 2) , while change in MMSE score was associated only with CTV (table 2) . Similar to the findings in the models including only HV:CTV, the slope of change in FAQ score was not associated with any atrophy or demographic variable and change in the memory and executive function composite scores was associated only with age and sex, respectively ( applied to hippocampal and cortical GMV to define HpSp MRI , tAD MRI , and LP MRI subtypes, yielded clinical phenotypes consistent with those reported in the autopsy study. 1 The HpSp MRI group was younger and declined more rapidly than both the tAD MRI and LP MRI groups on measures of global cognition despite comparable cognition at baseline. Moreover, the HpSp MRI subtype performed more poorly on a composite measure of executive function. When modeled as continuous variables, smaller CTV relative to HV was predictive of decreased baseline executive function and more 2-year clinical decline. When HV and CTV were modeled independently, CTV emerged as the main driver of the baseline performance and differential rates of decline across the cohort, although the ratio was independently predictive of 2-year change in dementia severity. Overall, given that the patterns of AD subtypes and associated clinical phenotypes were similar between those defined with atrophy measures from MRI and those defined with postmortem NFT counts, these findings suggest a localized association between the amount of tau pathology and the loss in GM consistent with a previous report. 6 Future studies with tau PET will help to further elucidate this relationship.\nUnlike at baseline, subtype did not affect 2-year decline in the executive function composite score. However, this finding may be due to a floor effect. Major components of the executive function score are Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B, which have maximal scores for noncompletion (150 seconds for TMT A, 300 seconds for TMT B). Thus, if an individual could not complete the TMT at baseline or at follow-up, decline in executive function could not be captured.\nThe atrophy signature and cognitive profiles associated with the different subtypes identified in the present study are similar to those associated with sporadic EOAD. Specifically, increased cortical atrophy, especially in lateral and medial parietal areas, and a higher prevalence of atypical (dysexecutive, visuospatial) cognitive presentations have been reported in EOAD, in contrast to atrophy predominantly in the hippocampus and an amnestic cognitive profile in late-onset AD (LOAD). [26] [27] [28] Thus, the HpSp MRI subtype shows features similar to EOAD, whereas LOAD features are more similar to those of LP MRI . The fact that the subtype (or the continuous GMV) remained significantly associated with clinical presentation only when age was included in the statistical model and was a stronger predictor than age itself suggests that while an EOAD/LOAD age cut point provides a simple diagnostic rule, the clinical profile and trajectory are driven by the different underlying patterns of neurodegeneration, which may provide a more biologically driven basis for segregating patients with AD into subtypes. Whereas a typical AD sequence of atrophy, similar to the stereotypical progression of tau pathology, 29, 30 would show hippocampal atrophy preceding a more widespread decrease in cortical GMV, the HpSp MRI group appears to show the reversed sequence, with cortical atrophy preceding that of the hippocampus. The presence of distinct atrophy patterns in mild cognitive impairment and AD and the profiles of the subtypes identified in the present study are also consistent with data-driven cluster analyses, which identified differential brain atrophy patterns that were dominated either by medial temporal atrophy or by widespread cortical atrophy. 3, [31] [32] [33] The prevalence of the atypical Murray-Dickson subtypes found in the present study (14.4% HpSp MRI , 16.6% LP MRI ) was comparable to that found in the original, substantially larger, autopsy study.\n1 Subtypes defined solely after stage 1 of the Murray-Dickson algorithm (i.e., defined solely on the basis of the HV:CTV ratio) exhibited phenotypic relationships very similar to those obtained after stage 2. In particular, the HpSp MRI group (stage 1) progressed more rapidly and performed worse on executive relative to memory tasks. This finding is also consistent with the direct comparison of antemortem MRI to pathologic subtypes determined postmortem, in which the simple HV:GMV ratio (i.e., corresponding to step 1 of the algorithm) was found to significantly predict the postmortem neuropathologic tau subtype. 6 To avoid selection bias, we calculated the subtype cutoffs from baseline data independently of whether the participants had follow-up data. If the subtypes were calculated just on the subset of participants who had 2-year follow-up data on all scales, the distribution of participants across the 3 subtypes was maintained and the findings were not substantially altered (only 4 participants showed different subtype categorization in stage 1 or 2). Thus, the cutoff values to determine subtype in the present study appear to be fairly consistent within the study population, supporting the presence of phenotypic differences within the AD cohort.\nOne drawback of the Murray-Dickson algorithm is that it requires subdividing a cohort of patients (when applied to vMRI) on the basis of the distribution of their hippocampal and cortical GMV and their ratio. Thus, this technique is not per se directly applicable prospectively to individual participants. However, the quartile and median values reported in the present study may provide suitable cut points for a decision tree to assign a subtype prospectively to new participants with mild AD with vMRI scans processed with the same processing pipeline and segmentation software. This hypothesis remains to be determined with replication in independent samples.\nA few other limitations of the present study exist. Although AD pathology likely develops in preclinical and prodromal stages over many years, we focused only on patients with clinical AD in this study. Future studies in prodromal populations (mild cognitive impairment, particularly amnestic vs nonamnestic), as well as preclinical AD, are warranted. Furthermore, the ADNI study recruits from primarily academic medical institutions and may not be reflective of the broader AD community. In addition, the study has age (55-90 years only) and severity (mild AD or less) inclusion criteria and does not include atypical presentations of AD. However, the fact that we saw differences by atrophy subtype despite the relatively strict enrollment criteria suggests that these effects are robust and generalizable. Future studies in a broader AD population would help to better characterize these differential atrophy profiles.\nAD subtypes based on brain atrophy defined with an algorithm originally derived from postmortem NFT counts identified participants with varying clinical profiles, genetic background, and differential rates of cognitive decline, consistent with those observed in the original autopsy study. In particular, patients with the HpSp MRI subtype, reflecting increased cortical rather than hippocampal atrophy, were generally younger, were less likely to be APOE e4 positive, and had both a more dysexecutive cognitive profile and a more rapid rate of clinical decline. The rate of cognitive decline was driven primarily by cortical GMV loss. The ability to distinguish these subtypes and to determine neurodegenerative predictors of decline with in vivo imaging methods enables clinical trajectories to be predicted more accurately in living patients and points to the utility of considering atrophy patterns beyond the hippocampus in the assessment of patients with AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Dr. Shannon Risacher completed the design, conceptualization, and execution of the study, performed analysis and interpretation of the data, and was responsible for the drafting and revision of the manuscript.
