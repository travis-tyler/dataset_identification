Although it is well known that amyloid plagues and neurofibrillary tangles are two key neuropathological features in AD, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD are not fully understood. A growing body of evidence support the idea that the hyperactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with excess cortisol may be involved in cognitive impairment and dementia (Csernansky et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Gil-Bea et al., 2010) . In addition, it has been reported that the degree of hyperactivity of the HPA-axis was associated with the severity of hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment in patients with dementia (de Leon et al., 1988; Gurevich et al., 1990) . Animal studies reported that chronic stress and glucocorticoids can accelerate memory decline and increase amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathologies in mouse models of AD (Green et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2006) . Further, the authors also found that elevated glucocorticoid levels increase A\u03b2 production by increasing levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) (Jeong et al., 2006) . Taken together, these findings highlight an important role of cortisol in the pathogenesis of AD.\nSynaptic function has been regarded as a critical mechanism underlying cognitive impairment in the pathogenesis of AD (Selkoe, 2002) . A previous study suggested that presynaptic proteins (e.g., synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, and Rab3a) were significantly decreased in AD brains (Sze et al., 2000) . Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a presynaptic protein which plays an important role in neuronal survival and cognition (Toonen et al., 2017) . One previous study showed that SNAP-25 was elevated in the CSF of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, indicating that SNAP-25 may be a useful biomarker reflecting synapse degeneration (Brinkmalm et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018) . Importantly, it has been demonstrated that corticosterone can cause a substantial loss of synapses in rodents, indicating a potential role of corticosterone in the maintenance of synapse function (Tata et al., 2006) . To our knowledge, no human studies on the association between CSF cortisol levels and synapse degeneration have been reported.\nHere, the levels of cortisol in CSF among normal controls, patients with MCI and AD had been compared. Second, we examined the relationship of CSF cortisol levels and synapse degeneration. Finally, we investigated the associations between CSF cortisol levels and typical AD-related biomarkers, including hippocampal volumes, CSF A\u03b242, t-tau, and p-tau levels."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this study were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

In addition, we also found that levels of cortisol in CSF were associated with tau pathologies but not amyloid-\u03b2 protein. However, no significant differences in CSF cortisol levels were found among the three diagnostic groups. Epidemiological studies suggested that chronic environmental stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD (Pardon, 2011; Zverova et al., 2013) . Additionally, preclinical studies have found that glucocorticoids and corticotrophinreleasing hormone (CRH) were involved in AD pathogenesis by manipulating the levels of A\u03b2 and tau pathologies (Kulstad et al., 2005; Green et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2006; Filipcik et al., 2012; Rothman et al., 2012) . Conversely, Baglietto-Vargas et al. (2013) reported that mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, can reduce levels of A\u03b2 and tau and ameliorate cognitive deficits in mice models of AD. Taken together, these findings highlight an important role of chronic stress and stress-related hormones in affecting AD pathogenesis. In the present study, we found that levels of cortisol in CSF were positively correlated with tau pathology and synapse degeneration in normal controls, subjects with MCI and AD. Our findings were consistent with the results from previous studies (Green et al., 2006; Sotiropoulos et al., 2011) . For instance, it has been reported that chronic stress can trigger tau hyperphosphorylation, a core mechanism in AD, and lead to cognitive impairment (Green et al., 2006; Sotiropoulos et al., 2011) . Importantly, tau hyperphosphorylation plays a key role in synaptic function and neuronal survival related with AD due to the fact that phosphorylated tau destabilizes microtubules and results in tau accumulation and cytoskeletal OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. Model 1 is unadjusted. Model 2 was adjusted for age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54, MMSE scores, and diagnosis. a CSF cortisol was treated as independent variable in linear regression models. b Model 2 was adjusted for age, gender, education, diagnosis, APOE \u03b54, MMSE scores, and intracranial volume (ICV). c Abnormal CSF A\u03b2 levels (<192 pg/ml) was treated as dependent variable in logistic regression models.\ndamage (Fitzpatrick et al., 2017) . In addition, tau mislocalization to synapses may be associated with synaptic dysfunction in AD (Hoover et al., 2010; Tai et al., 2012) . These findings could possibly explain how higher levels of cortisol in brain lead to synapse dysfunction, and ultimately cognitive deficits. Although numerous evidence suggested an association of cortisol with synaptic function in preclinical studies, the data in human are limited. Our data found that CSF cortisol was associated with synaptic degeneration in normal controls, patients with MCI and AD. These findings strengthen the idea that CSF cortisol may be associated with synapse degeneration. However, further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms that underlie the associations of cortisol and synaptic degeneration. In the present study, no significant differences in CSF cortisol levels were observed among three diagnostic groups. It has been reported that there were no differences in cortisol levels in plasma (Csernansky et al., 2006) , salivary (Wolf et al., 2002; Souza-Talarico et al., 2010) or CSF (Popp et al., 2009 ) between cognitively normal subjects and patients with MCI. In contrast, others found greater levels of cortisol in salivary in patients with MCI (Arsenault-Lapierre et al., 2010) . However, in patients with AD, previous studies reported elevated levels of cortisol in plasma, salivary, urinary and (Greenwald et al., 1986; Peskind et al., 2001; Rasmuson et al., 2001; Hoogendijk et al., 2006; Curto et al., 2017) . These inconsistencies in the published literature on cortisol levels in MCI or AD may result from several differences between studies, including:\n(1) the sample, which can be salivary, plasma, urinary and CSF; (2) sample size, which can be vary from a handful of participants to many 100's of participants; and (3) methodological differences in the assay procedure which may have effects on sensitivity.\nIn present study, we did not find significant correlations between CSF cortisol and A\u03b2-42 levels, which is consistent with a previous study (Laske et al., 2009) . However, in the same study, Laske et al. (2009) found that cortisol levels in serum, but not CSF, were associated with CSF A\u03b2-42 levels, suggesting serum and CSF cortisol levels appear to be independent in AD patients. Recently, one study investigating the relationship of serum cortisol and amyloid metabolism in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) found that serum cortisol levels were not associated with serum A\u03b2 levels at baseline. However, cortisol levels in serum at baseline were found to be correlated with serum A\u03b2 levels 1 year later (Ishijima et al., 2018 ). The precise association of cortisol and amyloid metabolism needs further investigation.\nSeveral limitations should be noted. First, cross-sectional design limits our ability to explore the temporal relationship of cortisol and synapse degeneration and AD-related biomarker. Second, the findings of this study may not be generalizable to other populations. Finally, this study included only subjects with mild AD. Further study should also include moderate and severe dementia patients to clarify the relationship of severity of cognitive impairment and CSF cortisol levels."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In conclusion, we found that CSF cortisol levels were associated with tau pathologies and synapse degeneration but not amyloidbeta, highlighting a potential role of cortisol in synapse degeneration in AD patients."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "JZ conceived and designed the studies.
