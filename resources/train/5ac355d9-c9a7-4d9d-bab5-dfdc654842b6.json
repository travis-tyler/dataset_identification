[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT Dementia alters the brain wiring on different levels. However, these changes might be subtle particularly in patients with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI). Hence, developing accurate diagnostic techniques for eMCI identification is critical for early intervention to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a large body of machine-learning-based research developed for classifying different brain states (e.g., AD vs MCI) using neuroimaging data. These works can be fundamentally grouped into two categories. The first one uses correlational methods, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its variants, with the aim to identify most correlated features for diagnosis. The second one includes discriminative methods, such as feature selection methods and linear discriminative analysis (LDA) and its variants to identify brain features that discriminate between two brain states. However, existing methods examine these correlational and discriminative brain data independently, which overlooks the complementary information provided by both techniques, which could prove to be useful in data classification tasks. On the other hand, how early dementia affects cortical brain connections in morphology remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a cooperative correlational and discriminative ensemble learning framework for eMCI diagnosis that leverages a brain network representation from multiple morphological networks, each derived from the cortical surface. Specifically, we devise the shallow convolutional brain multiplex (SCBM), which encodes both region-to-region and network-to-network relationships. Then, we represent each individual brain using a set of SCBMs, which are used to train an ensemble of CCA-SVM and LDA-based classifiers, cooperating to output the label for a new testing subject. Overall, our framework outperformed several state-of-the-art methods including independent correlational and discriminative methods.\nINDEX TERMS Morphological brain network, multi-view brain data, canonical correlation analysis, discriminative methods, linear discriminant analysis, ensemble classifier, brain multiplex."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The increasing frequency of dementia occurring is an alarming trend that has prompted urgent research with the goal of preventing the development of the disease. Diagnosing dementia in its early stages is a crucial step in preventing the development of the disease into worsened symptoms [1] . Early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) is an early stage of dementia which affects the brain function and cognition in subtle ways. These can be challenging to identify when mapping brain connections using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of a disordered brain [2] .\nDeveloping a deeper understanding of how early stages of dementia alter specific brain connections in patients might improve the likelihood of earlier diagnosis and assist in treating patients. Within this scope, several machine learning approaches leveraged multimodal MRI data including resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) to distinguish between patients with MCI and healthy controls [3] . However, the very early brain states of dementia including eMCI remain mostly overlooked in previous works when compared with later states such as AD and MCI.\nRecent machine-learning methods were devised for MCI identification using connectomic brain data [4] , [5] . However, existing works mainly used functional brain networks (derived from rsfMRI) and structural networks (derived from dMRI) [6] . These exclude the recent landmark works [7] - [9] , which devised morphological brain networks (MBN) for mapping morphological 'connections' in the cortex to circumvent the limitations of functional and structural connectomes [10] , [11] . Basically, an MBN is generated by measuring the difference in morphology between two cortical regions based on a specific cortical attribute (e.g., sulcal depth). More importantly, [7] - [9] proposed to embed multiple brain networks into a multiplex network structure composed of intra-layer and inter-layer networks. Each intra-layer network in the multiplex represents an MBN derived from a specific cortical attribute, whereas an inter-layer network is a network-to-network similarity inserted between two consecutive intra-layers. The integrated inter-layer network is able to capture high-order brain alterations at the morphological level. While [9] used correlational inter-layers in the brain multiplex structure for late dementia diagnosis, [7] proposed convolutional inter-layers produced by convolving two consecutive MBNs (intra-layers) in the multiplex for early dementia stratification. Notably, both multiplex architectures outperformed conventional single-layer and multi-layer brain network representations. Furthermore, while [9] used a machine learning method that identifies discriminative connectional features for dementia classification, [7] proposed a correlation-based ensemble learning framework, which identifies highly correlated multiplex features. Such approaches disentangle correlational from discriminative approaches, which might limit our understanding of disordered connectional changes in the diseased brain.\nAs shown in [7] and [9] , a prevalent practice for improving classification accuracy is to identify features which contain useful information for the classifier training. In particular, reducing redundant features and primarily focusing on features which have been scrutinized proves to be a useful technique when applied to a classification problem, especially with the growing dimensionality and complexity of data. These existing sample classification approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: methods that aim to identify highly correlated features, and methods that seek to identify the most discriminative features.\nThe first group, correlational methods, aims to identify highly correlated features within the data, selecting a subset of features from the original data with the purpose of removing redundancy which might hinder prediction accuracy. A wide body of correlational methods can be covered with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [7] , [8] , [12] , [13] and its variants. CCA, broadly speaking, maps input features into a shared space where features are more comparable and hence, their correlation can be maximized. The projected correlational features in the shared space are then fused together, which reduces the dimensionality of the original data. Several CCA variants have been developed including sparse CCA (sCCA) [14] and non-linear kernel CCA (kCCA) [15] . Specifically, with the proliferation of multi-view data, multi-view CCA (MvCCA) [16] , [17] and Tensor CCA (TCCA) [18] were designed with the aim of maximizing the correlation between an arbitrary number of views. In addition to these, there are several innovations upon existing CCA variants such as two-stage kernel CCA (TSKCCA) [19] which by implementing L1-regularization allows for a more reliable identification of non-linear correlations, improving upon KCCA and other existing CCA methods.\nThe second group, discriminative machine learning approaches, aim to maximize the distinction between sets of data allowing for a reduction in dimensionality. There are a number of discriminative approaches, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [20] , where the input features are projected onto a space where their disparity and discriminability are maximized. These were previously used to predict Alzheimer's disease progression from structural imaging [21] . Other methods include discriminative feature selection methods such as Mutual Information (MutInf-FS) [22] , which prioritizes minimizing the redundancy in data while maximizing the dependency and relevance of features, or Multi-Cluster Feature Selection (MCFS) [23] , thereby reducing the data dimensionality while maintaining its structure. Other approaches such as Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS) [9] , [24] modeled the relationship between sets of features using a graph to identify groups of highly connected discriminative nodes.\nHowever, a fundamental limitation of the above methods and works reviewed in [25] consists in either identifying correlational or discriminative features for stratifying dementia states. This overlooks the complementary information that can be integrated from both correlational and discriminative approaches to further improve the eMCI/NC classification accuracy.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a cooperative correlational and discriminative ensemble learning framework, which first pairs brain multiplexes, each generated using a different set of MBNs. Each pair of training multiplexes is then communicated to two different blocks of our framework: the first block includes a set of K discriminative classifiers and the second block includes a set of K correlational classifiers. Ultimately, a pair of testing multiplexes will pass through correlational and discriminative classification blocks, thereby outputting 2K labels. By aggregating the labels predicted by all blocks for all pairs of multiplexes, we obtain the final label for the target testing subject. In addition to this landmark contribution, we leverage a multi-layer brain network architecture, the shallow convolutional brain multiplex (SCBM) [8] , which unlike the deep CBM proposed in [7] , is generated using only two MBNs. This avoids creating redundant features when pairing multiplexes prior to passing them forward to classifiers. VOLUME 6, 2018 FIGURE 1. Pipeline of the proposed cooperative correlational and discriminative ensemble learning using brain multiplexes. (A) shows the construction of the multiplex where the inter-layers are created between two intra-layers (two MBNs derived from the cortical surface). (B) For all possible combinations of multiplex pairs, each pair of multiplexes is passed into the ensemble framework, consisting of a correlational learning block (where they are mapped by CCA and classified by SVM) and a discriminative block (where they are mapped and separated into two classes by LDA). The two blocks produce predicted class labels for the test subjects based on analysis of subsequent pairs of multiplexes. The final class label is assigned through majority voting on labels assigned by the two blocks."}, {"section_title": "II.

SINGLE-VIEW MORPHOLOGICAL BRAIN NETWORK (MBN) CONSTRUCTION", "text": "For each cortical attribute (e.g., cortical thickness), we construct a single-view network for each subject. Such network comprises a set of nodes (anatomical brain regions of interest -ROIs) and a collection of edges interconnecting the nodes (representing the dissimilarity between the two brain regions in morphology). The average value of a cortical attribute was calculated for each anatomical region of interest (ROI). For each cortical attribute, the strength of each network edge connecting two ROIs is then computed as the absolute difference between their average values, thereby quantifying their dissimilarity (Fig. 1) . The same procedure was followed to obtain the connectivity matrices from different cortical attributes (e.g., sulcal depth, mean curvature)."}, {"section_title": "B. SHALLOW CONVOLUTIONAL BRAIN MULTIPLEX (SCBM) CONSTRUCTION", "text": "In a generic way, we define a brain multiplex M using a set of M intra-layers (or MBNs) {V 1 , . . . , V M }, each representing a single view of the brain morphology (i.e., cortical attribute). Next, we slide an inter-layer C i,j between two consecutive intra-layers V i and V j . Each inter-layer is created by convolving two consecutive intra-layers. Each element in row a and column b within the convolutional inter-layer matrix C i,j between views V i and V j is defined as:\nThe multiplex architecture allows not only to explore how different brain views get altered by a specific disorder, but how their relationship might get affected. Since the morphological brain connectivity matrices are symmetric ( Fig. 1-A) , we extract features from each MBN by directly concatenating the off-diagonal weights of all connectivities in each triangular matrix. For each network of size n \u00d7 n, we extract a feature vector of size (n \u00d7 (n \u2212 1)/2). Previously, in [7] , the generalized multiplex architecture was proposed:\nNext, to capture the inter-relationship between all possible combinations of intra-layers in a multiplex, a set of N multiplexes were generated for each subject through reordering the intra-layer networks, thereby generating an ensemble of brain multiplexes M = {M 1 , . . . , M N }. However, this approach resulted in many highly correlated features used for the ensemble learning, which may somewhat mislead classifier learning. To minimize the correlation between different multiplexes when pairing them for ensemble classifier training, we design a shallow (i.e., 2-layer) convolutional brain multiplex structure. We define a shallow multiplex M = {V i , C i,j , V j } using 2 intra-layers V i and V j and an inter-layer C i,j encoding the relationship between V i and V j , slid in between them [8] ( Fig. 1-A) . We note that each subject-specific brain multiplex M in M captures unique similarities between 2 different morphological brain network views (e.g., sulcal depth network and cortical thickness network) that are not present in a different shallow multiplex."}, {"section_title": "C. PROPOSED CANONICAL CORRELATIONAL AND DISCRIMINATIVE MAPPINGS OF SCBM SETS", "text": "Since each multiplex M k \u2208 M captures a unique and complex relationship between different brain network views, one needs to examine all morphological brain multiplexes in the ensemble M. This will provide us with a more holistic understanding of how explicit morphological brain connections can be altered by dementia onset as well as how their implicit high-order (a connection of connections) relationship can be affected. To make use of all the information available from different multiplexes, in the correlational learning block of our framework (outlined in green Fig. 1-B) , we use CCA [12] , [13] to map pairs of multiplex feature vectors extracted from different sets into a shared subspace that depicts highly-correlated relevant features. This correlational block allows to minimize the multiplex set-specific noise and reduces multiplex data dimensionality. Next, we use each fused correlational pair of training multiplex featuresM c k,l to train a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier ( Fig. 1-B) . Noting that for each training subject we have N multiplexes estimated, we perform C 2 N mappings of each pair of SCBMs in M.\nSimultaneously, we train the paralleled discriminative block (outlined in red Fig. 1-B) aggregating sets of regularized LDA classifiers using the paired SCMBN features from different sets in a supervised manner. Additionally, each LDA classifier attempts to maximize the difference between multiplex features so that there are distinct groups based on the given class labels. All training multiplex features are mapped into a discriminative space guided by the labels, where the discriminative paired multiplex features are generatedM d k,l . In the testing stage, we map each pair of testing multiplex feature vector onto their corresponding CCA space where they are communicated to an SVM and LDA classifiers, respectively. Finally, to identify the label of the testing subject, we use majority voting by selecting the highly frequent predicted label outputted by classifiers in both blocks."}, {"section_title": "III. RESULTS & DISCUSSION A. EVALUATION DATA", "text": "We evaluated the proposed classification framework using 84 subjects (42 eMCI and 42 NC) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) GO database (adni.loni.usc.edu), each with structural T1-w MR image. The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nWe used FreeSurfer [26] to reconstruct both right and left cortical surfaces for each subject from T1-w MRI. Then we parcellated each cortical hemisphere into 35 cortical regions using Desikan-Killiany Atlas. For the deep CBM, we defined N = 6 multiplexes, each using M = 4 MBNs, anchored at V 1 . For each cortical attribute (signal on the cortical surface), we compute the strength of the morphological network connection linking i th ROI to the j th ROI as the absolute difference between the averaged attribute values in both ROIs. Multiplex M 1 includes cortical attribute views\nFor each cortical region, V 1 denotes the maximum principal curvature brain view, V 2 denotes the mean cortical thickness brain view, V 3 denotes the mean sulcal depth brain view, and V 4 denotes the mean average curvature brain view. As for the proposed SCBM, we define N = C 2 4 = 6 shallow multiplexes, by considering all possible pairings of 2 views out of 4. For our experiments, we created 4 representations of MBN data: (1) 'Views' by concatenating all MBNs, (2) 'Correlational multiplexes' with inter-layer computed using Pearson correlation, (3) 'Convolutional multiplexes' composed of 4 intra-layers with inter-layers generated using 2D convolution, and (4) 'Shallow convolutional multiplexes' composed of 2 intra-layers with inter-layers generated using 2D convolution.\nRemark: In the convolutional brain multiplexes, the convolution operation between intra-layers captures the signal within a subgraph (a small patch in the connectivity matrix) extracted from a first layer (whole matrix) as an expression of other subgraphs extracted from a second layer. One can think of the inter-layer network as a 'high-order blending' of both intra-layers, expressing the amount of overlap of intra-layer 1 as it is shifted over intra-layer 2."}, {"section_title": "B. EXPERIMENT SETUP", "text": "To demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating correlational and discriminative methods into a single framework, we benchmarked our method against several discriminative methods including: Eigenvector Centrality (ECFS) [27] , VOLUME 6, 2018 Mutual Information (MutInf-FS) [28] , and Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS) [24] . We also benchmarked our method against the CCA-based eMCI/NC classification framework in [7] . We also evaluated the performance of each of the aforementioned discriminative methods when combined with CCA using our proposed framework. Additionally, we benchmarked against newer discriminative and correlational methods, Tensor CCA (TCCA) [18] , the multi-view Discriminant Analysis (MvDA) [29] , and finally the two methods combined into a paired classifier.\nThe first method, Tensor CCA (TCCA) [18] , utilizes tensors for a correlation analysis of an arbitrary number of views. Specifically, TCCA maps multiple views into covariance tensors where correlated features can be identified, maximizing the correlation between several views and hence improving upon traditional CCA methods which are optimized for pairwise correlation. Furthermore, TCCA is capable of identifying high order correlation information by also adopting the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, further improving upon its correlational counterparts. The second method, Multi-view Discriminant Analysis (MvDA) [29] , follows a similar process by extending traditional LDA to support multiple views. MvDA aims to maximize the between-class variations while simultaneously minimizing any within-class variance, consequently highlighting discriminative features. Subsequently, we combine both MvDA and TCCA into a single framework for a final benchmark, to allow for the analysis of the shared information between the correlational and discriminative methods.\nWe used leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) to evaluate our proposed method and its comparison methods. Specifically, using a support vector machine (SVM), we train a model on the data with the number of subjects minus one and subsequently predict a label for the remaining subject. This process is repeated until there are predicted labels for every subject where they can be compared to the ground truth labels, producing an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores. Furthermore, due to MvDA containing an optimization variable, \u03bb, we tuned it using 5-fold cross-validation, starting with \u03bb = 0.1 and iterating through to 0.9 with a step size of 0.1. This form of nested cross-validation was used for two other variables in the experiment. Specifically, the number of selected features for ECFS and MutInfFS were automatically tuned using a similar nested 5-fold cross-validation technique, where the feature size varied from 50 to 400 with a step size of 50. Additionally, we empirically tuned specific variables in TCCA due to the cumbersome runtime of the method. We set the optimization variable to 0.5 and tuned the number of features for each data type. Finally, ECFS, TCCA, and MvDA required dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional data, due to computational limitations and memory overload. Consequently, PCA was applied to the data for dimensionality reduction. In particular, for ECFS method, we applied PCA to the deep convolutional multiplexes as it was unable to handle high dimensional data. Table 1 displays the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each method. Each benchmark method shows results for morphological views, correlational multiplexes [9] , deep convolutional multiplexes [7] , and shallow convolutional multiplexes in both hemispheres. Additionally, in Fig. 2 , we show the comparison between independent LDA, CCA, and our proposed method via column graph, showing the accuracy for each data type. The best accuracy was attained using the proposed framework with shallow convolutional multiplexes for the right hemisphere, with an accuracy of 80.95% (Fig. 2) . The proposed framework improved upon the independent methods, increasing the accuracy by 3-7% in the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere results show a contrasting conclusion, achieving the best accuracy using independent LDA with correlational multiplexes (76.19%). These conclusions can be seen clearly in Fig. 2 . This difference in accuracy between hemispheres might be explained by the way early dementia biomarkers manifest in the data, sometimes being more difficult for certain methods to identify."}, {"section_title": "C. IDENTIFYING THE MOST DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES", "text": "To identify the top 10 most discriminative features of each view (cortical region), we applied ECFS which returned a ranking of features, from the most to the least discriminative which allowed us to select the optimal number of features. We note that we used ECFS as it is the second best discriminative method that allows to track the original features unlike LDA which projects the features. The ranked features were averaged between all subjects to produce circular graphs showing the most common top features for each view (Fig. 3 ).\nWeights were then produced for each feature where they were correlated with the thickness of the edge in the circular graph. The most highly correlated features are not shown due to neither TCCA nor CCA returning a ranking of features but directly projecting the data within their methods, which inhibits tracking of the original features. There are several compelling observations that can be made from the circular graphs shown in Fig. 3 . The most prominent of which is the significance of the entorhinal cortex which appears to be a primary hub in all views and both hemispheres, as it is present in every connection. This also may indicate the significance of this region as a strong biomarker for detecting early stages of dementia. Another notable observation occurs in the right hemisphere's view 3 (mean sulcal depth) where there is a strong connection between the transverse temporal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus, neither of which appear in any other view. This may be due to the parahippocampal gyrus' proximity to the entorhinal cortex, causing it to be affected by early stages of dementia. Finally, the posterior-cingulate cortex is a prominent feature in views 1 (maximum principle curvature) and 4 (mean average curvature), occurring in both hemispheres, although more pronounced in the left. Like the entorhinal cortex, the posterior-cingulate cortex is a highly connected hub node, and may also be a key biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of early dementia."}, {"section_title": "D. PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "We proposed a novel framework that pairs discriminative and correlational methods together to leverage the complementary information that can be neglected when only one of the approaches is used. Furthermore, we improved upon existing deep convolutional brain networks by using a 2-layer alternative which shows the relationship between 2 views, while also reducing the high dimensionality and redundant features of the deep convolutional multiplexes.\nOur proposed framework significantly outperformed several comparison methods when focusing on both the deep and shallow brain multiplexes in the right hemisphere. These conclusions are shown clearly in Fig. 2 , where the combined LDA and CCA method has a large margin of increase over their independent counterparts. The left hemisphere produced contrasting results, with independent Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieving the highest accuracy using correlational data. These opposing results might indicate that early stages of dementia affect the hemispheres in distinct ways. While also producing superior results with the proposed method, it was also observed that pairing both correlational and discriminative methods significantly improved results for data in the right hemisphere, when compared to any of the independent discriminative methods. Both ECFS and MutInf-FS improved their accuracy when paired with CCA for the shallow data in the right hemisphere, yielding their highest results, further demonstrating the proposed framework's improvement.\nThe benchmark methods maintained a consistent performance with the proposed framework; however, the performance in the left hemisphere was notably lower. One interesting result was with the newly proposed methods TCCA, MvDA and their paired classifier, which achieved very high accuracies individually but were somehow weakened when paired. One potential factor for their reduced accuracies was the addition of principle component analysis (PCA) as neither method can directly handle high-dimensional data. PCA has proven to affect the accuracy of classification as it can reduce reduncancy; however, it can also remove useful features and hence affect the performance either way [30] , [31] . The effect of PCA may also be noted within the fluctuations in the performance of ECFS using convolutional data."}, {"section_title": "E. PERFORMANCE OF LEFT & RIGHT HEMISPHERES", "text": "An interesting observation to note is the disparity between accuracies from the left and right hemispheres. While the right hemisphere performs relatively well, the left severely underperforms with almost all methods, including the proposed framework, with the exception of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Despite the contrasting conclusion from the right hemisphere, pairing discriminative and correlational methods is detrimental to the classification accuracy in the left hemisphere when compared to standalone discriminative methods. This may be explained by the severe underperformance of the CCA fusion method, which can be seen in Table 1 , where there is up to a 10% decrease in accuracy between hemispheres. This disparity can be observed in Fig. 2 where the classification accuracy significantly improves when the correlational and discriminative accuracies are similar individually. However, when the disparity between the correlational and discriminative methods is large, the accuracy generally averages between the two instead of improving. This is probably due to the majority voting being heavily biased towards the lower accuracy, pushing the classifier to select the incorrect label."}, {"section_title": "F. ANALYSIS OF MOST DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES", "text": "Using ECFS to identify the top most discriminative features for each view, we could identify significant biomarkers for displaying early signs of dementia. The most notable finding was the prominence of the entorhinal cortex where almost all the top 10 features were connected. While being a hub node in the brain responsible for numerous connections, the entorhinal cortex is also notable for being one of the first regions to be affected by early states of dementia [32] , [33] and is hence a crucial biomarker to analyze when diagnosing eMCI. Furthermore, another notable region was the posterior cingulate cortex which occurs multiple times in the maximum principle curvature and the average mean curvature views. The prominence of this identified region can possibly be explained by the proximity to the affected entorhinal cortex, indicating that the spread of dementia starts at hub nodes then spreads outwards into connected regions. Interestingly, the posteriorcingulate cortex, which also appeared frequently, is another dominant hub node commonly identified as one of the first affected regions by dementia [34] . These findings may assist in identifying early states of dementia by clearly displaying significant biomarkers and patterns in brain scans of the affected patients. Additionally, it was observed that the most prominent identified features remained consistent across all the morphological brain views, which might indicate that dementia affects the brain morphology uniformly. Further analysis could be made for identifying prominent features by finding a correlational method which allows us to better track the most relevant features."}, {"section_title": "G. SHALLOW VS. DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL BRAIN MULTIPLEXES", "text": "A limitation of the deep convolutional multiplexes was the possible redundancy of data due to its high dimensionality. Since different deep multiplexes contain overlapping sets of features, resulting in highly-correlated input data, it might result in a suboptimal ensemble performance. Hence, the shallow multiplex structure solved this problem by reducing the correlation between individual classifiers in the ensemble and overall produced a better ensemble classifier performance compared to the ensemble classifier using deep convolutional multiplex structure. The utilized shallow convolutional brain multiplex (SCBM) consistently outperformed concatenated MBN views and correlational brain multiplexes across all methods within the right hemisphere -except for independent ECFS."}, {"section_title": "H. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK", "text": "To further improve the proposed classification architecture, it is essential to address the limitations found with the analysis of the results attained in our experiment. In particular, the performance of the proposed framework and comparison methods within the left hemisphere are a significant limitation. Both the correlational and discriminative methods have a large disparity in their performance between hemispheres, with the right hemisphere consistently giving better results. The benchmark CCA method performs particularly poorly in the left hemisphere, and noticeably has a negative effect upon the paired method's performance. Generally, the left hemisphere contains features which might be harder to identify, with dementia possibly manifesting in significantly different ways across hemispheres. Additionally, the discriminative methods perform poorly on the left hemisphere, with both ECFS and MutInf-FS losing a considerable accuracy.\nFinding methods which further improve the results of the left hemisphere would be a suitable initial direction for future work. For improving the correlational block of our framework, one can use methods that go beyond linear correlations and better identify sparse feature correlations such as Sparse CCA, or Kernel CCA. Additionally, a more tuned optimization of Tensor CCA (TCCA) may also be applicable to the problem as it showed promising results. Improving the discriminative methods could also have a significant impact on improving the combined accuracy. Finding more discriminative feature selection methods which rank features, like ECFS and MutInf-FS, may be a useful addition as a more accurate method could identify more biomarkers within the left hemisphere. Furthermore, tuning the selected features for ECFS and MutInf-FS, by using smaller step-sizes, could have a positive affect on the classification as they would identify only the most reliable features that differentiate between both groups."}, {"section_title": "IV. CONCLUSION", "text": "Diagnosing early brain symptoms of dementia such as early Mild Cognitive Impairment (eMCI) is vital to prevent worsening of symptoms. To assist this diagnosis, we proposed a cooperative correlational and discriminative ensemble learning framework using shallow convolutional brain multiplexes. Our method attained a large increase in accuracy when using both the shallow and deep convolutional data against several benchmark methods including [7] , and numerous discriminative methods. A reported increase of over 7% was attained for the shallow data which supports our theory that utilizing both correlational and discriminative analysis methods yields an increase in overall performance when focusing on the right hemisphere. Another conclusion drawn from these results is that similar accuracy between the shallow and VOLUME 6, 2018 deep convolutional data is obtained with the shallow having a higher prediction accuracy frequently. This shows that investigating the similarity between two brain networks can be convenient when analyzing the multi-level effects dementia has on brain connections. In our future work, we will explore other correlational and discriminative methods that are based on feature ranking and avoid projections, thereby allowing to identify the original features most relevant to the target classification task.
