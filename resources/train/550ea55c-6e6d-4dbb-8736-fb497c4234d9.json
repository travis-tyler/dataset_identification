Recent research has also reported that the 2019-nCoV virus is 96% identical at the genome level to a previously detected bat coronavirus, which belongs to a SARS-related coronavirus species (ie, SARS-CoV). 18 Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, 2019-nCoV likely originated in bats, but it remains unclear whether an intermediary animal host was involved before the virus jumped to humans. As reported in earlier research, however, although bats could be the original host of 2019-nCoV, the virus may have initially been transmitted to an intermediate animal host sold at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, thus facilitating the emergence of 2019-nCoV in humans. 19 In the present study, we investigated the time origin and genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in humans based on 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with known sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020.\nWe conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of four 2019-nCoV genome sequence datasets (ie, \"dataset_14,\" \"dataset_24,\" \"data- "}, {"section_title": "| Recombination and phylogenetic analyses", "text": "To assess the recombination for the full dataset (ie, \"dataset_32\"), we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1. 23 The best-fit nucleotide substitution model for \"dataset_32\" was identified "}, {"section_title": "| Transmission network reconstruction", "text": "The HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (www.hivtrace.org) 35 was employed to infer transmission network clusters for the full dataset (ie, \"dataset_32\").

The PHI test of \"dataset_32\" did not find statistically significant evidence for recombination (P = 1.0). Likelihood-mapping analysis of \"dataset_14\" revealed that 100% of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong star-like topology signal reflecting a novel virus, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread ( Figure 1A) . Likewise, 91.9%, 81.8%, and 74.7% of the quartets from \"dataset_24,\" \"dataset_30,\" and \"data-set_32,\" respectively, were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating relatively more phylogenetic signals as additional sequences were analyzed over time ( Figure 1B-D) . ML phylogenetic analysis of the four datasets also showed star-like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood-mapping results (Figure 2 ). Root-to-tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best-fitting root showed that \"dataset_14\" had a relatively strong positive temporal signal (R 2 = .2967; correlation coefficient = .5446) ( Figure 3A ).

We also considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between 2019-nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site.

Of note, the strong star-like signal (100% of quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle) from \"dataset_14\" at the beginning of the virus outbreak suggests that 2019-nCoV initially exhibited low genetic divergence, with recent and rapid human-tohuman transmission. This result is consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \"da-taset_14\" (Figure 2A ). The genetic divergence from \"dataset_32\" and \"dataset_30\" was higher than that for \"dataset_14,\" but still demon- (Table 1) .\nThis is considered reasonable given the limited genetic divergence and strong star-like signals and is also consistent with our previous study. 36 Using the tip-dating method, the mean TMRCA date and Table 1 ). The TMRCA estimated by the tip-dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained evolutionary rate method. We identified three phylogenetic clusters with posterior probabilities between .99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference (Figures 4 and 5) . We also identified three transmission clusters when the genetic distance between the 2019-nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site ( Figure 6 ). Intriguingly, only one cluster (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020 from Zhuhai) was identified by both phylogenetic and network-based methods. This is a good example showing the differences between phylogenetic (posterior probability or bootstrap value) and network-based (genetic distance) methods.\nHowever, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of 2019-nCOV genome sequences presented in this study.\nThe first genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was made public in early January 2020, with several dozen-taken from various peoplenow available. The genome sequences of 2019-nCoV have already led to diagnostic tests, as well as efforts to study its dispersal and evolution. As the outbreak continues, we will require multiple gen- Therefore, we predict that one or more mutations may be selected and sustained during the 2019-nCoV outbreak as the virus adapts to human hosts and possibly reduces its virulence, as reported in the previous study. 37 However, we are uncertain whether this will influence its transmissibility.\nIn conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of likelihood -mapping, transmission network, and phylogenetic analyses in providing insights into the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of 2019-nCOV. Improving the linkage between patient records and genome sequence data would also allow large-scale studies to be undertaken. Such research could directly influence public health in terms of prevention efforts introduced to reduce virus transmission in real-time."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science "}]
