Apart from discovery of susceptibility genes, prediction of individual's phenotype from high-dimensional genetic information, termed as a genetic prediction, is an important task for personalized medicine. Currently, researchers are exploring the most effective way of building genetic prediction models (Purcell et al. 2009) . In this paper, we develop a new statistical approach, smooth-threshold multivariate genetic prediction, for building genetic predictive models with input of large-scale genome-wide SNPs data.\nWe consider standard multiple regression model but with high-dimensional predictor variables. To be specific, y = (y 1 , . . . , y n )\nT represent response variables of individual's phenotype data modeled by a conditional distribution given predictor variables X = (X 1 , . . . , X p ) observed for n individuals, in which X j = (x 1,j , . . . , x n,j )\nT for j \u2208 M = {1, . . . , p}. The conditional expectation of y i given x i = (x i,1 , . . . , x i,p ) is assumed to be a linear combination \u03b7{E(y i |x i )} = x i \u03b2, where \u03b7 is some known monotone function and \u03b2 is a vector of regression coefficients. In this paper, we consider linear regression with identity map \u03b7 for quantitative trait such as clinical characteristics, and logistic regression with logit function \u03b7 for binary trait such as affected/unaffected status. Each X j is either genotype at a SNP site or other covariate such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption and principal components for population stratification. Each SNP can take one of three possible genotypes, gg, gG and GG, where g and G denote minor and major alleles at the SNP site, respectively. If X j represents the observed count of minor allele g at a SNP site, X j takes a value from {0, 1, 2}. Under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the observed count of minor allele g at each SNP follows a binomial distribution with parameter f \u2208 [0, 0.5] called a minor allele frequency (MAF), i.e. frequency of the minor allele g in general population. Quality controls (QCs) are often conducted to remove low-quality SNPs by checking HWE and missing rates as well as low MAF SNPs. Even after those QCs, large number of SNPs still remain. Since sample sizes are usually far less than the number of SNPs, the predictive modeling in GWAS faces the p \u226b n problem. The p \u226b n condition hampers multiple regression that fits simultaneously using p predictors X.\nStandard GWAS analysis conducts marginal association scan between y and each X j independently, i.e. a univariate analysis which tests the slope parameter in univariate regression model, followed by multiple test using a Bonferroni correction with a stringent significance level (e.g. p-value less than 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) in order to control the rate of false positive findings. Meanwhile, suppose that X does not include covariates and consists of SNPs only. Let T j (y, X) represent a non-negative test statistic for testing association between jth SNP X j and y as a function of y and X, and the corresponding inclusion threshold be t > 0. For example, t is a chi-squared quantile at a given p-value cutoff for chi-squared test statistics T j (y, X). The resulting SNP set from a marginal association screening at a threshold t is defined by A = {j \u2208 M : T j (y, X) > t}. Purcell et al. (2009) proposed a gene score method which simply averages each genotype data weighted by estimated effect size for each SNP in A. Warren et al. (2013) consider multiple regression for SNPs in A, called a multivariate gene score method.\nIn the purpose of prediction, the cutoff t can be chosen in terms of prediction ability. However, evaluating prediction ability is not straightforward unlike in traditional setting without screening. It is known that, the screening invalidates traditional statistical procedures, called an winner's curse effect. Analogous problem arises in the context of prediction modeling. Actually, simulation studies as well as examination on real GWAS datasets reported that screening leads to overfitting. In Ueki and Tamiya (2016), we show that the screening can deflate the residual sum of squares (RSS) compared with the RSS without screening, so that the RSS becomes too optimistic. Since screening complicates the behavior of RSS, naive use of RSS is unwarranted in measuring prediction ability. Instead, we can use cross-validation (or sample splitting) which divides the training data into two parts, one of which is used for ranking SNPs and remaining is used to construct a predictive model. Purcell et al. (2009) choose an optimal inclusion cutoff by cross-validation.\nAlthough cross-validation takes into account of the screening, reduced sample sizes in training stage may lose predictive power, which is a severe concern when sample sizes are small. Five or ten-folds cross-validation is commonly used in model selection. For example, the SparSNP program (Abraham et al., 2012) implementing penalized regression methods, the lasso and elastic net, searches for entire genome-wide SNPs data without SNP screening. SparSNP selects the tuning parameter by k-fold cross-validation with default setting of k = 10. Repeated genome-wide scans needed at each candidate tuning parameter and multiple runs of model fitting in each fold increase computational cost. For large-scale data such as the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, heavy computational cost critically limits the applicability although penalized methods are known to give better predictive power than the simpler gene score method.\nIn this paper, we develop a new predictive modeling approach, a smooth-threshold multivariate genetic prediction, which is really applicable to large-scale genome-wide data such as WGS data while preserving high prediction ability. Our method consists of two stages. At the first stage, our method continuously screens SNPs based on the output from standard univariate analysis for marginal association of each SNP. At the second stage, the predictive model is built by a generalized ridge regression simultaneously using the screened SNPs with SNP weight determined by the strength of marginal association reflecting the uncertainty of inclusion. Since the final predictive model is essentially built in multiple regression model as in the sure independence screening, the correlations between predictor variables are accounted for (See also Warren et al. (2013) ). Marginal association signal is used only for penalizing each regression coefficient. Our method is very rapid because computationally expensive genome-wide scan is required only once in contrast to the penalized methods which need genome-wide scan several times. Our proposal can be seen as a smoothed version of multiple regression after single SNP-GWAS screening of predictor variables at some p-value cutoff, in which the discontinuous process in screening is replaced by a continuous function. The resulting continuity makes the prediction stable in the sense of Breiman (1996) . The continuity in SNP screening also leads to a closed form expression of generalized degrees of freedom (GDF; Ye, 1998) , and allows an application of Stein's unbiased risk estimation (SURE). While the Mallows' C p (Mallows, 1973) with the usual degrees of freedom is no longer unbiased model selection criterion due to the effect of screening, we can readily construct an unbiased C p -type model selection criterion using the GDF. It allows data-dependent choice of optimal SNP inclusion cutoff without relying on cross-validation. The effect of screening is properly accounted for by the SURE's unbiasedness. Since no cross-validation is needed, computationally expensive genome-wide scan is required only once in ranking SNPs. We also extend to generalized linear models and propose a loglikelihood-based C p -type model selection criterion. Simulation studies which mimic real SNP-GWAS data for both quantitative and binary traits show that the proposed method gives better performance than gene score and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and attains a comparable or sometime improved prediction performance with the lasso and elastic net in SparSNP program. Application to large-scale WGS data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) exhibits that the proposed method gives higher predictive performance than both the gene score and GBLUP methods."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Here we consider linear multiple regression model, y = \u00b5 + \u03f5, where \u00b5 = E(y|X) = X\u03b2, \u03f5 \u223c N(0, \u03c3 2 I n ), X is a p-dimensional design matrix and \u03b2 is the corresponding p regression coefficients. Since p is much larger than n in typical GWAS data, some dimensionality reduction is required. Sparsity assuming that many components of \u03b2 are zero would be a realistic assumption. If susceptible SNPs show relatively large marginal signal, marginal association screening effectively reduces the dimensionality. The gene score method (Purcell et al., 2009 ) and its multivariate generalization (Warren et al., 2013) use upperranked SNPs in marginal association, A = {j \u2208 M : T j (y, X) > t}, for a given cutoff value t > 0. Although dimensionality is effectively reduced, discontinuity in y present in the screening process in A may incur instability of prediction, i.e. small change in data can make large changes in the prediction (Breiman, 1996) . To address the discontinuity issue, we use a smooth-thresholding proposed by Ueki (2009) . To be specific, we propose to estimate the regression coefficients by . Here\u010e j is an adaptive lasso smooththresholding function defined by\u010e\nSince\u010e j = 1 if and only if T j (y, X) \u2264 t, the screened set A with\u010e j is the same as that withD j = 1 {T j (y,X)\u2264t} , where 1 {\u00b7} denotes the indicator function. It can be seen that\u010e j replaces the discontinuous screening processD j by a continuous function. As a result,\u03bc i (y) turns out to be continuous in y.\nThe regression coefficient for the screened set in (2.1),\u03b2 A , can be seen as a solution to\n3)\n, which is the minimizer of a generalized ridge regression loss, ||y \u2212 X A \u03b2 A || 2 + \u2211 j\u2208A \u03b2 2 j W j , with respect to \u03b2 A . Ridge weight for each predictor variable, W j , represents uncertainty of marginal association screening. If the marginal association is very weak, we have\u010e j \u2248 1 and large W j , then the corresponding regression coefficient is strongly shrunken towards zero. If the marginal association is strong, we have\u010e j \u2248 0 and W j \u2248 \u03bb, then the corresponding regression coefficient is less penalized. From the fact that the winner's curse effect produces larger selection bias for small regression coefficient, it is expected that the above penalization decreases the selection bias.\nPredictive power largely depends on the choice of t. It may be done using cross-validation by dividing a dataset into test and training samples (Warren et al., 2013) . Cross-validation takes into account sampling variability due to the screening. However, repeated genome-wide scans to obtain the screened set A needed in cross-validation incurs computational burden. It is also concerned that the reduction in training sample sizes decreases the predictive power of the model. Instead of crossvalidation, we propose a C p -type criterion based on SURE using GDF. The continuity of\u03bc i (y) in y leads to a closed-form expression of GDF. In what follows, we consider p-value cutoff \u03b1 instead of t by a one-to-one transformation t = F \u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03b1), where F \u22121 is a quantile function of the distribution of T j (y, X) under the null hypothesis of no marginal association such as F or \u03c7 2 distribution. An optimal \u03b1 is determined by minimizing the C p -type criterion within a range of \u03b1 for search, [\u03b1 min , \u03b1 max ]. The proposed procedure is outlined at the end of this section. It is noteworthy that the computational intensive genome-wide scan is required only once in the single-SNP association screening at Step 1. Subsequent Steps 2-4 are performed on the reduced set of SNPs whose single-SNP association p-value is less than \u03b1 max .
