MRI-based hippocampus volume, a core feasible biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is not yet widely used in clinical patient care, partly due to lack of validation of software tools for hippocampal volumetry that are compatible with routine workflow.

Receiver operating characteristic analysis of FSL-FIRST hippocampal volume (corrected for head size and age) revealed an area under the curve of 0.79, 0.70, and 0.70 for prediction of aMCI-to-ADD conversion within 12, 24, or 36 months, respectively. Thus, FSL-FIRST provides about the same power for prediction of progression to ADD in aMCI as other volumetry methods."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "versit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.

However, manual segmentation is time consuming and therefore hardly compatible with routine workflow in the typical diagnosis setting with high patient throughput. In contrast, fullyautomated and computationally efficient software tools do provide the potential to translate hippocampus volumetry into clinical routine. There are several commercial and non-commercial software tools for hippocampus volumetry available, some of which have been evaluated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in a process of qualification of hippocampus volume as an imaging biomarker for enrichment of clinical trials in predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6] . Despite considerable methodological differences, all of the tested tools provided about the same power for prediction of conversion to AD dementia (ADD) in MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [6] . Our group [7, 8] recently proposed a processing pipeline for fullyautomated hippocampus volumetry based on the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package (version 8, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) [9] . The SPM software is freely available and well documented open source. The prognostic accuracy of the SPM8 processing pipeline in ADNI aMCI subjects was in very good agreement with the EMA results [8] . However, the SPM8 processing pipeline uses (global) stereotactical normalization into template space and a predefined standard hippocampus atlas mask to delineate the hippocampus in template space. The hippocampus mask selected for this application is rather large, in order to account for residual anatomical variability after stereotactical normalization. As a consequence, hippocampus volume estimated by the SPM8 pipeline is considerably larger than hippocampus volume from manual segmentation according to the harmonized protocol proposed recently [10] . This is a limitation of the atlas-based SPM8 approach.\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of another freely available software tool, FSL-FIRST, which was developed for anatomical segmentation of subcortical structures including the hippocampus [11] . FSL-FIRST deploys model-based segmentation for accurate anatomical delineation of the hippocampus (detailed description of the method in [11] ). Hippocampus volumetry with FSL-FIRST was performed in exactly the same ADNI subjects that had been included in the evaluation of the SPM8 processing pipeline [8] . This allows direct head-tohead comparison of FSL-FIRST and SPM8."}, {"section_title": "MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI subjects", "text": "MRI data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nIn brief, 198 aMCIs from phase 1 of the ADNI were included: 95 ADNI aMCIs who had converted to ADD within a period of 36 months (32 after 12 months, 43 between 12 and 24 months, and 20 between 24 and 36 months), and 103 ADNI aMCIs who had remained stable over 36 months. In addition, 137 ADNI normals with 1.5T screening MRI were included as controls. All of them had been documented as normal throughout a period of 36 months after baseline clinical examination. No subjects were excluded based on poor image quality. A more detailed description of eligibility criteria and the characteristics of the included cohorts is given in [8] .\nTwo 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (3D-MPRAGE) images had been acquired in the same imaging session (back-toback scans). We consistently selected the first scan to mimic clinical routine in which there is usually only a single scan available.

SPM8 rigid-body co-registration to a whole brain template [12] in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was used for this preprocessing step. Then, hippocampus segmentation was performed using the FIRST module from the FMRIB's Software Library (FSL; version 5.0; http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). The run first all routine was applied with slight modification to enable a larger search region and a normalized mutual information cost function as described in [13] . The total hippocampus volume (FIRST-HV) was obtained by summing hippocampus volume in left and right hemisphere.\nFSL-FIRST uses a hippocampus model comprising shape and intensity information. The model has been derived from 336 T1-weighted MRIs in which the hippocampus was delineated manually. These MRIs were registered globally to MNI space (affine 12 parameter registration). A second, local registration was restricted to subcortical structures. The variation in shape and intensity is modeled by a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

The adjusted total hippocampus volume is denoted as FIRST-HVad.\nThe SPM8-based HV toolbox [7] was used for TIV estimation, although the FSL software provides possibilities to obtain the TIV, for example by using the Brain Extraction Tool (BET) with corrections as described in [15] , and the use of different software tools in general means an additional effort for the user. The rationale for using the SPM8-based HV toolbox for TIV estimation was to simplify the comparison with TIV-and age-adjusted hippocampus volume from the SPM8 processing pipeline (avoid additional variability by different TIV estimates) [8] .

All accuracy measures were cross-validated. Standard deviation is given in round brackets, 95% confidence interval in square brackets Signed difference and relative signed difference of FIRST-HV from the two back-to-back MPRAGE scans of the ADNI baseline imaging session were both very small (Table 1) , demonstrating very high testretest stability of FIRST-HV. The actual estimates of the hippocampus volume (FIRST-HV) were used for the test-retest analysis rather than hippocampus volume corrected for TIV and age (FIRST-HVad) in order to avoid additional variability due to test-retest variability of SPM8-based TIV estimates. FSL-FIRST was applied to exactly the same ADNI aMCI subjects that had previously been included in the evaluation of an SPM8-based processing pipeline [8] . Although both methods are quite distinct methodologically, the predictive accuracy in these subjects was about the same (AUC of FSL-FIRST / SPM8 was 0.79 / 0.78, 0.70 / 0.72, and 0.70 / 0.71 for prediction of aMCIto-ADD conversion within 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively). The performance of FSL-FIRST is also in good agreement with the performance of other tools evaluated in ADNI MCI subjects. In the EMA study, for example, AUC for prediction of MCI-to-ADD conversion within 24 months ranged from 0.69-0.74 [6] . This suggests that the method used for quantitative estimation of the hippocampus volume has only a small impact on its predictive power. A possible explanation of this might be an intrinsic limitation of the hippocampus volume as prognostic marker in aMCI, that is, an upper threshold for its accuracy considerably below 100%, which also the best volumetry cannot surpass. FIRST-HV showed high correlation with the semiautomated HV-SNT values which in turn have been shown to provide excellent agreement with manual tracing of the hippocampus [14] . The correlation with HV-SNT was considerably stronger for FSL-FIRST than for the SPM8 processing pipeline (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.86 versus 0.72 [8] ). This indicates that the model-based FSL-FIRST method indeed achieves more accurate delineation of the individual hippocampus in MPRAGE images than the atlas-based SPM8 approach. However, it should be noted that other methods for fully-automatic hippocampus volumetry might provide even higher agreement with manual delineation. For example, Wolz and co-workers reported very high intraclass correlation between the learning embeddings for atlas propagation (LEAP) method and manual delineation (two-way mixed single measures intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(3, 1) = 0.898) [17] .\nAhdidan and colleagues, using another multi-atlas method for fully-automated hippocampus volumetry, found very high spatial agreement with manual hippocampal segmentation as measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (0.87 on average) [18] .\nHippocampus segmentation by FSL-FIRST clearly failed in only one out of 335 subjects. This demonstrates the robustness of the method, which is an important prerequisite for use in everyday clinical routine. However, it is important to note that this robustness was achieved only after some minor modifications of the original FSL-FIRST pipeline, namely (i) rigid-body transformation of each individual MRI into template space prior to application of FSL-FIRST and (ii) spatial extension of FSL-FIRST's hippocampus search space as has been suggested previously [19] ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Hippocampus volumetry with FSL-FIRST provides about the same performance for prediction of aMCI-to-ADD conversion as other tools. This qualifies FSL-FIRST to be added to the list of freely available hippocampus volumetry tools for use in clinical routine. Compared to the atlas-based SPM8 approach, model-based FSL-FIRST provides more accurate anatomical delineation of the hippocampus and, therefore, more accurate estimates."}]
