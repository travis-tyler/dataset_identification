Fibrillar amyloid accumulation, a hallmark structural brain neuropathology of AD, begins about two decades prior to clinical diagnosis. 1 Ten percent of cognitively normal individuals aged 50 have amyloidosis, with prevalence increasing to over 40% by age 90. 2 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) was the first radiotracer used in human studies of amyloid PET. 3 Several studies have demonstrated that 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET measures of glucose metabolism, an indicator of brain function, are correlated with the mean of the early PiB time frames [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] as well as the R 1 parameter reflecting relative radiotracer delivery computed from dynamic PiB-PET. 9 These results suggest that dynamic PiB imaging can be used to assess both the structural proteinopathies and functional properties of the brain. Similar results have been obtained with other amyloid radiotracers, including 18 F-florbetapir (FBP) 10 and 18 F-florbetaben. 7, 11 Additionally, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as measured by dynamic 15 O-H 2 O-PET has been shown to correlate with PiB-K 1 , the unidirectional influx rate of radiotracer from plasma to tissue in units of ml=\u00f0ml \u00c1 min\u00de, 12, 13 as well as with the unitless relative delivery parameter R 1 given by the ratio of tissue K 1 to reference region K 1 . 14, 15 Cerebral glucose metabolism and blood flow are reflective of neuronal, in particular synaptic activity. 16, 17 Hence, 15 O-H 2 O and FDG-PET have been used as measures of functional neurodegeneration, which, as the aforementioned studies show, can also be assessed via dynamic amyloid imaging.\nThis dual-biomarker imaging of both fibrillar amyloid burden and neuronal activity via dynamic amyloid PET has important clinical implications: it may obviate the need for a separate PET scan to measure neuronal activity, thereby reducing patient burden and radioactivity exposure. The availability of information on neuronal activity in addition to amyloid burden can enable better differential diagnosis of dementias. 18 Furthermore, understanding functional neurodegeneration is important for prognosis. For example, studies show that co-occurrence of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration is associated with steeper cognitive declines than the presence of either alone. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Therefore, characterization of neuronal activity, a proxy for neurodegeneration, alongside amyloidosis is key to a more complete understanding of cognitive decline. It is particularly important to assess longitudinal changes in neuronal activity to identify factors that can slow down or prevent cognitive decline and associated brain changes.\nPrevious reports that demonstrated the use of dynamic amyloid imaging for computing surrogates of neuronal activity have been limited to cross-sectional associations. It remains unclear whether surrogate measures computed from dynamic amyloid imaging are reliable longitudinally, and whether they exhibit longitudinal changes similar to those of rCBF. In this paper, we use rCBF as measured by static 15 O-H 2 O-PET and dynamic PiB-PET to address these gaps in knowledge by examining within-individual longitudinal associations and population-level longitudinal trends in rCBF, mean of early PiB time frames, and PiB-R 1 . We hypothesized that both early PiB time frames and R 1 would be highly correlated with rCBF cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and that they would have similar associations with age, sex, and amyloid group."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods Participants", "text": "We selected visits with both a 15 O-H 2 O and a dynamic 11 C-PiB-PET scan in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), and a structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) within six months of PET scanning.

The resulting sample consisted of 159 individuals with a total of 355 visits acquired between June 2005 and September 2017. Ten individuals were used to define the optimal time frame for the early amyloid image.

MRI acquisition is detailed in Supplement. Anatomical labels and regional brain volumes were obtained for each MRI using the MUSE labeling approach 24 with atlases that have been harmonized to account for differences in scanners and acquisition parameters. 25 This harmonization enabled the use of volumetric data acquired on the three different scanners (355 visits) together in statistical analyses. We used 118 MUSE regions of interest (ROI) covering the cerebral cortex, lobar white matter (WM), and subcortical gray matter (GM) structures ( Supplementary  Table) . In our analyses, we focused on an AD metabolic signature composite region, the meta-ROI (comprised of bilateral angular, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal gyri), 26 given that dynamic PiB-PET may be useful in assessing AD-related neurodegeneration in addition to gaining insight into a hallmark neuropathology of AD. We also evaluated a composite of all cortical GM regions.\nTransmission scan. A transmission scan in two-dimensional mode using a 68 Ge rotating pin source was obtained prior to the emission scans and was used for attenuation correction during PET reconstruction. 15 O-H 2 O-PET imaging. After completion of the transmission scan, a static 15 O-H 2 O-PET scan was acquired in resting state on a GE Advance scanner in threedimensional mode following an intravenous bolus injection of 370 MBq of 15 O-H 2 O. Image data were obtained for 60 s once the total radioactivity counts in the brain reached threshold levels. The image was reconstructed using filtered backprojection (image matrix \u00bc 128 \u00c2 128, 35 slices, pixel size \u00bc 2 \u00c2 2 mm, slice thickness \u00bc 4.25 mm). Each 15 O-H 2 O-PET scan was rigidly registered onto the corresponding MRI using normalized mutual information. 27 The MUSE label image was transformed from MRI to PET space using the resulting rigid registration matrix, and was resampled to the PET space voxel grid using nearest neighbor interpolation. The 15 O-H 2 O-PET images were normalized by cerebellar GM to obtain rCBF images consistent with PiB-R 1 (see below), which is based on a cerebellar GM reference region. The cerebellum has been used previously as a reference region for analysis of 15 O-H 2 O-PET. 14, 28 PiB-PET imaging. Ten minutes after the 15 O-H 2 O-PET scan, a dynamic PiB-PET scan was obtained over 70 min (33 frames) on a GE Advance scanner in three-dimensional mode. Acquisition began immediately following an intravenous bolus injection of approximately 555 MBq of PiB, and time frames were binned according to the following protocol: 4 \u00c2 0.25, 8 \u00c2 0.5, 9 \u00c2 1, 2 \u00c2 3, and 10 \u00c2 5 min. The dynamic scan was reconstructed using filtered backprojection with a ramp filter, yielding a spatial resolution of approximately 4.5 mm FWHM at the center of the field of view (image matrix \u00bc 128 \u00c2 128, 35 slices, pixel size \u00bc 2 \u00c2 2 mm, slice thickness \u00bc 4.25 mm). Each frame was aligned to the mean of the first 2 min to correct for motion. Average of the first 20 min of PiB-PET scans was rigidly registered onto the corresponding MRI, and the MUSE label image was transformed from MRI to PET space. Radiotracer kinetics were modeled using a simplified reference tissue model with a cerebellar GM reference region, and distribution volume ratio (DVR) and relative delivery parameter (R 1 ) images were estimated using linear regression with spatial constraint. 29 R 1 is given by\nwhere K 1 is the unidirectional influx rate from plasma into tissue and K ref 1 is the unidirectional influx rate into the reference region. We separated individuals into amyloid \u00c0 and \u00fe groups based on a mean cortical PiB-DVR threshold of 1.062 derived from a Gaussian mixture model (Supplement). Early amyloid image (EA) was computed as the average of the time frames within the 0.75-2.5-min interval, normalized by cerebellar GM activity. This time interval was selected to maximize regional correlation with rCBF in a separate training data set (see Supplement).\nRegional rCBF, PiB-EA, and PiB-R 1 mean values were computed in native PET space using transformed MUSE labels.\nData from the BLSA are available upon request from the BLSA website (https://www.blsa.nih.gov).

To assess the reliability and stability of each PET measure, we computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for each ROI. This entailed fitting a linear mixed effects model with a fixed and random intercept as well as a fixed slope to account for change over time. ICC was computed as the ratio of the variance of the random intercept to the total variance (i.e. sum of the random intercept and noise variances).\nWithin-ROI correlations. To determine whether EA or R 1 is a better surrogate of rCBF, we computed all pairwise Pearson correlations at baseline for each ROI. We repeated these correlations for rates of change, computed for 52 individuals with at least three PET measurements. For each ROI, rate of change in rCBF, denoted \u00c1rCBF \u00c1t , was defined as the coefficient of the age term in individual-specific linear regression models with rCBF as the outcome, and intercept and age as explanatory variables. We similarly computed the rates of change in EA and R 1 .\nCross-sectional and longitudinal associations. We assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of each meta-ROI PET measure with age, sex, and amyloid group using linear mixed effects models. We also explored models including APOE \"4 positivity as an additional independent variable. We first converted each PET measurement to a z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation at baseline. For each PET measure, we fitted a linear mixed effects model with longitudinal PET measure as the dependent variable, and intercept, baseline age (centered at 75), sex, amyloid status, time from baseline, and interactions of baseline age, sex, and, amyloid status with time as fixed effects. We included a random intercept per individual. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.\nPower calculations. For each meta-ROI PET measure, we fitted a random slopes linear mixed effects model with age as the independent variable. Mean annualized change was computed as the fixed effect estimate for the age term, and standard deviation (SD) was computed as the standard deviation of the random slope.\nWe computed the number of participants required per group to detect a groupwise difference equal to 50% of the estimated mean annualized rate of change given the estimated variance-covariance matrix based on a twosided test with a \u00bc 0.05 and 80% statistical power, assuming that each individual is observed for four visits separated by two-year intervals.\nSoftware. For statistical analyses, we used R version 3.4.3. 30 Linear mixed effects models were fitted using the nlme package. 31 Plots were generated using ggplot. 32 Power calculations were performed using the lmmpower function in the longpower package. 33 Results Figure 1 shows rCBF, EA, and R 1 images for a participant with higher and a participant with lower levels of rCBF.\nIntraclass correlation coefficients. PiB-R 1 ICCs were the highest in every ROI except for the right occipital pole, where EA had a higher ICC ( Supplementary  Figure 1) . Median (interquartile range [IQR]) ICC across ROIs was 0.58 (0.50-0.64), 0.67 (0.57-0.73), and 0.81 (0.73-0.84) for rCBF, EA, and R 1 , respectively. Meta-ROI ICCs fell in the highest quartile: 0.74, 0.81, and 0.86 for rCBF, EA, and R 1 , respectively (Supplementary Table 1 ). Longitudinal trends in the meta-ROI for each PET measure are illustrated in Figure 2 .\nWithin-ROI correlations. Cross-sectionally, rCBF had higher correlations with R 1 compared to EA in 75 of the 118 ROIs ( Supplementary Figure 2(a) ). Median (IQR) Pearson correlations across ROIs was 0.65 (0.60-0.72), 0.67 (0.63-0.72), and 0.88 (0.85-0.92) for rCBF-EA, rCBF-R 1 , and EA-R 1 , respectively. Meta-ROI correlations fell in the highest quartile: 0.79, 0.76, and 0.93 for rCBF-EA, rCBF-R 1 , and EA-R 1 , respectively (Figure 3(a) , Supplementary Table 2 ).\nRate of longitudinal change in rCBF was more strongly correlated with rate of change in R 1 than EA in 71 of the 118 ROIs ( Supplementary Figure 2 Meta-ROI correlations fell in the highest quartile: 0.61, 0.65, and 0.94 for rCBF-EA, rCBF-R 1 , and EA-R 1 , respectively (Figure 3(b) , Supplementary Table 2 ).\nCross-sectional and longitudinal associations. We did not observe any associations between the PET measures investigated and APOE \"4 positivity. Therefore, APOE was not included in the final linear mixed effects model. Associations with baseline age (b \u00bc \u00c00.035, p \u00bc 0.0007 for rCBF; b \u00bc \u00c00.021, p \u00bc 0.043 for EA; b \u00bc \u00c00.022, p \u00bc 0.026 for R 1 ) and time (b \u00bc \u00c00.062, p \u00bc 0.0012 for rCBF; b \u00bc \u00c00.084, p < 0.0001 for EA; b \u00bc \u00c00.061, p \u00bc 0.0001 for R 1 ) were statistically significant for each meta-ROI PET measure ( Table 2 ).\nThere were some differences across the different PET measures in relation to cross-sectional associations with sex and amyloid group. While the directions of the associations agreed, there were differences in the magnitude of the estimated regression coefficients and their statistical significance. rCBF and R 1 were lower in the amyloid \u00fe group (b \u00bc \u00c00.39, p \u00bc 0.011 for rCBF; b \u00bc \u00c00.31, p \u00bc 0.028 for R 1 ), whereas this association was not statistically significant for EA (b \u00bc \u00c00.12, p \u00bc 0.44). EA and R 1 levels were lower among males (b \u00bc \u00c00. 35 , p \u00bc 0.030 for EA; b \u00bc \u00c00.50, p \u00bc 0.0014 for R 1 ), while this was not statistically significant for rCBF (b \u00bc \u00c00.048, p \u00bc 0.76). We did not find statistically significant associations of baseline age, sex, or amyloid group with rate of longitudinal change in any of the PET measures. For a qualitative assessment of the differences between amyloid\u00fe and amyloid\u00c0, we computed mean images per amyloid group (not adjusted for covariates) and subtracted them (amyloid\u00c0 \u00c0 amyloid\u00fe). The difference images (Figure 4 ) further demonstrated the similarity between rCBF and R 1 images, whereas the EA images exhibited subtler group differences.\nThe lack of statistical significance for the amyloid status and EA association raised the possibility that EA may be contaminated by amyloid-binding PiB signal, nullifying our ability to detect lower neuronal activity among amyloid\u00fe individuals. We assessed whether EA reflects amyloid burden by computing cross-sectional Pearson correlation between continuous PiB-DVR and EA at baseline among the 47 PiB\u00fe individuals in our sample. This correlation (0.18, p \u00bc 0.22), while not statistically significant, was higher than the correlations of PiB-DVR with PiB-R 1 (\u00c00.0065, p \u00bc 0.96) and rCBF (0.065, p \u00bc 0.66).\nPower calculations. The mean (SD) annualized change in meta-ROI rCBF, EA, and R1 was \u00c00.0031 (0.00070), \u00c00.0025 (0.00035), and \u00c00.0020 (0.0012), respectively. We found that to detect a groupwise difference equal to 50% of the estimated mean annualized change, 318, 243, and 232 participants would be needed per group for rCBF, EA, and R1, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We evaluated whether two measures derived from dynamic PiB-PET scans, namely the average of the early frames (EA) and the relative delivery parameter R 1 , can serve as surrogates of rCBF measured by static 15 O-H 2 O-PET. Compared to rCBF and EA, R 1 had the highest longitudinal test-retest reliability and required the smallest sample to detect groupwise differences in longitudinal rates of change in the meta-ROI, an AD metabolic signature composite region.

The meta-ROI exhibited cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations in the highest quartiles. All meta-ROI PET measures had statistically significant associations cross-sectionally with age and showed statistically significant longitudinal declines. In age-adjusted analyses, meta-ROI rCBF and R 1 were lower among individuals with elevated amyloid levels (adjusting for sex), whereas EA and R 1 were lower among males (adjusting for amyloid status). The lack of statistical significance for lower EA among amyloid\u00fe individuals can be explained by the weak correlation we observed between EA and amyloid burden, potentially compromising EA as a surrogate of rCBF. Given the higher ICC of R 1 and its lower correlation with amyloid burden compared to EA, R 1 is a more favorable surrogate measure for rCBF. Our findings confirm previous cross-sectional reports of early PiB time frames 28 and PiB-R 1 14,15 as surrogates of cerebral blood flow as measured by 15 O-H 2 O-PET. Our study adds to the existing body of knowledge by evaluating the longitudinal agreement between rCBF and these surrogate measures from dynamic PiB scans, demonstrating that PiB-based measures, in particular R 1 , can be longitudinally reasonably reliable surrogates of rCBF in certain individual ROIs and the meta-ROI.\nThe recently published National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) research framework 34 recommends a biomarker-based classification system for studying the preclinical, MCI, and dementia stages of AD based on ''b-amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)].'' Our study shows that dynamic PiB-PET can be used to gain insight into two of these three categories, with DVR yielding a measure of amyloid burden and R 1 yielding a measure of functional neurodegeneration.\nCertain kinetic properties, such as a high first-pass influx rate, of PiB and other amyloid radiotracers allow for the use of their early frames and radiotracer delivery parameters as correlates of rCBF. 12 These kinetic properties stem from these radiotracers' moderate lipophilicity, which yields optimal passive transfer across the blood-brain barrier. 35 Our findings may be generalizable to other radiotracers with similar properties.\nThere is a tight coupling between rCBF and glucose metabolism, with rCBF increasing in response to increased glucose demand by functionally activated normal cerebral tissue, 36 which constitutes the biological basis for the observed correlations between 15 O-H 2 O and FDG-PET imaging. 37, 38 Consistent with the association between CBF and glucose metabolism, our results agree with previous cross-sectional reports demonstrating that early amyloid time frames and PiB-R 1 can serve as surrogates of glucose metabolism. [4] [5] [6] 8, 9, 28 Studies have shown that the early amyloid time frames are strongly correlated with the relative flow parameter R 1 , 8 and to a lesser extent, with the absolute flow parameter K to FBP-R 1 in most regions. 28 We found minimal differences between the EA and R 1 estimates with regard to their correlations with rCBF. However, the intraclass correlation coefficients accounting for overall longitudinal decline that we reported for PiB-R 1 were higher than the ICCs of rCBF computed from 15 O-H 2 O-PET and of PiB-EA. This suggests that PiB-R 1 is a more reliable measure, which is an important consideration, especially for longitudinal studies. The low-to-moderate ICCs of rCBF measures may in part explain the low correlations we observed for longitudinal rates of change between rCBF-and PiB-based measures.\nWe found similar associations with age and time for each of the three PET measures in the AD metabolic signature meta-ROI. This finding confirmed that each PET measure can capture age-related cross-sectional associations as well as longitudinal declines. Gietl et al. found negative associations between age and early PiB frames in the hippocampus, as well as negative age associations in frontal, temporal, and parietal GM regions among amyloid\u00fe cognitively normal and mild cognitively impaired individuals. 39 Given that the correlations between rCBF and PiB-based measures were not perfect, we would expect to find some differences in statistical inference using different PET measurements. This was indeed the case for the analyses we conducted using the meta-ROI measures in relation to their associations with amyloid status and sex. We found that rCBF and R 1 were lower among amyloid\u00fe individuals, but this effect was not statistically significant for EA. Given the weak positive correlation between PiB-EA and PiB-DVR among amyloid\u00fe individuals, it is possible that amyloid-binding signal is present to an extent in the EA measurements, which could explain the lack of a statistically significant amyloid status association for EA. Similar to our study, the study by Gietl et al. did not find associations between early PiB frames and amyloid positivity. 39 Another study including individuals with dementia due to AD, as well as cognitively normal and mild cognitively impaired individuals, reported lower early PiB frame measures only in posterior cingulate and parietal cortices among amyloid\u00fe individuals, whereas FDG-PET demonstrated wide-spread differences in cortical and subcortical GM. 5 The sex effect we observed for the PiB-based measures, but not for rCBF, is harder to explain. This suggests possible differences between cerebral delivery or clearance of PiB and 15 O-H 2 O.\nOur study has several limitations. Our previous investigations of partial volume correction on 15 O-H 2 O-PET scans yielded rCBF values with low signal-to-noise ratios due to increased noise, and therefore, we did not use partial volume corrected data. However, given that both our 15 O-H 2 O and PiB-PET scans were acquired on the same scanner, the same scanner point spread function applies, and thus, differences due to partial volume effects should be minimal. We could not evaluate differences in PET measures by clinical diagnosis given our small sample size. We did not investigate different methods for PiB kinetic parameter estimation, which could influence agreement of R 1 values with rCBF. We do not obtain arterial input functions given the longitudinal nature of our PET study, and as a result, had to rely on reference region approaches for estimating PET parameters and could not compute absolute delivery parameters K 1 . A strength of our study was the ability to compare rates of change in rCBF to change in PiB-based surrogate measures, due to the extensive longitudinal PET data available in the BLSA.\nOur conclusion that the PiB-R 1 kinetic parameter can constitute a surrogate measure of rCBF will be useful for other studies involving dynamic PiB-PET imaging. The longitudinal agreement we observed among these measures indicates that changes in neuronal activity over time can be assessed with longitudinal PiB-PET, without the acquisition of an additional PET scan. Our study demonstrates the value of a dynamic 0-70-min rather than a delayed PiB-PET acquisition. A better understanding of longitudinal changes in neuronal activity will help assess disease risk factors, identify protective mechanisms, and enable better predictors of cognitive progression.\nIn conclusion, the relative delivery parameter R 1 computed from dynamic PiB-PET can serve as a reasonable surrogate of relative regional cerebral blood flow computed from 15 O-H 2 O-PET. We found a moderate level of cross-sectional agreement between PiB-R 1 and rCBF, and a low-to-moderate level of agreement in longitudinal rates of change. Both PET measures exhibited similar age and amyloid status associations crosssectionally and showed marked longitudinal declines. The higher longitudinal stability of PiB-R 1 compared to rCBF is an important property for longitudinal studies. Our results demonstrate that dynamic PiB-PET scans can provide a measure of neuronal activity in addition to amyloid burden. This dual-imaging property may obviate the need to acquire a 15 O-H 2 O or 18 F-FDG-PET scan, thereby reducing patient burden, radioactivity exposure, and cost. intellectual content; YA took part in analysis and interpretation of data, and revision of manuscript for intellectual content; DFW was involved in the study design and data acquisition supervision, revision of manuscript for intellectual content; SMR took part in the study concept and design, oversight of data acquisition, interpretation of data, revision of manuscript for intellectual content."}]
