[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "a b s t r a c t Despite growing attention to the unintended intergenerational consequences of incarceration, little is known about whether and how paternal incarceration is related to children's food insecurity. In this article, I use data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study to examine the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity. Propensity score matching models indicate that recent paternal incarceration, defined as incarceration in the past 2 years, is associated with an increased likelihood of food insecurity among 5-year-old children, but only among children living with their biological fathers prior to his incarceration. These associations cannot be explained by the mechanisms considered, including post-incarceration changes in economic well-being, parental relationships, maternal parenting, and maternal health. Taken together, the findings highlight the salience of the father's residential status in linking paternal incarceration to children's food insecurity, and they have a number of implications for policy and practice."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "because paternal incarceration is concentrated among already vulnerable poor and minority children, an unintended consequence of the growing prison population may be increased inequality among children \u00f0Wakefield and Wildeman 2013\u00de.\nDespite increasing attention to the consequences of paternal incarceration for child well-being across the life course, little is known about whether and how paternal incarceration is related to food insecurity among children \u00f0however, for research on this topic, see Wallace and Cox \u00bd2012\u00de, an especially acute and severe form of deprivation that is distinct from other indicators of economic insecurity or hardship \u00f0McIntyre et al. 2003\u00de . There are good reasons to expect that paternal incarceration increases children's risk of food insecurity and that this association is particularly strong among children living with their fathers prior to their fathers' confinement. Young children are especially at risk of experiencing food insecurity, as they are exposed to fewer alternative food resources than older children \u00f0e.g., school meal programs, meals at friends' houses\u00de and may thus experience especially deleterious consequences of food insecurity \u00f0Slack and Yoo 2005\u00de.\nI use data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study \u00f0FFCWB\u00de, a longitudinal sample of urban children born to mostly unmarried parents between 1998 and 1999, many of whom experience paternal incarceration during early childhood, to answer two research questions. First, what is the relationship between paternal incarceration and food insecurity among children with residential fathers \u00f0prior to incarceration\u00de and children with nonresidential fathers \u00f0prior to incarceration\u00de? Second, to what extent do post-incarceration changes in economic well-being, parental relationships, maternal parenting, and maternal health explain the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity? Overall, given the substantial number of children who experience paternal incarceration, the unequal distribution of incarceration across the population, and the importance of food insecurity for children's life course trajectories, disentangling the consequences of paternal incarceration for children's food insecurity adds a fundamental new dimension to our understanding of childhood inequality. background food insecurity among children Food insecurity, defined by the Economic Research Service \u00f0ERS\u00de of the US Department of Agriculture \u00f0USDA\u00de as having limited access to adequate food due to lacking economic or other resources, is a large and growing problem in the United States \u00f0Nord 2009; Coleman-Jenson, Gregory, and Singh 2014\u00de. In 2013, nearly 18 million households in the United States were food insecure, and about 8.6 million children \u00f011.7 percent\u00de lived in households where at least one child was food insecure \u00f0Coleman-Jenson et al. 2014\u00de . Food insecurity among children is not evenly distributed across the population and, instead, is more common among minority children, children living in households with incomes below the poverty line, and children with single parents. About three-fifths of food-insecure households participate in at least one federal food and nutrition program, suggesting that these programs still leave some families vulnerable \u00f0Coleman-Jenson et al. 2014\u00de .\nThe consequences of food insecurity among children are wide-ranging. Food insecurity or hardship is associated with educational outcomes, including reduced test scores, a greater likelihood of retention, and lower school engagement \u00f0Alaimo, Olson, and Frongillo 2001; Ashiabi 2005; Jyoti Frongillo, and Jones 2005; Howard 2011 ; however, also see Dunifon and Kowaleski-Jones \u00bd2003, which finds that food insecurity is associated with children's health and behavior but not their test scores\u00de; behavioral outcomes including internalizing problems, externalizing problems, poor social skills, and visits to a psychologist \u00f0Kleinman et al. 1998; Murphy et al. 1998; Alaimo et al. 2001; Weinreb et al. 2002; Dunifon and Kowaleski-Jones 2003; Slack and Yoo 2005; Whitaker, Phillips, and Orzol 2006; Zaslow et al. 2009; Belsky et al. 2010; Huang, Oshima, and Kim 2010; Slopen et al. 2010 ; also see Fram et al. 2011\u00de ; and health outcomes, including stomachaches, headaches, and poor general health \u00f0Kaiser and Townsend 2005; Cook et al. 2006; Chilton et al. 2009; Eicher-Miller et al. 2009; Gundersen and Kreider 2009\u00de . Therefore, it is possible that children's food insecurity explains some of the negative relationship between paternal incarceration and children's educational \u00f0e.g., Haskins 2014; Turney and Haskins 2014\u00de, behavioral \u00f0e.g., Geller et al. 2012; Wakefield and Wildeman 2013\u00de , and health outcomes \u00f0e.g., Roettger and Boardman 2012; Foster and Hagan 2013; Turney 2014b\u00de. why might paternal incarceration increase children's food insecurity?\nTheoretically, there are many reasons to expect that paternal incarceration would have deleterious consequences for children's food insecurity. Although incarcerated men are often thought of as solitary and isolated from family members, the majority of incarcerated men have children \u00f0Mumola 2000\u00de. Prior to incarceration, many fathers are employed, contribute economically to family life, and are engaged in parenting their children \u00f0e.g., Geller, Garfinkel, and Western 2011; Arditti 2012; Turney and Wildeman 2013\u00de . Therefore, incarceration is a disruption that affects not only the incarcerated but also the families and children of the incarcerated. At least four possible pathways may link paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity: changes in family economic well-being, changes in parental relationships, changes in maternal parenting, and changes in maternal health.\nEconomic instability resulting from paternal incarceration is perhaps the most obvious pathway through which incarceration may increase children's food insecurity. Incarceration necessitates that men, most of whom contribute earnings to their families prior to incarceration, lose their jobs. This means that incarcerated men, while simultaneously accumulating legal debt \u00f0Harris, Evans, and Beckett 2010\u00de, have few opportunities to economically provide for their families \u00f0see, e.g., Western 2006\u00de. Incarceration facilitates human capital deficits, social network disruptions, and discrimination; accordingly incarcerated men have difficulty securing gainful employment after release \u00f0Hagan 1993; Pager 2003\u00de. Given the strong link between economic instability and food insecurity \u00f0e.g., Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011\u00de, it is quite likely that the economic instability \u00f0including indicators of material hardship\u00de resulting from paternal incarceration means that families experiencing paternal incarceration have difficulty providing nutritious meals and consistent access to food for their children.\nThe mechanisms linking paternal incarceration to children's food insecurity may not be narrowly economic. Indeed, incarceration has a number of cascading collateral consequences for family life. It is by now well known that paternal incarceration strains family relationships, leading to marital dissolution and poor relationship quality between parents \u00f0Western 2006; Comfort 2008; Massoglia, Remster, and King 2011; Turney 2015\u00de ; increases maternal neglect and harsh parenting \u00f0Turney 2014\u00de; and increases maternal mental and physical health problems \u00f0Wildeman, Schnittker, and Turney 2012; Lee, Wildeman, et al. 2014\u00de . Given that relationship instability \u00f0Bartfeld and Dunifon 2006; Manning and Brown 2006 ; however, for research that shows that family structure is not associated with children's food insecurity after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, see Miller et al. \u00bd2014\u00de, parenting difficulties \u00f0Cook and Frank 2008\u00de, and health impairments \u00f0Whitaker et al. 2006\u00de are all linked to food insecurity, it is likely that these mechanisms, in addition to resultant changes in economic wellbeing, explain any observed relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity.\nAlthough there are good reasons to expect paternal incarceration to increase children's risk of food insecurity, it is equally plausible that any observed differences in food insecurity by paternal incarceration are driven by selection into incarceration rather than by incarceration itself. Children of incarcerated fathers, compared to their counterparts, experience economic and social disadvantages \u00f0e.g., poverty\u00de prior to the incarceration of their fathers, and, in many cases, these disadvantages are intimately linked to incarceration and are not observed in survey data \u00f0e.g., Turney and Wildeman 2013\u00de. Indeed, unobserved heterogeneity is considered a crucial threat to causal inference when studying the intergenerational consequences of paternal incarceration \u00f0Giordano 2010; Wakefield and Uggen 2010\u00de. Furthermore, it is also possible that increased receipt of food stamps among families with incarcerated fathers \u00f0Chung 2012; Sugie 2012\u00de partially offsets income loss resulting from the incarceration \u00f0Kreider et al. 2012\u00de."}, {"section_title": "considering variation by father's residential status", "text": "It is likely that the relationship between incarceration and children's food insecurity varies by fathers' residential status prior to their incarceration. Previous research suggests that there are vast differences in fathers' economic, emotional, and instrumental contributions by their residential status prior to incarceration \u00f0Turney and Wildeman 2013\u00de. Therefore, as residential fathers, on average, contribute more to family life than nonresidential fathers, it is likely that the consequences of incarceration for children's food insecurity are strongest among children with residential fathers \u00f0for a qualitative examination of heterogeneity in the consequences of paternal incarceration, see Turanovic, Rodriguez, and Pratt \u00bd2012\u00de."}, {"section_title": "contributions of this study", "text": "Although research on the collateral consequences of paternal incarceration for child well-being has burgeoned in recent years, little research considers the consequences of paternal incarceration for children's food insecurity. There are two especially relevant papers. In the first, the only research on this topic to examine children's food insecurity, Sally Wallace and Robynn Cox \u00f02012\u00de use data from the FFCWB and find no statistically significant relationship between parental incarceration and children's food insecurity \u00f0although they do find that parental incarceration increases food insecurity among adults and households with children\u00de. In the second paper, Cox and Wallace \u00f0forthcoming\u00de find that parental incarceration increases the risk of food insecurity among households with children by about 4 percentage points \u00f0but they do not specifically examine children's food insecurity\u00de.\nI extend this existing research in three ways. First, I consider paternal incarceration instead of parental incarceration. I focus on paternal incarceration because the cumulative risk of paternal imprisonment is much greater than the risk of maternal imprisonment \u00f0Wildeman 2009\u00de and because recent research suggests that maternal incarceration may not be causally related to children's well-being \u00f0Wildeman and Turney 2014\u00de. Second, I extend this research by examining variation in the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity by fathers' preincarceration residential status. Third, I extend this research by considering the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The resulting analysis provides a nuanced accounting of the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity. data, measures, and analytic strategy data source: fragile families and child well -being study I use a series of propensity score matching models, which match treatment \u00f0children with fathers incarcerated between the 3-and 5-year surveys\u00de and control \u00f0children with fathers not incarcerated between the 3-and 5-year surveys\u00de observations, to estimate the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity. Data come from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study \u00f0FFCWB\u00de, a longitudinal survey of nearly 5,000 new and mostly unmarried parents who gave birth in urban areas between 1998 and 2000 \u00f0Reichman et al. 2001\u00de. Mothers and fathers were first interviewed in person at the hospital or as soon as possible after the focal child's birth. Both parents were reinterviewed by telephone when the focal child was about 1, 3, 5, and 9 years old. Additionally, when children were 3, 5, and 9 years old, a subsample of families participated in an in-home interview, which included a questionnaire for caregivers \u00f0usually the children's mothers\u00de and an activity booklet for the children. The FFCWB response rates are comparable to or higher than response rates of other householdbased surveys, such as the National Survey of Family Growth \u00f0NSFG; Sassler and McNally 2003\u00de. 1 The FFCWB data have several advantages in examining the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity. First, unlike other data sources commonly used to study the prevalence and correlates of children's food insecurity \u00f0e.g., the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort \u00bdECLS-B, the Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyKindergarten Cohort \u00bdECLS-K, and the Study of Income and Program Participation \u00bdSIPP\u00de, the FFCWB both collects information on paternal incarceration and targets a sample of relatively disadvantaged households that includes a large number of fathers who experienced incarceration. Additionally, these data include a wealth of information about mothers, fathers, and children, making it possible to adjust for preexisting differences between families that did and did not experienced paternal incarceration and to consider mechanisms underlying the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity."}, {"section_title": "analytic sample", "text": "The Core Food Security Module \u00f0CFSM\u00de, the food security module established by the USDA, was included in the 3-and 5-year in-home surveys of the FFCWB and, accordingly, my analyses primarily draw on data through the 5-year survey. My analytic sample is composed of the 3,004 families who participated in the 5-year in-home survey.

To consider how much of the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity is explained by each set of mechanisms, I compare the coefficient of paternal incarceration in model 1 to the coefficients in models 2-6. I also test for statistically significant differences across models. 7 sample description Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all variables, by father's residential status at the 3-year survey. Food insecurity was more common among children with nonresidential fathers. About 6.7 percent of children with residential fathers, and 9.4 percent of children with nonresidential fathers 7. There are problems inherent in comparing across logistic regression models \u00f0Mood 2010\u00de; however, these results are similar when instead using linear probability models. 198 experienced food insecurity at the 5-year survey \u00f0p < .01; see Miller et al.\n\u00bd2014 to see how the prevalence of children's food insecurity in the FFCWB compares to the prevalence in other samples\u00de. Additionally, there are sharp differences in incarceration by fathers' residential status; about 8.7 percent of residential fathers and 26.7 percent of nonresidential fathers were recently incarcerated \u00f0 p < .001\u00de. Families with residential fathers differed from families with nonresidential fathers across nearly all demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics considered. Mothers in residential father families, compared to their counterparts in nonresidential father families, were more likely to be non-Hispanic white \u00f029.9 percent compared to 12.4 percent, p < .001\u00de, were less likely to be non-Hispanic black \u00f036.1 percent compared to 66.2 percent, p < .001\u00de, and were more likely to be Hispanic \u00f030.0 percent compared to 19.9 percent, p < .001\u00de. Mothers in residential-father families were more likely to be foreign-born \u00f0about 19.8 percent compared to about 6.4 percent, p < .001\u00de, were older at baseline \u00f026.4 years compared to 23.8 years, p < .001\u00de, and were more likely to have lived with both biological parents at age 15 \u00f051.6 percent compared to 31.9 percent, p < .001\u00de.\nAdditionally, at the 3-year survey, mothers in residential-father families had higher socioeconomic status than their counterparts in nonresidential father families. These mothers had higher educational attainment \u00f052.4 percent had some postsecondary education compared to 40.1 percent, p < .001\u00de, Note.-Survey symbols: b 5 measured at the baseline survey; y1 5 measured at the 1-year telephone survey; y3 5 measured at the 3-year telephone survey; y5 5 measured at the 5-year telephone survey; ih3 5 measured at the 3-year in-home survey; ih5 5 measured at the 5-year in-home survey.

They also had lower levels of material hardship \u00f01.4 compared to 2.0, p < .001\u00de. Mothers in residential-father families also had more favorable health outcomes than their counterparts, and they were less likely to report fair or poor health \u00f010.7 percent compared to 16.1 percent, p < .001\u00de, depression \u00f016.1 percent compared to 25.2 percent, p < .001\u00de, and substance abuse \u00f08.7 percent compared to 10.7 percent, p < .001\u00de. Finally, there are important differences between residential and nonresidential fathers. Fathers living with their children were less likely to have engaged in domestic violence toward the mother \u00f01.9 percent compared to 14.7 percent, p < .001\u00de, were less likely to report substance abuse \u00f09.7 percent compared to 25.9 percent, p < .001\u00de, and were less likely to have experienced incarceration prior to the 3-year survey \u00f026.6 percent compared to 57.0 percent, p < .001\u00de. These fathers had fewer impulsive behaviors \u00f01.9 compared to 2.1, p < .05\u00de. Taken together, the descriptive statistics show that these two groups of children-children with residential fathers and children with nonresidential fathers-grew up in vastly different environments. results paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity Table 3 presents results from the propensity score matching models. The analyses in panel A are restricted to children who were living with their fathers at the 3-year survey. The unmatched models, which are essentially the unadjusted association between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity, show that children of incarcerated fathers were about three times as likely as their counterparts to experience food insecurity. Recent paternal incarceration is associated with a greater likelihood of children's food insecurity \u00f0b 5 1.055, OR 5 2.87, p < .001\u00de. Paternal incarceration continues to be associated with children's food insecurity in the matched model \u00f0b 5 0.894, OR 5 2.44, p < .05\u00de. This relationship persists in the most rigorous specification, the doubly robust matching model, which is expected given the success of matching \u00f0b 5 0.896, OR 5 2.45, p < .05\u00de. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that, when fathers are living with their children prior to incarceration, paternal incarceration increases the likelihood children experience food insecurity at age 5.\nThe analyses in panel B are restricted to children who were not living with their fathers at the 3-year survey. The unmatched models show that paternal incarceration is not significantly associated with children's food insecurity \u00f0b 5 .090, OR 5 1.09, NS\u00de. This pattern persists in the matched models \u00f0b 5 2.057, OR 5 0.94, NS\u00de and in the doubly robust matched models \u00f0b 5 20.137, OR 5 0.87, NS\u00de. Therefore, when fathers were not living with children prior to incarceration, there is no statistically significant relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity.

In supplemental analyses, I pooled children with residential and nonresidential fathers and used propensity score matching models to estimate the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity.

I address this concern by implementing Mantel-Haenszel bounds, a statistical procedure that quantifies the degree to which an omitted variable may render the results statistically insignificant \u00f0Mantel and 9. It is possible that paternal incarceration may make it more likely for children to experience an onset of food insecurity and less likely to experience an exit from food insecurity. Although the 2-year gap between reports of food insecurity \u00f0measured in these data at the 3-and 5-year surveys\u00de makes it difficult to fully understand the dynamics of paternal incarceration and food insecurity, as children's food insecurity is highly transient \u00f0Li, Mills, et al. 2014\u00de, supplemental analyses estimate two additional dependent variables: \u00f0i\u00de children's food insecurity onset, a dummy variable indicating no food insecurity at the 3-year survey and food insecurity at the 5-year survey, and \u00f0ii\u00de children's food insecurity exit, a dummy variable indicating food insecurity at the 3-year survey and no food insecurity at the 5-year survey. Among children with residential fathers, about 4.6 percent experienced an onset of food insecurity between the 3-year and 5-year surveys and about 4.2 percent experienced an exit from food insecurity between the 3-year and 5-year surveys \u00f0compared to 6.6 percent and 7.0 percent of children with nonresidential fathers\u00de. Results from the most rigorous model, the doubly robust model, provide evidence that, among children with residential fathers, paternal incarceration is associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing an onset of food insecurity \u00f0b 5 1.048, OR 5 2.85, p < .05\u00de and a lower likelihood of experiencing an exit from food insecurity \u00f0b 5 2.850, OR 5 .43, p < .05\u00de.

However, given that these findings are almost certainly missing the full dynamics of children's food insecurity, they should be interpreted cautiously.\nHaenszel 1959; Becker and Caliendo 2007\u00de. This is a nonparametric test that compares the observed number of observations that experienced paternal incarceration that also experienced the dependent variable with the expected number if the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity is zero. I present results from the Q-statistic, which estimates negative unobserved selection, in app. table A3. These results show that an omitted variable would not render the results statistically insignificant until G 5 1.65.\n10 Compare this to the correlates of paternal incarceration from app. table A1, which shows that very few characteristics would increase the likelihood of paternal incarceration by 165 percent. Therefore, it is unlikely that the analyses omit a variable, which is not correlated with the other control variables included in the model, that would render the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity statistically insignificant.\nSecond, I conduct falsification tests,which consider both unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality \u00f0e.g., fathers living in households with food insecurity might engage in criminal behavior to help their family get more resources and therefore may be more likely to experience incarceration\u00de. I use propensity score matching to estimate children's food insecurity \u00f0mea-sured at the 3-year survey\u00de as a function of future paternal incarceration \u00f0measured between the 3-and 5-year surveys, as in the main analyses\u00de and all control variables.

These analyses \u00f0not presented but available upon request\u00de show no statistically significant relationship between future paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity \u00f0b 5 0.129, p 5 .537\u00de, suggesting that unobserved characteristics are unlikely to be a threat to causal inference and that reverse causality is unlikely to be operating."}, {"section_title": "mechanisms linking paternal incarceration to children's food insecurity", "text": "The next set of analyses considers the mechanisms underlying the relationship between recent paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity 10. Because it is not possible to estimate Mantel-Haenszel bounds for the doubly robust matching models, these estimates are based on the matched models.\nPaternal Incarceration and Children's Food Insecurity | 353 among families with residential fathers. I first estimate each of the mechanisms as a function of paternal incarceration. These results \u00f0not presented\u00de show that paternal incarceration is associated with indicators of economic well-being \u00f0poverty and material hardship at the 5-year survey\u00de and parental relationship characteristics \u00f0coresidential status and relationship quality at the 5-year survey\u00de but not indicators of maternal parenting or maternal health. This suggests that the indicators of maternal parenting and maternal health considered here are not mechanisms linking recent paternal incarceration to children's food insecurity.\nIn table 4 , logistic regression models estimate children's food insecurity as a function of recent paternal incarceration, the propensity for experiencing recent paternal incarceration, and the mechanisms. Model 1 estimates the baseline association. In model 2, which adjusts for economic well-being \u00f0measured as poverty, material hardship, and employment at the 5-year survey\u00de, the paternal incarceration coefficient increases by 3 percent. In model 3, which adjusts for parental relationship characteristics \u00f0measured as coresidential status and relationship quality at the 5-year survey\u00de, the paternal incarceration coefficient decreases by 18 percent \u00f0and to statistical insignificance\u00de. In models 4 and 5, which adjust for maternal parenting \u00f0measured as engagement, parenting stress, and neglect at the 5-year survey\u00de and maternal health \u00f0measured as fair/poor health, depression, and substance abuse at the 5-year survey\u00de, the paternal incarceration coefficient decreases by 14 percent and 12 percent, respectively. However, across models 2-6, the paternal incarceration coefficient is not statistically different from the coefficient in model 1. Further, with the exception of material hardship and neglect, the mediators are not independently associated with children's food insecurity. Taken together, these results provide little evidence that the mediators considered link paternal incarceration to children's food insecurity. discussion Food insecurity among children, even more so than food insecurity among adults, is an especially acute and severe form of deprivation that is distinct from other indicators of economic deprivation or hardship \u00f0McIntyre et al. 2003\u00de. Despite existing government programs specifically designed to curb hunger, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u00f0SNAP\u00de, the National School Lunch Program \u00f0NSLP\u00de, and Women, Infants, and Children \u00f0WIC\u00de, rates of children's food insecurity in the United States have increased over the past decade \u00f0Gundersen and Ziliak 2014\u00de. Some have suggested that one reason children's food insecurity remains an intractable social problem is because the correlates of children's food insecurity, above and beyond poverty, are not well understood \u00f0Gundersen and Ziliak 2014\u00de.\nTheoretically, there are many reasons to expect that paternal incarceration, an acute familial stressor that is disproportionately experienced by poor and minority children, would have deleterious consequences for children's food insecurity. There are likely both economic and noneconomic pathways linking paternal incarceration to children's food insecurity. With respect to economic pathways, it is well known that incarceration reduces employment and wages \u00f0e.g., Western 2006\u00de, and recent research suggests that incarceration increases material hardship among current and former romantic partners of the incarcerated \u00f0Schwartz-Soicher, Geller, and Garfinkel 2011\u00de. In turn, economic instability is a known correlate of children's food insecurity \u00f0Gundersen and Ziliak 2014\u00de. With respect to noneconomic pathways, it is likely that additional disruptions resulting from paternal incarceration, such as the destabilizing of romantic relationships \u00f0e.g., Western 2006\u00de, impaired parenting behaviors \u00f0e.g., Turney 2014a\u00de, and increased mental health problems \u00f0e.g., Wildeman et al. 2012\u00de , make it more difficult for mothers and other caregivers to provide adequate food for their children \u00f0Bartfeld and Dunifon 2006\u00de.\nChildren with residential fathers and children with nonresidential fathers are two distinct groups, and, theoretically, paternal incarceration may be more consequential for children who are living with their fathers immediately prior to their incarceration \u00f0Turney and Wildeman 2013\u00de. Indeed, the results of the current study, using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study and estimated through a series of propensity score matching models, suggest that recent paternal incarceration is associated with an increased risk of children's food insecurity but only among children who were living with their biological fathers prior to their incarceration. The combination of negative associations \u00f0for children with residential fathers, where one would most expect to find negative associations\u00de and null associations \u00f0for children with nonresidential fathers, where one may or may not expect to find negative associations\u00de lends face validity to the results. These divergent findings between children with residential fathers Although there is no independent relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity among children of nonresidential fathers, it is precisely this group of children that suffers from the highest rates of food insecurity. The rates of food insecurity are nearly 50 percent higher among children with nonresidential fathers \u00f0with 9.4 percent of children with nonresidential fathers and 6.7 percent of children with residential fathers experiencing food insecurity at the 5-year survey\u00de. Children with nonresidential fathers are about three times as likely as children with residential fathers to experience recent paternal incarceration \u00f026.7 percent compared to 8.7 percent\u00de. Furthermore, children of nonresidential fathers are disadvantaged across an array of demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral indicators. Therefore, although there is no independent relationship between paternal incarceration and food insecurity among this group of children, these children likely suffer other deleterious consequences of paternal incarceration and, more generally, are an especially vulnerable group.\nIndeed, more broadly, the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity is consistent with prior research documenting the mostly negative intergenerational consequences of paternal incarceration. Children of incarcerated fathers, compared to their counterparts, experience educational \u00f0e.g., Haskins 2014; Turney and Haskins 2014\u00de, behavioral \u00f0e.g., Geller et al. 2012; Wakefield and Wildeman 2013\u00de , and health impairments \u00f0e.g., Roettger and Boardman 2012; Foster and Hagan 2013; Turney 2014b\u00de . These analyses show that young children with incarcerated fathers are disadvantaged across another important and distinct dimension: access to nutritionally sound and adequate food. Children's food insecurity signifies an extreme level of disadvantage and, given the relationship between children's food insecurity and children's educational, behavioral, and health outcomes \u00f0e.g., Alaimo et al. 2001; Dunifon and Kowaleski-Jones 2003; Ashiabi 2005; Howard 2011\u00de , it is quite possible that children's food insecurity explains some of the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's educational, behavioral, and health outcomes.\nDespite expectations that both economic and noneconomic pathways would explain the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity, the results provide little evidence that this was the case. Post-incarceration changes in economic well-being, parental relation-ships, maternal parenting, and maternal health explain some, but not all and not a statistically significant amount, of the association between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity. This is inconsistent with expectations. One possible explanation is that the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity is direct; the direct removal of fathers from households makes it difficult for mothers or other caregivers to monitor and provide food to children. Another possible explanation is that the indicators of economic well-being, parental relationships, maternal parenting, and maternal health are not measured properly and that different measures of these constructs would yield substantively different results. For example, the measure of poverty may not be nuanced enough to capture changes in economic well-being following paternal incarceration, especially given that so many families were living in poverty prior to the father's incarceration.\n11 A final possible explanation is that additional mechanisms exist. Two especially plausible possibilities include residential mobility \u00f0and changes in neighborhood composition resulting from mobility\u00de and a decrease in social support \u00f0Turney, Schnittker, and Wildeman 2012\u00de. Future research should adjudicate between these and other explanations. Moreover, although these mechanisms may not significantly mediate the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity, some of the mechanisms may be distinct outcomes associated with paternal incarceration. Material hardship is one such example \u00f0e.g., SchwartzSoicher et al. 2011\u00de. Material hardship does not significantly mediate the association between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity, but the results of this analysis show it is correlated with both paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity.\nlimitations These analyses should be interpreted cautiously, as several limitations, many of them common to studying either paternal incarceration or children's food insecurity, exist. First, the relatively small number of children who experience both incarceration and food insecurity, especially within the residential father subsample, precludes some additional analyses that might be instructive. For example, it is not possible to consider sources of heterogeneity 11. Although supplemental analyses that instead consider a more nuanced measure of poverty-income-to-poverty ratio-come to substantively similar conclusions.\nPaternal Incarceration and Children's Food Insecurity | 359 among children with residential fathers \u00f0e.g., variation by poverty status, variation by SNAP receipt\u00de, despite the fact that these analyses may yield useful findings. Similarly, too few mothers experience incarceration between the 3-and 5-year surveys, making it impossible to consider the independent relationship between maternal incarceration and children's food insecurity. Very low food security among children, an even more severe marker of disadvantage, is extremely rare in the sample, making it impossible to precisely estimate the relationship between paternal incarceration and very low food security among children. Given these data limitations, researchers collecting information on children's food insecurity should also consider collecting information on parental incarceration, and vice versa.\nAnother limitation involves unobserved heterogeneity. It is possible that there are unmeasured characteristics that might render the relationship between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity spurious. For example, the data do not include indicators of criminal activity \u00f0though measures of domestic violence and characteristics correlated with criminal activity \u00bde.g., prior incarceration, substance abuse are included in the estimate of the propensity score\u00de, and it is possible that children of fathers engaging in criminal activity are likely to experience both paternal incarceration and food insecurity. Although I cannot rule out the possibility of a spurious relationship, several aspects of the analyses, including results from the Mantel-Haenszel bounds and the placebo regression, suggest that unobserved heterogeneity may not bias the results. The concentration of statistically significant relationships among children with residential fathers further strengthens the case for causal inference because it is among this group \u00f0compared to the group with nonresidential fathers\u00de that one would most expect to see negative associations. Future research should exploit exogenous variation-perhaps in sentencing decisions, which is not possible with these data-to more explicitly consider causal relationships.\nFinally, as with all broadly representative data that ascertain information about paternal incarceration, the measure of paternal incarceration is quite crude. For example, it is not possible to distinguish between prison and jail spells, even though it is plausible to assume that prison incarceration and jail incarceration differentially influence family life \u00f0because prison spells are usually longer than jail spells and because prisons, compared to jails, are often located farther from inmates' homes\u00de. Relatedly, although the data include some information about incarceration duration and incarceration offense type, the large amount of missing data on these measures makes it impossible to consider their potential contributions to children's food insecurity among the relatively small subsamples of residential and nonresidential fathers."}, {"section_title": "policy implications and conclusions", "text": "Taken together, these findings suggest that the consequences of paternal incarceration extend beyond the offender and spill over to children of offenders, consistent with a growing body of literature documenting the cascading consequences of incarceration for family life \u00f0e.g., Turney and Wildeman 2013; Turney 2014a\u00de . These findings have a number of implications for policy. Given the link between paternal incarceration and children's food insecurity, these findings suggest that families that experience paternal incarceration, especially those families that include residential fathers prior to incarceration, could benefit from being monitored for food insecurity. The findings also suggest, however, that children of nonresident fathers are an especially vulnerable population. These children are at heightened risk of food insecurity regardless of whether they experience paternal incarceration. The findings of this study thus suggest that, if we are to end hunger among children, policy makers would be wise to develop strategies that mitigate the collateral consequences of paternal incarceration for children's well-being and ensure that vulnerable children-those in households with incarcerated fathers and those in households with nonresident fathershave access to sufficient food.
