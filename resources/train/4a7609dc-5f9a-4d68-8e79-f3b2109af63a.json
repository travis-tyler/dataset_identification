[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Functionally related brain regions are selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. However, molecular markers of this pathophysiology (i.e., beta-amyloid and tau aggregates) have discrepant spatial and temporal patterns of progression within these selectively vulnerable brain regions. Existing reductionist pathophysiologic models cannot account for these largescale spatiotemporal inconsistencies. Within the framework of the recently proposed cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease, however, these large-scale patterns are to be expected. This model postulates the following: 1) a tau-associated, circumscribed network disruption occurs in brain regions specific to a given phenotype in clinically normal individuals; 2) this disruption can trigger phenotype independent, stereotypic, and amyloid-associated compensatory brain network changes indexed by M A N U S C R I P T\n2 changes in the default mode network; 3) amyloid deposition marks a saturation of functional compensation and portends an acceleration of the inciting phenotype specific, and tau-associated, network failure. With the advent of in vivo molecular imaging of tau pathology, combined with amyloid and functional network imaging, it is now possible to investigate the relationship between functional brain networks, tau, and amyloid across the disease spectrum within these selectively vulnerable brain regions.\nIn a large cohort (n = 218) spanning the Alzheimer's disease spectrum from young, amyloid negative, cognitively normal subjects to Alzheimer's disease dementia, we found several distinct spatial patterns of tau deposition, including 'Braak-like' and 'non-Braak-like', across functionally related brain regions.\nRather than arising focally and spreading sequentially, elevated tau signal seems to occur system-wide based on inferences made from multiple cross-sectional analyses we conducted looking at regional patterns of tau signal. Younger age-of-disease-onset was associated with 'non-Braak-like' patterns of tau, suggesting an association with atypical clinical phenotypes. As predicted by the cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease, we found that amyloid is a partial mediator of the relationship between functional network failure and tau deposition in functionally connected brain regions. This study implicates large-scale brain networks in the pathophysiology of tau deposition and offers support to models incorporating large-scale network physiology into disease models linking tau and amyloid, such as the cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"section_title": "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n11 entorhinal, inferior temporal, and dorsal precuneus) and modeled those values against global A\u03b2-PET.\nRegions with a higher frequency of abnormal \u03c4-PET signal might be expected to show signal elevation sooner (i.e., at lower A\u03b2-PET SUVR levels) than lower frequency brain regions, which would manifest as a steeper slope in the cross-sectional analyses of \u03c4-PET vs. A\u03b2-PET.

The cognitive domains supported by these networks, which decline as a function of targeted Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, include memory, visual-spatial, sensorimotor, language, behavioral, and executive faculties . The extent to which these cognitive functions are impaired in any individual varies greatly and is dependent on disease duration. The prototypical late-life onset phenotype, referred to as typical Alzheimer's disease dementia, begins with a memory-encoding deficit, before slowly involving other cognitive faculties in a heterogeneous fashion (Petersen, 2003) . Atypical clinical variants begin with predominant non-memory clinical symptoms before involving other cognitive functions and commonly have a younger age of disease onset (Warren et al. , 2012) .\nThe molecular hallmarks of this process include beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), composed of the tau protein. The NFT burden is more closely associated with cognitive decline than A\u03b2 plaques (Bennett et al. , 2004 , Braak et al. , 1996 , Dickson et al. , 1992 , Duyckaerts et al. , 1997 . Therefore, the pattern of tau protein deposition should resemble brain networks that support the cognitive functions that decline in Alzheimer's disease dementia (i.e., memory, visual-spatial, sensorimotor, language, behavioral, and executive systems) (Alladi et al. , 2007 , Mesulam et al. , 2014 , Murray et al. , 2011 . Prior to this tau-associated cognitive decline, there is a long preclinical disease phase associated with A\u03b2 plaques in the absence of significant tau pathology outside of the medial temporal lobe (Bateman et al. , 2012 , Braak et al. , 1996 , Dickson et al. , 1992 . It remains unclear how these molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology are mechanistically related across the spectrum of clinical and preclinical disease states. We have previously proposed a cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, which incorporates systems-level pathophysiology into existing molecular disease models . This model hypothesizes that synaptic remodeling/burden, associated with compensatory shifts in large-scale network configurations, is related M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "4 to amyloidosis in hubs of high connectivity during the preclinical disease phase and tau pathology within specific networks during clinical disease stages. In other words, the model predicts that large-scale network changes would be related to both A\u03b2 and tau. More specifically, it predicts that the relationship between network changes and tau would be partially mediated by pathophysiologic changes marked by A\u03b2 deposition. (NFQ) , see (Wiepert et al., 2017) \n\n\n\nconnectivity, leads to network-wide changes in signal processing that have a large impact on APP processing and the likelihood of observing A\u03b2 pathology in hubs of high connectivity.\nIt may be the case that local, within-network tau-associated disruptions trigger large-scale brain wide compensatory rearrangements which have been associated with amyloidosis in previous studies . The observed plateauing of amyloidosis in this and other studies may mark a saturation of brain-wide compensatory changes for the original local network failure -with this original network containing only a subset of hubs. With an exhausted compensatory reserve, wide spread taurelated neurodegeneration proceeds within the inciting local network (Figure 1 ). This scenario, predicted by our model of a cascading network failure, would result in the characteristic spatiotemporal gaps observed for A\u03b2 and tau. The observation that the relationship between network failure and \u03c4-PET is partially, but not fully, mediate by A\u03b2-PET lends support to this model of network failure being causally related both to A\u03b2 and tau (Figure 1 and 7) . Our exploratory analyses supported the conclusion that there are two distinct patterns of posterior DMN connectivity associated with distinct tau-PET patterns as our model would predict ( Figure 7D and 7E), with one pattern relating to A\u03b2 ( Figure 7B ) and the other to NFQ ( Figure 7C ). Whilst alternate but currently unknown mechanisms may lead to the acceleration of molecular tau pathology by A\u03b2 pathology, it seems likely that any such mechanism will need to include distributed brain network changes in order to incorporate all of the existing knowledge of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.\n34 limitation of \u03c4-PET is the off target binding to substrates unrelated to Alzheimer's disease tau pathology.\nHowever, our ICA-based analysis was able to isolate off-target signal (e.g., form the choroid plexus) and separate that from on-target signal in Braak staging regions. While it is still unclear what the pathologic correlates of age-associated marginally elevated levels of \u03c4-PET signal in clinically normal subjects are, they do appear to be associated with worse cognition . Studies correlating in vivo \u03c4-PET with histopathology in preclinical Alzheimer's disease are needed to better understand this phenomenon."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1: Cascading Network Failure, Amyloid, and Tau", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "This figure is a schematic of the hypothetical model relating large-scale brain networks, beta-amyloid, and tau across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum and serves as an outline of the current study. 1) A brain surface rendering with 5 key regions of spatially independent tau deposition patterns (see Figures 2 and 3).

The model that is under investigation in this study is outlined in Figure 1 . In the first part of our study, we used independent component analysis applied to [F-18] -AV-1451, a positron emission tomography ligand that was designed to detect Alzheimer's disease-related tau pathology (\u03c4-PET) (Schwarz et al. , 2016 , Xia et al. , 2013 , to investigate distinct spatially independent patterns of tau deposition. This allowed us to isolate and quantify a typical, or 'Braak-like' (Braak et al. , 2006 , Braak and Braak, 1991 , Braak and Braak, 1997 , Braak et al. , 2011 , tau-deposition pattern that contains all of the brain regions needed for pathologic staging of NFT. In contrast to most autopsy studies, where tau deposition across the entire brain is not quantified in large numbers of subjects, we were able to investigate the emergence of this pattern across the entire brain and in doing so assess for cross-sectional evidence of system-wide tau deposition rather than sequential progression. In the second part of this study, we used data from \u03c4-PET and A\u03b2-PET as measures of molecular changes and related this to functional network changes using task-free functional MRI (fMRI). The combined results of these analyses strongly implicate large-scale brain systems in the pathophysiology related to tau protein deposition and in the pathophysiology linking A\u03b2 and tau, providing support for the model outlined in Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Methods:", "text": "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6"}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "All participants were enrolled in either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Mayo Clinic Rochester Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

These images were then entered into a spatial ICA using the infomax method implemented in Group ICA Toolbox (http://mialab.mrn.org/software/#gica), with the dimensionality of 33 being determined using minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Rerunning the ICA procedure with bootstrap sampling repeated 100 times revealed highly-stable components. We also repeated this analysis at a higher dimensionality (i.e. 70). The high-dimensional ICA produced less stable components, but our main component of interest (discussed in detail in the results section) was nearly identical at the higher-dimensional ICA level (data not shown). Therefore we report the results of the ICA analysis performed at the dimensionality determined by the MDL criteria (i.e., 33). The preprocessed \u03c4-PET scans for all subjects (n = 218) were included in the ICA to identify group-level, voxel-wise, spatially independent patterns of \u03c4-PET signal and subject-level loadings, or subject component scores, for each pattern. Five of the 33 independent components (ICs) were related to the relevant Alzheimer's disease neurobiology in that they showed a strong A\u03b2-PET relationship (i.e., significantly higher component scores in subjects with A\u03b2-PET SUVR > 1.5 than subjects with SUVR < 1.5, Bonferroni corrected P < 0.001). The remaining components were related to non-specific signal or brain structure (e.g., ventricles, white matter, etc.). Key regions of off-target binding (Lowe et al. , 2016) , which typically confound ROIbased assessment, separated into distinct ICs with no association to A\u03b2-PET. For example, signal in the choroid plexus IC was not related to A\u03b2-PET or cortical thickness (P = 0.13) but was related to advancing age (\u03b2 = 0.21, P = 0.002) (see Supplementary Figure 1 ).

All of these ICs will be made available via individual requests sent to the corresponding author and the peak coordinates are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 presentations (Whitwell et al. , 2015) , but this will require a dedicated analysis beyond the scope of the current investigation.\nWe observed that the regions captured by IC-5 included all of the regions that are commonly sampled in pathologic studies of Braak NFT staging (see Supplemental Figure 2 ). We found this to be a striking data driven way of defining these regions, with the weighting (i.e., subject component score) of Braak NFT Regions) . Further, we quantitatively verified that the expected Braak-gradient was indeed present by using pre-defined \"Braak ROIs\" as previously described . These Braak ROIs collapse the Braak NFT stages into three regions with the expected Braakgradient being BR I/II > BR III/IV > BR V/VI. We calculated the median z-score in each Braak ROI for each of the 5 spatial ICA maps. We found that only IC-5 followed the expected Braak-gradient and that this was most evident after adjusting by biological SNR (Supplementary Figure 5) . We therefore refer to IC-5 as the typical, or 'Braak-like,' tau pattern because all off the brain regions needed for Braak staging were included in one component and the Braak -gradient is evident in the weighting of that spatial pattern, allowing for a Braak-like stage to be summarized in one number (i.e. the subject component score for IC-5) rather than using three separate numbers for each Braak ROI. This observation may explain why Braak\nROIs do not outperform global measures of \u03c4-PET (Maass et al. , 2017) . The other components do not meet these criteria and are referred to as atypical, or 'non-Braak-like' patterns. This designation was also supported by our analyses of subject component scores versus age of disease onset (see next paragraph). This is because atypical clinical (Warren et al. , 2012) and pathologic phenotypes (Murray et al. , 2011) are associated with younger-age of disease onset.\nWe investigated the association of each of these \u03c4-PET patterns with age of disease onset in 32 of the impaired subjects for whom this information was known (Figure 2 inset plots). The four atypical tau deposition patterns were more common in subjects with a younger age of onset, but this relationship was only significant for IC-3 (P < 0.01) and IC-2 (P = 0.01). The Braak-like pattern of tau deposition was not associated with age of disease onset (P = 0.39). , in the current study we consider a positive (greater than zero) subject component score as indicating elevated tau-PET signal. These correlations persist even after controlling for gray matter density and are linear through the entire cohort free from outlier bias (Supplementary Figure 6) . In a post-hoc voxel-wise analyses controlling for gray matter density at each voxel, these subject component scores were strongly predictive of \u03c4-PET SUVR in a spatially unique way for each IC (Supplementary Figure 7) . These analyses support the conclusion that the originally identified\nICs capture 5 distinct spatial patterns of elevated tau deposition. We also compared our ICA approach to a more traditional reporter ROI SUVR method by correlating the subject component scores for each ROI with the SUVR from an entorhinal cortex ROI. We find a high correlation between our ICA approach and the SUVR based reporter ROI approach with correlations ranging from 0.56 to 0.79. The typical Braaklike pattern (IC-5) had the strongest correlation with the entorhinal cortex reporter ROI, which also supports using IC-5 as the representative \u03c4-PET subject component score. The advantage of using the ICA based method, rather than the reporter ROI SUVR value, is that the ICA method is data driven and incorporates biologically relevant information in the PET images outside the reporter ROI and is not contaminated by atrophy effects or off target binding that separates out into separate independent components of \u03c4-PET signal. The ICA approach also allows for separating out distinct patterns of tau deposition rather than forcing all potential patterns into a signal a priori defined ROI-based schema. There was a large amount of between-subject heterogeneity in the expression of these 5 \u03c4-PET patterns ( Supplementary Figures 8-12 ), including subjects with typical Alzheimer's disease dementia.

Marginally elevated levels of the Braak-like and non-Braaklike patterns were present in a subset of both amyloid positive (dark gray plots in Supplementary Figure   11 ) and amyloid negative subjects (light gray plots in Supplementary Figure 11 , and see Supplementary Figure 12 for a case example)."}, {"section_title": "Elevated \u03c4-PET signal distributed similarly across Braak NFT regions", "text": "The frequency map of voxels with high tau levels largely recapitulated the typical tau pattern (Figure 4) .

The significant effect of brain region on the relationship between \u03c4-PET and A\u03b2-PET (t = -5.64, p < 0.001) remains, but without any difference between the inferior temporal and entorhinal regions (t = 1.57, p = 0.12). The fact that signal differences between the entorhinal and inferior temporal regions disappeared after standardization is compatible with the fact that they were included in the same independent component with a greater weighting in inferior temporal regions ( Figure 2E , and Supplementary Figure 14A) . In other words, our threshold-free ROI-based analyses are well in line with our frequency plot and our original ICA analysis in which all Braak-regions remained in the same IC.\nIntriguingly, once we adjusted the 'Braak-like' IC pattern (Supplementary Figure 14A) by the voxel-wise biological SNR (Supplementary Figure 14B) , the Braak NFT pathologic-staging schema was very closely approximated (Supplementary Figure 14C) . The biological SNR adjusted IC-5 map also had the most evident Braak-gradient (Supplementary Figure 5F ). This demonstrates that \u03c4-PET signal does indeed measure all regions in the Braak NFT schema in a manner that would be predicted by the pathologic literature, but statistical properties and off target signal contamination need to be accounted for in order to observe these changes. A recent ROI-based analysis was not able to demonstrate significant hippocampal signal change given that this approach has more difficulty in dealing with regional variation in disease-related tau-signal increases and contamination with 'off target' binding in adjacent structures.\nThe voxel-wise average \u03c4-PET maps created across the AD spectrum suggest a similar systemwide increase in \u03c4-PET signal, rather than a sequential spread ( Figure 6 ). There was little evidence of elevated average \u03c4-PET signal in subjects with negative loadings (IC score < 0), but component scores in these subjects still displayed age-associated increases (\u03b2 = 0.58, P < 0.001) consistent with recent reports and with existing pathologic literature (Crary et al. , 2014) . Elevated average levels of tau-PET become visually apparent in subjects with positive loadings, and signal was present simultaneously throughout the regions identified by the typical \u03c4-PET pattern. However, between IC score levels of 0.5 -1.0, there was a large increase in the magnitude of the signal throughout the system.

All three measures were associated with age across the disease spectrum and in clinical normal subjects; therefore all models include age as a covariate. Importantly, we recently reported that among clinically normal subjects, \u03c4-PET is not associated with NFQ when age is included in a multivariate model suggesting that age-related factors other than entorhinal cortex tau can drive NFQ prior to amyloid accumulation and cognitive impairment (Wiepert et al. , 2017) .\nNetwork failure was associated both with A\u03b2-PET (\u03b2 = 0.34, P < 0.001) and the typical tau pattern (\u03b2 = 0.31, P < 0.001 and see group comparison in Figure 6 ). Therefore, we performed a mediation analysis to test whether the relationship between network failure and tau was mediated fully, partially, or at all by A\u03b2. As an important prerequisite to performing the mediation analysis, we had previously Figure   7A ). This demonstrated that global A\u03b2 was relatively more associated with medial and lateral temporal tau deposition than the precuneus in a pattern recapitulating IC-5 ( Figure 7B ). This was in contrast to the pattern observed for NFQ, which had a relatively greater association with tau in the precuneus compared to the medial and lateral temporal regions in a pattern recapitulating IC-4 ( Figure 7C ). These results are in line with a recent regional analysis of tau, amyloid, and gray matter ."}, {"section_title": "Posterior DMN connectivity patterns associated with tau-PET are distinct for tau in the temporal lobe versus the precuneus", "text": "This result then lead to our analyses of IC-5 and IC-4 as a predictor for posterior DMN connectivity (see the equation at the bottom of Figure 7 ). This was in-line with the model presented in Figure 1 . IC-5 was associated with hyper-connectivity within the posterior DMN (e.g., the precuneus) and increased connectivity to a variety of other brain regions as would be predicted in step 2 outlined in Figure 1 ( Figure 7D ). IC-4, or the precuneus/posterior DMN specific tau deposition, was associated with declining posterior DMN connectivity in the precuneus and increased frontal lobe connectivity ( Figure   7E ). This explains why the NFQ is associated with the IC-4 pattern of tau deposition, and is consistent with step 3 outlined in Figure 1 . However, none of the results in Figure 7 D and E survived correction for multiple comparisons and should be considered post-hoc and exploratory, but well-grounded in the results leading to this analyses. The cascading network failure model is consistent with these cross-sectional observations, but it is not the only potential interpretation (see more detailed discussion below). This is certainly true regarding hypotheses relating to temporal sequences of events. Longitudinal analyses across the ADspectrum will be required to truly examine temporal predictions made by our model and alternative models.

This is consistent with recent reports of differences in \u03c4-PET uptake between specific clinical phenotypic variants of Alzheimer's disease . Further support for the notion that \u03c4-PET patterns more closely capture network-related variability, which manifests as different clinical phenotypes, comes from the striking correspondence of \u03c4-PET patterns and three resting state networks (ventral visual stream, posterior DMN, and the left working memory network [ Supplementary Figure 4] ). In further support of this association with phenotypic heterogeneity, the left working-memory network is a system thought to underlie the phonologic loop (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974 ), which we have recently shown to be more affected in language presentations of Alzheimer's disease (Whitwell et al. , 2015) . However, as is apparent to clinicians and caregivers, there remains a large amount phenotypic heterogeneity even in so-called 'typical' presentations of Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Figure 8 ). As such, the different patterns of tau deposition identified in our study are relevant to studies of all phenotypic presentations of Alzheimer's disease, as well as all clinical stages, extending across preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia ( Supplementary Figures 8-12 ). In fact, isolating the extent to which these tau deposition patterns are present has great potential to serve as a new phenotypic tool that may be more precise than recapitulating the Braak staging schema using Braak\nROIs . Cognitive domain and phenotype-specific correlations with \u03c4-PET patterns\nwere not the focus of this current study, but future studies into these associations are needed.\nIt was surprising that Braak NFT staging regions were all present within the same \u03c4-PET IC pattern (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figures 2, 5, and 14) . This is an unexpected result because early neocortical regions, as one would expect from a seed-based templating mechanism following the Braak staging gradient. Sequential spreading not fully detected by \u03c4-PET until later stages could also produce these observations, but using Braak-staging ROIs, or any other regional approach, would not confer any particular advantage over global measures in such a case (Maass et al. , 2017) . The lack of utility in using Braak-staging ROIs is also highlighted by the fact that the \u03c4-PET signal in preclinical AD is more widespread than predicted by pathologic staging as was recently shown by others (Mishra et al. , 2017) and also observed in this study (see Figure 6 and Supplementary Figures 11-13 ). Another alternative explanation for the observed widespread signal is that tau-PET is sensitive to abnormalities in vulnerable brain systems even in the absence of NFTs, perhaps manifesting as marginally elevated tau-PET signal.\nAll three of these possibilities would appear as synchronously elevated \u03c4-PET signal rather than recapitulating the sequential involvement that has been inferred from cross-sectional pathologic studies.\nIt is uncertain if there is a neuropathological correlate for the \u03c4-PET signal in these brain regions at early Braak NFT stages, as they are not all routinely sampled as part of the Braak NFT-staging schema and the probability of observing tau in these regions likely varies. It appears that the major difference between these brain regions is the biological SNR ( (Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 13 ). The fact the differences between these regions is largely related to SNR is also consistent with statistical differences observed between these brain regions and their correlation with clinical variables (Maass et al. , 2017) . Even when we separated out subjects by typical Braak-pattern loadings ( Figure 6 and Supplementary Video S1), we did not appreciate a pattern of sequential involvement in these brain regions, but more of a 'blooming' of the \u03c4-PET signal throughout Braak regions with progressive increase in the intensity of the signal. We also observed the presence of these IC patterns (indicating signal throughout the system) in clinical normal subjects without elevated A\u03b2 levels ( Supplementary Figures 11 and 12 ). Longitudinal \u03c4-PET studies spanning the Alzheimer's disease spectrum will be needed to investigate this apparent emergence of \u03c4-PET signal diffusely within functional systems."}, {"section_title": "The relationship between A\u03b2-PET and \u03c4-PET", "text": "The majority of the variability in \u03c4-PET can be explained by A\u03b2-PET, with similar percentages found using generalized additive models (Supplementary Figure 2 , 65.8% of the deviance, p < 0.001) and in the mediation analyses with network failure (67%, 95% CI [45%, 97%]). However, the relationship is non-linear and appears more sigmoidal (Supplementary Figure 3) , consistent with proposed biomarker models , Villemagne et al. , 2013 . The change in A\u03b2-PET plateaus, as has been reported previously ; however, \u03c4-PET continues to increase as the proportion of clinically impaired subjects increases (Figure 6 ), suggesting that \u03c4-PET is a better marker of progression in the clinical disease phase (Brier et al. , 2016) , while A\u03b2-PET is a better marker of preclinical disease stages. Given that \u03c4-PET appears to continue to increase after amyloid saturation, this may drive the partial independent association between NFQ and tau from A\u03b2 ( Figure 7 ). In this context, it is interesting to note that the global A\u03b2 is more associated with the spatial pattern captured in IC-5 (typical Braak pattern, Figure 7B ) and NFQ is more associated with the pattern captured by IC-4, which resembles the posterior DMN (Dice coefficient of similarity = 0.57) centered in the precuneus ( Figure 7C ).

This pattern and the apparent temporal sequence are largely in keeping with the cascading network failure model discussed in more detail below and outlined in Figure 1 .\nIt is still unclear why there is an apparent temporal lag between markers of A\u03b2 increase and markers of tau increase. In addition, A\u03b2 deposition occurs throughout all major hubs of connectivity in the brain (Buckner et al. , 2009) , while tau deposition occurs within specific functional networks ( Figure   2 ) and not in major hubs in general. Existing models have struggled to account for these spatiotemporal gaps between the two major molecular hallmarks of the disease. Invoking pathophysiologic mechanisms that incorporate large-scale brain systems may shed light on this long-standing apparent spatiotemporal paradox between A\u03b2 and tau , Stam, 2014 ."}, {"section_title": "Large-scale brain networks and protein deposits", "text": "There are many open questions regarding the mechanistic link between large-scale brain networks and neurodegenerative diseases, despite the long-known fact that connected systems are important aspects of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Over the years, several monikers have been proposed to capture this relationship, such as systems degenerations (Saper et al. , 1987) , network-based neurodegeneration (Greicius and Kimmel, 2012) , and molecular nexopathies (Warren et al. , 2013) . Seed-based polymerization of various proteins spreading along structural brain connections is currently the most widely accepted hypothesis for the observed associations between neurodegenerative patterns and network properties (Raj et al. , 2012 , Zhou et al. , 2012 . However, questions remain regarding the explanatory ability of these models (Walsh and Selkoe, 2016) , and they have not accounted for the spatiotemporal gap between the two major molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, recent tests of the seed-based polymerization model failed to achieve as strong of evidence for Alzheimer's disease as for other neurodegenerative diseases studied (Zhou et al. , 2012) . The authors speculate that it may be the dual-protein nature of Alzheimer's disease that led to this discrepancy. Therefore, while seed-\nbased polymerization may explain portions of tau pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease, it does not explain A\u03b2 pathophysiology or the stereotypical spatiotemporal gaps between tau and A\u03b2. In addition, \u03c4-PET signal seems to be detectable in multiple brain regions across functional networks simultaneously rather than in a step-wise manner, which is more supportive of selectively vulnerable brain systems being the etiology as opposed to seed-based templating, although, both mechanisms may occur simultaneously (Walsh and Selkoe, 2016) . In this context, it should be noted that functionally connected brain systems, centered in the parietal and posterior cingulate regions, have been found to be abnormal in mouse models of age-related memory impairment, and that this functional stress is alleviated with therapies targeting brain circuits (Haberman et al. , 2017) .\nThe cascading network failure model may be better able to account for these discrepancies by reconciling distributed network level pathophysiology with proposed molecular pathophysiological mechanisms ( Figure 1 ). It is clear that synaptic activity and plasticity are related to the (patho)physiology of A\u03b2 (Palop and Mucke, 2010) , with converging evidence from various perspectives including theoretical (Mesulam, 1999) , molecular (Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014), animal model based (Bero et al. , 2011) , and in vivo microdialysis and electrophysiological studies (Cirrito et al. , 2005) . Three key facts regarding amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing are important to consider in this regard: processing of APP is influenced by (1) synaptic activity (Cirrito et al. , 2005) and plays an influential role in both (2) long-term potentiation, and (3) long-term depression (Palop and Mucke, 2010) . From a signal-processing perspective within a system connected via synapses, these three factors ideally position APP processing to serve a 'gain' function (i.e., adjusting signal-to-noise properties depending on the context of the signals that are being passed along synapses over time). Viewed from this perspective, a natural link becomes apparent between system/network wide signal processing in the brain and APP processing at the synapse.\nThe cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease postulates that largescale compensatory shifts in brain connectivity, which initially appear as increased levels of functional M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature, which has been a limitation in all previous studies of tau spatial patterns across the disease spectrum.
