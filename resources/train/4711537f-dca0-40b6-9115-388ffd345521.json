[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The results of our survey within Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study conducted in 2015 show that only a quarter of Lithuanians reach the highest international achievement level in mathematics. The present study aims to identify links between the physical activity of primary schoolchildren, educational factors influencing it and learning outcomes. The experimental group includes 50 girls and boys aged 6-7 years old, and the control group includes 48 girls and boys the same age. The methodology is based on the DIDSFA model (dynamic exercise, intense motor skills repetition, differentiation, reduction of parking and seating, physical activity distribution in the classroom). Physical activity assessment is carried out with the help of the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire. Academic achievements are gauged according to the distribution of mathematical learning achievements specified by curriculum content. Statistically significant differences are found in the analysis of average MET per boy in the experimental group (1417.59 MET, min/week) in comparison with that of the girls in the same group (1000.38 MET, min/week, p < 0.05). The tasks for phenomena, equations and inequalities in the experimental group reveal 0.92\u00b10.42 for the girls and 0.87\u00b10.45 for the boys. There are no statistically significant differences (p>0.05). The findings of our study attach evidence and details to the assumption that there are associations between physical activity and academic achievement of primary schoolchildren. It is a linear association with physical fitness test and mathematic test scores. No variable have any significant association with gender or academic test outcome."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent investigations have argued that children are one of the most dynamic parts of inhabitants in the population. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child mentions the need to ensure the child's physical, mental and social development on a sustainable basis. It has been found that the child's physical activity (PA) is a multi-component phenomenon. Within the present study, it has been found that on the average 8% of daytime are spent in the physically active environment. It has been established that physical activity increases the flexibility of children's brain and plays a particularly important role in the development of children's cognitive functions (Tomporowski et al., 2008) . One of the important cognitive functions is memory that manipulates information and regulates thinking and behaviour (Diamond, 2013) .\nIt is also one of the indicators of children's learning achievements. The application of physical activity at schools is very important. Primary school can increase the physical activity of children from moderate to intensive; for example, the time of the breaks (Powell et al., 2016) during physical education lessons (McKenzie & Lounsbery, 2014) . Low physical activity and long sitting, for example, during lessons and immobility during breaks result in poorer learning achievements for children (Syv\u00e4oja et al., 2013) . Those children, whose physical activity level increases by the age of 11years old, achieve better learning outcomes at the age of 11, 13 and 16 (Booth et al., 2014) . The results of the research provide evidence that fostering physical activity and active lifestyle can improve boys' reading skills during the first school year (Haapala et al., 2017) . The most important factors for primary school students are physical education and the educational environment at school."}, {"section_title": "Problem Statement", "text": "The development of higher skills is highlighted in the main strategic education documents.
