This grid allows for the placement of the poles over land, thus removing the numerical singularity associated with the convergence of meridians at 20 the geographical North Pole. An additional advantage of the curvilinear grids is that a higher resolution in the region of interest can be reached, while maintaining a global domain. Using the global ocean model alleviates issues related to ocean open boundary conditions and provides an additional \"degree of freedom\" in the model setup and tuning, which can be helpful to adjust the ocean component for the better performance within the region of interest.

For the ROM atmospheric component REMO, three representative variables were chosen: Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP), near-surface temperature (T2m) and precipitation; while for the ocean component 25 MPI-OM: Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and the velocity components of the sub-surface current. These fields are compared to gridded data from different sources to evaluate the ability of ROM model to simulate the present Mediterranean climate. These data sets are derived from observations or reanalysis where appropriate (Table 1) . (Dee et al., 2011); free access data can be found at https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim. Total precipitation was validated against the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; Huffman et al., 2014) dataset, a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to study rainfall for weather and climate research.\nThree datasets were used for the evaluation of the SST: ERA-Interim, EN4 and OISST. For the development of EN4 data set 5\nGood et al., (2013) performed a 1-degree monthly objective analysis from ocean temperature and salinity bathythermograph profiles (MBT, XBT). The version EN4.1.1 used here includes the improvements on the estimation of MBTs and XBTs downward velocity developed by Gouretski and Reseghetti (2010) . On the other side, the NOAA performed an analysis constructed by combining observation from different platforms (satellites, ships, buoys) on a regular global grid 1/4\u00ba x 1/4\u00ba, known as Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST; Reynolds et al., 2007) . Currently, the OISST dataset is 10 considered the best-observed SST dataset available, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution.\nTo validate ROM SSS, we made comparisons with two climatologies: EN4 v.4.1.1 (Good et al., 2013) and MEDSEA_REANALYSIS_PHY_006_009 (Fratianni et al., 2015) implemented by Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). MEDSEA_REANALYSIS_PHY_006_009 is based on the NEMO code, the data assimilation scheme is variational, and all historical in-situ and satellite observations were used. The model is 15 primitive equation in spherical coordinates implemented for the Mediterranean at 1/16\u00ba x 1/16\u00ba horizontal resolution (Fratianni et al., 2015) . ESM (Giorgetta et al., 2013) is composed by ECHAM 6 (Stevens et al., 2013) for atmosphere and MPI-OM (Jungclaus et al. 2013 ) for ocean as well as JSBACH (Reick et al., 2013) for terrestrial biosphere and HAMOCC (Ilyina et al., 2013) for the ocean's biogeochemistry. The coupling of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface is made possible by the OASIS3 (Valcke, 2013) coupler. Depending on the resolution of the ECHAM6 or MPI-OM the MPI-ESM has different configurations (MPI-ESM-LR (low resolution), -MR (medium resolution)); the -LR uses a bipolar grid with 1.5\u00ba resolution, while the -MR 25 version doubles the number of levels in the atmosphere and decreases the horizontal grid spacing of the ocean to 0.4\u00ba (Giorgetta et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In this section, a selection of key fields corresponding to the period 1980-2012 is presented.

Erroneous MSLP gradients lead to an erroneous regional wind circulation, and can also have a strong effect on ocean circulation (Sein et al., 2015) . Figs. 3a and 3b display the biases of modeled MSLP with respect to ERA-Interim for the boreal winter (defined as December, January, and February; DJF) and summer (defined as 5 June, July, and August; JJA) in the 1980-2012 period.\nAccording to Figs. 3a and 3b ROM provides a good agreement with ERA-Interim MSLP, showing maximum deviations smaller than 3 hPa over most of the domain for both seasons. The strongest departures can be found for DJF, due to an overestimation of the Azores high during the winter months. Those differences could be attributed to REMO parameterizations. Nonetheless, these relatively small deviations imply a small change in terms of regional wind circulation. 10\nDuring summer months (Fig. 3b ) MSLP biases are much smaller over the Mediterranean.\nFigs. 3c and 3d show T2m biases for DJF and JJA. For both seasons the departures are typically below 3\u00baC over most of the coupled domain, except for the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Atlas, the Caucasus and the Armenian highlands (Figs. 3c and 3d ).\nThis disagreement can be attributed to differences in the resolution of orographic features. Winter months show the largest T2m biases located close to the Mediterranean coastline, where atmospheric-ocean interactions could play a role. 15\nAt first glance, ROM generally underestimates the simulated cumulative precipitation over most of the Mediterranean region, for both winter and summer seasons. The largest discrepancies for DJF can be located over the Black Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Lyon and the southwest portion of Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 3e) , where negative anomalies can reach 3mm/d. Moreover, it is worth stating that during the same period the total precipitation was overestimated in regions linked to significant topographic reliefs (e.g. the Alps). Some coastal areas also showed positives anomalies that probably are 20 related to the atmosphere-ocean coupling. Nonetheless, these deviations did not exceed 3.5 mm/d allowing us to assume that our regional coupled model reasonably simulates the precipitation along the Mediterranean basin. By contrast, these deviations are minimal in the very dry summer season, although ROM shows a clear tendency to underestimate the precipitation (Fig. 3f )."}, {"section_title": "SST 25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Seasonal cycle", "text": "The differences between ROM and observed SST climatologies for winter (DJF) and summer (JJA) in the 1980-2012 period are presented in Fig. 4 . The SST seasonal cycle is well represented by the model, although its amplitude is reduced over most of the Mediterranean Sea. The deviations in absolute value do not exceed 3\u00baC, although ROM shows a cold bias, which is more significant in the eastern Mediterranean, especially in summer (Fig. 4) . The trend of modeled SST is weaker than references climatologies (Table 2 ) due to the absence of effects introduced by aerosols. Contrasted with the MPI-ESMs, the trend of ROM is closer to -MR than -LR as it is expected due to the horizontal spatial resolution of -MR. Despite these small differences, the interannual variability is well reproduced by ROM simulations 20 during 1980-2012 period. An offset of SST is visible in Fig. 6 , although it keeps constant during all period.\nA Taylor diagram ( Fig. 7 ) was used to quantitatively evaluate ROM performance. ERA-Interim, EN4 and ROM are all well correlated (r>0.7) with the observation-based climatology (OISST). However, MPI-ESM-LR and -MR correlations with OISST are lower. The SST standard deviations of ROM and MPI-ESM-MR (0.27\u00baC for both) are lower than OISST (0.32\u00baC), while ERA-Interim, EN4 and MPI-ESM-LR present closer values (0.34, 0.33 and 0.33\u00baC, respectively). The 25 corresponding root-mean-square-errors (RMSE, red contours) are enclosed by 0.07 and 0.32\u00baC, being ROM close to the climatological uncertainty. In general ROM improves the scores obtained by MPI-ESM simulations, since ROM shows higher correlation and lower RMSE with respect to OISST. western basin and Adriatic Sea and negative bias through the Levantine Sea and north Aegean Sea. It is precisely at northeast Adriatic Sea, by the Po Delta, where the largest positive differences occur (+3 psu), and to the north of the Aegean Sea where largest negative differences (-3 psu) are found. Nevertheless, the deviations do not exceed, in absolute value, 0.5 psu in a large part of the domain (Fig. 8) ."}, {"section_title": "SSS", "text": "Comparison with MPI-ESM-LR and -MR SSS is shown in Fig. 9 . ROM is always saltier over the whole Mediterranean, with 5 decreasing difference towards the southeast. In general, ROM SSS is closer to EN4 and CMEMS climatology than any of the MPI-ESM versions."}, {"section_title": "SSH and circulation", "text": "To conclude with the analysis of the ocean component of ROM, the SSH was analyzed. A first approximation for properly comparing the SSH of the model to the AVISO Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) (SSALTO/DUACS, 2013) is to add only the thermosteric contribution (as a constant resulting from the average over the 20 whole basin) to the dynamic SSH of the model . Fig. 11 shows the yearly mean and the seasonal cycle of ROM SSH compared to altimetric data. The modeled SSH shows lower values than the observed (Fig. 11a) ; however, it represents quite acceptably the behavior of AVISO time series. The amplitude of the mean seasonal cycle is 12 cm for the simulation, and 14.5 cm for AVISO (Fig. 11b) . Thus, the model is able to reproduce a realistic interannual variability and seasonal cycle. 25\nFinally, a mass balance was made to estimate the net transport of water throughout the Strait of Gibraltar and Dardanelles in order to compare the water flux modeled by ROM with the observations. Table 3 gives the water budget of ROM averaged over the 1980-2012 period. The water loss by evaporation (E) is greater than the gain by precipitation (P) and river runoff (R) generating a deficit of 0.034 Sv into the basin. However, this deficit is partially compensated by the net water inflow through the Strait of Gibraltar (0.03 Sv) and the Dardanelles, where the inflow (0.132 Sv) exceeds the outflow (0.109 Sv). 30 ROM water budget is 0.026 Sv lower compared to RCSM4 model, but a significant part of the difference is due to difference in river runoff. (Fig. 12a) . The warmest area is found along the Levantine Sea coastline. The averaged Mediterranean SST is 18.61\u00baC (Fig. 12a) while at the end of the 21 st century under RCP8.5 scenario it is expected to have a mean increase of +2.73\u00baC, warming in a range from a maximum of 3.8\u00baC at the Aegean Sea to a 10 minimum of 0.9\u00baC at the Alboran Sea (Fig. 12b ).\nAs shown in Fig. 12c the Eastern Mediterranean is saltier than western, particularly in the Levantine Sea (39 psu). The Western basin presents lower salinities (< 38. while under the RCP 8.5 projection it will experience a mean increase of 0.17 psu. The differences between the mean SSS projection and present climate shows a dipolar structure through the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 12d) . Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the Western Mediterranean is expected to slightly freshen (from -0.5 to -1 psu), while the Eastern will become saltier. It is precisely at the north of the Aegean Sea where largest SSS increases (+4 psu) are found.\nIn general, MPI-ESM-LR and -MR projections under the RCP8.5 scenario at the end of the 21 st century are warmer than that 20 of ROM over most of the Mediterranean Sea. Namely, the projected mean SST increases are 2.80 and 2.87\u00baC for MPI-ESM-LR and -MR, respectively (Table 4 ). Despite differences in horizontal resolution, MPI-ESM-LR and ROM show a similar spatial distribution of the expected warming (Fig. 13a) , contrary to MPI-ESM-MR where the SST warming is projected to be higher in the western basin and north of Adriatic (Fig. 13b) . Mediterranean Sea shows an increase of its temperature through the entire water column (Figs. 14a and 14c) , which is more evident in surface layers. The warming that initially takes place in the upper ocean propagates gradually to deeper layers along the 21st century. The behavior of the Eastern Mediterranean is similar to that of the western basin, but with warmer temperatures, especially in the surface layers. At the end of the 21 st century the eastern basin is expected to have a surface temperature increase up to 3.8\u00baC (Fig. 14a ) and the western up to 3\u00baC (Fig. 14c) . In deeper layers (1000 m) the water 5 temperature will increase by 0.6\u00baC for both basins, which is a very significant warming at these depths.\nThe mean temporal evolution of salinity anomalies displays different patterns through the Mediterranean Sea. During the 21st century the upper layer (0-100 m) of the Western Mediterranean is projected to freshen (-0.5 psu) while the deeper layers tends to get saltier up to 0.5 psu. However, the Eastern Mediterranean will increase its salinity up to 0.5 psu in the entire water column along the current century. 10"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The ROM model has shown good skills in reproducing the main characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea Compared to other state-of-art regional climate models, ROM introduces a remarkable innovation, which consist in the implementation of a global oceanic model with high horizontal resolution at regional scales. This approach allows to obtain information of the global ocean without losing spatial resolution in the coupling area. An important disadvantage of the proposed model, related previously in Sein et al., (2014) , is that the bias and internal variability generated from the global domain can influence the results in the coupled domain, making it difficult to separate the source of bias. 20\nRAOCMs are capable of improving the simulation of the climate system by the driving model through dynamical downscaling from GCMs (e.g. Li et al., 2012; Sein et al., 2015) . The ROM coupled system driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis can improve the representation of key climatic variables on the regional scale by including physical processes into the MPI-OM, which are not accounted for in the ESMs. These improvements are mainly visible in the ocean model results (Fig. 15) . 25 Figure 15 clearly shows that our ROM model attain overall higher correlations with the observations for SST interannual variability than MPI-ESM simulations. In MPI-ESM-LR, the ocean model is not able to represent the exchange through the Gibraltar and Dardanelles Straits or the behavior of the Adriatic Sea due to the lack of the model resolution (Fig. 15b) . The MPI-ESM-MR (Fig. 15c) improves the lack of MPI-ESM-LR model resolution, although it shows low correlations with observations at those locations. The regionalization implemented in our ROM model provides greater horizontal resolution, 30 allowing the representation of local scale and mesoscale processes that are not detectable by ESMs. The model also demonstrated good skills in reproducing the area-averaged interannual standard deviations of SST for the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 16d) . According to Fig. 16 , ROM coupled system presents yearly SST standard deviations close to the reference OISST dataset. In fact, ROM does not only improve the yearly spatial standard deviations with respect to the MPI-ESMs (Figs. 16e and 16f ) but also regarding to ERA-Interim and EN4 (Fig. 16b and 16c) . The MPI-ESM-LR and -MR are not able to reproduce those local patterns due to the absence of resolution, thus indicating that the dynamical 5 downscaling from MPI-ESM improves the simulation of GCMs.\nThe Mediterranean Sea will be warmer and saltier at the end of 21 st century. The ROM simulations under RCP 8.5 scenario provided integrated estimates of climate change similar to other models (Table 4 ). The mean \u2206SST projected by ROM under RCP 8.5 scenario is 2.73\u00baC while Thorpe and Bigg (2000) using high resolution models under 2XCO2 scenario is estimated a 4\u00baC warming for the SST (Table 4) . Somot et al., (2006) carried out a similar study using high resolution models forced by 10 the SRES scenario A2. The results of their study are similar to those obtained in the present work. Later, Somot et al., (2008) used a RAOCM for the Mediterranean basin, to simulate the SRES A2 scenario during 1960-2099, obtaining a \u2206SST of 2.6\u00baC. In MPI-ESM simulations for RCP 8.5 the SST shows an increase of 2.80\u00baC (-LR) and 2.87\u00baC (-MR). All SST warming estimates are quite coherent with those obtained by Adloff et al., (2015) for different climate scenarios.\nAs shown in Table 4 , the mean \u2206SSS projected by ROM under RCP8.5 is lower than those estimated by other authors 15 (Somot et al., 2006; 2008 , Adloff et al., 2015 . This seems to be related to the fact that the SSS filed in the ROM RCP 8.5 projection shows a dipolar structure in the Mediterranean (Fig. 12d) . The SSS decrease in the western basin could be related to the influence of surface waters from the Northeast Atlantic. As we exposed in section 3.3, the MPI-ESM-LR and -MR models under RCP 8.5 scenario also represent this dipolar pattern and the averaged increment of SSS shown by ROM into the Mediterranean Sea. 20"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, the regional atmosphere-ocean coupled model ROM (Sein et al., 2015) Furthermore, it is very remarkable that the Western Mediterranean surface layer presents a salinity decreasing tendency, opposite to the rest of the Mediterranean.\nFinally, we conclude that the ROM is a powerful model system that can be used to estimate possible impacts of climate 5 change on regional scale.
