[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Multivariate analysis techniques for neuroimaging data have recently received increasing attention as they have many attractive features that cannot be easily realized by the more commonly used univariate, voxel-wise, techniques 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 . Multivariate approaches evaluate correlation/ covariance of activation across brain regions, rather than proceeding on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Thus, their results can be more easily interpreted as a signature of neural networks. Univariate approaches, on the other hand, cannot directly address interregional correlation in the brain. Multivariate approaches can also result in greater statistical power when compared with univariate techniques, which are forced to employ very stringent corrections for voxel-wise multiple comparisons. Further, multivariate techniques also lend themselves much better to prospective application of results from the analysis of one dataset to entirely new datasets. Multivariate techniques are thus well placed to provide information about mean differences and correlations with behavior, similarly to univariate approaches, with potentially greater statistical power and better reproducibility checks. In contrast to these advantages is the high barrier of entry to the use of multivariate approaches, preventing more widespread application in the community. To the neuroscientist becoming familiar with multivariate analysis techniques, an initial survey of the field might present a bewildering variety of approaches that, although algorithmically similar, are presented with different emphases, typically by people with mathematics backgrounds. We believe that multivariate analysis techniques have sufficient potential to warrant better dissemination. Researchers should be able to employ them in an informed and accessible manner. The current article is an attempt at a didactic introduction of multivariate techniques for the novice. A conceptual introduction is followed with a very simple application to a diagnostic data set from the Alzheimer s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), clearly demonstrating the superior performance of the multivariate approach.\nThe video component of this article can be found at http://www.jove.com/video/1988/ Protocol 1. To give a conceptual overview of multivariate analysis we can picture a very simple situation: a hypothetical data set for 50 human participants, where only three regions, denoted as voxels (=3-dimensional pixels in Figure 1 ) in the brain were measured. (Insert Figure 1 here, read caption as voice over.) 2. The general aim of multivariate analysis is to identify the major sources of variance in the data, and then describing the major effects of interest in the data in terms of these sources of variance. Figure 2 shows a simplistic example. (Insert Figure 2 here, read caption as voice over.) 3. We now apply both univariate and multivariate analysis to a clinical data set. We downloaded FDG-PET resting scans for 95 early Alzheimer's patients and 102 age-matched controls from the website of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (http:// www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/). We randomly picked 20 scans of both patients and controls and designated them as our derivation sample. The remaining 75 and 82 scans, respectively, constitute our replication sample. Univariate and multivariate Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers will now be derived in the derivation sample, and their diagnostic efficacy tested in the replication sample. 4. For the univariate marker, we contrast the 20 AD scans with the 20 controls scans in the derivation sample and pick the brain location that shows the largest decrease in PET signal in the AD patients as shown by a T-test. To test the diagnostic efficacy of this region, we check the data in the replication sample at this location and plot its PET signal as a function of disease status. 5. For the multivariate marker, we first perform a PCA on the combined 40 scans in the derivation sample, and then construct a covariance pattern from the first 5 Principal Components whose subject scaling factor shows a maximal mean difference between AD patients and healthy controls. (Details can be found in these representative papers 2\n.) The diagnostic covariance pattern obtained form the derivation sample is then prospectively applied to the replication sample. The resulting subject scaling factors are plotted as a function of disease status. 6. To provide a more general comparison of both univariate and multivariate approaches from step 4 and 5, we perform a \"split sample\" simulation and repeat both steps 1,000 times on resampled data, each time forming a 20/20 derivation sample and a 75/82 replication of AD patients and healthy controls afresh. Univariate and multivariate disease markers are computed from the derivation sample and the decision threshold is set such that at most 1 healthy control is misclassified as AD (= specificity 95%). The disease markers with their specific decision thresholds are then prospectively applied to the replication samples. The classification error rates in the replication sample are recorded for all resampling iterations."}, {"section_title": "Video Link", "text": "The video component of this article can be found at http://www.jove.com/video/1988/ Protocol 1.

A few choices for parameters in the multivariate analysis were made that can be subject debate to considerable debate. We spared the discussion of these issues in this article to avoid distraction from the major issues. First, we chose the first 6 Principal Components to construct our AD-related covariance pattern. There are theoretical reasons for this choice that we did not discuss 4 . The particular choice of 6 Principal Components though is not critical for our argument: one can chose in the range from 2 to 20 PCs and still obtain superior generalization performance of the multivariate marker in the split-sample simulations. The results are similarly robust with respect to the choice of numbers of subjects in derivation and replication samples. We chose 20 subjects for both groups in the replication sample, but this was purely for mathematical convenience to speed up the computations. Our results about the relative merits of both techniques would hold similarly if the numbers of subjects in the derivation samples were increased.\nSecond, we only presented the most basic kind of multivariate analysis. Considerable complication with techniques borrowed from the Machine-Learning literature, linear and non-linear transformations prior to the PCA, and various other wrinkles are feasible that could boost the generalization performance even more. For simplicity we have not touched on these possibilities in this article."}, {"section_title": "Disclosures", "text": "No conflicts of interest declared."}]
