Outbreaks were subsequently reported in cruise ships such as Diamond Princess, where it infected 712 (19%) of the 3700 passengers and crew. 3 In January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 spread to Europe, 4 with most confirmed cases reported from Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the first case was detected in Washington on January 19, 2020, 5 and had a travel history to Wuhan. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were uploaded from around the globe into the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data. 6 Genome epidemiologists performed big data analysis of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and suggested a pattern of spread of the virus from Wuhan to Europe, then the United States and the rest of the world. 7 They determined that COVID-19 spread coast to coast across the United States. 8 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. As of June 26, there have been over 2,422,312 confirmed cases in the US and 9.635 million cases worldwide that have contributed to more than 124,415 deaths in the US and 489,922 deaths worldwide (Table I) . 3, [9] [10] [11] [12] The WHO estimates that COVID-19 is fatal in about 3.4% of reported cases. 13 The number of people infected and its associated death toll make the COVID-19 pandemic one of the worst pandemics in recent history, and certainly worse than previous CoV pandemics-SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 14, 15 Rarely in human history have hospitals, clinicians, epidemiologists, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies worked so rapidly toward a common goal like we are seeing today-to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This vast scientific and clinical effort has generated a wealth of information at an unbelievable pace. We navigated through this scientific literature, and here we summarize the major developments in this rapidly changing field. We examine the scientific basis and big data aspects of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and transmission-mitigation strategies such as social distancing and wearing facemasks. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in people suffering from allergic rhinitis can serve as a clue for new-onset COVID-19. We examine how patients with asthma can be at a higher risk for severe"}, {"section_title": "DISTINGUISHING MILD COVID-19 SYMPTOMS FROM THOSE SEEN IN ALLERGIC DISEASES", "text": "The median incubation period for COVID-19 has been estimated to be 4 to 5 days, 16, 17 and 98% of the subjects develop the symptoms within 12 days of infection. 17 The clinical presentation and current recommendations in the management of COVID-19 are described in considerable detail on the American College of Physicians 18 and National Institutes of Health (NIH) 19 Web sites. There are some differences in symptoms observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from those observed in seasonal allergies. SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals usually develop symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, shortness of breath, myalgia, fatigue, fever, 16, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] and rarely (about 1%) conjunctival congestion, 16 and most recover spontaneously. In contrast, seasonal allergies almost universally present with a seasonally reproducible constellation of allergic rhinitis symptoms consisting of runny itchy nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, postnasal drip, and conjunctival congestion. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] From an allergist's perspective, a shift from these allergic rhinitis symptoms to those observed in COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath (Table II) 16, 22, 29 may suggest the possibility of newonset COVID-19 in allergic individuals. Taste or olfactory dysfunctions such as anosmia and dysgeusia can occur in about 35% to 90% of patients who reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, 30, 31 which is similar to higher to that seen in allergic rhinitis (taste dysfunction 20%, 32,33 olfactory dysfunction 20%-40% 33, 34 ). Wheezing, a common feature of asthma exacerbation, rarely occurs in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] However, both asthma and COVID-19 are often associated with cough and shortness of breath, 16, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] 40 and testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be required to exclude the possibility of new-onset COVID-19 in individuals with asthma. The mechanisms underlying the lack of a strong association between asthma and COVID-19 are discussed in greater detail later in this article. Because about a fifth of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop cutaneous manifestations such as erythematous rash, urticaria, and chickenpox-like vesicles, 41 if a patient with recurrent urticaria has new-onset urticarial rash together with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, it may suggest new-onset COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce severe Kawasaki-like disease, 42,43 a multisystem vasculitis characterized by persistent fever, conjunctival injection, exanthema, lymphadenopathy, inflammation of the tongue and pharyngeal mucosa, and edema in peripheral extremities. 44 Because its diagnosis is established by the presence of 5 or 6 principal symptoms, Kawasaki disease is not difficult to distinguish from allergic conjunctivitis or skin eruption. Because Kawasaki disease is a risk factor for subsequent allergic diseases, 45, 46 children who develop this disease during SARS-CoV-2 infection should be followed longitudinally for the development of allergic diseases."}, {"section_title": "CLINICAL FEATURES OF SEVERE COVID-19", "text": "One of the reasons COVID-19 has developed into such a feared pandemic is that a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons develop severe life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress 16 Schatz. 29 The 0s for shortness of breath and fever are not real numbers because these symptoms were not discussed in the article, likely because they are not common clinical features of AR. \u00e0Chen et al. 22 syndrome (ARDS), heart failure and other organ failures, and septic shock. 15, [20] [21] [22] A comparison of clinical features of PCRconfirmed patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in China versus those hospitalized in New York suggests that the patients in New York had 4-to 5-fold higher gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and a higher incidence of shortness of breath (Table III) . 16, 23 These differences could reflect a more severe cohort of patients being included in the report from New York, or suggest racial or other differences. Risk factors for severe or fatal COVID-19 include age above 60 years, presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease, history of cigarette smoking, obesity, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and d-dimer level more than 1 mg/ mL. 16, 20, 37, 47 The presence of shortness of breath as an early symptom is associated with more severe COVID-19. 16 Although myocardial injury from SARS-CoV-2 occurs rarely in about 5% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, its presence has been identified as a risk factor for death. 48, 49 The availability of intensive care unit beds to manage patients with severe COVID-19 can be a problem 50,51 because the number of available intensive care unit beds varies widely in the United States 11 or other countries 12 (Table I) ."}, {"section_title": "DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DETECTING AND MONITORING COVID-19 AND IMMUNE RESPONSE", "text": "The criterion standard test for COVID-19 is a RT-PCR-based test. 52 Nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, middle turbinate, anterior nares specimens or swabs collected by health care professionals, and other Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended specimens are placed into a virus preservation solution, 53 lysed to extract SARS-CoV-2 genes N, E, S, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and amplified by real-time RT-PCR. 54 COVID-19 point-of-care testing involves qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab and/or nasal wash/aspirate specimens. Some in-home testing kits for COVID-19 are now FDA-approved. 55 Virus isolation and culture is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure. Seroconversion occurs in 7 days in 50% and 14 days in all patients. 56 Even though many antibody-based tests have flooded the market, it is important to remember that they have not yet been validated, and ''positive'' test results may give a false sense of security of being ''immune'' to SARS-CoV-2. 57, 58 SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF USING SOCIAL DISTANCING, QUARANTINE, AND FACEMASKS TO REDUCE SPREAD OF SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through aerosol and droplets during coughing. 59 Virus-laden small (<5 mm) aerosolized droplets can remain in the air and travel long distances (>1 m, and sometimes even 4 m), 60,61 thus providing a scientific rationale for the CDC guidelines of social distancing of 6 ft (about 2 m). These droplets can spread and deposit on surfaces, where the virus remains viable for a few days. 62 SARS-CoV-2 is more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus can be detected up to 72 hours after application to the former surfaces. 63 SARS-CoV-2 remains viable in aerosols for 3 hours, which is similar to that for SARS-CoV. 63 The soles of shoes of medical staff can serve as carriers of SARS-CoV-2. 61 Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is high even before the onset of symptom, 64 during the first week of symptoms, and continues till the end of symptoms. 56 In one study, fecal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 52% of hospitalized patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and 39% of the subjects without gastrointestinal symptoms. 65 However, the main mode of transmission appears to be through aerosol, droplets, and contact with surfaces that have deposits of the active virus. 56, 63, 66 A big data study of infections in China estimated that 86% of all COVID-19 infections were undocumented. 67 Their modeling studies estimated that because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source for about 80% of infections, and facilitated the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV2. 67 However, because this report analyzed data from only the first few weeks of January, when local authorities were overwhelmed and underreporting cases, and did not include the data from the huge surge of cases in February, the 86% estimate should be treated with caution. During the previous SARS-CoV pandemic, the importance of social distancing, isolation of patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of exposed persons were identified as effective measures of mitigating the transmission of the virus. 68 These measures were also effective in mitigating the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 in China. 69 Modeling studies suggest that the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days in mainland China, but had a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. 70 Recent studies have similarly shown the utility of facemask in mitigating transmission of COVID-19. [71] [72] [73] However, some data suggest that surgical or cotton masks may not be enough to filter SARS-CoV-2. 74 MV, Mechanical ventilation. *Guan et al. 16 Goyal et al. 23 For these reasons, other CDC guidelines such as washing hands, not touching the face, and social distancing should also be followed to reduce the spread of this virus."}, {"section_title": "CoVs THAT HAVE CAUSED HUMAN DISEASES", "text": "CoVs are positive single-strand enveloped RNA viruses that belong to the family Coronoviridae. These viruses are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface, a large RNA genome, and a unique replication strategy. Before SARS-CoV-2 appeared, 6 human CoVs have been known to have contributed to human diseases: alpha CoVs HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and beta CoVs HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 75 The seasonal CoVs HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild upper respiratory tract illness. [76] [77] [78] However, pandemic CoVs SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV behave differently, and have caused staggering illness and death. The lower respiratory tract symptoms such as severe acute respiratory illness, shortness of breath, and chest computed tomography findings of SARS-CoV2 infection are similar to symptoms of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 21 Similar to SARS and MERS, 79,80 older age is a risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2. Although the 3.4% case-fatality rate of SARS-CoV2 13 appears to be lower than that reported for SARS (10%) or MERS (34%), 81 the number of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (about 9.64 million) is many times greater than the number of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV (about 8500) or MERS-CoV (about 2500). 82 Thus, the overall health effects of COVID-19 have greatly exceeded those observed in previous CoV pandemics."}, {"section_title": "GENOME SIMILARITIES, RESERVOIR, AND INTERMEDIATE MAMMALIAN HOST OF PANDEMIC CoVs", "text": "The genome size of SARS-CoV-2 (29.9 kb) is similar to the genome size of SARS-CoV (27.9 kb) and MERS-CoV (30.1 kb). 83-85 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have about 80% genome sequence similarity. 1, 86 The SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-CoVlike CoVs share approximately 96% sequence similarities. 86 Likewise, CoVs in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) have a high degree of similarity in all 6 residues of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) site of SARS-CoV-2. 87,88 Because scientific data suggest that civets and camels served as reservoirs for maintenance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 89 it has been proposed that bat CoV could have been transmitted to humans through pangolin reservoir to cause COVID-19. 88 "}, {"section_title": "RECEPTORS AND LUNG CELLS THAT BIND SARS-CoV-2", "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a well-defined receptor for SARS-CoV. 90 This receptor is expressed in most human respiratory cells, 91, 92 explaining its propensity to replicate in these cells. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the respiratory mucosa through the same ACE2 receptor. 93 The spike glycoprotein (S protein) on SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in binding host ACE2 receptor and in membrane fusion. 94, 95 Structural studies have elucidated the conformational aspects of the interaction of the RBD of S protein with ACE2 (Fig 1, A) . 37, [94] [95] [96] [97] This binding induces conformational changes in amino acids that help create salt bridges, increase van der Waals interactions, and facilitate binding with ACE2 with much greater affinity than SARS-CoV. 98 The S protein contains subunit S1 with the RBD that binds ACE2, the membrane-fusion subunit S2, the transmembrane anchor, and the intracellular tail (Fig 1, B) . Attachment of the RBD of S1 to host ACE2 receptor requires the help of the cellular transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2) 99 to cleave S2 protein from S1, and help in membrane fusion 100,101 (Fig 1, B) . Some unique features of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 14,56 account for its 10-to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 99 Structural analysis also suggests that some variations of ACE2 can strengthen the interactions between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. 98 A neutralizing antibody CR3022 that recognizes the conserved epitope RBD of SARS-CoV 102 also targets the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 103 only when 2 RBDs on the trimeric S protein are changed to the ''up'' position conformationally. 104 A careful study of this conformationally dependent interaction of this neutralizing antibody with RBD of SARS-CoV-2 may provide critical information required for developing additional high-potency neutralizing antibodies.\nThe cells in the lungs and airways that are likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated by single-nuclei and single-cell RNAseq analysis of human lung tissues. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in transient secretory cells in the segmental bronchial branches and cells derived from lung tissues. 105 Because SARS-CoV-2 has a furin-cleavage site in its S protein, a feature missing in SARS-CoV, it can use the serine endoprotease furin in host cells to streamline its internalization. 94, 105 The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 increases the expression of ACE2, which further damages the alveolar cells. After fusion with the host cell, the viral genome RNA is released into the cytoplasm. The uncoated RNA translates the replicasetranscriptase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab encoded in openreading frame 1a and 1ab located at the 5'-terminus of the genome, and the replication-transcription complex 106 replicates RNA for assembly and virus release. [107] [108] [109] RESPIRATORY VIRUSES, CoVs, SARS-CoV-2, AND ASTHMA Many respiratory viruses have been associated with asthma exacerbations, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses (RVs), influenza virus, CoV, enterovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. 77, [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] Atopy and asthma are risk factors for lower respiratory tract infection, more severe virus-induced wheezing, and asthma exacerbation. [117] [118] [119] The contribution of RV or RSV to the initiation of asthma and asthma exacerbation has been investigated for many years. Positive family history of asthma, history of atopy, and wheezing are risk factors for RSV-induced lower respiratory tract infection, 118 and hospitalizations due to RV infection. 119 RSVinduced bronchiolitis is the most common cough, wheezing, and respiratory distress, and requires hospitalization in infants. 120 Many prospective long-term follow-up studies demonstrated that the history of wheezing illnesses caused by RVor RSV infections is a predictor of the subsequent development of asthma. 113, [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] From these studies, 2 hypotheses have emerged; RSV-or RV-induced wheezing initiates the development of asthma, or, these viruses trigger wheezing and exacerbation of asthma. The validity of these 2 schools of thought has been debated for decades.\nLike other respiratory viruses that infect the airway epithelial cells and pneumocytes through their receptors and induce asthma exacerbations, 110, 111, [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] seasonal human CoVs HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 can also cause common cold and induce asthma exacerbations. 110, [131] [132] [133] Inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV pandemic CoVs into cynomolgus macaques infects airway cells with subtle differences. 134 SARS-CoV-2 infects type I and II pneumocytes in ciliated airway mucosal epithelial cells and damages alveolar cells, whereas MERS-CoV infects predominantly type II pneumocytes, and causes less lung damage. 134 Investigators have proposed a hypothesis to explain the mechanism by which respiratory viruses trigger asthma exacerbations-patients with asthma have an attenuated IFN-I and IFN-III response to these infections, and the resultant unopposed T H 2 responses contribute to asthma exacerbation. [135] [136] [137] Because infection of lung and airway cells with SARS-CoV-2 induces an attenuated IFN-I and INF-III signature 138,139 similar to that observed in patients with asthma, COVID-19 would be expected to frequently trigger asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors such as CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL17, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCR1, CXCR2, IL5RA, IL-6, FIG 1.

S1 part has an RBD. The virion uses the spike protein S1 to attach with RBD of the host ACE2 receptor on the cell membrane with the help of the cellular TMPRSS2. Following attachment of S1 to ACE2, the host serine protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the S2 protein from S1, and plays a role in membrane fusion of CoVs. The figure was created using BioRender (https://biorender.com/). C, The prevalence of asthma in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in United States. Data were extracted from April 8, 2020, MMWR report 37 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 97 The total length of each bar represents the prevalence rates of COVID-19 in each age group. The length of the blue part of this bar is the expected prevalence rate of asthma in each age group. The orange part represents the prevalence rate of COVID-19 in excess of the expected prevalence rate of asthma in each age group.\nIL-1b, and IL-1R2 observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage and lungs of patients with COVID-19 138,139 also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection should frequently induce asthma exacerbations. Yet, quite surprisingly, in the April 8, 2020, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 37 report of 1482 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the United States in March 2020, it was mentioned that wheezing was present in only about 7% of the 178 patients in whom data were available on underlying conditions, which is less than the prevalence rate of about 10% of asthma in the general population. 140 These reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 rarely induces asthma exacerbations during hospitalization for COVID-19. 37, 140 Could host immune-response factors contribute to the reduced ability of SARS-CoV-2-infected airway and lung cells from inducing asthma exacerbations? SARS-CoV-2 entry-associated genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in human nasal and lower airway epithelial cells, and cells that express these genes often coexpress innate immune genes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 1 and MX dynamin-like GTPase 1 (MX1). 141 IDO is a rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan catabolism that increases the synthesis of tryptophan metabolites such as kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and xanthurenic acid that induce immune tolerance and suppress experimental allergic inflammation. 142, 143 Thus, increased expression of IDO in ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing cells could reduce asthma exacerbations in COVID-19. MX1 is an IFN-inducible GTPase with antiviral activities against a broad range of RNA viruses. 144 The data from the Childhood Origins of Asthma study and Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood suggest that polymorphisms of the MX1 gene are associated with asthma exacerbations. 145 Thus, similar to IDO, increased expression of MX1 in ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing cells could reduce asthma exacerbations in COVID-19. IL-33, an alarmin that normally resides dormant exclusively in the nucleus, becomes a proallergic cytokine when it is secreted extracellularly and induces allergic inflammation and contributes to asthma exacerbation. [146] [147] [148] Infection with respiratory viruses that trigger asthma exacerbation, such as influenza and rhinovirus, induce IL-33 secretion from bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar cells in the airways. 146, 148, 149 Yet, our search of databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar did not find peer-reviewed publications that show that SARS-CoV-2 induces IL-33 secretion in the airways. Taken together, the unique host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could explain why it does not frequently trigger asthma exacerbations.\nIf SARS-CoV-2 does not induce asthma exacerbations, can asthma be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection as suggested on the CDC Web site 150 ? The comorbid diseases data in the April 8, 2020, MMWR report show that in 18-to 49year-old patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 27% had a history of asthma. 37 The COVID-19 task force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology suggests that given the 10% prevalence of asthma in the United States, the higher 27% of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in this age group suggests that they may be at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 (Fig 1, C) . 37, 151 The same MMWR report suggests that African Americans have a disproportionally higher hospitalization for COVID-19, accounting for 33% of the US hospitalizations, 37 just as they have a higher propensity for severe asthma. [152] [153] [154] In contrast to these MMWR data, a retrospective analysis of 140 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China with confirmed results of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection reported that none of them had asthma. 35 Another study performed in China involving 548 patients with COVID-19 revealed that 0.9% of patients with COVID-19 had asthma, which is lower than the prevalence rate of asthma in the general population in China. 36 The discrepancy between the US MMWR report and these studies from China could reflect racial differences in the role of asthma in the severity of COVID-19. 35, 37, 151 However, in a very large study of 5700 patients in New York City hospitalized for COVID-19, only 9% of the patients had underlying asthma, 155 similar to the prevalence rates of asthma in the general population. That presence of asthma does not contribute to the severity of COVID-19 is also evident from another study performed in New York City that showed no increase in asthma in invasive compared with noninvasive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. 23 What could be the explanation for the paucity of patients with asthma in patients with COVID-19 in studies performed in China? 35, 36 Because the expression of airway levels of ACE2 is lower in atopic subjects compared with nonatopic subjects, 156 T H 2-high endotype of asthma may be at a lower risk for severe COVID-19 because their airways would have fewer receptors for entry of SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, because exposure of the airways of allergic patients with asthma to environmental allergens reduces ACE2 expression levels, 156 seasonal exposure to aeroallergens may protect them from COVID-19. As discussed later, ciclesonide and formoterol are commonly used inhalers in asthma, and their antiviral properties could protect patients with asthma from COVID-19.\nOn the basis of MMWR data, 37 if one assumes that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 particularly in the 18-to 49-year age group (Fig 1, C) , what could be the mechanisms of this increased propensity toward severity of COVID-19? Because obesity is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, 37 obesityrelated endotype of asthma 157,158 could be a higher risk for severe COVID-19. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in sputum cells is higher in males, in African Americans, and in patients with asthma with a history of diabetes, all risk factors for severe COVID-19. 159 Persons with ACE D/D genotypes have higher immunoreactive ACE concentration in serum and a higher risk of asthma than those with other genotypes. [160] [161] [162] Because SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 to infect cells, future studies should evaluate whether the ACE D/D genotype is a risk factor for COVID-19. TMPRSS2 is expressed in human airway epithelium 163 and thought to contribute to the severity of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV lung infection. 164 Because subjects with atopic asthma have higher nasal levels of TMPRSS2 compared with healthy volunteers, 165 these increased levels could be a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in asthma. Treatment of mice with ACE2 activator or angiotensin (1-7) reduces airway inflammation in experimental asthma. 166, 167 In addition, loss of ACE2 in the animal model study has been shown to aggravate severe acute lung injury, and the administration of recombinant human ACE2 alleviates lung injury. 168 Taken together, these studies suggest that signaling through ACE2 provides protection against both allergic airway inflammation and acute lung injury. Because attachment of S1 part of the S protein to ACE2 can stimulate splicing of ACE2 by TMPRSS2, 169 it is possible that this spliced ACE2 is less effective in providing protection against acute lung injury and asthma. Future studies will have to determine whether the administration of human recombinant ACE2 could be a treatment option for COVID-19 in patients with asthma."}, {"section_title": "SCIENTIFIC STRATEGIES BEHIND MAJOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR COVID-19", "text": "Many clinical trials such as seen in NIH ClinicalTrials.gov 170 or EU Clinical Trials Register 171 are being performed worldwide for COVID-19 (Table IV) , [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] but as of today there are no proven effective treatments. On March 20, 2020, WHO announced the launch of SOLIDARITY, 177 an unprecedented, coordinated push to collect robust scientific data rapidly during a pandemic. 178 Properly designed large clinical trials are required for assessing drugs in each category of the following mechanistic categories (Fig 2) , and are being performed.\nInhibiting viral entry: Decoy receptor, mAbs, convalescent plasma, camostat Some data suggest that this strategy may be effective in COVID-19 (Fig 2, A) . Acting as a decoy, human recombinant soluble ACE2 treatments dramatically inhibited the growth of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells by more than 1000-fold, 179 and suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection with engineered human blood vessel and kidney organoids. 179 These results suggest that human recombinant soluble ACE2 could block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and is a potential drug for use in COVID-19. In another study, transfusion of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibodies collected from the donors who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection to 5 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation improved their clinical status. 180 Likewise, the administration of convalescent plasma had a beneficial effect on 10 patients with severe COVID-19. 181 Human neutralizing mAbs from convalescent patients with COVID-19, B38 and H4, inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD to ACE2 182 (Fig 2, A) .

In addition to its suppressive effects on viral replication, hydroxychloroquine inhibits Toll-like receptor 7/9-dependent inflammatory responses. 186 In a small study, azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination than hydroxychloroquine alone or either drug given orally. 175 The low cost and vast availability of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is one of the reasons it is being evaluated as part of SOLIDARITY trials. However, a parallel, double-masked, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 revealed that the mortality rate until day 13 was higher in the high-dosage chloroquine diphosphate group than in the low-dosage group. 187 The high-dosage group of chloroquine showed more often increased QTc interval than the low-dosage group. 187 Likewise, another report suggests that neither hydroxychloroquine alone nor in combination with azithromycin had beneficial clinical effects in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 188, 189 Furthermore, the administration of hydroxychloroquine may contribute to increased mortality 180 and prolongation of QTc interval in electrocardiogram. 19 These studies suggest that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may not have significant efficacy in COVID-19, and their excessive use may contribute to electrocardiogram changes and even death."}, {"section_title": "Inhibiting translation of the viral genome and replication of virus", "text": "Lopinavir-ritonavir is a boosted protease inhibitor used for treating HIV type 1 infection that had favorable effects on SARS 190 and MERS 191 in small studies.

Here, we reviewed the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19, and examined how this knowledge has been critical in providing the scientific rationale for identifying novel and FDA-approved repurposed therapeutic targets. From an allergists' perspective, we discussed how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis may serve as a clue for new-onset COVID-19 in subjects with allergy, and examined how asthma could be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Till effective vaccines or treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale discussed in this article that underlie pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing.
