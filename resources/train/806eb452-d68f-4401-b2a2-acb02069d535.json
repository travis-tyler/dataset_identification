[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Atlantic component of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) consists of a northward flow of relatively warm waters in the upper ocean, deepwater formation at high latitudes in the North Atlantic and a southward flow of cold waters at depth. Together with the water volumes carried by this circulation, the AMOC redistributes massive amounts of heat through the Atlantic Ocean. At its maximum (near 24\u00b0-26\u00b0N), the northward heat transport associated with the AMOC contributes with almost 25% of the combined global atmosphere and ocean northward heat transport (Trenberth & Caron, 2001). Global circulation models consistently indicate that the AMOC may have a profound impact on the climate system variability, for example, by driving the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (Zhang et al., 2014;Zhang & Wang, 2013). Changes in the AMOC are thought to have led to rapid climate change in the past: paleo-records (Peterson et al., 2000;Stott et al., 2002) as well as climate models (Ganopolski & Rahmstorf, 2001) closely relate drastic changes in the AMOC with abrupt changes in Earth's climate. Long-term climatic predictions suggest that a collapse in the overturning cell will cause an overall temperature decrease over the Northern Hemisphere, changes in African and Indian monsoon regimes, and changes in hurricane activity (Vellinga & Wood, 2002). The AMOC is formed by a complex system of thermohaline and wind-driven currents. In this context, the energetic western boundary currents play a major role in redistributing and exchanging heat and properties. A significant portion of the cold lower limb flow of the AMOC is conveyed by the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), which rapidly transports recently formed North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) southward along the continental slope of the American continents (e.g., Bower & Hunt, 2000;Garzoli et al., 2015;Rhein et al., 2015;Watts, 1991), although ocean interior pathways are also thought to be important for the export of NADW from its source regions (e.g., Bower et al., 2009;Lozier et al., 2013). In the subtropical North Atlantic, most of the northward flowing warm upper limb of the AMOC is carried within the Gulf Stream through the Straits of Florida or in shallow western boundary currents east of the Bahamas (e.g., Frajka-Williams et al., 2016;McCarthy et al., 2015). In the subtropical South Atlantic, the warm upper AMOC limb is thought to be primarily in the eastern basin (Garzoli et al., 2015). However, the western structure of the water masses at the SAMBA-W line and to determine the average pathways of these water masses in the vicinity of 34.5\u00b0S. To this end, we report a new set of hydrographic data with unprecedented time-space resolution, collected along the SAMBA-W line. We also analyze some aspects of the temporal variability of the water properties, although we do not pursue a full analysis of the mesoscale processes associated with these variations because our current data set (essentially, a half-dozen snapshot hydrographic sections spread over four years) cannot resolve high-frequency (mesoscale) activity. The data and methods are presented in sections 2 and 3, respectively. In section 4, the time-averaged properties of  (NADW, blue), and abyssal (LCDW/AABW, light green).

On the basis of these results, pathways for each layer are proposed. A summary and concluding remarks are presented in section 5.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans the barotropic velocities. For each profile, the horizontal velocity was projected onto a reference frame rotated 43.5\u00b0T to match the shelf break orientation. A section of the alongshore component of the velocity was created for each occupation by gridding the data in the same fashion as done for the \u03b8, S, and O 2 data. The time-mean alongshore section was then obtained by averaging the two realizations. Higher quality profiles were typically collected west of 47\u00b0W, where the region is characterized by stronger acoustic backscatter. This is reflected by the higher instrument range observed below~1,000 m (80-110 m) in contrast with the lower ranges observed farther offshore (60-90 m). Given these range values for a single down-looking LADCP, we have estimated the accuracy of the final LADCP data to 5 cm/s (Thurnherr, 2010). Therefore, we have neglected all velocity values below this threshold.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 4.1.1. Tropical Water The upper~200 m of the water column at the SAMBA-W line are occupied by the warm and relatively salty TW, a diluted variety of the Salinity Maximum Water (SMW) that originates in the subtropics due to excess evaporation over precipitation (M\u00e9mery et al., 2000). Due to its relative high density, the SMW is subducted below the surface as it flows south from its formation region, while its salinity decreases below 37.00 through mixing with the fresher surrounding waters. By the time the SMW reaches 34.5\u00b0S and has become TW, the core of the layer is characterized by a subsurface salinity maximum in the upper-right corner of the average \u03b8-S diagram at \u03b8~20.0\u00b0C, S~36.10 ( Figure 4a and Table 2). The averaged \u03b8-S and O 2 -S diagrams at the four selected longitudes along the SAMBA-W line are presented in Figure 5. The saltiest, least modified variety of TW is found at the westernmost location, 51.5\u00b0W, within the core of the BC (\u03b8~21\u00b0C, S~36.50). The TW becomes monotonically fresher and colder in the offshore direction ( Figure 5a). For example, the salinity maximum at 44.5\u00b0W is found at \u03b8~18.7\u00b0C and S~35.98. Subsurface dissolved oxygen maxima are also observed offshore of the BC, centered at \u03b8 = 19.5\u00b0C at 49.5\u00b0W, \u03b8 = 19.0\u00b0C at 47.5\u00b0W, and \u03b8 = 17.0\u00b0C at 44.5\u00b0W (Figure 5b), whereas no noticeable maximum is observed at 51.5\u00b0W. The diluted TW observed east of 49.5\u00b0W is consistent with previous analyses of the western boundary circulation south of 34.5\u00b0S. After colliding with the MC, the BC splits into two branches, one flowing southward as an overshoot, and the other turning equatorward offshore of the BC (Stramma & Peterson, 1990; Figure 1a). After crossing the SAMBA-W line, the TW flowing southward within the BC becomes colder and fresher through mixing with subantarctic waters in the Brazil-Malvinas front. It then recirculates northward offshore of the main southward flow. Hereafter we refer to this northward countercurrent as the \"BC offshore recirculation.\" The relatively high mean EKE observed east of~50\u00b0W at SAMBA-W (~300-600 cm 2 /s 2 ; Figure 1b) compared to the weak mean kinetic energy in that region (<50 cm 2 /s 2 , not shown) suggests that the BC offshore recirculation may be dominated by mesoscale features, such as eddies and meanders. By contrast, the mean flow is significantly more energetic closer to the western boundary, west of~51\u00b0W, where the mean kinetic energy range is 300-400 cm 2 /s 2 and the EKE is~100 cm 2 /s 2 . Because the recirculated TW found within the BC offshore recirculation contains elements of subantarctic waters, there is a noticeable thermohaline contrast \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans with the more pristine TW found within the BC. The highest \u03b8-S contrast between the TW variety found at 51.5\u00b0W and the TW variety found at 49.5\u00b0W is observed during austral summer because the waters within the BC are warmer and saltier. For example, during the SAM08 cruise (December 2012), the TW core at 51.5\u00b0W was found at \u03b8~23\u00b0C, S~36.95, which was 2.5\u00b0C warmer and 0.68 saltier than the TW core at 49.5\u00b0W (not shown). The oxygen maxima associated with the modified waters observed offshore are also consistent with mixing with oxygen-rich subantarctic waters. Furthermore, the inspection of individual profiles shows that the O 2 maxima are largely located at the top of the main thermocline, also suggesting an increase of dissolved oxygen concentration due to photosynthetic activity, which is known to be enhanced in the Brazil-Malvinas frontal zone (Brandini et al., 2000 (Figure 5a). Rather than being an averaging artifact, these inflections are a result of the presence of somewhat colder and saltier waters within the upper SACW. These inflections are present during the majority of the occupations. Associated with these modified varieties, the SACW found offshore of the BC (i.e., east of 49.5\u00b0W) also shows higher O 2 concentrations. Indeed, at 51.5\u00b0W, the waters within this layer are on average~10 \u03bcmol/kg less oxygenated than farther offshore ( Figure 5b). The SACW is mainly formed south of the SAMBA-W line, within the BMC and further east along the Subtropical Front during austral winter (Provost et al., 1999). After being subducted into the thermocline the SACW recirculates around the subtropical gyre, showing uniform properties across the basin. At the SAMBA-W line, the lower portion is characterized by a relatively low O 2 concentration ( Figure 4b). The sawtoothed intrusions observed in the averaged \u03b8-S diagram in the upper portion of the SACW of the region located offshore of the BC are typical of Subtropical Mode Water (STMW) formed through winter convection and subsequently capped by a fresher layer (Gordon, 1981). Based on historical hydrographic data, Provost et al. (1999) found that the BMC is a major region of mode water formation in the western South Atlantic and identified three main types of STMW. The salinity maxima associated with the inflections observed within SACW in the SAMBA-W line approximately fall within their STMW Type II. This water mass is characterized by \u03b8 = 15.0 \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C, S = 35.60 \u00b1 0.15; originates during the formation of deep winter mixed layers; and represents \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans the largest STMW volume. Our observations also fall into the STMW Type I as more recently defined by Sato and Polito (2014) (\u03b8 = 15.0 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C, S = 35.60 \u00b1 0.20), which is also thought to originate in the vicinity of the BMC. The influence of STMW in the BC offshore recirculation is further supported by the relatively higher dissolved oxygen concentration at the STMW temperature range (\u03b8 > 11.0\u00b0C; Figure 5b). The \u03b8-S inflections are not observed within the BC at the SAMBA-W line because at this location the waters in this density layer are purely of northern origin. Hence, the transition between the SACW observed within the BC and the admixtures of SACW and STMW found farther offshore also suggest a northward counter flow across the SAMBA-W line east of 49.5\u00b0W. The average velocity section displays a mean southwestward flow west of~49\u00b0W throughout the water column ( Figure 3d). West of 51\u00b0W, the higher velocities are associated with the BC (> 20 cm/s) and confined to the upper 600 m. The BC offshore recirculation is clearly depicted in the velocity section collected in July 2012, with alongshore velocities exceeding 20 cm/s east of 49\u00b0W ( Figure 2d). The average velocity section has hints of this northeastward flow between 48 and 49\u00b0W and 46.5 and 45\u00b0W ( Figure 3d). The presence of a semipermanent recirculation cell in the upper~500 m of the water column may have an important role in the volume transport associated with the AMOC at 34.5\u00b0S. Dong et al. (2014) have shown that changes in the net geostrophic transport across a transbasin section at this latitude, at seasonal time scales, are partially controlled by changes in the western boundary density field. The authors suggested that these density changes are associated with the relative strength of the MC and the BC, which generate positive density anomalies in the western boundary due to an intensification of the MC and a weakening of the BC during austral winter, and the opposite during summer. Although the MC does not extend as far north as 34.5\u00b0S, a northward excursion during winter could effectively enhance the mixing of subtropical and subantarctic waters across the Brazil-Malvinas Front within the TW and SACW layers, resulting in colder and fresher waters being advected northward by the BC offshore recirculation, which would generate positive density anomalies near 34.5\u00b0S.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans (S < 34.6) is significantly different than further offshore, on average warmer (\u03b8 > 3\u00b0C) and more oxygenated (O 2 > 200 \u03bcmol/kg; green line in Figures 7a and 7b). This is most likely a combination of two effects: (i) nearbottom intensification of diapycnal mixing with the overlying O 2 rich AAIW and (ii) the southward recirculation along the western boundary, which allows more time for mixing. By contrast, the lower portion of UCDW (S > 34.6, \u03b3 > 27.75 kg/m 3 ) is modified due to the somewhat more subtle differences between the NADW varieties flowing underneath. At 49.5\u00b0W, the potential temperature increases from 2.92\u00b0C at S~34.52 to 3.35\u00b0C at S~34.83 due to interaction with the relatively warmer NADW flowing southward within the DWBC (red line in Figure 7a). By contrast, \u03b8 increases roughly half as much in the same salinity range on the eastern end of the section because of the relatively colder variety of NADW found there (black line in Figure 7a). Argo profiles collected between 34.5\u00b0S and 27\u00b0S close to the slope show a monotonic northward temperature increase (inset in Figure 7a), suggesting a recirculation cell that extends farther north, similar to that discussed above for the AAIW layer. Inspection of \u03b8-S properties from CTD profiles collected near 30\u00b0S further supports this hypothesis. For this data set, it is useful to discriminate the profiles collected close to the continental slope (i.e., within 500 km in the cross-shore direction from the 200 m isobath; magenta circles in Figure 7) from those collected farther offshore (i.e., farther than 500 km from the 200 m isobath; grey circles in Figure 7). The UCDW close to the slope is significantly warmer (\u03b8 > 3.2\u00b0C) and more oxygenated at \u03b3 > 27.8 kg/m 3 due to mixing with the relatively warm and oxygen-rich variety of NADW flowing underneath, while that observed offshore presents potential temperatures within the range found at the SAMBA-W line. Unlike the AAIW, once the UCDW leaves its \"source\" region in the Southern Ocean and recirculates through the South Atlantic, its oxygen concentration increases with time due to mixing with the adjacent and relatively more oxygenated AAIW and NADW. Therefore, the overall temperature and oxygen decreasing in the offshore direction observed at the SAMBA-W line requires admixtures with more \"pristine\" varieties of UCDW, such as those found near the Malvinas Escarpment (crosses in Figure 7). The recirculation pattern of UCDW in the vicinity of the SAMBA-W line thus resembles that of the AAIW layer, with older, recirculated UCDW flowing southward across 34.5\u00b0S as a slope current underneath the BC, mixing at the BMC with more pristine UCDW advected northward by the MC, and then recirculating northward beneath the BC offshore recirculation. As with the AAIW, the July 2012 alongshore velocity section and the averaged section also corroborate this circulation pattern for the UCDW (Figure 2d and 3d). The averaged section, however, displays a weaker northward flow of~5 cm/s at 47\u00b0W. \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 4.1.5. North Atlantic Deep Water The DWBC at the SAMBA-W line is mainly composed of recently ventilated NADW, which is clearly identifiable by its high oxygen concentration (O 2 > 240 \u03bcmol/kg), relatively high potential temperature (2.0\u00b0C < \u03b8 < 3.5\u00b0C) and high salinity (S > 34.8; Figures 2 and 3a-3c and Table 2). However, the \u03b8, S, and O 2 maxima within the NADW as observed in the synoptic sections are offset vertically, indicating slightly different NADW types (e.g., Figure 2). The warmest variety of NADW is concentrated against the bottom slope just below the interface with UCDW (\u03b8 > 3.3, Figure 2a), and the NADW substantially cools in the offshore direction, whereas the average salinity (S~34.95, \u03b3 = 27.985 kg/m 3 ) and oxygen (O 2~2 50 \u03bcmol/kg 1 , \u03b3 = 27.995 kg/m 3 ) maxima are located at a higher neutral density levels. Farther north, in the western tropical South Atlantic, the NADW is commonly divided into three sublayers, namely, Upper (uNADW), Middle (mNADW), and Lower NADW (lNADW), identified by a shallow salinity maximum and two deep oxygen maxima, respectively (M\u00e9mery et al., 2000;Tsuchiya et al., 1994). In what follows, before analyzing the NADW properties at 34.5\u00b0S, we will describe how these sublayers are modified as the NADW flows southward along the boundary. This will provide the basin-scale perspective required to interpret our observations at the SAMBA-W line. At 13\u00b0S, the core of uNADW is characterized by a salinity maximum higher than 34.97 and \u03b8~3.75\u00b0C near the continental boundary (orange diamonds in Figure 8a), whereas it is somewhat fresher, colder, and less oxygenated farther offshore (\u03b8~3.60\u00b0C, S~34.96; grey diamonds in Figure 8a). This maximum salinity layer is capped by still warmer but fresher waters that must be a variety of NADW due to their high potential temperature, but nonetheless lie outside our defined NADW neutral density limits (\u03b8 > 3.7\u00b0C, S~34.90, 27.75 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 27.90 kg/m 3 ). The water mass overlying the uNADW is also associated with high tritium and chlorofluorocarbons (not shown) and is referred to in literature as shallow uNADW (suNADW; Rhein et al., 1995). Note that warmer waters (\u03b8 > 4.1\u00b0C) are also found against the continental boundary in this neutral density range (Figure 8a). Interestingly, the oxygen concentration at this \u03b8 maximum is significantly lower (195 \u03bcmol/kg < O 2 < 215 \u03bcmol/kg; orange diamonds in Figure 8b) than at the underlying NADW. Because the UCDW does not reach as far north as 13\u00b0S (Tsuchiya et al., 1994), we associate the relatively warm, oxygen-poor suNADW with a modified variety of uNADW derived from a direct mixture between the uNADW and the lower portion of the AAIW, which is characterized by low O 2 concentration (140 \u03bcmol/ kg < O 2 < 160 \u03bcmol/kg) in the vicinity of 13\u00b0S (Tsuchiya et al., 1994). We will examine the \u03b8 maximum associated with the suNADW farther south because it has an important role in modifying the UCDW/NADW Figure 8. Same as Figure 5 for the NADW layer. The orange (grey) diamonds are CTD profiles collected within (farther than) 300 km of the 200 m isobath at the CITHER-2 LEG 2 section (13\u00b0S); the magenta (grey) circles are CTD profiles collected within (farther than) 200 km of the 200 m isobath at the CLIVAR/WOCE A10 (~30\u00b0S); the black crosses are CTD profiles collected during the CITHER-2 LEG 1 (WOCE A17, 45-48\u00b0S) section. The CTD data collected at the SAMBA-W line are bounded to the NADW \u03b3 limits; all other data are limited to \u03b3 > 27.7 kg/m interface in the vicinity of the SAMBA-W line. The deepest levels within NADW (28.01 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.10 kg/ m 3 ) at 13\u00b0S are occupied by the mNADW and lNADW, which are characterized by two oxygen maxima located at \u03b8~3.5\u00b0C, O 2~2 50 \u03bcmol/kg and at \u03b8~2.2\u00b0C, O 2~2 55 \u03bcmol/kg, respectively (Figure 8b). At~30\u00b0S, the uNADW is colder and fresher than at 13\u00b0S but is still recognizable by a salinity maximum, particularly close to the boundary (\u03b8~3.4\u00b0C, S > 34.94; magenta circles in Figure 8a). The potential temperature maximum associated with suNADW is also present right above the salinity maximum and is colder and slightly fresher than farther north. As observed at 13\u00b0S, there is also a marked temperature difference at the \u03b8 maximum between waters found close to the slope (\u03b8~3.7\u00b0C, 34.86 < S < 34.92; magenta circles in Figure 8a) and offshore (2.9\u00b0C < \u03b8 < 3.3\u00b0C, 34.86 < S < 34.92; gray circles in Figure 8a). The profiles collected east of the Rio Grande Rise (~33\u00b0W) show no trace of the potential temperature maximum. Rather, there is a monotonic cooling and a salinity and oxygen concentration increasing with greater depth between the UCDW at \u03b3 < 27.9 kg/m 3 and the inflection point at \u03b8 = 2.4\u00b0C, S = 34.9, and O 2 = 247 \u03bcmol/kg. Below this level, the O 2 extremes in the mNADW and lNADW sublayers are smoother as a result of mixing as the DWBC flows southward throughout the section. Close to boundary, the oxygen maximum associated with lNADW is noticeable at \u03b8~2.45\u00b0C, O 2~2 50 \u03bcmol/kg; these values are about 0.25\u00b0C warmer and 5 \u03bcmol/kg less oxygenated than those observed at 13\u00b0S. By contrast, the O 2 maximum associated with mNADW is manifested as an inflection point centered at \u03b8~3.3\u00b0C and O 2~2 46 \u03bcmol/kg. Offshore of the Rio Grande Rise, the NADW at 28.01 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.1 kg/m 3 is about 0.05 fresher and 5 \u03bcmol/kg less oxygenated (Figure 8b). At the SAMBA-W line, the distinct characteristics of uNADW, mNADW, and lNADW vanish almost completely. The averaged \u03b8-S and \u03b8-O 2 diagrams exhibit a single, smooth inflection point at the NADW core, which becomes increasingly eroded in the offshore direction. At 49.5\u00b0W, the salinity maximum that could be traced as uNADW (S > 34.92) is located at a lower neutral density range (27.96 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.02 kg/m 3 ) than the uNADW found farther north close to the slope. It is also associated with a secondary O 2 maximum, a remnant of mNADW with concentrations not exceeding 245 \u03bcmol/kg at \u03b8 = 3.15\u00b0C (red curve in Figure 8b). By contrast, the oxygen maximum associated with the lNADW vanishes through mixing with the underlying LCDW. As a result, the deepest oxygen maximum observed at 49.5\u00b0W is located at a lower density and is warmer and less oxygenated than the deepest oxygen minimum observed farther north (O 2 = 247 \u03bcmol/kg, 2.4\u00b0C < \u03b8 < 2.8\u00b0C, 28.02 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.05 kg/m 3 ; Figures 8a and 8b). Furthermore, the warm layer associated with suNADW is still present close to boundary (\u03b8 > 3.3\u00b0C in Figure 3a). The interface between UCDW and NADW in the western boundary of the SAMBA-W line is not well defined because the density of the warm suNADW is similar to the UCDW (M\u00e9mery et al., 2000) and they are both poorly oxygenated due to mixing with the overlying low oxygen waters from the tropical region. Indeed, the average potential temperature maximum at 49.5\u00b0W within this warm layer is found at \u03b8 = 3.387\u00b0C, \u03b3 = 27.884 kg/m 3 , that is, within the UCDW density range (red curve in Figure 7a). Hence, using \u03b3 = 27.9 kg/m 3 as the UCDW/NADW interface will inevitably label the warm suNADW generally found close to the continental slope as UCDW. Although these waters are too warm for the traditional definition of UCDW, we decided to keep \u03b3 = 27.9 kg/m 3 as the NADW upper limit throughout the entire section because it effectively keeps most of the highly oxygenated waters within NADW limits (see, for example, the synoptic section in Figure 2). At the eastern end of the SAMBA-W line, at 44.5\u00b0W, the NADW is overall colder (\u03b8 < 3\u00b0C), fresher (S < 34.89), and less oxygenated (O 2 < 240 \u03bcmol/kg; black curve in Figures 8a and 8b), clearly evidencing the eroded nature of the NADW found offshore. The averaged \u03b8-S and \u03b8-O 2 properties at the deepest portion of the NADW (\u03b8 < 2\u00b0C) converge at all selected longitudes, and the oxygen concentration significantly decreases downward due to mixing with the underlying LCDW. By contrast, at~30\u00b0S and 13\u00b0S, the O 2 decreases almost linearly with temperature from its maximum at the lNADW core to values associated with AABW (circles and diamonds in Figure 8b), evidencing the absence of LCDW at these latitudes. In agreement with M\u00e9mery et al. (2000), who set the deep front between the uNADW and UCDW approximately at 26\u00b0S, our results indicate that at~30\u00b0S as well as at 34.5\u00b0S, \u03b8 does not exceed~3.7\u00b0C within the layer defined by 27.75 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 27.90 kg/m 3 (Figures 7a and 8a), thus implying that south of~30\u00b0S and away from the slope, this density range is occupied by UCDW. However, our results also reveal the presence of an intensified southward flow against the slope between 13\u00b0S and the SAMBA-W line, which conveys a relatively warm but poorly oxygenated variety of uNADW that we associate with suNADW.\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans LADCP observations show a weak southward flow (just over 5 cm/s) within the LCDW range and east of 47.5\u00b0W that contrasts with the average northward flow derived from our water mass analysis. Whether this disparity is due to the low accuracy of the LADCP in this deep, low-scattering environment is difficult to assess with the available data. Future observations will be required to better assess the circulation at this level. Regardless, our water mass analysis shows that the upper portion of the LCDW found at the SAMBA-W line (\u03b8 > 0.9\u00b0C) does not actually reach 30\u00b0S, thus indicating an average eastward spreading between this latitude and 34.5\u00b0S. Based on hydrographic and CFC data collected during the WOCE section A17, M\u00e9mery et al. (2000) also found evidence of an eastward turning of the LCDW at~34.5\u00b0S. CTD profiles collected along this section clearly show a deep front located approximately at 28.10 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.25 kg/m 3 , which separates the less oxygenated and relatively fresh LCDW to the south from an admixture of NADW and AABW to the north (not shown). Our results also indicate that the densest fraction of the LCDW (\u03b8 < 0.2\u00b0C, \u03b3 > 28.25 kg/m 3 ) continues northward and outflows into the Brazil Basin through the Vema Channel, ultimately mixing with the underlying AABW. Therefore, these results indicate that the upper LCDW turns eastward after colliding with the southward flowing NADW. Our water mass analysis suggests an average northward flow of AABW across the SAMBA-W line. In agreement with this result, the velocity estimates from the PIES array also show an average northward flow of AABW between 47.5\u00b0W and 44.5\u00b0W during 2009-2014 (Meinen et al., 2017). By contrast, if these estimates are averaged over the 2012-2014 time span, the AABW flow is southward in the offshore portion of the SAMBA-W line. Bottom track velocities derived from the LADCP measurements show the AABW flow close to the bottom (~100-120 m above the seafloor) switching between a northeastward to a southwestward direction between realizations (not shown). These opposite results thus suggest that the meridional flow of AABW may reverse and stress the importance of collecting long-term absolute velocity measurement in the abyssal layers.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans noticeable difference associated with a seasonal cycle. Therefore, we do not attempt to thoroughly study any aspects of the seasonality of the standard deviations in what follows. In addition, because changes in the AABW are just above the measurement accuracy levels, a more thorough analysis for this layer is left to a future study. The time-mean salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration profiles along with their standard deviations for the upper portion of the water column are presented in Figure 10. The largest \u03b8, S, and O 2 standard deviations are observed in the TW core and its interface with the SACW (25.60 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 26.50 kg/m 3 ; see also Table 3). The standard deviation profiles also show that the variability in this density range is generally higher at both ends of the SAMBA-W line. Close to the continental slope, at 51.5\u00b0W (green line in Figures 10a and 10b), the high standard deviation in salinity at \u03b3 < 25.70 kg/m 3 is due to the difference between the significantly warm and salty TW advected southward by the BC during the austral summer and the relatively fresher waters observed during winter time. On the other hand, the largest temperature and salinity changes at the eastern end of the section (44.5\u00b0W, black line in Figures 10c and 10d; \u03b3~26.00 kg/m 3 ) are associated with the presence of the relatively cold and fresh subantarctic waters. This also explains why the lightest fraction of the TW (\u03b3 < 26.00 kg/m 3 ) is on average 0.3 fresher at 44.5\u00b0W than at 51.5\u00b0W. By contrast, the lower half of the SACW (26.60 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 27.10 kg/m 3 ) is characterized by a band of low variability in \u03b8, S, and O 2 at all four selected longitudes along the SAMBA-W line (Figures 3d-3f and 10). Indeed, the standard deviation in this density range is about half of that observed in the overlying layers (Table 3). These denser SACW are too deep to be influenced by deep winter convection associated with mode water formation (Sato & Polito, 2014). The time-mean and standard deviation of S and O 2 at the intermediate levels at each selected longitude along the SAMBA-W line are presented in Figure 11. The highest variability is observed at the core of the AAIW at 51.5\u00b0W and 49.5\u00b0W (see also Figures 3a and 3b and Table 3). Inspection of the individual hydrographic sections shows the occurrence of events when anomalously fresh and highly oxygenated AAIW in the 27.20 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 27.40 kg/m 3 range are found in this portion of the section. Compare, for example, \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans two CTD stations occupied at 49.5\u00b0W during SAM04 (December 2010) and SAM05 (July 2011; black thin lines in Figures 11a and 11b). The freshest and most oxygenated variety of AAIW (S < 34.2, O 2 > 270 \u03bcmol/kg at \u03b3~27.25 kg/m 3 ) was observed during the latter occupation, whereas an eroded AAIW was found during the former cruise (S > 34.3, O 2 < 230 \u03bcmol/kg at \u03b3 = 27.30 kg/m 3 ). By contrast, the properties of the relatively low salinity and oxygen-rich variety of AAIW observed offshore from the BC, at 47.5\u00b0W and 44.5\u00b0W, are significantly less variable (Figures 11c and 11d and Table 3). Below the AAIW core, the AAIW/UCDW interface is characterized by a band of minimum variability throughout the entire SAMBA-W line, except over the continental slope. The \u03b8, S, and O 2 standard deviations at 49.5\u00b0W, 47.5\u00b0W, and 44.5\u00b0W in the 27.55 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 27.65 kg/m 3 range are approximately a third of that at the AAIW core, whereas these values are significantly larger at 51.5\u00b0W (Table 3). The time-mean and standard deviation of S and O 2 at the deep and abyssal levels at 49.5\u00b0W and 44.5\u00b0W are presented in Figure 12. The variability at the NADW layer increases toward the eastern end of the SAMBA-W line (Figures 3d-3f). As discussed above, the offshore portion of the section is generally occupied by eroded, older NADW, and thus, the salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration at its core is on average lower at 44.5\u00b0W than at 49.5\u00b0W (black and red curves, Figure 12). However, more pristine (higher S and O 2 ) varieties of NADW are sporadically observed circulating in this region, thus generating higher variability there. For example, in the 27.95 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.05 kg/m 3 range, the S standard deviation is 0.022 at 49.5\u00b0W and 0.034 at 44.5\u00b0W (Table 3). To illustrate these types of events, two CTD profiles collected at 44.5\u00b0W SAM04 (December 2010) and SAM08 (December 2012) are also plotted in Figure 12 (blue lines). Note the marked difference between the less eroded core of NADW observed in 2010 compared to that found in 2012. The former presents higher salinity (S > 34.9) and dissolved oxygen concentrations (O 2 > 250 \u03bcmol/kg), clearly indicating the presence of younger NADW at the eastern end of the section, whereas the latter is significantly fresher (S~34.875), less oxygenated (O 2~2 35 \u03bcmol/kg) and presents ubiquitous small-scale interleaving, characteristic of the recirculated variety of NADW. Within the BC offshore recirculation, variations in salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 200 m are consistent with the energetic mesoscale activity that characterizes the region (Figure 1b). \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans Property variations could be introduced by the presence of relatively cold, fresh, and oxygen-rich subantarctic waters advected by migrating eddies detached from the BMC. The other logical possible source for low-salinity surface waters in the region, river outflow from the R\u00edo de la Plata, can be excluded as a possibility through analysis of the observed temperature and salinities. Admixtures of TW and Rio de la Plata waters have only been found west of~51.5\u00b0W. This is in agreement with results of Guerrero et al. (2014), who showed that R\u00edo de la Plata low-salinity waters do not extend offshore of~51\u00b0W in the vicinity of SAMBA-W. Interannual variability in the BC offshore recirculation may also be associated with the formation of STMW during winter, which is in turn associated with variability of air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes. As discussed in section 4.1, the STMW is advected northward from the formation region to these latitudes by BC offshore recirculation. By contrast, the SACW is characterized by a band of minimum standard deviation, particularly for waters denser than 26.7 kg/m 3 . This suggests that the mesoscale activity associated with the BC does not introduce significant water property variability on density surfaces due to the well-mixed nature of the recirculated SACW. At intermediate levels, high variability of AAIW is observed beneath the main southward flow associated to the BC as a consequence of the sporadic presence of lenses of pristine AAIW. Because these younger waters are generally found in the eastern portion of the section, this suggests that the intermediate level is also characterized by mesoscale features such as those previously mentioned. The presence of pristine AAIW at the western end of the SAMBA-W line could also be associated with inversions of the intermediate flow. For example, Preu et al. (2013) found evidence of northward penetrations of young AAIW along the slope as far north as~31\u00b0S on the basis of historical hydrographic data. According to the authors, this may also have an impact on the sediment dynamics in those regions where the AAIW is associated with the near-bottom flow. Although velocity time series derived from the PIES data between 51.5\u00b0W and 49.5\u00b0W do not show flow reversals beneath the BC, this may be because the PIES velocities represent averages over very large horizontal distances of 90-270 km (Meinen et al., 2012(Meinen et al., , 2017. The AAIW/UCDW interface is characterized by a band of low variability except over the shelf break, where the interaction with the bottom topography generates local variations. The low variability band suggests a large mixing rate between the two water masses, further supporting the hypothesis that the AAIW and the UCDW share a similar circulation scheme in the western part of the basin. The intensified variability observed in the deep layers at the eastern end of the SAMBA-W line suggests an energetically meandering DWBC that generates occasional excursions of recently formed NADW away from the continental slope. These property variations are consistent with the strong absolute transport variability observed between 47.5 and 44.5\u00b0S, which results in large southward and northward transport anomalies in the offshore portion of the SAMBA-W line (Meinen et al., 2012 \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans variations with westward migrating vortices that superimpose on the DWBC and modulate the intensity and sign of the flow in the western portion of the SAMBA-W line. Such vortices could effectively advect the more pristine NADW offshore, as well as inject the recirculated varieties closer to the slope, which is also occasionally observed in some SAMBA-W occupations. Beneath the NADW, the LCDW layer also exhibits high water property variability in the eastern end of the section (Figures 11e and 11f and Table 3). A plausible mechanism for introducing such variability could be the passage of deep eddies detaching from the MC in the Southwest Argentine Basin such as those reported by Gordon and Greengrove (1986a) and Arhan et al. (2002). These eddies could effectively introduce variability by short-circuiting the northward LCDW flow from the Malvinas Escarpment, advecting younger LCDW (i.e., colder and less oxygenated) more effectively to 34.5\u00b0S.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans agreement with the average geostrophic velocity as estimated from the PIES as well as numerical models (Meinen et al., 2017) for the period 2009-2014 (their Figures 2a and 2b). The inferred pathways are summarized in the schematic diagram presented in Figure 13. The upper level circulation is composed of TW and SACW. Both water masses flow southward with the BC close to the continental slope, undergo significant mixing with waters of subantarctic origin at the Brazil-Malvinas front, and recirculate northward across the SAMBA-W line east of~49.5\u00b0W (Figure 13, pathway 1). This pathway is in general agreement with the mean satellite sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity fields (not shown). The properties of the intermediate level waters in the western boundary display a previously undetected recirculation cell superimposed on the well-known pathway beneath the subtropical gyre across the South Atlantic. This pathway resembles that initially proposed by Wust (1935), in which a portion of the recently formed AAIW flows northward along the western boundary. Our results, however, indicate that this northward flow is located about 400-600 km east of the slope. After bifurcating at~27\u00b0S, the \"old\" AAIW flows southward underneath the BC as an IWBC and crosses the SAMBA-W line close to the shelf break ( Figure 13, pathway 2). Mixing with more pristine AAIW varieties, which were advected northward from the Drake Passage by the MC, occurs in the BMC. From the BMC the recirculated AAIW returns equatorward below BC offshore recirculation. Argo data collected between 27\u00b0S and 34.5\u00b0S show an overall north-to-south salinity decrease in this latitude range, therefore indicating that not only does the recirculation cell extend as far north as the Santos Bifurcation but that the newly formed AAIW leaks into the southward flowing branch below the BC. The water mass analysis yields a similar circulation scheme for the UCDW (Figure 13, pathway 3). The more \"pristine\" varieties of UCDW are also found in the offshore portion of the SAMBA-W line, whereas the lower portion of this density range is occupied by a warm and light variety of NADW close to the slope. At the deep levels, the difference between the more recently formed NADW observed close to the continental slope and the more diluted varieties located farther offshore indicates the presence of a DWBC flowing parallel to the continental slope across the SAMBA-W line. Our water mass analysis as well as our LADCP measurements indicate that more pristine NADW flows southward west of~49.5\u00b0W, and diluted varieties recirculate northward through the offshore portion of the section. This is in good agreement with the multiyear time series observations from Meinen et al. (2012) and Meinen et al. (2017). Additionally, given that the eroded, recirculated variety of NADW found at the SAMBA-W line is not observed at 30\u00b0S, it must flow eastward into the interior of the basin somewhere between these latitudes ( Figure 13, pathway 4). Further investigation is required to determine exactly how the \"young\" NADW is modified into the eroded form that we observe in the offshore portion of the SAMBA-W line. Previous studies have shown that intense CDW-NADW mixing, causing the strongest circumpolar transformation of CDW, occurs in the southwestern Argentine Basin (Georgi, 1981b). No recirculations are inferred in the abyssal layers from our water mass analysis. However, further analysis using direct velocity measurements must be conducted to fully determine the average sense of the flow. The upper portion of the LCDW (28.10 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.22 kg/m 3 ) flows northward across 34.5\u00b0S and is almost absent north of this latitude. As a result, a well-defined deep front separates the NADW to the north from the LCDW to the south, therefore suggesting that the major part of LCDW veers eastward after colliding with the southward flowing NADW in the vicinity of the SAMBA-W line (Figure 13, pathway 5). Denser LCDW and AABW at \u03b3 > 28.22 kg/m 3 are observed at 27\u00b0S and 13\u00b0S with overall similarity to that observed at 34.5\u00b0S, thus indicating that the waters within this density range cross the SAMBA-W line are not blocked by the NADW (Figure 13, pathway 6). The recirculations documented in this paper may have an important role in the meridional volume transport associated with the South Atlantic MOC, for example, by modifying the density field in the upper levels. The role of the above described recirculations on the large scale net volume, fresh water, and heat transport at the upper, intermediate and deep levels will be further investigated in a subsequent study combining historical CTD and Argo data with numerical model results."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "As part of the SAMOC initiative (www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/SAMOC_international), six Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) sections were occupied along the SAMBA-W line between July 2009 and December 2012 using two different research vessels (Table 1). Five occupations were completed using the R/V Puerto Deseado, and one (SAM08) using the R/V Alpha-Crucis. Full-depth CTD profiles are available for all occupations (the station locations are shown in Figure 1c). High-quality, quasi-continuous profiles of temperature (T), salinity (S), and dissolved oxygen concentration (O 2 ) were collected and subsampled at 1 dbar intervals at every station together with up to 24 bottle samples for calibration. CTD measurements were collected using SBE 3plus and SBE 3-02/F temperature, SBE 4C and SBE 4-02/O conductivity, and SBE 43 oxygen sensors attached to a SBE 9/11+ CTD. The conductivity of each bottle sample was determined using Guildline AUTOSAL salinometers from which bottle salinity was derived with an uncertainty of \u00b10.003. CTD salinity data were then calibrated against bottle samples, and an uncertainty of \u00b10.003 was estimated for the final calibrated CTD salinity measurements. Likewise, the dissolved oxygen concentration of each bottle sample was determined with the Winkler titration method (Langdon, 2010), and CTD oxygen data were calibrated against the bottle samples. An uncertainty of \u00b15 \u03bcmol/kg was estimated for the final CTD oxygen measurements. Because there were no oxygen water samples collected during SAM02, oxygen data from this cruise were excluded from the analysis. In addition, a Teledyne RD Instruments 300 kHz Workhorse Monitor lowered-Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) was deployed together with the rosette multisampler during the SAM05 and SAM07 cruises (Table 1). Delayed mode Argo pressure (P), T and S profiles collected from 2003 to December 2016 within the region bounded by 34\u00b0S, 35\u00b0S, 44.5\u00b0W and the shelf break ( Figure 1c) were combined with the above indicated CTD data to prepare mean salinity and potential temperature sections presented in section 4.1. All available Argo profiles were used instead of limiting to the 2009-2012 time window when the CTD sections along the SAMBA-W line were occupied in order to increase the number of available Argo profiles. Additional Argo data were used to determine the thermohaline properties close to the western boundary north of the SAMBA-W line (blue box in Figure 1b). The Argo data were obtained from the U.S. NODC World Ocean Database 2013 available at http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html (Boyer et al., 2013). All profiles with a WOD Quality Flag higher than 2 were excluded from the analysis. The remaining profiles were visually inspected and compared with the CTD data set collected at SAMBA-W to detect any noticeable sensor drifts or offsets. Additional historical hydrographic data were used to investigate the properties of the water masses at the western boundary of the South Atlantic north and south of the SAMBA-W line as presented in section 4.1 ( Table 2). The CTD data across the Malvinas Escarpment between~51 and~45\u00b0S correspond to the WOCE line A17 and were obtained from the CITHER-2 project archive (M\u00e9mery et al., 1995), as well as the data along the section near 13\u00b0S (M\u00e9mery et al., 1995). The CTD data at the western edge of the Santos Basin near 30\u00b0S correspond to two CLIVAR A10 occupations in 2003 and 2011 (Uchida et al., 2005;Wanninkhof et al., 2013).

Also shown are the EKE and the mean absolute dynamic topography (ADT) for the period 1993-2016 ( Figure 1b). The mean EKE was computed from surface geostrophic velocities with a horizontal resolution of 1/4\u00b0produced and distributed by E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (product identifier SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_-REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_047). The mean ADT (i.e., sea surface height above geoid) was downloaded from AVISO (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The mean vertical sections presented in section 4.1 are prepared by linearly interpolating the CTD and Argo profiles onto a regular density grid using neutral density (\u03b3; Jackett & McDougall, 1997) as the vertical coordinate, which is computed using the \"GAMMA-N\" \u03b3 package version 3.1 for Matlab. The data are interpolated along 34.5\u00b0S at \u03b3 intervals of 0.02 kg/m 3 for 25.00 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 27.60 kg/m 3 and 0.005 kg/m 3 for 27.60 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.29 kg/m 3 and at distance intervals of 49 km. The distance origin is set at (51.5\u00b0W, 34.5\u00b0S), where the section changes orientation from zonal to southeast-northwest (site A, Figure 1c). Before gridding, Argo profiles within the selected region were projected onto 34.5\u00b0S following the mean orientation of the shelf-break (~43.5\u00b0T). Diluted waters from the R\u00edo de la Plata occasionally occupy the upper~50 m of the southern Brazil outer shelf and shelf break, extending as far north as 28\u00b0S during fall-winter and spreading farther offshore in spring-summer (Piola et al., 2000). The variability introduced by these low salinity waters is beyond the scope of this study. Thus, data exhibiting these waters are excluded from the analysis by removing the upper 50 dbar of all CTD and Argo profiles with S < 35. The neutral density boundaries used to delimit each water mass layer are determined based on water mass properties criteria similar to those adopted by Preu et al. (2013), except that only neutral density criteria are applied in this paper. The boundary between the Tropical Water (TW) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) was defined as the neutral density at the zonally averaged 16\u00b0C isotherm. The neutral density ranges assigned to each water mass layer are detailed in Table 2. Constant neutral density contours are plotted in every \u03b8-S diagram for reference. The selected \u03b3 contours are computed by fitting a quadratic function (i.e., \u03b8 as a function of S) to the data used in each diagram. To study the hydrographic conditions in the intermediate layers near the western boundary between the SAMBA-W line and the Santos Bifurcation (~27\u00b0S), 325 Argo profiles collected within 250 km of the 200 m isobath in the cross-shore direction are inspected (blue box in Figure 1b). The profiles are sorted in three latitude bands, namely, 34.5-31.5\u00b0S, 31.5-29\u00b0S, and 29-27.5\u00b0S. The mean \u03b8-S distribution for each band is computed by averaging the observed salinities within 0.1\u00b0C potential temperature bins. The salinity standard deviation for each \u03b8 bin is also computed. The temporal variability of the water mass properties is presented in section 4.2. Changes are investigated along neutral density surfaces in order to minimize the dynamic heaving effect associated with mesoscale and higher frequency features, such as the passage of eddies or internal waves. The standard deviation sections of \u03b8, S, and O 2 are computed relative to the section mean by first gridding each separate hydrographic section as described above using only CTD data and then computing the standard deviation for each grid element relative to its mean value. The spatiotemporal structure of the water masses is further analyzed at four longitudes along the SAMBA-W line, which correspond to the locations of the PIES moorings (red circles in Figure 1c). For calibration purposes a CTD profile was collected at each of the PIES locations in all cruises, thus providing the best temporal coverage at these sites. For each of these four locations, all available P, \u03b8, S, and O 2 profiles are linearly interpolated onto the regular \u03b3 grid defined above and averaged and standard deviation profiles are then computed. The LADCP data are processed for horizontal velocity with the LDEO_IX implementation of the velocity inverse method (Visbeck, 2002) version 12. Due to the lack of shipboard ADCP measurements, only the ship drift measured with the GPS and the bottom tracking data (available for all profiles) were used to constrain "}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hydrographic Structure and General Circulation in the Vicinity of the SAMBA-W Line", "text": "As a consequence of the convergence of multiple water masses formed in different regions of the world ocean, the northwestern Argentine Basin is characterized by a highly complex hydrographic structure, which can be seen in the full-depth, high-resolution sections of \u03b8, S, and O 2 collected during the SAM07 cruise in July 2012 presented in Figure 2. These quasi-synoptic sections also reveal the presence of relatively intense mesoscale features passing through the SAMBA-W line, such as the cyclonic eddy centered at 46.5\u00b0W, which generates a significant doming of isopycnals. To complement the synoptic view of the hydrographic conditions along the SAMBA-W line, time-averaged sections including all CTD occupations and historical Argo profiles as detailed in section 2 are also presented in Figure 3. An average section of the alongshore component of the horizontal velocity derived from the LADCP measurements is also displayed to corroborate our findings regarding the main pathways of the water masses ( Figure 3d). The comparison between the snapshot and the time-averaged property sections reveals a structure that sustains over time (at least over the period of a few years when the observations were collected) despite the contrasting properties between adjacent layers. Indeed, the zonally averaged time-mean \u03b8-S and \u03b8-O 2 diagrams ( Figure 4) exhibit several inflection points, each representing distinct water masses formed at remote locations around the globe. From top to   "}, {"section_title": "Antarctic Intermediate Water", "text": "The relatively fresh and highly oxygenated AAIW is injected into the South Atlantic through two routes, one with the MC which is relatively colder and fresher (Piola & Gordon, 1989), and another from the Indian Ocean as part of the Agulhas/Benguela current system, which conveys a relatively warmer, saltier, and less oxygenated variety (Lutjeharms, 1996;Piola & Georgi, 1982;Talley, 1996;Figure 1a). Some of the AAIW sources may also enter the South Atlantic by subduction just south of the Subantarctic Front throughout the basin (Schmid, 2000). Near the western boundary, the AAIW flows poleward south of~27\u00b0S. This is confirmed by the offshore deepening of isopycnals over the shelf break along the SAMBA-W line, observed in both the synoptic and the averaged sections (<130 km; Figures 2 and 3), which sustains a southward geostrophic flow relative to the BC. The averaged salinity and the dissolved oxygen sections show an AAIW that is somewhat saltier and less oxygenated beneath the BC than farther offshore (Figures 3a-3c). Recall that the averaged sections include data from~300 Argo profiles collected in the vicinity of the SAMBA-W line during a 12-year span, hence suggesting that this asymmetry is a semipermanent feature of the AAIW layer in this region. To further investigate this structure, the averaged \u03b8-S and \u03b8-O 2 properties in the AAIW \u03b3 range at the four selected longitudes along the SAMBA-W line are presented in Figure 6. The core of AAIW (\u03b3 = 27.34 kg/m 3 ) at the two western locations, 51.5\u00b0W and 49.5\u00b0W, is saltier than 34.25 and exhibits oxygen concentrations lower than 250 \u03bcmol/kg, whereas it is~0.25\u00b0C colder, 0.02 fresher, and 10-15 \u03bcmol/kg higher in O 2 further east at 47.5\u00b0W and 44.5\u00b0W (colored curves in Figures 6a and 6b). Furthermore, the analysis of AAIW properties at the western boundary north and south of the SAMBA-W line shows that the waters found beneath the BC at 34.5\u00b0S are closer to those observed farther north near the Santos Bifurcation (S > 34.28, O 2 < 235 \u03bcmol/kg; gray circles in Figures 6a and 6b), whereas the waters observed offshore at 34.5\u00b0S resemble those found near the Malvinas Escarpment (S < 34.2, O 2 > 260 \u03bcmol/kg; black crosses in Figures 6a and 6b). To extend these results, we study the AAIW hydrographic structure at the western boundary between the SAMBA-W line and the Santos Bifurcation using Argo data as explained in section 3. Note that Argo profiles are limited to 250 km from the 200 m isobath so as to include only the saltier and less oxygenated variety of AAIW found onshore at the SAMBA-W line (Figures 3b and 3c). The results are presented in the inset in Figure 6a. An overall north-to-south salinity decrease is observed in the averaged Argo profiles. At 4.5\u00b0C, the salinity is on average 34.255 between 34.5\u00b0S and 31.5\u00b0S, 34.290 between 31.5\u00b0S and 29\u00b0S, and 34.320 at 29\u00b0S-27.5\u00b0S. Despite the difference in the number of averaged Argo profiles at the three latitude bands 10.1029/2018JC013907 Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans (167, 125, and 55, respectively), the significantly higher salinity standard deviation about \u03b8 at the 34.5\u00b0S-31.5\u00b0S range further suggests the presence of a wider range of AAIW varieties closer to the SAMBA-W line than is found farther north. Because the AAIW recirculating with the subtropical gyre is continually eroded by mixing with adjacent water masses (i.e., SACW and UCDW), thereby increasing its salinity and decreasing its oxygen concentration, the properties observed in the eastern half of the SAMBA-W line indicate the presence of more pristine varieties of AAIW from farther south. The source of these waters must be the more recently ventilated AAIW derived from the northern Drake Passage and advected northward along the Subantarctic Front by the MC, as indicated by the properties of the waters observed near the Malvinas Escarpment at this density range. Hence, we hypothesize that the old (lower in O 2 concentration), recirculated AAIW flowing south underneath the BC mixes with recently formed AAIW in the BMC and returns north below the BC offshore recirculation. The July 2012 snapshot ( Figure 2d) and the averaged ( Figure 3d) velocity sections are in agreement with this result, displaying a southwest flow of~10-15 cm/s west of 49\u00b0W and a weaker return flow farther offshore. Moreover, we suggest that this recirculation cell extends at least as far north as 27\u00b0S. This is confirmed by the Argo floats nearby the western boundary: the southward salinity decrease observed between the Santos Bifurcation and the SAMBA-W line can only be accounted for by a continuous injection of recently ventilated AAIW from the BMC."}, {"section_title": "Upper Circumpolar Deep Water", "text": "The UCDW is the upper branch of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), a large body of relatively fresh and oxygen-poor water within the Southern Ocean that arises from the mixing of upwelled NADW with waters circulating within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Reid et al., 1977). As CDW is reinjected into the South Atlantic along the western edge of the Argentine Basin within the MC, the southward flowing NADW, which shares a similar density range, splits it into an upper (UCDW) and a lower (LCDW) branch (M\u00e9mery et al., 2000;Reid et al., 1977). At the SAMBA-W line, however, the average isopycnal surfaces within the UCDW suggest a mean poleward flow at the western end as observed in the AAIW layer ( Figure 3). The potential temperature range within the UCDW at 34.5\u00b0S is relatively narrow (2.65\u00b0C < \u03b8 < 3.62\u00b0C), and the core is characterized by a sharp oxygen minimum (O 2~1 90 \u03bcmol/kg; Figure 4b and Table 2). Synoptic sections consistently show that the potential temperature and the dissolved oxygen concentration at the UCDW core monotonically decrease in the offshore direction at the SAMBA-W line (e.g., Figure 2). The average \u03b8-S and \u03b8-O 2 distributions at this latitude depicted in Figure 7 show that close to the slope (at 51.5\u00b0W), the upper fraction of UCDW Figure 6. Same as Figure 5 for the AAIW layer. The grey circles and black crosses in both panels are CTD profiles collected during the CLIVAR/WOCE A10 (~30\u00b0S) and CITHER-2 LEG 1 (WOCE A17, 45-48\u00b0S) sections, respectively. The inset in (a) shows the \u03b8-S distribution along the western boundary from Argo data at three selected latitude ranges: 34-31.5\u00b0S (blue), 31.5-29\u00b0S (black), and 29-27.5\u00b0S (red). The heavy lines (shading) are the profile averages (standard deviation). The red dashed rectangle in (a) indicates boundaries of the inset. See Figure 1 for CTD stations and Argo profiles location."}, {"section_title": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans", "text": "As it spreads away from the DWBC into the interior, the NADW mixes with adjacent water masses, thus becoming colder, fresher, and less oxygenated. As a result, observations at 13\u00b0S and 30\u00b0S show that recently ventilated NADW is found near the slope whereas older, eroded varieties are found farther offshore (Figure 8). However, at the SAMBA-W line, this difference is larger; that is, the NADW variety found offshore is significantly more eroded at 34.5\u00b0S than farther north, particularly at neutral densities higher than 28.01 kg/m 3 (Figure 8a). There are two potential pathways that could explain these observations:( i) the diluted NADW found east of~43\u00b0W at 27\u00b0S flows southward across this latitude and reaches 34.5\u00b0S intensifying its erosion rate as it mixes with the more concentrated UCDW and LCDW located in the vicinity of the SAMBA-W line and (ii) there is a recirculation cell, which conveys a diluted variety of NADW from south of the SAMBA-W line. The latter hypothesis has been also suggested by Meinen et al. (2012) on the basis of oxygen measurements from the SAM05 cruise (July 2011). More recently, Meinen et al. (2017) used PIES measurements collected between 2009 and 2014 to show that the DWBC east of 49.5\u00b0W has on average a northward component across the SAMBA-W line. The weak upward slope in the offshore direction of the time-averaged isopycnals east of 47\u00b0W provides further evidence supporting this hypothesis (Figure 3). Direct velocity measurements from LADCP show a southwestward flow against the slope reaching an average maximum of 15 cm/s at 49\u00b0W and a somewhat weaker return flow of 5-10 cm/s in the vicinity of 47\u00b0W (Figures 2d and 3d). We therefore accept the second pathway as the most likely for the recirculated NADW. The NADW found in the offshore portion of the SAMBA-W line is overall more eroded than that found at 30\u00b0S (black line and grey circles in Figure 8a, respectively), particularly at \u03b3 > 28.01 kg/m 3 , meaning that the recirculated NADW flowing northward across the SAMBA-W line could not feed the diluted varieties found at 30\u00b0S. This observation suggests that the recirculated NADW flowing northward across 34.5\u00b0S must be driven away from the western boundary toward the interior of the basin between 34.5 and 30\u00b0S. This eastward spreading is in agreement with the numerical model analysis of van Sebille et al. 2012, who found 1 Sv of NADW crossing eastward along a quasi-zonal secondary pathway at 32\u00b0S. 4.1.6. Lower Circumpolar Deep Water/Antarctic Bottom Water Beneath the NADW, the abyssal layer at the SAMBA-W line is occupied by LCDW and AABW. The coldest and densest water mass is the AABW, which is mainly composed of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). This is the youngest abyssal water mass escaping the Southern Ocean (Orsi et al., 1999), hence its relatively high oxygen (O 2 > 225 \u03bcmol/kg, Figure 4b). The Antarctic origin of the AABW explains its cold nature, which is the reason why the 0\u00b0C isotherm is a commonly used criterion to separate AABW from LCDW (Georgi, 1981a;Preu et al., 2013). Indeed, the \u03b3 = 28.27 kg/m 3 isopycnal closely follows the 0\u00b0C isotherm along the SAMBA-W line (e.g., Figure 2). The overlying LCDW is on average more oxygenated than the UCDW (\u03b8 = 0.7\u00b0C, O 2~2 15 \u03bcmol/kg; Figure 4) due to mixing with the WSDW. Unlike in the overlying layers, the properties in the LCDW/AABW density range (\u03b3 > 28.10 kg/m 3 ) are largely homogeneous along the SAMBA-W line (Figures 2 and 3), which suggests the absence of opposing flows near the western boundary at this latitude. In what follows, we will evaluate how the LCDW and the AABW are modified as they are spread into the South Atlantic from the Malvinas Escarpment downstream to the northern Argentine Basin across the SAMBA-W line. As indicated by Arhan et al. (1999), individual CTD profiles collected near the slope at~48\u00b0S show LCDW flowing northward with the deep MC (~2,600-4,400 m). The influence of NADW in this region is minor and restricted to waters with \u03b8 > 1.20\u00b0C (black crosses in Figure 9a). These observations show a relatively fresh layer between 0.90\u00b0C < \u03b8 < 1.80\u00b0C, which is characterized by constant salinity (S~34.72). Immediately above this layer, the potential temperature decreases and the salinity increases monotonically with greater depth between 27.60 kg/m 3 < \u03b3 < 28.01 kg/m 3 , thus indicating a direct mixture of LCDW and UCDW in this density range (Figures 7a and 8a). The absence of NADW is also evident in the \u03b8-O 2 relationship, where oxygen decreases upward linearly with increasing temperature from the relatively high AABW values (\u03b8~\u00c00.15\u00b0C, O 2~2 25 \u03bcmol/kg, Figure 9b) to a minimum at the UCDW core (\u03b8~2.20\u00b0C, O 2~1 70 \u03bcmol/kg, Figure 8b). By contrast, the LCDW is capped by NADW farther offshore, causing a monotonic salinity increase at \u03b8 > 0.7\u00b0C and an oxygen minimum at \u03b8~1.30\u00b0C (grey crosses in Figures 9a and 9b). Along the SAMBA-W line, the oxygen minimum associated with LCDW at the three selected longitudes is on average higher and colder (\u03b8~0.75\u00b0C, O 2~2 16 \u03bcmol/kg) than across the Malvinas Escarpment, thus indicating substantial erosion by diapycnal mixing as well as isopycnal mixing with NADW in an equal density range as these waters flow along the western boundary of the Argentine Basin. 10.1029/2018JC013907\nAt 30\u00b0S there is no trace of LCDW at \u03b3 < 28.22 kg/m 3 (\u03b8 > 0.4\u00b0C) except for an individual CTD profile collected at the Vema Channel (~39.4\u00b0W) during the 2011 WOCE A10 section. This profile reveals the presence of LCDW somewhat saltier than those found at the SAMBA-W line but with very similar O 2 concentrations at \u03b8 < 0.9\u00b0C (green line in Figure 9). Except for this individual profile, there is an indication of direct mixing between lNADW (\u03b8~2.0\u00b0C, O 2~2 50 \u03bcmol/kg) and the densest portion of LCDW (\u03b8 < 0.4\u00b0C, O 2 < 220 \u03bcmol/kg), manifested by a monotonic temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration decreasing with greater depth. At \u03b8 < 0.4\u00b0C, however, the oxygen concentration is similar to that observed at the SAMBA-W line. An inflection in the \u03b8-O 2 curve at \u03b8~0.2\u00b0C, O 2~1 85 \u03bcmol/kg further suggests mixing with the underlying AABW at 30\u00b0S (grey circles, inset in Figure 9b). The oxygen concentrations at \u03b8 < 0.050\u00b0C are similar to those observed at the Malvinas Escarpment (~220 \u03bcmol/kg). However, the O 2 in this temperature range is on average~3-5 \u03bcmol/kg higher at the SAMBA-W line. This is caused by three anomalous profiles collected during the SAM05 and SAM07 cruises. Only two bottle samples within the AABW are available to verify these values. Unfortunately, the differences between the CTD measurements and the bottle samples are too large (15 and 5 \u03bcmol/kg) to determine if these casts reveal a real increase in dissolved oxygen concentration in AABW in recent years. Farther north, observations show no trace of LCDW as well. A significantly warmer and saltier variety of AABW is found at 13\u00b0S (0.040 < \u03b8 < 0.075, 34.685 < S < 34.698; inset in Figure 9a), and the absence of inflections in the \u03b8-O 2 curve further suggests an admixture of lNADW and AABW at \u03b3 > 28.1 kg/m 3 , without the presence of LCDW at all. LCDW and AABW spread into the Argentine Basin from the Drake Passage and around the South Sandwich Trench closely following the western edge of the basin as a DWBC beneath the deep MC (Georgi, 1981a;Reid, 1989; Figure 1a). Based on hydrographic observations, Coles et al. (1996) have suggested a bifurcation of the abyssal flow at the BMC, with a branch flowing northward along the western boundary and the other branch recirculating poleward through the interior of the basin. The latter branch somewhat resembles the flow of the MC, which retroflects southward at the BMC. This is consistent with the hydrographic observations collected near the Malvinas Escarpment, which show more pristine LCDW near the slope and a diluted variety farther offshore (Figure 9). Previous studies (Georgi, 1981a;Speer & Zenk, 1993) indicate a cyclonic circulation of LCDW and AABW in the northwest Argentine Basin, that is, northeastward across the SAMBA-W line. In agreement with observations from Reid et al. (1977), the time-mean isopycnal surfaces in the SAMBA-W line slope upward toward the west (Figure 3), also suggesting a downward increase of the northward flow. The Figure 9. Same as Figure 5 for the LCDW/AABW layer.

The sections of the standard deviation of \u03b8, S, and O 2 relative to the time averages yield a comprehensive view of the temporal variability of the water mass properties (Figures 3d-3f). To further study the zonal structure of this variability, the standard deviation of \u03b8, S, and O 2 relative to the average profiles at four selected longitudes is computed as explained in section 2. To effectively remove local sources of variability, such as evaporation/precipitation or the passage of synoptic weather systems, property changes in the upper 50 m are excluded from the analysis. The results are focused on neutral density layers and presented in Table 3. Because only two austral spring/summer sections are available, it is not possible to isolate and study the seasonal variability of the water mass properties with CTD sections only. We explored all the Argo data collected in the vicinity of the SAMBA-W line to further analyze a potential seasonal signal. However, we found that due to the uneven spatial and temporal distribution and the nonsynoptic nature of these data, the variability among profiles collected within an individual season is higher than any  7Note.
