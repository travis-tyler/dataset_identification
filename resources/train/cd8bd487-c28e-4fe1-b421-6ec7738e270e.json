[{"section_title": "", "text": "He introduced Procustes analysis and the invariant quotient metric to equip the shape space with a metric and a measure.\nTimothy F. Cootes and co-workers introduced the active shape models, ignoring the intrinsic curvature of the space of Procustes-aligned shapes, used linear statistics and thereby made computations straightforward. This has had a immense impact on the computational modeling with now close to 5,000 citations.\nMuch work has followed these contributions in creating shape spaces equipped with (invariant) metrics, using transformations to align shapes, equipping the group of transformations with metrics, etc. and to reformulate mathematical theories in a computational tractable manner.\nThis special issue follows this line of research. Five papers have been included in this special issue. Of these, three papers deal with diffeomorphic mappings and metric constructions of these (originating from the Large Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework), one with a novel shape descriptor, and one with making statistics in curved spaces.\nThe paper by Lorenzi et al. \"Geodesics, parallel transport & one-parameter subgroups for diffeomorphic image registration\" underpin the mathematical rigor of using the oneparameter sub-groups of the LDDMM framework. These stationary velocity fields show to be of good approximation to the LDDMM for smaller deformations while larger intersubject registrations have substantially different geodesics than the full LDDMM implementations.\nThe paper by G\u00fcnther et al. \"Flexible shape matching with finite element based LDDMM\" decouples the current and deformation discretization by using conforming adaptive finite elemts. This leads to more flexibility in the formulation as illustrated for example by incorporating multiple scales.\nThe paper by Modin et al. \"Geodesic warps by conformal mappings\" studies the shape equivalence under planar conformal mappings. The space of planar conformal mappings is equipped with a metric and a numerical discretization is developed. Computational examples are illustrated on artificial examples.\nThe paper by Zeng et al. \"Teichm\u00fcller shape descriptor and its application to Alzheimer's disease study\" studies the family of non-intersecting closed 3D curves. It is applied to MRI data form the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) distinguishing normal controls from Alzheimer's patients by the shape of the cortical surface. The Teichm\u00fcller space is a quotient space of conformal mappings; two surfaces in between which a conformal mapping exists have the same representation in Teichm\u00fcller shape space. The space is equipped with a metric. By solving a Ricci flow, the Teichm\u00fcller representation may be found.\nThe paper by Fletcher et al. \"Geodesic regression and the theory of least squares on Riemannian manifolds\" introduces the geodesic regression as a mapping between a real-valued parameter to be regressed to a manifold-valued dependent random variable. The key idea is that regressed curves must be geodesics on the manifold. Existence, uniqueness, and maximum likelihood criteria are developed. Also here brain shape is analyzed: the relation of the shape of corpus callosum to age.\nAll these are aspects of the fundamental property that shapes do not live in Euclidean space. Since the pioneering work of D'Arcy Thomson equaling shapes by transformations, David Kendall showing that shapes represented as labeled landmarks live in complex projective spaces, and Timothy Cootes reformulating this in a computational simple manner, the work has continued developing representations and appropriate metrics to allow for statistical modeling. This special issue continues this development bridging statistics, geometry, and computational science."}]
