[{"section_title": "", "text": "Since January 2003, the ERS has estimated the monthly state level milk cost of production for Vermont and other selected states in the country. Since the inception of Public Act 09-229 the Connecticut Commissioner of Agriculture has used the Vermont cost of production to determine if assistance should be provided to Connecticut milk producers. However, questions have arisen about the validity of monthly state level estimates using the current USDA methodology and thus effective January 2011, monthly state level milk cost of production is no longer estimated. 1 The lack of cost estimates for use by the Commissioner of The ideal estimates that one would provide to the Commissioner of Agriculture would be based on the monthly cost of production for Connecticut dairy farmers. Unfortunately there exists no USDA data or variables that can estimate this cost for Connecticut. Given these constraints, it has been agreed upon that the estimates to be provided are based on the Vermont monthly cost of production using the existing USDA methodology. This report presents the current USDA methodology and continues the Vermont milk cost of production estimates previously calculated by the ERS. This report does not address concerns about the validity of this methodology and the authors do not endorse the long-term continued use of these estimates. Beyond 2011, it is recommended that an alternative methodology for calculating the monthly milk cost of production be considered specifically based on Connecticut dairy farms."}, {"section_title": "II. Methodology and Data", "text": "The methodology used to calculate the monthly milk cost of production for selected individual states was established by the USDA and implemented by the ERS since January 2006. While the USDA no longer estimates state level cost of production, it is possible to use their established methodology and available data to continue to calculate the cost of production for 2011. The data and variables used to estimate the monthly milk cost of production are detailed in Table 1.  It is important to note that data published by NASS is often revised in subsequent months as new information used to create these estimates becomes available. Data revisions are most reliably obtained from the NASS statistics database. Collecting these data at the latest possible time provides for the most up-to-date estimate of the cost of production. Due to the timing that the Commissioner of Agriculture needs to use the monthly cost of production estimates, it is best to collect the data for the previous quarter one month following the end of the quarter, i.e. the end of July or beginning of August for Quarter 2. All data used in this report was collected from the NASS statistics database on August 2, 2011. The methodology for calculating the cost of production uses three main variable categories from the ARMS and NASS reports. The ARMS is used to compute an annual milk production cost for selected states, including Vermont, for each year from 2005 to 2010. This production cost is broken down by the components of the cost of production, which include operating costs, allocated overhead, and their respective subcategory costs. Operating costs include feed, veterinary and medicine, bedding and litter, marketing, custom service, fuel, repairs, and other operating related costs as detailed in Table 1. Allocated overhead, also  Table 1, includes costs associated with hired labor, opportunity costs of unpaid labor and land, capital recovery, taxes and insurance, and general overhead. Each of these cost components also have associated NASS prices paid indexes from the Agricultural Prices report. A complete list of equations used to calculate the monthly cost of production is included in Appendix A."}, {"section_title": "III. Monthly Cost of Production and Related Uniform Pricing for Quarter 2, 2011", "text": "The estimates for the April, May, and June 2011 milk cost of production for Vermont are shown in Table 2. 1/ Estimates may be adjusted based on revisions in monthly agricultural price indices and milk production estimates as provided by the USDA. Source: Based on USDA's 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey of milk producers and updated using current USDA milk production per cow and production input indexes. See http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/CostsAndReturns/monthlymilkcosts.htm for methodology. The total cost is broken down into two main categories: operating costs and allocated overhead. The operating costs for April, May, and June 2011 are $13.00, $13.46, and $13.78/cwt., respectively. The major component of operating costs is the total feed costs of $9.20, $9.64, and $9.94/cwt., respectively. With the exception of the feed cost categories, there is very little variation within cost categories from month to month. Allocated overhead during these three months are $10.25, $10.26, and $10.36/cwt. for April, May, and June, respectively. Very little monthly changes in costs occur within allocated overhead cost categories. The total milk cost of production is $23.25 for April, $23.71 for May, and $24.14/cwt. for June. The average of these three months, i.e. the quarter two average cost of production, is thus $23.70/cwt. Public Act 09-229 specifies the minimum sustainable monthly cost of production as eighty-two percent of the monthly average cost of production. Eighty-two percent of the milk cost of production is $19.07 for April, $19.45 for May, and $19.80/cwt for June. The average of these three months is $19.44/cwt. For comparison purposes, the statistical uniform prices (i.e. blend price) for Hartford, CT for the second quarter of 2011 are $20.28 for April, $20.69 for May, and $21.99/cwt for June, all higher than the minimum sustainable monthly cost of production. The difference between the uniform prices and the eighty-two percent minimum sustainable monthly cost of production is $1.21 for April, $1.24 for May, and $2.19/cwt for June. This represents an average statistical uniform price of $1.55/cwt higher than the minimum sustainable monthly cost of production. The uniform prices that farmers are receiving during the second quarter of 2011 are historically high (above $20/cwt) and were seen before only during the second half of 2007 and the months of January and July 2008. With uniform prices above the cost of production no payment to farmers takes place, a situation that is currently common for other federal crop subsidy programs. 3"}, {"section_title": "IV. Concluding Remarks", "text": "At the request of the Connecticut Commissioner of Agriculture we have estimated the monthly milk cost of production for Vermont using the established USDA methodology and available USDA data. While we provide such estimates in this report for the second quarter of 2011, and will continue to do so for the remainder of 2011, it is recommended that the Commissioner of Agriculture consider pursuing monthly estimates for the milk cost of production based on Connecticut surveys and a methodology to be developed for monthly adjustments."}]
