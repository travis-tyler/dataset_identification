In this context, an unsupervised Formal Concept Analysis method, based on Galois lattices, may be used to extract all logical relations, and limit over-fitting issues. 5 Systems biology is currently regarded as an exploration tool for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, that has the potential to discover new fundamental insights. While the current state of truly integrative systems-level semantic knowledge of preclinical AD is still in its infancy, when combined with valid and reliable biomarker discovery and validation, Systems biology will be a cornerstone for precision medicine. [6] [7] [8] Notably, since AD shows peripheral manifestations, it may serve as an ideal use-case for systems biology. Multiple systems are affected in AD, including systemic immune response and inflammation, 9, 10 renal and hepatic clearance, 11, 12 lipid and glucose metabolism, [13] [14] [15] and xenobiotics from gut microbiome. 16, 17 Moreover, intercellular communication systems-including the glymphatic system 18, 19 and extracellular vesicles 20, 21 -have been reported. The study of peripheral blood-an easily accessible, information-rich matrix in which these complex systems can be interrogated-is expected to expand our knowledge of the systems biology of AD. 22, 23 There are a growing number of studies investigating single omics levels (genomic/epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) of preclinical AD and many of these studies tell a consistent story within individual omic levels. Here, we attempt to concisely summarize the general convergent findings at each level. Since the initial identification of the \u03b54 allele of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE \u03b54) as a risk gene variant for AD, 24 numerous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses of GWAS have been performed. [25] [26] [27] Moreover, recent studies using whole-exome sequencing, "}, {"section_title": "Systems biology blood biomarkers in AD trials -Hampel et al", "text": "whole-genome sequencing, and targeted sequencing have led to the identification of rare variants in other novel lateonset AD genes. 26 Besides the three identified causal gene mutations (amyloid precursor protein [APP], presenilin 1 and 2 [PSEN1 and PSEN2]) for autosomal dominant earlyonset AD, more than 40 susceptibility genes/ loci have been identified for late-onset AD. 26 Most of these genes encode for functional pathways that are not obviously related to the primary amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau proteopathy. Accordingly, they are involved in orthogonal pathways such as immune response and inflammation (eg, ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 [ABCA7]), synaptic function (eg, Myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1 [BIN1]), and lipid metabolism (eg, phospholipase D3 [PLD3]). This list will surely be enlarged in the future as more genes/loci are discovered. For instance, a recent meta-analysis of AD on 9751 samples from Norway and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) identified four novel risk loci: heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-dulfotransferase 1 (HS3ST1), immunoglobulin heavy variable 1-68 pseudogene (IGHV1-68), USP6 N-terminal like (USP6NL)/enoyl-CoA hydratase domain containing 3 (ECHDC3), and benzodiazepine receptor associated protein 1 (BZRAP1-AS). 28 Transcriptomics involves the measurement and study of the complete set of RNA transcripts, produced by the genome, and affecting protein expression and other cellular operations. 29 Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) technology, using blood leukocytes, is a promising nextgeneration approach that has advantages for clinical trials. RNAseq is very efficient and has a broad range of detection. 30 Transcript expression goes beyond genome expression, reflecting state dependent demands on the organism, including long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and micro RNAs (miRNAs). Transcriptomic analysis can provide greater biological resolution viewed as coexpression networks 31 that may be more valid and reliable for measuring perturbations of AD-relevant metabolic pathways. 32 To date, transcriptomic studies in AD revealed alterations in lncRNA and miRNA expression reflecting aging and AD-related alterations in synaptic function, 33 neurovascular coupling, 34 immune response, 35 and energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. 36 Proteins are the key functional molecules in biological systems providing structural, functional, and regulatory control of cells, tissues, organs, apparatuses, and systems. Proteins change in response to the demands of the organism in real time and, as a result, the proteome is dynamic. While early attempts at measuring the key proteopathy of AD have been disappointing, 37 recent attempts using newer technologies have been more successful. 38 Accordingly, numerous studies showed consistent alterations of immune, 39 inflammatory, 40 neurotrophic, 41 and vascular-related proteins that may be promising candidates for proteomic blood biomarkers.\nThe metabolome consists of low-molecular weight compounds representing the end products of metabolism. With the advent of high-resolution mass spectrometry-based technologies over the past decade, numerous blood metabolomic AD markers have been reported, including those reflecting immune response, 42 neurotransmitter biosynthesis 43 lipid and energy metabolism, 44 and oxidative stress. 45 While the major findings highlighted above suggest several compelling lines of biological dysfunction, it is clear that integration across the multiple levels of inquiry will yield much more information about the global processes involved in the preclinical AD state. Consequently, there is scientific rationale for creating multiomics panels which span multiple levels of systems biology to yield more reliable and informative properties. Although relevant approaches are emerging, 46,47 the ultimate success of using systems-level biomarkers in clinical trials will depend on the construction of robust multiomic panels and their implementation by translational scientists. 48\ninfectious disease). This multistep path can facilitate and optimize the early diagnosis of disease. 49 The first steps necessary for developing blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis should aim at establishing the specific contexts of use (COUs), \"a statement that describes the manner and purpose of use for the biomarker in drug development\"( Table I) . 50\nmedicine approaches, either in prevention or dementia-stage trials, according to precision medicine. Current anti-A\u03b2 trials require evidence of brain or CSF A\u03b2 pathology as inclusion criteri for AD patients. 61 Emerging blood biomarker candidates showed promise for predicting the presence of A\u03b2 pathology in the brain concordant with results shown by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) investigations. 38 These tests might be used to identify patients eligible for anti-A\u03b2 trials, either directly or more likely as a prescreen. This approach is useful to target other aspects of AD pathophysiology, and, if biomarkers (and treatments) are being developed successfully, they could then serve to guide treatment decisions (ie, \"biomarker-guided therapy\" with \"theragnostic\" biomarkers).\nAD-like A\u03b2 pathology represented a positive development in this direction. 79, 80 The repeated failures of several potential disease-modifying drugs in Phase III clinical trials led to question the right target and the A\u03b2 hypothesis. 81 However, it should be considered that, frequently, AD patients recruited for clinical trials were already at a too advanced and potentially irreversible (decompensated) clinical stage of the disease (systems failure) and were not precisely selected using validated and qualified biomarkers. 75 Nevertheless, the case remains that late-stage therapies are likely bound to show only minimal effects or fail. 82 Therefore, early preclinical disease stage therapeutic trials focusing on A\u03b2, tau protein, and other disease-aggravating targets would probably have a better chance of delaying/halting AD-related pathophysiology.\nAccording to this scenario, defining and validating appropriate biomarkers is crucial for obtaining an early diagnosis of AD and assess the efficacy of disease-modifying drug treatments for AD, 83, 84 as stated by the FDA and by the Euro-pean Medicines Agency (EMA). 85 The recent revision of the diagnostic criteria developed by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) Working Group shifts the definition of the AD \"construct\" from symptomatic to biological and, specifically, introduces the use of biological markers-in the \"A/T/N\" classification schemeas the new criteria reflecting AD pathophysiology. 86 The framework of the A/T/N scheme includes both a CSF and a neuroimaging biomarker in each of the three biomarker groups to identify the preclinical stage of AD and predict the following cognitive decline. 86 In particular, \"A\" refers to biomarkers of A\u03b2 pathology, ie, the 42-amino acid-long A\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2 1-42 ) in the CSF or amyloid PET); \"T\" refers to biomarkers of tau pathology, ie, CSF phospho tau (p-tau) or tau PET; \"N\" refers to biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury, ie, CSF total tau (t-tau), 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET ( 18 F-FDG-PET), or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These advanced unbiased biological criteria are required to better design clinical trials aimed at identifying disease-modifying compounds. 86 \nWhen referring to both drug development and clinical trials, high costs, insufficient accessibility, and invasiveness of CSF biomarkers need to be critically assessed compared with blood-based biomarkers. 5 Once validated in independent large-scale cohorts, blood-based biomarkers will likely play a critical role to recognize-as early as in primary care settings-individuals with high risk of an early AD stage and to send these individuals to specialized centers where a confirmatory diagnosis can be done and the \"A + / T + /N + biomarker profile can be established. 86 The usefulness of blood-based biomarkers further increases when we consider the possibility that disease-modifying compounds, currently in Phase II/III clinical trials (eg, BAN2401 [Eisai], Aducanumab [Biogen] or Gantenerumab [Hoffmann-La Roche], or anti-tau therapies), might be approved in the coming future. In this scenario, blood-based biomarkers will increase the probability to get access to these treatments and will provide a fast and cost-effective rapid test to detect AD and, then, establish the eligibility of patients for inclusion into new clinical trials with new \"potential\" disease-modifying drugs.\nWhen considering the specific context in drug development, blood-based biomarkers should be validated and qualified for a specific COU, including assessment of mechanism of action (target engagement), dose optimization, efficacy maximization, and monitoring of both drug response and safety. 50, 85 Once a blood-based biomarker is validated for all or some of the above mentioned COUs, it can be implemented in clinical trials, designed to identify disease-modifying agents, and combined with specific neuropsychological tests assessing both episodic memory and other relevant cognitive domains (ie, executive dysfunction). 76 Different blood-based biomarkers have been studied in the last 5 years, although preliminary evidence of validation is available only for the A\u03b2 1-42 /40-amino acid-long A\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2 1-40 ) ratio, the \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), t-tau, and p-tau. 50 Recent studies using ultrasensitive analytical assays (Single Molecule Array [SiMoA TM ] platform) and fully automated immunoassays showed that plasma A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations and, particularly, the A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio predict the risk of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in cognitively normal individuals. 88 Recent studies showed that preconcentration of plasma A\u03b2 peptides via immunoprecipitation substantially facilitated their immunological measurements. 89 Plasma A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations and A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio correlate with conventional and validated AD biomarkers essential to detect an A + /T + /N + biomarker profile, 38,88,90,91 such as CSF A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations and brain A\u03b2 deposition (as assessed by PET). 88, 90 The inverse correlation found between plasma A\u03b2 1-42 reduction and brain A\u03b2 deposition might be useful for future clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies directed against A\u03b2 (ie, Aducanumab). Indeed, the decrease of plasma A\u03b2 1-42 concentrations can predict A\u03b2 positivity in subjective cognitive decline, MCI, and AD dementia. 90 In this regard, decreased plasma A\u03b2 1-42 and increased nerve growth factor precursor (proNGF) concentrations combined with inflammatory biomarkers predict the worsening of \"latent\" AD pathophysiology and the subsequent cognitive decline in Down syndrome. 93 The ability of A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio to predict cognitive decline might be useful not only for early diagnosis, but also to monitor disease evolution differently from CSF A\u03b2 1-42 , which is stable over time and not useful for predicting disease progression. 85, 94 This novel evidence, when validated in long-term longitudinal (24 to 36 months) studies involving large cohorts, will be crucial to identify the specific COU of A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio as a novel biomarker to assess the mechanism of action of disease-modifying drugs on the target A\u03b2 (target engagement). We can hypothesize that a disease-modifying drug able to bind A\u03b2 will prevent both plasma A\u03b2 1-42 reduction and brain A\u03b2 deposition as well as related subsequent brain atrophy and cognitive decline.\nAnother approach is to demonstrate target engagement of drugs affecting A\u03b2 processing such as \u03b3-secretase modulators or BACE-1 inhibitors. 85 Plasma BACE-1 concentrations are higher in MCI individuals who progressed to AD, over a 3-year follow-up, compared with stable MCI. 95, 96 Plasma BACE-1 activity can predict disease progression; however, this novel COU needs to be validated in independent clinical trials.\nWhen moving to the \"tau scenario\" of AD, recent highly sensitive immunoassays have been assessed for their potential in using plasma t-tau as a reliable blood-based biomarker for subject/patient selection (screening in primary setting) and AD prognosis. 50, [97] [98] [99] It is known that: (i) plasma t-tau concentrations are significantly increased in AD patients compared with controls 100 ; (ii) blood-\nbased p-tau is increased in AD patients and MCI individuals compared with controls 101-103 and plasma p-tau 181 is a more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated brain A\u03b2 deposition than t-tau 104 ; (iii) high baseline concentrations of plasma t-tau in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort correlated with increased rates of atrophy (as assessed by MRI), hypometabolism (as assessed by 18 F-FDG-PET), and the consequent cognitive decline 98 ; (iv) higher baseline concentrations of plasma t-tau in MCI individuals are associated with greater cognitive decline at 15 months not correlating with brain A\u03b2 deposition. 105 Whether the increased concentrations of plasma t-tau can be considered a specific biomarker for AD or just a prognostic marker for nonspecific cognitive decline is still debated. 85 Recently, Chen and colleagues, using a highly sensitive detection platform combined with antibodies directed against the N-terminus of tau protein, found that N-terminal-detected tau (NT1) in plasma was able to discriminate between controls and AD or MCI-AD patients. Plasma NT1 did not predict disease progression, but it could be considered a potential blood-based screening test for AD/AD-MCI useful to improve the selection of individuals eligible for clinical trials and to assess the clinical efficacy of tau-directed immunotherapies. 106 Overall, the above considerations indicate a COU for bloodbased biomarkers for better patient selection in clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy of investigative disease-modifying drugs. 50 This is a prospective scenario given the slow evolution of cognitive decline (12 to 24 months) in early AD, as indicated by psychometric test data. As a consequence, well-validated blood-based biomarkers, integrated into a single panel, will help examine target druggability and resistance mechanisms, thus increasing the predictability of cognitive outcome changes in response to drug treatments. This innovation will enable to reduce costs and resources required by clinical trial pipelines. 107\ngroup. In such cases, studying both biomarker-positive and -negative patients will be necessary to obtain regulatory approval for the use of the drug only in a biomarker-identified subgroup.\nTo foster investigation of targeted therapies using predictive biomarkers, regulators are prepared to discuss and advise on new, more sensitive end points as well as on statistical and pharmacometric modeling.\nblood-based tests for AD detection and diagnosis will be rapidly available, inexpensive, and easy to implement. 118 Supporting the international Alzheimer Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) (available at: https://www.apmiscience. com/) and its cohort program (APMI-CP), 119 the Blood-Based Biomarker Interest Group (BBBIG) has been created to provide global standards and best practices for the assessment of blood-based biomarkers. In a multistage diagnostic process, it is envisioned that blood-based biomarker tests would provide the screening entry point preceding further second-stage CSF analysis, MRI, and PET neuroimaging. Further profiling steps, based on genomic/epigenomic exploratory analyses, may be implemented as part of multimodel interventions targeted to specific biologically defined patient subgroups. 118 There are many potential COUs for AD biomarkers including, but not limited to, identification of AD risk, risk for progression from MCI to AD, population screening, stratification into clinical trials, disease monitoring, pharmacodynamics, monitoring of individual safety and tolerability or treatment response monitoring. 120 With regard to the heterogeneous AD spectrum, blood-based biomarkers are particularly useful to specifically select individuals with A\u03b2 pathology, using the A\u03b2 1-42 /A\u03b2 1-40 ratio. 121 The FDA recently granted Breakthrough Device Designation for a brain amyloidosis blood test to screen for risk of AD. 122 If approved, it would be the first blood-based screening test to predict brain amyloid PET scan results in adults with memory complaints or dementia.\nIt is conceivable that other blood-based biomarkers will indicate and identify individuals with more acute and faster disease progression (eg, NFL or tau and, possibly, an inflammatory biomarker, such as YKL-40). 123 In this respect, the selection of individuals into a clinical trial will be enhanced using pathophysiological blood-based biomarkers identifying patients at risk for progression and "}, {"section_title": "Contexts of use for blood-based biomarkers", "text": "Blood (plasma/serum) is unquestionably the most appropriate biological matrix for use in large exploratory studies.

Each of these settings should be considered as two separate COUs due to differences in patients and routines.

A problem with the latter approach is that the evidence needed to demonstrate utility in a COU might differ from that typically found in a case-control cohort (eg, the cohort might not be representative of the COU [amyloid prevalence, disease stage]), the cohort might not have all the relevant measures, or the best biomarkers for each COU might differ. 49,70"}, {"section_title": "Positive and negative predictive biomarkers detecting target druggability and drugresistance mechanisms", "text": "Current drug therapies for AD are considered transiently (\"symptomatic\") biologically effective and could not substantiate clinically meaningful disease-modifying outcomes.

Up to now, they have been mostly used as exploratory end points in clinical trials. However, their role as prescreening tools for selecting individuals (before more expensive and more invasive biomarkers are used) could be useful and, from a regulatory perspective, more qualification work in this direction is endorsed. 112, 113 Predictive biomarkers are used to identify treatment-responsive patient subgroups. The usefulness of a biomarker to identify patients eligible to be treated with a new drug depends on the statistical interaction between biomarker and drug, ie, on the difference in the effect size between biomarker-positive and -negative patients. The biomarker is called predictive with respect to a given drug if this difference is positive. Obviously, empirical demonstration that a biomarker is predictive in AD based on usual clinical data would require further corroboration in a well-powered clinical trial. Biomarker-drug codevelopment has been useful in recent years, especially in oncology, but remains a difficult task in AD due to the slow course of the disease and the lack of validated end points or surrogates, especially if early treatment at prodromal stages is contemplated.\nInvestigating pathway-based targeted drugs simultaneously in different pathologies in innovative study designs, such as recently proposed master protocols, could contribute to more efficient development. However, much effort is still required to explore and confirm reasonable predictive biomarkers based on clinical end points that are believed to predict the treatment effect.

This requires; (i) the identification of these pathophysiological pathways underlying clinical phenotypes and breaking down one uniformly appearing clinical disease into disease subtypes characterized by biomarkers that are representative of the molecular phenotype. Such an approach has been successfully applied in oncology where biomarkers are used to differentiate subtypes of eg, breast cancer or lung cancer for better response rates. 116 Furthermore, this may require (ii) monitoring of the pathophysiological response during treatment to understand whether a patient's disease is initially responding to a treatment and whether it continues and sustains response or (iii) monitoring whether an escape mechanism has been activated and the patient requires a different treatment approach.\nIn clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases, this may require early identification of patients with an existing pathology but still absent of very discrete or unspecific symptoms, such as in AD, where biological indicators can precede the clinical symptoms by more than 10 to 15 years. 117 In cases where a specific pathophysiological pathway defining a disease subgroup is targeted by a particular compound, a companion diagnostic approach may be required to test the status of biomarker(s) related to the molecular pathway(s) involved in order to provide safe and effective treatment options. Development of such companion diagnostics often requires exceptional communication and seamless collaboration between two companies (ie, diagnostics and drug companies) with distinct proficiencies and disparate teams which, in practice, may present serious challenges during all stages of codevelopment from design and execution of clinical trials to market access and reimbursement, including Institutional Review Board oversight, study management, monitoring and complex submissions to regulatory agencies. Even though a companion diagnostic approach allows for personalized treatments and may reduce the incidence of adverse effects and overall costs via avoidance of unnecessary and/or inefficient treatments, it should also be recognized that there are several disadvantages associated with a companion diagnostic approach as well. For instance, requirement of a specific diagnostic test to be performed before any treatment may be initiated, or requirement of continuous testing for monitoring purposes could actually add to the cost of individual patient care. In addition, lack of availability or limited accessibility of such a test for every individual potentially eligible for the drug may cause unwanted delays in access to the treatment.
