[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Age-related cognitive decline is likely promoted by accumulated brain injury due to chronic conditions of aging, including neurodegenerative and vascular disease. Because common neuronal mechanisms may mediate the adaptation to diverse cerebral insults, we hypothesized that susceptibility for age-related cognitive decline may be due in part to a shared genetic network. We have therefore performed a genome-wide association study using a quantitative measure of global cognitive decline slope, based on repeated measures of 17 cognitive tests in 749 subjects from the Religious Orders Study. Top results were evaluated in 3 independent replication cohorts, consisting of 2279 additional subjects with repeated cognitive testing. As expected, we find that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus, APOE, is strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (P DISC \u03ed 5.6 \u03eb 10 \u03ea9 ; P JOINT \u03ed 3.7 \u03eb 10 \u03ea27 ). We additionally discover a variant, rs10808746, which shows consistent effects in the replication cohorts and modestly improved evidence of association in the joint analysis (P DISC \u03ed 6.7 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 ; P REP \u03ed 9.4 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 ; P JOINT \u03ed 2.3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 ). This variant influences the expression of 2 adjacent genes, PDE7A and MTFR1, which are potential regulators of inflammation and oxidative injury, respectively. Using aggregate measures of genetic risk, we find that known susceptibility loci for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory diseases are not significantly associated with cognitive decline in our cohort. may be a useful tool to dissect susceptibility loci for age-related cognitive decline and uncover shared molecular pathways with a role in neuronal injury."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Decline in cognitive performance occurs with advancing age and is associated with a variety of common, age-related chronic medical conditions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia (Reitz et al., 2011a) ; however, many other common adult illnesses, including type 2 diabetes (Croxson and Jagger, 1995; Grodstein et al., 2001; Reijmer et al., 2010) , cerebrovascular disease (Desmond et al., 2000; Pendlebury and Rothwell, 2009) , as well as other cardiovascular risk factors (Desmond et al., 1993; Warsch and Wright, 2010) , and inflammatory disorders (Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009 ) have been implicated in agerelated cognitive decline. Based on autopsy series from community-based cohorts, most individuals with dementia have multiple contributory pathologies at the time of death (Neuropathology Group of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study, 2001; Sonnen et al., 2007; Troncoso et al., 2008) . It is likely that diverse forms of brain injury interact to accelerate cognitive decline. For example, it has been suggested that vascular-related brain injury may promote the development of AD pathology or, less directly, the clinical manifestation of AD-related cognitive decline (Launer et al., 2008; Schneider and Bennett, 2010; Warsch and Wright, 2010) . Results from a variety of experimental paradigms for the study of neuronal injury and repair indicate that overlapping cellular and molecular mechanisms likely mediate the response to a diversity of central nervous system insults (Bishop et al., 2010; Cho et al., 2010; Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009; Martinez-Vicente and Cuervo, 2007; Ross and Poirier, 2004) . Besides the local reactions to brain lesions, the ability of neuronal networks to adapt to and compensate for an accumulated burden of injury, sometimes referred to as cognitive reserve (Stern, 2009 ), likely has a substantial impact on the trajectory of cognitive decline. Studies of elder twins suggest substantial heritability in cognitive performance in late life (McClearn et al., 1997; Swan et al., 1990) , and we hypothesize that a core genetic network might therefore impact susceptibility for rate of age-related cognitive decline.\nGenome-wide association studies have proven a successful strategy for discovering susceptibility genes for complex human traits, including neurologic disorders, such as AD (Bertram and Tanzi, 2009) . Besides the apolipoprotein E locus (APOE), these studies have identified common variants in ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A4/MS4A6E , and PICALM as associated with AD susceptibility (Harold et al., 2009; Hollingworth et al., 2011; Lambert et al., 2009; Naj et al., 2011; Seshadri et al., 2010) . While elucidating the functional impact of disease-associated genetic variants remains an active area of investigation, there is evidence that these genes may have important roles beyond AD pathogenesis in affecting other disorders potentially relevant to cognitive decline. For example, in addition to the well-known effect of the APOE locus in promoting AD risk, this locus has also been associated with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and increased cerebral infarcts (Eichner et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2003; McCarron et al., 1999) . Similarly, polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, encoding a complement receptor, have previously been associated with susceptibility for infectious disease, particularly malaria (Cockburn et al., 2004; Rowe et al., 1997) . We have shown that polymorphisms in both APOE (Wilson et al., 2002a (Wilson et al., , 2002b and CR1 (Chibnik et al., 2011 ) have a measurable impact on age-related cognitive decline, including in subjects without dementia, and further, that these associations are mediated in part by an effect on promoting amyloid plaque pathology (Bennett et al., 2005a; Chibnik et al., 2011) .\nThe Religious Orders Study (ROS) is following more than 1100 older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers who have completed up to 16 years of annual cognitive testing. Here, we have leveraged available genotyping data for 749 subjects of European ancestry with longitudinal cognitive data to conduct a genome scan for loci associated with the rate of age-related cognitive decline. We report efforts to replicate the best results using data from 2 complementary, community-based studies, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), as well as a predominantly clinic-derived subject sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and offer evidence in support of replication for 1 variant. Finally, we explore whether known genetic susceptibility factors associated with other illnesses that are known to influence the risk of dementia, such as AD, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, also affect agerelated cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects are participants from 4 longitudinal studies, which are each described below.

Participation was 78.6% of all community residents at baseline and 80% to 85% retention of survivors at follow-up. The study began in 1993 and enrolls successive age cohorts of community residents as they attain the age of 65 years. To date, 10,802 subjects have contributed data.

The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the USA and Canada. The cohort includes 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research-approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years.

In this approach, each individual's path is assumed to follow the mean path of the group except for random effects that cause the initial level of function (i.e., intercept) to be higher or lower and the rate of change (i.e., slope) to be faster or slower. These random effects are assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution. The random and fixed effects were then used to estimate individual trajectories of cognitive decline. Residual, individual cognitive decline slope terms were extracted from the mixed models, after adjustment for the effects of age, sex, and education. Personspecific, adjusted residual slopes were then used as a quantitative outcome phenotype for the genetic association analyses. These estimates equate to the difference between an individual's slope and the predicted slope of an individual of the same age, sex, and education level.

For the cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disease categories, which have multiple component outcomes, SNPs that had reference alleles which were both protective for a disease and a risk factor for another disease were removed. To limit the amount of correlation between SNPs, we further refined this list by identifying all pairs of SNPs with a linkage disequilibrium r 2 \u0546 0.5 and keeping only the SNP in those pairs with the lowest p-value. Once we identified a final SNP set, the 4 GRSs were created by summing up the number of category specific risk alleles for each individual.

To better understand the impact of this variant on cognition, we evaluated associations with cognitive decline based on measures for each of the 5 domains of the ROS global cognitive score (Supplementary Table 3 ). This polymorphism was associated with the rate of cognitive decline in episodic memory (p \u03ed 3 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 ), perceptual speed (p \u03ed 0.048), semantic memory (p \u03ed 0.015), and working memory (p \u03ed 0.0046), but not visuospatial processing (p \u03ed 0.13), suggesting that, while it appears to have a predominant effect on decline in episodic memory, its role may not be limited to a single, functionally distinct anatomic region or circuit."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of rs10808746 effect on local gene expression", "text": "The rs10808746 SNP falls within an intron of phosphodiesterase 7A (PDE7A) and is near 2 flanking genes, mitochondrial fission regulator 1 (MTFR1) and armadillo repeat-containing protein 1 (ARMC1), that fall within a linkage disequilibrium block identified by the association peak (Fig. 3B) . In order to begin to characterize the effect of the discovered variant, we attempted to evaluate its impact on local gene expression in available datasets. In an analysis of gene expression data from PBMCs of 228 individuals with demyelinating disease (De Jager et al., 2009) , representing a set of subjects with an activated immune system, we found evidence for association between the discovered variant and expression of both PDE7A (p \u03ed 8.4 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 ) and MTFR1 (p \u03ed 4.5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 ), but not ARMC1 (p \u03ed 0.21) (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 4) . The significance of the rs10808746 association with PDE7A and MTFR1 expression in PBMCs was robust to gene-based permutation testing. Published data from a different cell type, HapMap lymphoblastic cell lines , also revealed associations with the expression of PDE7A (p \u03ed 5 \u03eb 10 -3 ) and MTFR1 (p \u03ed 0.041), but not ARMC1 (p \u03ed 0.17). However, the direction of effect for the association between this SNP and gene expression was not consistent between these 2 sets of data generated from different cell populations: the risk allele was associated with decreased expression of both genes in the PBMCs from subjects with demyelinating disease, but a more modest increase in both PDE7A and MTFR1 expression in the HapMap cell lines, which are B cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus. Based on available databases of gene expression data, such as BioGPS (biogps.gnf.org), both PDE7A and MTFR1 are widely expressed in diverse tissue types, including the central nervous system (Rhead et al., 2010; Su et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2009 ); however, a publicly-available brain expression dataset with genome-wide genotyping did not include probes for either MTFR1 or PDE7A.

In our ROS discovery cohort, a diagnosis of AD or of type 2 diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with cognitive decline (Supplementary Table 5 ), consistent with prior studies (Arvanitakis et al., 2004) . Supplementary Table 7 summarizes the SNPs included in each aggregate genetic risk score, along with the relevant references. For both the AD and cardiovascular risk models, we excluded APOE from consideration, because this locus' strong effect on cognitive decline would overwhelm the contribution of loci with more modest effect sizes. As shown in Table 3 , none of the aggregate risk models returned evidence of association in our ROS discovery cohort, and only the AD model demonstrated nominal association to cognitive decline in a more powerful joint analysis that included both the ROS and MAP cohorts. Our modest sample size limits our power in these analyses, but validating our strategy, we do see the expected correlation of the aggregate estimate of genetic risk for type 2 diabetes with a diagnosis of diabetes in our subjects (Supplementary Table 6 )."}, {"section_title": "Power for discovery and replication of genetic variants associated with cognitive decline", "text": "The genetic architecture of cognitive decline is currently not known. Given our results and the size of our discovery and replication sample sets, it is likely that cognitive decline, like most other complex traits, is influenced by many variants of modest effect, in addition to the APOE locus which has a strong effect on this trait. Using the PDE7A/ MTFR1 and CR1 loci as putative susceptibility loci with which to calibrate the design of future studies exploring cognitive decline, we performed power calculations to assess the sample size that would be necessary for a robust discovery study. For CR1, we observe an effect size (\u2424) of \u03ea0.0130 and a MAF of 0.20 in the ROS cohort; thus, we would need 7241 subjects to observe a genome-wide significant effect on the rate of cognitive decline (p \u03fd 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea8 ) with 80% power, and 8288 subjects for 90% power. For PDE7A/MTFR1, the effect size in the ROS cohort (\u2424 \u03ed ), and 2053 subjects for 90% power. However, in the MAP cohort, the PDE7A/MTFR1 has an effect size of 0.008, yielding an alternative estimate of 12,175 subjects needed for 80% power and 13,937 subjects for 90% power. The latter estimate is likely to more accurately reflect the true effect size of our variant because it comes from a replication cohort. The requirement for a larger sample size is consistent with what has been observed for other human traits (Park et al., 2010) and likely explains, at least in part, why we have not yet discovered susceptibility variants for cognitive decline reaching the genomewide significance level. These estimates will guide the design of our future efforts: it appears that sample sizes between 7241 and 12,175 subjects will be needed to have reasonable power to assemble convincing evidence of association between genetic variation and the rate of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We report the results of a genome-wide scan in 749 elder subjects to identify loci associated with the rate of cognitive decline, using a mixed effects model that incorporates repeated cognitive measures. Consistent with numerous prior studies (Feskens et al., 1994; Haan et al., 1999; Henderson et al., 1995; Hyman et al., 1996; Jonker et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 2002a Wilson et al., , 2002b , we found robust evidence for association between the APOE locus and the rate of age-related cognitive decline. Besides APOE, in a replication analysis including 2279 additional subjects, we identified 1 other locus (PDE7A/MTFR1) with consistent direction of effect on cognitive decline in all cohorts and improved evidence of association in a joint analysis. While additional replication efforts will be needed to validate the role of this locus in cognitive decline, our replication and extension analyses strongly suggest that this locus has an effect on the rate of cognitive decline in aging individuals.\nTo begin to understand the function of this variant, we explored its possible role in influencing the expression of nearby genes using available gene expression data sets. Although further work is needed to better understand the effect of this variant in different cell types (particularly in the brain for which data were not available), 2 of the 3 genes found in the block of LD surrounding the associated variant-PDE7A and MTFR1-appear to be influenced by rs10808746, which is found in an intron of PDE7A. MTFR1 has been shown to induce mitochondrial fission in a variety of cell types (Tonachini et al., 2004) , and in Mtfr1 null mice, testicular cells show increased oxidative injury and reduced expression of free radical scavengers, such as glutathione peroxidase 3 (Monticone et al., 2007) . Thus, MTFR1 is a reasonable candidate gene for further validation in the context of cognitive decline because it could be involved in modulating the response of central nervous system (CNS) cells to oxidative stress, implicated in many different models of neuronal injury including AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease (Cho et al., 2010) . PDE7A is another strong candidate: it is expressed in both neuronal and nonneuronal CNS cells and regulates intracellular signaling by affecting the concentration of cyclic dinucleotides (Mir\u00f3 et al., 2001; P\u00e9rez-Torres et al., 2003) . Data on its possible function in CNS cells is limited, but 1 report suggests that inhibiting this molecule may contribute to enhancing cell death in response to an apoptotic signal in lymphocytes (Dong et al., 2010) . There is also mixed evidence that it may have a role in mediating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during T cell activation (Kadoshima-Yamaoka et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2003) . Thus, PDE7A is also a reasonable candidate for mediating the effect of the rs10808746 variant, and it is further possible that the variant influences the expression and function of both genes, possibly by affecting shared pathways involved in neuronal degeneration.\nBased on our power calculations, it is clear that substantially larger sample sizes including 10,000 -15,000 subjects will be needed for a definitive investigation of the genetic architecture of the rate of cognitive decline. This estimate is in line with power calculations for other complex traits (Park et al., 2010) . The distribution of results from the ROS cohort suggest that it is unlikely that loci with a strong effect on cognitive decline exist outside of APOE. The existence of loci with more modest effects on cognitive decline is consistent with the suggestive evidence presented in support of CR1, a known AD susceptibility locus, and possibly PDE7A/MTFR1. We attempted to enhance our ability to test detect the role of genetic variation in cognitive decline by assessing aggregate measures of genetic risk for conditions that are well-known (AD, cerebrovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes) or hypothesized (inflammatory diseases) to influence this trait. Our aggregate measure of AD risk is nominally associated with cognitive decline, suggesting that this may be a fruitful strategy to deploy in future studies that leverage larger sample sizes and additional susceptibility alleles that will emerge in the near future.\nOur study was based on the hypothesis that common genetic pathways mediate the response and adaptation to diverse forms of brain pathology, and that variation in such loci might therefore impact age-related cognitive decline. This hypothesis is supported by observations from a variety of experimental paradigms of neuronal injury that several core cellular pathways, including protein misfolding/aggregation (Ross and Poirier, 2004) , autophagy (Martinez-Vicente and Cuervo, 2007) , mitochondrial dynamics (Cho et al., 2010) , and inflammation (Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009 ), play important roles in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In prospective, community-based autopsy series of dementia, most brains are found to have multiple pathologies (Neuropathology Group of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study, 2001; Schneider et al., 2007; Sonnen et al., 2007) , which likely interact to produce the clinical manifestations of age-related cognitive decline (Wilson et al., 2010) . Our strategy of using cognitive trajectories as an outcome trait for a genome-wide scan holds great promise for the identification of core genetic mechanisms mediating cognitive reserve and adaptation to injury. However, our current study provides evidence that the genetic architecture of this trait may be similar to that of other complex human traits, involving common variants of modest effects. We provide estimates of the substantially larger sample size required to achieve effective statistical power for robust gene discovery efforts, highlighting the need to combine additional cohorts with those reported here."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no conflicts of interest to report related to this work. , the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (U01 AG016976), and the state of Arizona.
