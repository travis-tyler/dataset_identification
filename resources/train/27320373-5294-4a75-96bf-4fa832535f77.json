There is growing consensus that the target population for disease-modifying therapy is not individuals with dementia but rather those with MCI or preclinical AD. 4 The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) recently subdivided MCI into early (EMCI) and late (LMCI) MCI stages on the basis of the severity of impaired delayed recall of logical memory. 5, 6 Several researchers have investigated the potential use of neuroimaging findings as biomarkers for EMCI and LMCI. [7] [8] [9] In a diffusion tensor imaging study of ADNI, there was no significant difference between CN and EMCI groups, whereas the LMCI group showed differences in mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity in the left hippocampal part of the cingulum. 7 In another study, the LMCI group showed reduced overall cortical thickness compared with CN and EMCI groups, but there was no difference between CN and EMCI groups. 8 Furthermore, brain glucose metabolism remains normal in individuals with EMCI despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation. 9 Therefore, despite an established concept of EMCI, significant EMCI-related brain abnormalities as revealed by neuroimaging are not well documented, except for amyloid deposition based on amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) using florbetapir.\nThese neuroimaging abnormalities (ie, cortical thinning, glucose hypometabolism, and amyloid deposition) in the MCI stage are mainly localized in the entorhinal and posterior medial cortical areas. [7] [8] [9] The posteromedial cortical areas are known to be functionally connected with entorhinal cortex [10] [11] [12] and to play a key role in memory function in MCI and dementia. 13, 14 These regions are also core regions of default mode network (DMN). 15 The DMN, which becomes less active during engagement in cognitive tasks and more active during rest, has received much attention as a potential AD biomarker. 16, 17 Several neuroimaging studies show that DMN areas overlap with areas of amyloid plaque deposition, 18 and functional connectivity in the DMN is disrupted in both AD and MCI. [19] [20] [21] As functional connectivity in the DMN has been noted to have an impact on the episodic memory, breakdown of DMN connectivity could be an underlying reason behind the memory loss in AD. 22 One notable study demonstrated that DMN connectivity indices can distinguish between individuals with MCI who will and will not convert to AD. 23 Main findings of that study were that an index of DMN connectivity for MCI nonconverters was higher than that for MCI converters, and baseline DMN connectivity indices were correlated with cognitive decline from the baseline. From these findings, it could be speculated that MCI subjects with more disrupted DMN connectivity are at greater risk to convert to AD.\nApplying the same criteria for EMCI and LMCI proposed in ADNI, the annual conversion rate to AD in the EMCI subjects (12%) were much less than that observed in LMCI subjects (27%). 5 On the basis of the previous literature that DMN functional connectivity is predictive of conversion from MCI to AD, 23 we can hypothesize that DMN connectivity of LMCI subjects is more disrupted than EMCI subjects. However, there has been no study focusing on DMN abnormalities at different stages of MCI, such as EMCI and LMCI.\nIn the present study, we used resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the breakdown of DMN functional connectivity across the continuum from CN to EMCI to LMCI using a well-established data-driven method. We examined whether this breakdown in functional connectivity corresponds with cognitive decline during the MCI stage."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Data Acquisition", "text": "Data were obtained from the ADNI database (adni. loni.usc.edu). The primary goal of ADNI is to test whether the results of serial MRI, PET, biological assays, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to assess the progression of MCI and early AD.\nFrom the ADNI database, we obtained data for all available 124 participants (45 CN, 49 EMCI, and 40 LMCI) who completed the following clinical, imaging, and neuropsychological assessments during a single visit: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), clinical dementia rating-sum of box score (CDR-SOB), ADNI composite score for memory and executive function (ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF), 24, 25 apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 carrier status, and resting-state fMRI. Of these 124 participants, 4 were excluded because of poor image quality (eg, excessive head motion, severe artifacts, or partial brain coverage). The remaining 120 subjects (43 CN, 47 EMCI, and 40 LMCI) were included in further analyses. Florbetapir mean standard uptake value ratio data were downloaded from the ADNI public database (ida.loni.use.edu).

The first 2 fMRI volumes were discarded for signal stabilization before preprocessing. A slice timing correction was performed for the fMRI time series, and spatially realigned fMRI time series images were coregistered with T1 MRI. T1 data were used as a normalization source image to register the fMRI images into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 template. Transformation matrices from individual T1s to the MNI template were calculated, and these matrices were applied to each coregistered fMRI image. Finally, normalized fMRI images were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width at half maximum to increase the signal to noise ratio. We extracted 20 groupindependent components. The reason for extracting 20 components was based on a previous report, which compared ICA methods, components, and resting-state networks. This study showed the overall highest consistency of temporal and spatial correlations when 20 components was used as a parameter. 28 DMN components were identified by selecting components with the highest spatial correlation to the DMN template supplied by GIFT software. Visual inspections assured that the selected components resembled the DMN. No false selection of the template-based automated procedure was observed. Individual DMN components extracted from group ICA were converted into z-score maps.\nPreprocessing of Structural T1 Data and Voxelbased Morphometry (VBM) Analysis VBM using T1 images was performed to investigate possible contributions that gray matter (GM) loss may have on DMN breakdown. Preprocessing of structural T1 data was performed using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anamoical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie algebra) implemented in SPM8. 29 Firstly, structural T1 images were segmented into the GM, the white matter, and the cerebrospinal fluid using the tissue priority maps, and GM maps were spatially normalized. Then, spatially normalized GM maps were modulated to adjust volume changes during nonlinear transformation. Finally, normalized GM maps were smoothed using the Gaussian kernel of 8 mm fullwidth at half maximum, and smoothed images were used for VBM. Regional GM volume was compared using 1-way analysis of variance in SPM8. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected, with a cluster extent threshold of 50.

As expected, LMCI subjects showed poorer performance than CN subjects in all neuropsychological tests. EMCI and LMCI subjects did not differ on the scores of MMSE, ADNI-EF, CDR-SOB, and FAQ. ADNI-Mem scores were significantly different among the 3 groups. CN and EMCI subjects differed on CDR-SOB and FAQ. Age, sex, and APOE E4 carrier status of all groups did not differ significantly, but LMCI subjects had more years of education than EMCI subjects. There was no significant difference in GM volume between the 3 groups, but the percentage of florbetapir-positive subjects was significantly higher in the EMCI and LMCI groups than in the CN group.\nResults of average DMN maps for the CN, EMCI, and LMCI groups are illustrated in Figure 1 . CN and EMCI subjects showed significant clusters in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and bilateral medial temporal lobe (Figs. 1A, B ). LMCI subjects showed significant clusters only in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, left and right lateral parietal cortex, and left medial temporal lobe (Fig. 1C) . Figure 2 and Table 2 show the results of voxel-wise group comparisons of DMN functional connectivity. EMCI and LCMI subjects showed decreased DMN functional connectivity in the precuneus, bilateral medial frontal, parahippocampal, middle temporal gyri, right superior temporal gyrus, and left angular gyrus compared with CN subjects. In addition, LMCI subjects exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the right superior frontal and left superior temporal gyrus compared with CN subjects ( Figs. 2A, B ). Furthermore, LMCI subjects exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the precuneus, bilateral medial frontal gyri, and left angular gyrus compared with EMCI subjects (Fig. 2C ).

When we performed this analysis in each of the groups (CN, EMCI, or LMCI), no statistically significant results were obtained."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The main finding of our study is that EMCI involves significant breakdown of functional connectivity in key DMN regions, including the precuneus, bilateral medial frontal, parahippocampal, middle temporal, right superior temporal gyri, and left angular gyrus. These are the main regions responsible for amyloid deposition and the disruption of DMN connectivity in AD. [18] [19] [20] 30, 31 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first examination of functional connectivity in the DMN at different stages of MCI. DMN connectivity is a well-replicated neuroimaging finding of AD. 16, 17, 20, 21, 23 We found that EMCI subjects showed decreased DMN functional connectivity, which is consistent with other studies showing decreased functional connectivity of the DMN in elderly CN individuals with high amyloid burden, 31, 32 individuals with presenilin-1 mutations, 33 and carriers of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE E4). 34, 35 We also investigated whether GM atrophy contributed to DMN connectivity. There was no significant difference of GM volume among 3 groups in the VBM analysis. Group difference of DMN connectivity remained significant after adjusting for the GM volume as a covariate, suggesting that DMN connectivity differences were independent of GM atrophy. Taken together, the present and previous studies indicate that disruption of DMN connectivity might be one of the earliest neuroimaging abnormalities of AD.\nAlthough not all individuals with EMCI convert to dementia, our results indicate that this group represents an early symptomatic stage of AD. Moreover, LMCI subjects showed additional disruption of DMN connectivity, suggesting that LMCI closely resembles AD in terms of DMN functional connectivity. Our findings suggest that DMN functional connectivity might deteriorate progressively from CN to EMCI to LMCI stages. Furthermore, DMN functional connectivity was positively correlated with clinical measures of cognitive ability, such as MoCA, ADNI-Mem, and ADNI-EF scores, and negatively correlated with CDR-SOB scores. These findings are also consistent with those of earlier studies. 16, 36, 37 Outcomes of recent clinical trials on disease-modifying therapies for AD have been disappointing. As a result, there is growing consensus that the optimal population for clinical trials is not demented individuals but rather predemented individuals on the spectrum of AD neurobiology. 4, 5 For this reason, the concept of EMCI has been gaining attention as the earliest symptomatic stage of AD. [7] [8] [9] 26 A previous study shows that brain metabolism remains normal despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation in EMCI, suggesting that the EMCI stage is an optimal period for antiamyloid intervention. 9 In this regard, our results suggest the value of neuroimaging findings for diagnosis and intervention during the EMCI stage.\nSeveral points should be carefully considered when interpreting our results. The percentage of amyloid-positive subjects based on amyloid PET using florbetapir in the EMCI group (60.9%) was higher than that in a previous study, 38 which might contribute to the observed breakdown of DMN functional connectivity in EMCI subjects. This variability between studies could be due to different sampled populations. Because our study focused on resting functional connectivity, we included subjects only if they underwent resting-state fMRI, which may have resulted in differences in sampled populations even though both studies used the same ADNI data set. Ab + EMCI subjects showed more widespread breakdown of DMN connectivity than Ab \u00c0 EMCI subjects in our subgroup analysis; it might be speculated that amyloid burden affects breakdown of DMN connectivity in EMCI subjects. Another consideration is that our study utilized a cross-sectional design. Thus, we were unable to observe longitudinal changes in DMN connectivity during AD progression within individuals or unable to determine the proportion of individuals with EMCI who progress to LMCI and then to AD. Lastly, we could not assess levels of CSF tau and Ab 42 , which could possibly be related to changes in DMN connectivity. Thus, future longitudinal studies that examine CSF biomarkers are needed to address these issues."}]
