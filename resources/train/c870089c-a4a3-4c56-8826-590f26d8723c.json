The year-round warm, wet climate on the windward sides of islands and the high fertility of relatively young volcanically derived soils are ideal conditions for carbon input, storage, and sequestration in ecosystems of the main Hawaiian Islands. Over the last three decades, several plotand stand-level studies, conducted at the scale of tens to hundreds of square meters, have demonstrated the high carbon sequestration capacity of Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystems with a focus on soils, live biomass, and plant productivity. However, there have been relatively few studies conducted at landscape (hundreds to thousands of square meters) to islandwide scales examining the biotic and environmental controls on aboveground carbon density and no islandwide to statewide estimates of carbon fluxes and net carbon balance for ecosystems of the Hawaiian Islands. The goal of this report is to provide robust baseline estimates of carbon storage and flux across the Hawaiian Islands based on the best available data and to then use this baseline data as input to predict how carbon cycling and storage may respond to projected future changes in climate, land use, land cover, and disturbance. Major components of the assessment include a new high-resolution land-cover map for the State of Hawai\u02bbi; projected future shifts in climatic zones owing to global warming; baseline estimates of carbon emissions from wildfire; comprehensive statewide estimates of current ecosystem carbon stocks in soils, live biomass, and detritus; comprehensive statewide estimates of current carbon fluxes from gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R e ); current and projected future stream-and groundwater carbon fluxes to nearshore waters; and statewide estimates of current and projected future net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) based on projected changes in climate, wildfire, land use, and land cover. Major findings from the assessment are as follows: Total carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems across the seven main Hawaiian Islands (excluding Ni\u02bbihau) was estimated to be 258 TgC, of which 71 percent was soil organic carbon (SOC) to 1 m depth, 24 percent was live biomass (above and below ground), and 5 percent was dead biomass (a combination of litter and downed woody debris). Hawai\u02bbi Island, the largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, stored 136 TgC, which accounted for 58 percent of the total carbon storage in the State of Hawai\u02bbi, whereas the island of Kaua\u02bbi had the highest carbon density (carbon storage per unit area), estimated as 23.5 kgC/m 2 . Live-biomass carbon storage in native forests was estimated as 32 TgC, which was 51 percent of all carbon stored as live biomass (63 TgC), followed by invaded forests (21 TgC) and alien tree plantations (6 TgC). Between 2003 and 2014, GPP across the seven islands averaged 20.2 TgC/yr, with Hawai\u02bbi Island accounting for 55 percent of this flux (11.2 TgC/yr). The island of Kaua\u02bbi had the highest mean annual GPP carbon flux density (GPP per unit land area) estimated at 1.85 kgC/m 2 . Carbon lost to the atmosphere from wildfire emissions was estimated as 0.03 TgC/yr, and carbon lost to nearshore waters from stream-and groundwater fluxes was estimated as 0.3 TgC/yr for the current baseline period, which was approximately 4 percent of statewide annual net primary production (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems of the seven main Hawaiian Islands sequestered an average of 0.34 TgC/yr during the baseline period, which was approximately 4 percent of statewide terrestrial NPP. Hawai\u02bbi Island represented the largest carbon sink, sequestering 0.24 TgC/yr or 70 percent of total statewide carbon sequestration. During the projected future period (2012-2061), carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems of the State of Hawai\u02bbi would decrease by more than 30 percent (from 0.34 to 0.22 TgC/yr) primarily because of a decrease in NPP and increased carbon losses from land-use and land-cover change, as well as increased aquatic carbon-leaching losses to nearshore waters. The State of Hawai\u02bbi was projected to remain a net carbon sink in 2061, primarily because of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems on Hawai\u02bbi Island. However, predicted landuse changes on the islands of Kaua\u02bbi and O\u02bbahu were projected to convert these islands from net carbon sinks to net carbon sources to the atmosphere by 2061."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Assessment Report", "text": "There are several known limitations of the assessment report. First, only a single climate projection scenario was used to project moisture-zone shifts in Fortini and others (this volume,chap. 3). Future analyses would benefit from multiple climate projection scenarios. Second, estimates of ecosystem respiration in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6) were based on the relationship between estimates of GPP and R e from eddy flux towers, none of which were located in the Hawaiian Islands, and these estimates agreed poorly with model output from Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8), yielding high uncertainty for this large and important pathway of ecosystem carbon loss to the atmosphere and also affecting estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP) and NECB. With regard to future assessments, the technical needs for reduction of uncertainties present in this assessment will require enhancements in observation systems and modeling research. Key enhancements in observation systems include inventory measurements of shrubland and grassland aboveground biomass and root-to-shoot ratios, direct measurements of streamflow and carbon concentration of ephemeral streams on the leeward sides of the seven main Hawaiian Islands, and the incorporation of currently unpublished data from eddy flux towers in the State of Hawai\u02bbi (Thomas Giambelluca, University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa) as well as the establishment of new eddy flux towers to directly assess the balance of CO 2 flux between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Key enhancements in modeling research include the development of an ensemble approach to ecosystem modeling and the development and incorporation of multiple climate-change and land-management scenarios that include different intensities of agricultural activities, conservation, ecological restoration, invasive species management, and wildfire suppression and prevention efforts. Although there are substantial uncertainties in our analyses, the analyses themselves represent state-of-the-art science, and this assessment provides information for priorities in reducing uncertainties that should improve future assessments. collected between 2000 and 2012; LULC data were derived from remote-sensing data collected in 2005; wildland-fire data were collected between 1904 and 2011; aboveground (and so belowground) biomass data reflect complex datasets collected in 2008 and 2009; soil-carbon data were based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) excavations conducted during the past 50 years; GPP, NPP, and ecosystem-respiration data were modeled from data collected between 2004 and 2013; and data on carbon export in streams are based on gage data collected between 1972 and 2013. The datasets used for this assessment were provided by a diverse set of partners participating in the assessment including the USGS, USDA Forest Service and NRCS, Carnegie Institution for Science, University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, State of Hawai\u02bbi Division of Forestry and Wildlife, Nature Conservancy, and other organizations. The carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi relied on a complete carbon budgeting approach ( fig. 1.3) that included the following features: (1) land-use and land-cover types (Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2) and biome and LULC maps delineating current distributions of vegetation types (Fortini and others, this volume, chap. 3); (2) modeled aboveground biomass for shrubs and grasslands, constructed and validated with biomass plots for these ecosystems types (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5); (3) remote-sensing-based quantification of aboveground biomass for forests, constructed with plane-based light detection and ranging (lidar) estimates of aboveground biomass and validated with plot data from USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots across the State of Hawai\u02bbi (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6); (4) modeled estimates of belowground live biomass based on generalized allometric equations linking aboveground and belowground biomass (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5); (5) MODIS-derived estimates of GPP and NPP and statistically determined relationships between GPP and ecosystem respiration to estimate net ecosystem production (NEP) (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6); (6) publicly available USDA NRCS mineral soil-carbon data; (7) spatially and temporally explicit carbon storage and GHG flux estimates (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6); and (8) streamgauge-based modeling of inorganic and organic carbon export by stream and groundwater discharge (MacKenzie and others, this volume, chap. 7). These data sources and modeling yielded a spatially extensive (99 percent of total land area for the State of Hawai\u02bbi) estimate of current carbon storage in Hawai\u02bbi's grassland, shrubland, and forest land base. The carbon assessment relied on the above baseline data for carbon storage and future projected vegetation (Fortini and others, this volume, chap. 3) to identify current (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6) and potential future carbon storage and flux (Sleeter and others,this volume,chap. 8,and Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 9). Specifically, estimates of current carbon storage were paired with projected change in biome coverage for the years 2090-2100, which in turn was based on dynamical downscaling of global circulation models (1-3-km 2 resolution for Hawai\u02bbi depending on island size). Projected biome maps were based on (1) modeling biome extent from projected climate variables of temperature and precipitation, where models are constructed from relationships between current climate and current modeled maps of biomes validated against current maps of actual biome type (Fortini and others, this volume, chap. 3); (2) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios of climate and land use (Sleeter and others, this volume, chap. 8); and (3) state and transition-model-based estimates of carbon storage and flux under new configurations of biome and ecological condition (native dominated, mostly native, and mostly nonnative), where biome-specific and ecologicalcondition-specific carbon characteristics were carried forward and adjusted using map projections for the new distribution of biome type and ecological condition (Sleeter and others,this volume,chap. 8). Several important caveats should be considered when interpreting projections from this assessment. Although current estimates are based on best available information required to quantify the carbon storage and flux, assessments of potential future carbon storage and flux under future climate and LULC are speculative as even the best projections for future climate and LULC in Hawai\u02bbi are uncertain, particularly for future rainfall and LULC. Critically, this assessment does not construct global warming potential budgets that require a complete accounting of all GHGs and associated residence times in the atmosphere as well as cradle-to-grave (onsite and offsite sequestration) GHG analyses. Projected land-use changes are simply those projected by global-scale modeling of LULC, and so do not include careful local vetting. Further, projected future vegetation changes were derived entirely from dynamically downscaled climate data, which, as mentioned, carry important uncertainties, especially with respect to precipitation-an important driver of dry, mesic, and wet vegetation-type distributions. In addition, vegetation dynamics from succession or climate change were not modeled for the assessment. Nonetheless, this assessment represents a sophisticated integration of ground-based observations, planeand satellite-based remote sensing, and vegetation and climate numerical modeling, and so it provides an enormously improved carbon inventory compared to previous efforts for the region or compared to that which could be achieved relying solely on numerical modeling. We also examined the potential effects of fire on carbon emissions under current and projected future conditions for five of the seven main Hawaiian Islands (Hawbaker and others,this volume,chap. 5), and this work relied on (1) baseline carbon storage data (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6), and (2) inventoried and remotely sensed area burned (Trauernicht and others, 2015). Ecosystem disturbances considered by this report also included plant invasions. We do not consider, however, insect and disease outbreaks, hurricanes and other severe wind events, individual tree falls, or larger scale cohort senescence events of unknown cause. The assessment is organized by biome (dry, mesic, and wet forest, shrubland, and grassland), by ecological condition (native dominated, mixed native and nonnative, mostly nonnative or heavily disturbed, and barren), and by major island. The terms stock or storage refer to the total amount of organic carbon contained by a reservoir of interest (for example, soil, living biomass, coarse woody debris), whereas flux refers both to CO 2 uptake by ecosystems of Hawai\u02bbi and to CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. We relied on the following units of measurement for this report. Teragrams or petagrams of carbon (TgC or PgC) are used for estimates of storage at the scale of the State of Hawai\u02bbi, whereas teragrams or petagrams of carbon per year (TgC/yr or PgC/yr) are used for fluxes when reporting the total amount of carbon gained or released at this scale. The state-level balance of both losses and gains is called regional carbon balance (RCB). At the scale of a stand, carbon stock per unit of area is given in kilograms of carbon per square meter (kgC/m 2 ) and carbon flux per unit of area (GPP, NPP, ecosystem respiration) is given in kilograms of carbon per square meter per year (kgC/ m 2 /yr). We identify the balance of carbon gain and carbon losses at the stand level (NEP), commonly viewed as NPP minus heterotrophic respiration (R h ). The transport of DIC and DOC by stream discharge is reported in teragrams of carbon per year. Unless otherwise noted, and following convention from previous reports (Zhu and others, 2012), fluxes are all listed as positive numbers, except in balance calculations, where we use the terrestrial ecosystem science convention of listing uptake of CO 2 by ecosystems as positive and losses to the atmosphere as negative. Below is a chapter-by-chapter description of work encompassed in this assessment."}, {"section_title": "Chapter-by-Chapter Description", "text": "Chapter 2 addresses all land-cover components of the Hawai\u02bbi assessment. Jacobi and others created land-cover maps for the Hawai\u02bbi assessment by building upon diverse existing land-use and land-cover map products for the main Hawaiian Islands. The required integration across map products necessarily involved an evaluation of individual mapped units with respect to both accuracy and relevance for the Hawai\u02bbi assessment. For the former, high-resolution imagery was used to improve accuracy of the mapped units including 2-m-resolution WorldView 2 and sub-meter-resolution Pictometry Online imagery. For the latter, previous delineations were collapsed into a hierarchical classification scheme that includes 48 detailed units, 27 general units, 13 biome units, and 7 land-cover units. An important modification associated with this effort included the refined delineation of ecological condition or status of the various vegetation-cover types into four broad classes: native dominated, mixed native and nonnative dominated, nonnative dominated or disturbed, and barren. Again, WorldView 2 and Pictometry Online imagery were used to improve delineations. Chapter 3 examines potential climate-related major biome shifts during the current to end-of-century assessment period. To do this, Fortini and others mapped 500-m-resolution climatically determined wet (mean annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration [MAP-PET] >1,661 mm), mesic (MAP-PET between 0 and 1,661 mm), and dry (MAP-PET <0 mm) moisture zones under current and modeled future climate. For the former, MAT and seasonality of rainfall shape suitability of  all areas of the main Hawaiian Islands to a given moisture zone, whereas for the latter, dynamically downscaled climate data for the 2090-2100 period are used to project shifts in moisture zones. Current distributions are validated by randomly splitting baseline input data into training (80 percent) and evaluation (20 percent) sets. Finally, current and future moisture-zone projections were integrated into previous mapping of forest, shrubland, and grassland cover-type classifications (Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2) to delineate nine major biome classes (dry, mesic, and wet forest, shrubland, and grassland) and understand how these broad biome types change in response to a shift from current to projected future modeled climate. Chapter 4 addresses the conceptual foundation for understanding how nonnative species invasion impacts carbon storage, flux, and sequestration. The assessment includes this chapter because invasive species exert a large influence on the composition, structure, function, and dynamics of Hawai\u02bbi's ecosystems, and so they influence the carbon storage, flux, and sequestration capacity of Hawai\u02bbi's ecosystems. Globally there is great uncertainty about the role of invasive species in the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, with recent meta-analyses showing diverse responses depending on the functional type of the invader, the composition and functioning of the ecosystem being invaded, and the type of biome hosting these interactions (Qiu, 2015). In this chapter, Hughes and others address these questions by examining, in a case-study design, how primary groups of nonnative invasive species (nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, non-nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, and fire-prone grasses) enter into ecosystems and modify processes regulating carbon balance. Effects can be positive (as with some nitrogenfixing trees on young geological substrates), negative (as with invasion of dry-to-mesic forests by fire-prone grasses and shrubs), or neutral or uncertain (as with understory invasions in wet forests). Overall, an effort is made to establish a framework for understanding these effects based on the structural and functional characteristics of the invader, the native communities being invaded, and the biome. Chapter 5 addresses the role of fire-related disturbances on ecosystem carbon balance for the main Hawaiian Islands. Dryto-mesic areas of Hawai\u02bbi, like many areas of the dry-to-mesic tropics, experienced extensive land clearing in the past century for ranching and agricultural land uses. In the second half of the last century, both agricultural and ranching industries declined, resulting in a buildup of fuels on undermanaged ranchlands and an invasion of fire-prone vegetation on former agricultural lands. As a result, large areas of Hawai\u02bbi were converted from forests characterized by low flammability vegetation to highly flammable shrub and grass vegetation, such that today more than 25 percent of total land area in Hawaii is threatened by wildfire, a disturbance that impacts vegetation composition, ecosystem function, and carbon storage and sequestration. Hawbaker and others estimated the effects of fire on carbon storage and sequestration for the main Hawaiian islands by (1) synthesizing annual-area-burned information from ground-based fire history databases (Trauernicht and others, 2015) and two remotely sensed data sources-the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database and Landsat 7 (the latter being used to examine fire occurrences recorded in the Hawai\u02bbi fire history database but not in the MTBS database); (2) characterizing burn-severity patterns; (3) assembling biomass load data from 419 plots at 204 different sites examined in 19 studies and linking the associated plot-or site-level data to vegetation-cover types; (4) estimating the annual percentage of land in each cover type that burns; and finally (5) incorporating all of these data into the First-Order Wildland Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) to estimate biomass consumption and carbon-related fire emissions. Because of data gaps, Ni\u02bbihau, L\u0101na\u02bbi, and Kaho\u02bbolawe were excluded from analyses in this chapter. Chapter 6 examines ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes at stand to whole-island scales. To examine stocks, Selmants and others assembled aboveground biomass carbon data for forests from Asner and others (2016), litter and downed woody debris data for all ecosystems from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5), and soil carbon to 1-m depth or bedrock from the NRCS gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. Selmants and others calculated belowground live biomass using a simple exponential equation describing the general relationship between root and shoot biomass for forest plants (Mokany and others, 2006) and aboveground-to-belowground ratios for grasslands (0.73) and shrublands (1.45). The main flux of carbon into ecosystems of Hawai\u02bbi is GPP, and this was determined from a Hawai\u02bbi-specific, 0.5-km-resolution MOD17 MODIS data product, refined from the global product by using the Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2) vegetation classification to assign carbon-use efficiencies to vegetation-cover types. Further, a local, high-resolution climate database (Fortini and others, this volume, chap. 3) was used to drive MOD17-modeled GPP estimates. Estimates of NPP were determined by applying Hawai\u02bbi-specific MOD17 assumed carbon-use efficiency coefficients to GPP estimates. Further, ecosystem respiration (heterotrophic plus autotrophic) was estimated from separate equations for forests, shrublands, and grasslands developed from published studies in order to estimate NEP for all islands. Chapter 7 evaluates the role of freshwater transport of carbon into oceans, including both stream transport and submarine groundwater discharge. For the former, MacKenzie and others estimated the flux of carbon transported in freshwater perennial streams to nearshore areas on Hawai\u02bbi, Maui, Moloka\u02bbi, O\u02bbahu, and Kaua\u02bbi Islands. There are no perennial streams on L\u0101na\u02bbi and Kaho\u02bbolawe and so they were excluded from the analysis. Long-term data for discharge, pH, temperature, alkalinity, and carbon (total inorganic, total organic, and particulate) from 16 gaged perennial streams from across Hawai\u02bbi, as well as watershed characteristics such as drainage area, basin slope, soil permeability, and land-cover class distributions, were used to build the relationships needed to predict freshwater carbon inputs to the nearshore using the regression-based Load Estimator Model. These 16 streams were selected because for each stream, daily discharge data and a minimum of 12 sample collections over 3 years were available for water chemistry and quantity. The calibrated and validated model was used to estimate daily carbon flux for more than 400 ungaged Hawai\u02bbi perennial streams with modeled mean flow data, estimated rainfall, and channel morphological measurements. Critically, this chapter did not examine ephemeral streams, which make up a large proportion of the total streams in Hawai\u02bbi. For the latter flux, MacKenzie and others used a hydrological budgeting approach to estimate submarine groundwater discharge for the main Hawaiian Islands and groundwater chemical data from wells to estimate inorganic and organic carbon fluxes. Chapter 8 addresses how changing climate and land use or land cover will potentially impact future carbon storage and flux in the State of Hawai\u02bbi. To do this, Sleeter and others relied on the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS), an integrated state-and-transition simulation stock-flow model that is linked to the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), itself a carbon-flux simulator. The model structure allows for the entire state to be mapped to 1 of 189 condition states (3 moisture zones, 9 land-cover types, and 7 islands). LUCAS provides the ability to impose transitions on each cell, including rates of change to new condition states, with LUCAS tracking time since transition (defined as the set of changes that move a cell from one condition to another) or age of vegetation captured within a cell (the latter being important for understanding the effects of fire on carbon storage, for example). In theory, any cell type could transition into any other cell type, but transition probabilities are determined by regularly updated adjacency functions, protected area status, and the professional judgement of land managers and the coauthor team, which limits or even eliminates the likelihood of some transitions. Following initialization with data derived from the above chapters, these probabilities allow for changes in land use to be coupled to a stock-flow carbon submodel, which can track associated changes in ecosystem carbon storage under the selected IPCC \"business as usual\" scenario. To enhance the level of detail achieved by LUCAS, each cell was modeled using IBIS to secure the following outputs: living wood, standing and downed deadwood, litter, and soil. Inputs to the IBIS model were NPP and GPP values reported in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6), with rates constrained by targeted amounts of living biomass that could not be exceeded. From this initial startup, the IBIS model was used to simulate seven flow paths for each cell including growth, litterfall, humification, mortality, deadfall, emissions, and leaching, each of which varies according to the cell type, vegetation type, surrounding environmental conditions, and transitions. Chapter 9 synthesizes estimates of NPP and R h from Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6), aquatic carbon fluxes to nearshore waters from MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7), and carbon emissions from fire from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5) to calculate net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and carbon sequestration potential for the baseline period. These synthesized estimates of NECB and carbon sequestration potential were then compared to NECB and carbon sequestration potential calculated using the first 5 years (2012-2016) of modeled simulation estimates of carbon fluxes by the IBIS ecosystem carbon submodel of the LUCAS model in Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8) to provide a range in baseline estimates. The overall trend in projected future ecosystem carbon balance and sequestration was examined by comparing islandwide and statewide estimates of mean annual NEP and NECB from the first 10 years of the modeled simulation (2011-2022) described in Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8) to islandwide and statewide estimates of mean annual NEP and NECB from the final 10 years of the modeled simulation (2051)(2052)(2053)(2054)(2055)(2056)(2057)(2058)(2059)(2060)(2061). Implications, limitations, and uncertainties of the approach used to estimate statewide NECB and carbon sequestration are discussed, as are proposed mechanisms to improve future assessments in Hawai\u02bbi.

A primary factor leading to the development of the unique native flora and vegetation of Hawai\u02bbi is the extreme isolation of this island archipelago; the closest continental area is North America, more than 3,200 km away (Juvik, 1998). The vast distances to other biological regions has dramatically restricted the number of species that have been able to successfully disperse across the Pacific Ocean and establish on these volcanic islands. The unique composition, structure, and species dynamics (such as disturbance history, species invasion, and succession) of the vegetation in Hawai\u02bbi, in addition to land-use and land-cover changes, make this tropical island archipelago an essential addition to the overall carbon assessment of the United States. The currently documented native Hawaiian flora is estimated to have resulted from just 258 successful colonizing species (Price and Wagner, 2011), which Juvik (1998) equates to species getting established in these islands at an average rate of one species every 98,000 years. Successfully colonizing species generally have small seeds that can be blown over the ocean by winds or dispersed by birds. Many of the ancestral species that ultimately became established in Hawai\u02bbi were subsequently able to radiate into a myriad of new endemic species (Wagner and Funk, 1995). One other important result of this isolation was that only a few tree species could become naturally established in Hawai\u02bbi and the resulting plant community composition and structure reflects the disharmonic nature of these few successfully colonizing taxa. This is clearly seen with \u02bbohi\u02bba (Metrosideros polymorpha), which is the most abundant tree species in most native Hawaiian plant communities. \u02bbOhi\u02bba is the dominant species forming the tree canopy in habitats that range from sea level to tree line, and it also dominates the vegetation from the wettest areas to very dry zones (Wagner and others, 1999;Mueller-Dombois and others, 2013). Perhaps the most remarkable feature of \u02bbohi\u02bba is the fact that it displays most of the characteristics of a pioneer species and is able to quickly colonize new or disturbed sites through dispersal of its very small, wind-blown seeds. Additionally, \u02bbohi\u02bba is relatively shade intolerant, another pioneer species characteristic. In most continental ecosystems, pioneer species are the first colonizers of a new or disturbed site but are eventually replaced by more typical climax species that are best adapted to getting established as secondary species in more mature habitats and are able to retain their dominance since they can regenerate even in dense understory shade conditions. Within this backdrop of the disharmonic Hawaiian flora filtered by isolation, the vegetation on the main Hawaiian Islands is influenced by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors.\nSharp climate and elevation gradients in the main Hawaiian Islands lead to huge vegetation variation over relatively short distances. Hawai\u02bbi possesses 25 of the 35 Holdridge global life zones (Asner and others 2005), which results in large variability in biomass across the Hawaiian landscape others, 2009, 2011). This variability means potential climate shifts can have major implications to land carbon through shifts in Hawai\u02bbi vegetation distribution. An important step in quantifying the potential changes in carbon storage owing to projected climate shifts is quantifying how the vegetation may change over time under future scenarios. However, projecting potential shifts in vegetation and plant communities has been a major challenge in climate change research (Cramer and others, 2001). There are clear implications of such shifts to the conservation of Hawaiian native species and their habitat, especially given the number of endangered species in Hawai\u02bbi and their high vulnerability to climate change (Fortini andothers, 2013, 2015;Krushelnycky and others, 2013). This gap in knowledge of potential vegetation shifts in response to climate also hinders the quantification of shifts in potential landscape carbon storage that can allow for evaluation of the viability of carbon sequestration efforts (Bachelet and others, 2001;Lucht and others, 2006;Gibbs, 2007). For a relatively small isolated land area such as Hawai\u02bbi, there are few research approaches available to help us explore the potential climate-based shifts in vegetation. Vegetationdistribution projections based on global vegetation models do not typically apply to isolated islands. Although part of the reason is the coarse spatial resolution of most global vegetation models (Bonan and others, 2003;Gonzalez and others, 2010;Pavlick and others, 2013), another major challenge arises from the numerous differences among island and continental systems under which vegetation models are parameterized. For instance, isolated disharmonic flora (Ziegler, 2002), which lead to differences in species richness (Ostertag and others, 2014), fire prevalence and behavior (Benoit and others, 2009;Ellsworth and others, 2013), and ongoing biological invasions (Asner and others, 2008;Mascaro and others, 2008), indicate mechanistic models parameterized for continental systems are of limited applicability to Hawai\u02bbi and other isolated archipelagos.\nNonnative invasive species have altered virtually all Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystems in a variety of ways, including substantial changes to the storage, production, and cycling of carbon (Ehrenfeld, 2003). Globally, nonnative species have changed the composition, structure, and function of countless native ecosystems (Elton, 1958;Vitousek and others, 1996), and the extent and influence of nonnative species invasions are considered substantial components of global environmental change (Vitousek and others, 1997). In turn, other aspects of environmental change (for example, land-use change, nitrogen deposition, and increased atmospheric-CO 2 concentrations) have likely amplified the spread and influence of invasive species (Dukes and Mooney, 1999). Nonnative species may alter carbon storage and dynamics by invading open niches in plant communities or by displacing native species by virtue of greater competitive ability and (or) reproductive output. However, nonnative species that generate the largest changes in carbon storage and cycling in ecosystems are those with the capacity to alter ecosystem processes, in effect resetting the rules under which all other species in the system operate (Vitousek, Walker, and others, 1987). Such processes include hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, natural disturbance regimes, primary production, and decomposition (Vitousek and others, 1997). These latter two processes represent the most direct determinants of carbon storage and cycling in ecosystems. Isolated oceanic islands are generally more susceptible to, and more heavily impacted by, nonnative species invasions than are continental systems. Island species collectively tend to exhibit proportionally higher levels of endemism (species found only on said islands), lower levels of diversity, commonly disharmonic plant and animal communities (lacking important functional or structural components, such as ants or nitrogen-fixing plants), and lower tolerance to disturbance (Vitousek, Loope, and Stone, 1987;Vitousek, 1990). The native biota of the Hawaiian Islands, Earth's most isolated archipelago, strongly exhibits these characteristics. Over 90 percent of Hawai\u02bbi's native flora is endemic, and many plant growth forms and (or) functional types that are abundant in continental systems are underrepresented or entirely absent in Hawai\u02bbi (for example, palms, pyrophytic grasses, terrestrial mammals). These attributes, coupled with high rates of nonnative-species introductions following European contact 220 years ago, have resulted in an island flora comprising about 1,200 native plant species and a\nRestoring, protecting, and maintaining functional ecosystems that can continue to sequester CO 2 from the atmosphere offers a powerful set of tools for mitigating climate change, which, paired with policies and regulations, can serve to directly offset anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The energy budgets of ecosystems are controlled by albedo, evapotranspiration, and resulting changes to solar heating and water balance. These drivers, in turn, regulate ecosystem capacity to fix and retain carbon, and so modify atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (Bonan, 2008). The total amount of carbon entering ecosystems through the process of photosynthesis is gross primary production (GPP). The difference between GPP and carbon losses from autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration is net ecosystem production (NEP) or net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) when additional carbon losses from disturbances and lateral fluxes are also considered (Chapin and others, 2006). When NECB is positive, carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere and stored in ecosystem carbon stocks, potentially offsetting anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (for example, fossil fuel combustion and other emissions). Global estimates of greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and gas flares were 9.5\u00b10. The amount of carbon stored and sequestered by specific ecosystem types varies widely (Whittaker and Likens, 1973;Bonan, 2008). Globally, forest ecosystems contain nearly 45 percent of all carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems and account for nearly 50 percent of all carbon sequestered by ecosystems (Bonan, 2008). However, savannas, shrublands, and grasslands can also be highly productive (Lieth, 1973;Whittaker and Likens, 1973), and because of their large areal extent, non-forest ecosystems hold a large proportion of global carbon stocks (Bonan, 2008). For instance, temperate grasslands store 6 PgC and sequester 5.6 PgC/yr globally (Saugier and others, 2001). Among forests, tropical forests tend to store and sequester more carbon than other ecosystems (471\u00b193 PgC and 1.02\u00b10.47 PgC/ yr, respectively [Pan and others, 2011]), even though they cover only 12 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface area (Bonan, 2008). Boreal forests and temperate forests also have large carbon stocks (282\u00b122.5 PgC and 118.6\u00b16.3 PgC, respectively) and contribute substantially to global net primary production (NPP) (0.5\u00b10.08 PgC/yr and 0.72\u00b10.08 PgC/yr, respectively) (Pan and others, 2011). In certain cases, carbon stored in and sequestered\nTerrestrial ecosystems in the tropics have the potential to be major carbon sinks, yet intensive land use and development can reduce that potential or even convert these ecosystems to net carbon sources to the atmosphere. Because of its steep environmental gradients and geological history, Hawai\u02bbi has been home to several plot-and stand-level studies examining the physical and biological controls over tropical ecosystem carbon storage and flux, with a focus on soils, live biomass, and plant productivity (Townsend and others, 1995;Torn and others, 1997;Aplet and others, 1998;Herbert and Fownes, 1999;Schuur and others, 2001;Giardina and others, 2003;Litton and others, 2006;Selmants and others, 2014;Giardina and others, 2014). More recently several landscapelevel studies on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi have examined biotic and environmental controls on aboveground carbon density (ACD) (Asner, Hughes, and others, 2009, Asner and others, 2010, Hughes and others, 2014, including the first whole-island estimate of aboveground carbon stocks for one of the main Hawaiian Islands (Asner and others, 2011). These landscape-scale studies integrated much of the previous research conducted at the plot scale but focused on a limited set of carbon pools or fluxes.\nPacific high islands of volcanic origin comprise watersheds with unique geomorphological, hydrological, and biological features compared to continental watersheds. Leeward and windward coasts are typically separated by high mountain ranges and consist of spatially compact, steeply sloped watersheds with relatively simple drainage networks and low-order streams (Resh and deSzalay, 1995). Because of their characteristics, stream systems on Pacific islands respond rapidly to short pulses of intense rain events that result from moisture laden airmasses moving off of the ocean and rising up along warm, high, volcanic island landmasses until they reach their dew point. Windward coasts are strongly influenced by trade winds and are characterized by perennial streams, whereas leeward coasts are isolated from trade winds by mountains and are characterized by intermittent streams. The spates or \"freshettes\" in windward perennial streams scour stream bottoms and deliver terrestrial-derived organic matter to nearshore waters. The remote nature of Pacific islands has resulted in unique assemblages of endemic fauna as well as the absence of key species found in continental streams (Bright, 1982;Polhemus and others, 2000). Pacific-island streams generally lack native leafshredding organisms (such as stoneflies or caddisflies) (Larned, Baseline and Projected Future Carbon Storage and Carbon Fluxes in Ecosystems of Hawai'i Editors: Paul C. Selmants, Christian P. Giardina, James D. Jacobi, and Zhiliang Zhu U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1834, 20172000Benstead and others, 2009;MacKenzie and others, 2013) and support lower levels of aquatic fungal biomass (MacKenzie and others, 2013) that are commonly found in continental streams and play an important role in leaf-litter breakdown and thus the carbon cycle (Vannote and others, 1980;Webster and Benfield, 1986). As a result, leaf-litter breakdown is much slower and is limited to fungal and microbial activity as well as physical abrasion (MacKenzie and others, 2013) resulting in a high export of coarse particulate organic carbon, especially during storm flows (Larned, 2000;Wiegner and others, 2009). Despite the lack of shredding insects, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is still an important component of Pacific-island streams (Wiegner and others, 2009;Wiegner and Tubal, 2010) and nearshore waters (Atwood and others, 2012;Johnson and Wiegner, 2014). Modeled DOC fluxes from Pacific high islands in the Oceania region were equal to DOC fluxes to coastal zones in North America and Africa, with the per-area rate of DOC flux being greater in Oceania than anywhere in the world (Harrison and others, 2005). Despite these modeled results, few studies have attempted to build carbon budgets from Pacific high islands; most studies have focused on POC and DOC fluxes from the Hawaiian Islands (Ringuet and MacKenzie, 2005;Mead and Wiegner, 2010;Wiegner and Tubal, 2010;Johnson and Wiegner, 2014). Baseline information on carbon budgets from high-island streams and groundwater and the factors that influence those budgets are paramount as human populations are expected to significantly increase in this area of the world over the next 25 years (Laws and Ferentinos, 2003) and climate and precipitation patterns are expected to change (Chu and Chen, 2005;Timm and others, 2011). Furthermore, flux of terrestrial-derived carbon to nearshore waters supports high levels of nearshore plankton and microbial production (Ringuet and MacKenzie, 2005;Wiegner and others, 2009;Mead and Wiegner, 2010;Johnson and Wiegner, 2014) that are fed on by many species of culturally and ecological important fin and shellfish (Atwood and others, 2012). This chapter reports results from a first attempt to estimate carbon fluxes and yields from surface-and groundwater sources to nearshore waters around the seven main Hawaiian Islands: Hawai\u02bbi, Moloka\u02bbi, L\u0101na\u02bbi, Kaho\u02bbolawe, Maui, O\u02bbahu, and Kaua\u02bbi. The steeply sloped and \"flashy\" nature of these and other Pacific-island stream systems has resulted in the development of few lakes and ponds. Furthermore, carbon and streamflow data from surface water were largely restricted to perennial streams and rivers. Therefore, our surface water model only focuses on carbon fluxes from perennial streams. Lentic systems could potentially play an important role in the overall carbon cycle of Pacific islands (Stackpoole and others, 2012) and additional information is needed from these ecosystems. However, when combined with reservoirs, lentic systems represent less than 0.03 percent of the landmass in Hawai\u02bbi. Additional information on flow and carbon dynamics of intermittent streams is also needed as these ecosystems are often overlooked and can contribute significantly to overall stream function (Datry and others, 2014; Strauch and others, 2014). Finally, river CO 2 emissions were also not included in this assessment. Additional data are needed to quantify this important component of the aquatic carbon cycle in Hawai\u02bbi. The objectives of this chapter are to (1) estimate coastal export of dissolved inorganic and total organic carbon from perennial streams and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), (2) compare carbon export values across the seven main Hawaiian Islands and evaluate inter-island variability, and (3) provide a preliminary examination of how the onset of climate change would impact carbon export to coastal waters.\nHawai\u02bbi is unique among the United States because of its isolation, tropical climate, discontinuous landmass, high degree of endemism, history of land-cover conversion, and dominance of some areas by invasive species. The year-round growing season, high rainfall on windward sides of islands and high fertility of volcanically derived soils all indicate that terrestrial ecosystems of Hawai\u02bbi have a high capacity to influence the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) between ecosystems and the atmosphere and influence the overall ecosystem carbon balance of the state. However, much of Hawai\u02bbi has not previously been included in any major national carbon and greenhouse inventory reports. Thus, the current baseline carbon balance is poorly understood at a statewide level, and the potential for climate and land-use change to affect carbon dynamics in Hawai\u02bbi has not been formally assessed. The main outcomes of the U.S. Geological Survey carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi include (1) estimates of the amount of carbon stored in ecosystems, (2) estimates of the capacity of ecosystems to sequester carbon, (3) estimates of the rate of carbon fluxes in and out of the ecosystems, and (4) evaluation of the effects of processes or driving forces that control ecosystem carbon balance. To support the outcomes of the assessment for the entire State of Hawai\u02bbi, the assessors sought to address the magnitude of carbon pools and fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems of the Hawaiian Islands and how the carbon balance of these ecosystems might be influenced by climate change, wildfire, leaching losses of carbon to nearshore waters and changes in land use and land cover. Chapters 2 through 8 of this assessment addressed these goals separately for different components and questions. In this chapter we focus on synthesizing results across terrestrial ecosystems of the Hawaiian Islands to summarize information at the statewide level on changes in carbon stocks, carbon fluxes, and ecosystem carbon balance for current baseline (2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013) and projected future (2012-2061) periods."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2.

Selmants, Christian P. Giardina, James D. Jacobi, andZhiliang Zhu U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1834, 2017 Moisture availability, temperature, and substrate type and age are primary factors that determine the composition, structure, and distribution of plant species and communities across the archipelago (Pratt and Gon, 1998;Price and others, 2012). However, human changes to the original landscape (for example, agriculture and development of urban areas) Warshauer, 1998), as well as impacts from a multitude of introduced invasive plant and animal species (Staples and Cowie, 2001), have dramatically altered the composition and distribution of many of the plant communities currently found in Hawai\u02bbi, particularly in lower elevation areas. The northeast trade winds that blow in this region of the Pacific Ocean more than 75 percent of the time generally result in wet windward habitats and dry leeward habitats on all of the main Hawaiian Islands (Giambelluca and others, 2013). The only exceptions to this pattern are seen on the tall volcanoes on the islands of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui, where the habitat becomes arid in the subalpine and alpine zones that lie above the trade-wind inversion layer (Giambelluca and others, 2013). Additionally the western (Kona) side of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi is in the wind shadow of the two large volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea. As a result, the weather pattern in this area is not driven by the trade winds but by a daily convection-circulation system that results in a pattern of onshore winds during the daytime that allows for the development of much wetter conditions at mid-elevations, even in this leeward part of the island (Giambelluca and Schroeder, 1998). Price and others (2012) produced a map showing the distribution of seven moisture zones across the main Hawaiian Islands and it clearly depicts these two anomalous conditions ( fig. 2.1). Although there have been many maps produced that depict vegetation for the State of Hawai\u02bbi, only a few of these display land cover for all of the main Hawaiian Islands, and most of those that were created before the year 2000 have very generalized units or are somewhat inaccurate as a result of more recent landuse changes or poor resolution (both spatial and spectral) in the imagery that was used to produce the map. Some of the more detailed and accurate maps include the Hawai\u02bbi GAP Analysis (HIGAP) land cover map (Gon and others, 2006), the NOAA C-CAP land cover map (NOAA National Ocean Service Coastal Services Center, 2012), and the more recently released Hawai\u02bbi LANDFIRE EVT land cover map (U.S. Geological Survey, 2009). However, all of these maps as originally produced were not considered to be detailed enough or current enough, or they had other classification issues that would not allow them to be used as the primary base for the carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi (CAH). For the CAH we integrated components from several of these previously mentioned land-use and land-cover mapping efforts and combined them into a single new land-cover map (CAH land cover) that was further updated using very high resolution imagery. The hierarchical classification system of the CAH land cover map allows for grouping the mapped units into different configurations, ranging from very detailed plant communities reflecting current conditions to very generalized major land-cover units and biomes that represent land use and potential vegetation zones, respectively. Additionally, we created an updated habitat status map based on the original version described in Price and others (2012). This map (CAH habitat status) depicts the distribution of plant communities that are (1) dominated by native species, (2) mixed native and alien species, (3) heavily disturbed areas with few native species, and (4) areas with less than 5 percent vegetation cover.\nEditors: Paul C. Selmants, Christian P. Giardina, James D. Jacobi, andZhiliang Zhu U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1834, 2017 This chapter represents the first comprehensive assessment of terrestrial-ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes across the main Hawaiian Islands in an effort to better understand how carbon stocks and fluxes vary by ecosystem component across islands and among ecosystem types. The goal of this chapter is to provide robust baseline estimates of carbon storage and fluxes across the Hawaiian Islands based on the best available data. This baseline data will then be used as input to predict how terrestrial carbon cycling may respond to projected future changes in land use, land cover, disturbance, and climate (see Sleeter and others,this volume,chap. 8). Conventional carbon cycle terminology (Chapin and others, 2006) was used in this chapter and throughout this report, as noted in Giardina and others (this volume, chap. 1). Of particular relevance here is the concept of net ecosystem production (NEP), which is defined as the imbalance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R e ). For this report, NEP was estimated by subtracting R e from GPP, therefore, a positive value indicates carbon accumulation or sequestration within an ecosystem (a net carbon sink), and a negative value indicates a loss of carbon from the ecosystem to the atmosphere (a net carbon source). This definition is consistent with that suggested by Chapin and others (2006)."}, {"section_title": "Input Data and Methods", "text": "The land-cover map used for the CAH was created by updating and combining spatial units from several previously produced maps using Esri ArcGIS ver. 10.2. Although the original maps were developed using imagery from various dates between 2000 and 2012, we considered them to represent \"current\" (about 2014) conditions. Base maps for this newly compiled CAH land-cover map included vegetation units and boundaries from the HIGAP land cover map (Gon and others, 2006), land-use units from the 2005 NOAA C-CAP map (NOAA National Ocean Service Coastal Services Center, 2012), the \"bare\" (<5 percent vegetation cover) map unit from the Hawai\u02bbi LANDFIRE map (Rollins, 2009;U.S. Geological Survey, 2009), and data on the distribution of managed tree plantations for the main Hawaiian Islands on both state lands (Yoshiko Akashi, Hawai\u02bbi Division of Forestry and Wildlife, unpublished data) and private lands (Nicholas Koch, Forest Solutions Inc., unpublished data). All spatial files were projected in UTM Zone 4 using the NAD83 datum. The HIGAP, NOAA C-CAP, and LANDFIRE maps were all based on LANDSAT TM imagery with 30 by 30 m (900 m 2 ) pixels. The tree-plantation maps were originally produced as polygon feature layers so they were converted to raster format and aligned to the same 30 m grid system that was used for the other maps and for the final CAH land-cover map. Each land-use or land-cover data layer was reviewed for accuracy of its selected units by comparing the mapped units to more recent high-resolution WorldView 2 (WV2) digital satellite imagery collected by DigitalGlobe in 2010 (<2-m pixel size; https://www.digitalglobe.com) and very high resolution imagery from Pictometry Online (POL; Pictometery International, 2014), which were also projected in UTM Zone 4 NAD 83. Where differences were found between the original mapped land-use and land-cover units and the high-resolution imagery, corrections were made to the original raster maps by reclassifying pixels to their correct values using the raster editing program Grid Editor developed by ARIS B.V. (2014). The HIGAP land cover layer needed the greatest amount of modification; these changes included (1) manually correcting misclassified pixels based on current high-resolution imagery, (2) combining similar or redundant mapping units with different names, (3) reclassifying some of the ambiguous HIGAP units (for example, \"uncharacterized forest\") into other mapped units, and (4) separating several of the HIGAP units (for example, \"ohi\u02bba forest\", \"koa forest\") into subunits based on moisture zones described and mapped by Price and others (2012). The updated map layers were then combined into a single raster map (CAH land-cover), which also has 30-m pixel resolution, using the   ArcGIS Mosaic tool. For this final map the updated HIGAP land cover map was used as the base map, with values from the NOAA C-CAP, LANDFIRE, and tree plantation maps replacing the HIGAP raster values that they overlaid. The mapped units for the CAH land-cover map are linked to the alliance and association levels of the revised National Vegetation Classification (rUSNVC) which is based on the National Vegetation Classification Standard that was formally adopted by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in 2008 (FGDC, 2008). These units also correspond with NatureServe's Terrestrial Ecological Systems Classification (NatureServe, 2010(NatureServe, , 2011). However, one major difference between the various CAH land-cover classification levels and the rUSNVC classification is that in the CAH land-cover map we did not separate the units into lowland, montane, and alpine units. The CAH habitat status map was developed by modifying the original Habitat Quality map produced by Price and others (2012) using several more recent land-use and land-cover maps and imagery. This map was revised by combining mapped agriculture and land use, as well as the \"bare\" categories from the NOAA C-CAP 2005 map (NOAA National Ocean Service Coastal Services Center, 2012), and adding road corridors to the heavily disturbed category based on the Tiger Roads layer (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). Additionally, corrections were made to this new version of the map by visually inspecting previously mapped units and comparing them to recent high-resolution imagery including WorldView 2 multi-spectral imagery and to very high resolution imagery obtained from Pictometry Online. Where needed, specific changes to pixels were reclassified using the ARIS GRID Editor. Because the CAH habitat status map was revised directly from a previous map, there are slight differences in the area calculations reported here for this map relative to areas reported for the CAH land-cover map, which was clipped by a different island polygon.\n\n\nOur area of interest encompasses the Hawaiian Islands, and includes the wide variety of invasive species and invaded communities present throughout the archipelago. We illustrate prominent examples of nonnative invasive plants and their impact on carbon cycling and storage-usually in relation to those of adjacent native-dominated plant communities-using data compiled from published literature.\nThe approach for this analysis included several steps: (1) estimating annual area burned for Hawai\u02bbi using satellitederived data to determine the spatial extent of wildland fire incidents and to characterize patterns of burn severity, (2) developing a database of biomass loads for different vegetation types from existing studies, (3) linking values from the biomass data to a satellite-derived land-cover classification, (4) combining the raster burn-severity data with the land-cover data to estimate annual area burned by vegetation type, and (5) estimating biomass consumption and fire emissions using the combination of the burn severity with land-cover classes and their associated biomass loads. The individual steps in this analysis and the data they depended on are described in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\nFor the current baseline period, we synthesized estimates of net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (R h ) from Selmants and others (this volume, chap. 6), aquatic fluxes to Chapter 9.

Jacobi, and Zhiliang Zhu U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1834, 2017 nearshore waters from MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7), and fire emissions from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5) and compare these to the first 5 years (2012-2016) of modeled simulation estimates of carbon fluxes by the IBIS ecosystem carbon submodel from Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8). Estimates of NPP derived from statewide MODIS GPP (MOD17) were used to calibrate the IBIS annual NPP estimates, and baseline fire estimates from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5) were used to parameterize IBIS annual carbon emissions from wildfire. Estimates of baseline carbon fluxes to nearshore waters from stream-and groundwater discharge from MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7) were not used to either parameterize or calibrate IBIS-submodel estimates of carbon-leaching losses, so these independent estimates can be used to cross-validate each other. Likewise, estimates of R h were derived from regression-based estimates of ecosystem respiration (R e ) (Selmants and others, this volume, chap. 6) minus MODISbased estimates of NPP and were not incorporated into IBIS estimates of R h ; these estimates can be cross validated with one another, as can estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP), the difference between NPP and R h . For the current baseline period, mean annual carbon fluxes were calculated separately by island and expressed in TgC/yr. For the projected future period (2012-2016), net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) (see Chapin and others, 2006) for terrestrial ecosystems was calculated as follows: NECB = NPP -R h -Fire C -C leaching loss -Land Use C flux for which the abbreviations for the fluxes are defined as above. Land Use C flux is a brief pulse of carbon lost to the atmosphere associated with land clearing and conversion, for example, urbanization and conversion to agriculture. We also compare independent estimates of projected future carbon losses from terrestrial ecosystems through stream-and groundwater discharge to nearshore marine waters from MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7) and Sleeter and others (this volume, chap. 8), both of which are based on projected future changes in moisture zones induced by climate change as described in Fortini and others (this volume, chap. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Habitats and Land-Cover Units", "text": "The CAH land-cover classification is hierarchical with 48 CAH Detailed land-cover units, which can be grouped into 27 CAH general land-cover units, 13 CAH biome units, and 7 CAH major land-cover units (Appendix 1). The CAH detailed landcover units generally correspond to the rUSNVC association level, the CAH general land-cover units correspond to the rUSNVC group level, and the CAH biome units correspond to the rUSNVC subclass level. Although the CAH detailed land-cover units more clearly depict the current vegetation of the area, we used the CAH general land-cover units for calculating aboveground carbon stocks (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5), and the CAH biome units were used as a starting point for projecting vegetation distribution in 2100 (see Fortini and others,this volume,chap. 3). Based on our revised CAH habitat status map, more than 16 percent of the landscape on the main Hawaiian Islands has been heavily impacted by agriculture, urban development, and resort development ( fig. 2.2; table 2.1). Approximately 31 percent of the islands are still dominated by native vegetation and 36 percent of the area has habitats that are somewhat disturbed, with a mix of native and alien plant species. The remaining area, 16 percent,  Shaded-relief base modified from U.S. Geological Survey National Elevation Dataset, 2015. has less than 5 percent vegetation cover; most of this area is in the alpine zone on the islands of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui, although some relatively large non-vegetated areas are found on recent lava flows, primarily on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. For the most part this non-vegetated unit can be considered to be native dominated, particularly in the alpine and subalpine zones. From a vegetation-structure perspective, more than 35 percent of the current landscape on the main Hawaiian Islands is covered by forest, dominated variously by native tree species, alien tree species, or a mix of the two ( fig. 2.3; table 2.2). Another 16 percent is mapped as shrubland and approximately 17 percent as grassland. Non-vegetated areas, primarily on Maui and Hawai\u02bbi Island, compose almost 19 percent of the map. The remaining area was mapped as either agriculture, developed, or \"other\" (wetlands and bogs), which compose less than 0.2 percent of the map. The 13 CAH biome units incorporate a combination of vegetation structure (for example, forest, shrubland, and grassland) and moisture zones from the Price and others (2012) map (fig. 2.4;table 2.3). Although this depiction of the CAH land-cover map also includes units that relate directly to modification of the landscape by human development, the basic land cover and moisture zones could be generalized across these areas to create the base for the current and future biome maps described in Fortini and others (this volume,chap. 3). The CAH General Map units are even more detailed and display the distribution of plant communities that incorporate vegetation structure, moisture zones, and status of the dominant vegetation (native dominated, mixed native-alien communities, and alien dominated), as well as land-use units (fig. 2.5; table 2.4). This map level was used as the basis for the overall carbon assessment described in MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7). Finally, the 48 CAH detailed land-cover units bring dominant species into the unit description (Appendix 1). Although we did not use this level of detail directly in our CAH analysis, these units form the basis for the more generalized units described above. Additionally, this most detailed map level will likely be useful as a base map for other research and management applications in the main Hawaiian Islands.

In Hawai\u02bbi, where conservation efforts tend to be habitat focused, the lack of projections of vegetation shifts under future climate is a major knowledge gap for developing management actions aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation. \u2022 As a first approximation of such changes, we have modeled potential shifts of terrestrial vegetation across the Hawaiian landscape between now and the end of this century. Our approach relies on modeling the relation between current climate and the distribution of broad, climatically determined moisture zones (for example, dry, mesic, and wet areas) that form the basis of natural landcover classification classes in Hawai\u02bbi (for example, dry forests, wet forests, mesic shrublands). \u2022 In this approach we modeled the suitability of the landscape to each moisture zone based on its relation to mean annual temperature, wet season precipitation, and dry season precipitation and then integrated these individual moisturezone models into landscape moisture-zone projections under current and end-of-century climate scenarios. \u2022 We integrated our moisture-zone projections into a detailed Hawai\u02bbi land-cover map to derive a first approximation of climate-based shifts in land cover in Hawai\u02bbi. The results show we can accurately replicate the current distribution of Hawaiian moisture zones using simple climate metrics based on temperature and precipitation. \u2022 Our resulting models identify areas in the landscape where projected shifts in climate may lead to moisture-driven vegetation shifts with clear consequences to overall carbon storage across the archipelago.\n\u2022 Invasive species are widely distributed among most of Hawai\u02bbi's forests, woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands. \u2022 Primary groups of invasive nonnative species include nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, non-nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, and grasses. Each species within these groups may have a positive, negative, or neutral effect on carbon stocks, depending on the structural and functional characteristics of the invader as well as those of the native communities undergoing invasion. Common invasion scenarios and their ramifications for carbon storage and cycling are presented. \u2022 Although there is worldwide interest to protect and even increase carbon storage in ecosystems to mitigate climate change (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2006), and invasion of nonnative plants into Hawai\u02bbi's ecosystems may, in some cases, increase carbon stocks across landscapes of Hawai\u02bbi, invasive species are commonly the primary cause of profound, and in many cases irreparable, damage to Hawai\u02bbi's native ecosystems, degrading their compositional, structural, and functional integrity. In addition, it is not clear whether any carbon sequestration benefit of invasive species can be sustained on a long-term basis.\n\u2022 Carbon storage and fluxes were examined for terrestrial ecosystems on the seven main Hawaiian Islands: Hawai\u02bbi, Maui, Moloka\u02bbi, L\u0101na\u02bbi, Kaho\u02bbolawe, O\u02bbahu, and Kaua\u02bbi. Total carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems across these islands was estimated to be 258 TgC, of which 71 percent was soil organic carbon to 1 m depth, 24 percent was live biomass (above and below ground), and 5 percent was dead biomass (a combination of litter and downed woody debris). \u2022 Hawai\u02bbi Island, the largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, stored 136 TgC, which accounted for 58 percent of the total carbon storage in the State of Hawai\u02bbi. The island of Kaua\u02bbi had the highest carbon density (carbon storage per unit area), estimated as 23.5 kgC/m 2 , followed by O\u02bbahu (20.5 kgC/m 2 ), Maui (17.1 kgC/m 2 ), Moloka\u02bbi (16.1 kgC/m 2 ), and Hawai\u02bbi Island (14.0 kgC/m 2 ). \u2022 Live-biomass carbon storage in native forests was estimated as 32 TgC, which was 51 percent of all carbon stored as live biomass (63 TgC), followed by invaded forests (21 TgC) and alien tree plantations (6 TgC). \u2022 Between 2003 and 2014, gross primary production (GPP) across the seven islands averaged 20.2 TgC/yr, with Hawai\u02bbi Island accounting for 55 percent of this flux (11.2 TgC/yr). As was the case with carbon storage, the island of Kaua\u02bbi had the highest mean annual GPP carbon flux density (GPP per unit land area), estimated at 1.85 kgC/m 2 , followed by Moloka\u02bbi (1.68 kgC/m 2 ), O\u02bbahu (1.47 kgC/m 2 ), Maui (1.34 kgC/m 2 ), and Hawai\u02bbi Island (1.07 kgC/m 2 ). \u2022 Between 2003 and 2014, the estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP) in terrestrial ecosystems across the seven islands averaged 2.38 TgC/yr (a positive value denotes a carbon sink). Among ecosystem types, native forests represented the largest single terrestrial carbon sink with NEP of 1.26 TgC/yr, which accounted for 53 percent of total annual carbon sequestration. Alien grasslands were estimated to be a net carbon source to the atmosphere with NEP estimated at -0.56 TgC/yr, because ecosystem respiration exceeded GPP in large areas of alien dry grasslands.\n\u2022 Total carbon flux to nearshore waters from perennial streams and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) from five of the seven main Hawaiian Islands was estimated to be 0.309 TgC/yr. This total was dominated by SGD inputs (74 percent or 0.228 TgC/yr), which were largely composed of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Dominance by DIC in the total flux was partially the result of a lack of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) datasets and the general absence of particulate organic carbon (POC) from groundwater. SGD fluxes were greatest from Hawai\u02bbi Island (0.146 TgC/yr), representing more than half of the total SGD DIC inputs, followed by Maui (0.032 TgC/yr), O\u02bbahu (0.024 TgC/yr), Kaua\u02bbi (0.023 TgC/yr), and Moloka\u02bbi (0.004 TgC/yr). Perennial stream fluxes were greatest from O\u02bbahu (0.023\u00b10.008 TgC/yr), followed by Kaua\u02bbi (0.020\u00b10.005 TgC/yr), Hawai\u02bbi (0.020\u00b10.011 TgC/yr), Maui (0.014\u00b10.008 TgC/yr), and Moloka\u02bbi (0.004\u00b10.003 TgC/yr). \u2022 Total organic carbon (TOC), the combination of DOC and POC, represented 76.6 percent of carbon entering nearshore waters (0.062\u00b10.028 TgC/yr) and ranged from 72.6 to 78.3 percent of total surface fluxes (0.003-0.016 TgC/yr) across the five of the seven main islands. DIC entering nearshore waters from perennial streams was estimated to be 0.019\u00b10.006 TgC/yr. Lack of data precluded estimating carbon burial in stream systems of Hawai\u02bbi. However, the \"flashy\" nature of these streams may limit carbon deposition, suggesting carbon burial is a small fraction in the overall aquatic carbon budget. \u2022 Total carbon aquatic yields from perennial streams were greatest from O\u02bbahu (20.36\u00b16.73 gC/m 2 /yr), followed by Kaua\u02bbi (16.63\u00b14.45 gC/m 2 /yr), Maui (16.41\u00b19.75 gC/m 2 /yr), Moloka\u02bbi (10.04\u00b17.16 gC/m 2 / yr), and Hawai\u02bbi Island (8.18\u00b14.30 gC/m 2 /yr). Again, TOC was the dominant form of carbon in carbon yields, representing 72.6-78.3 percent of aquatic carbon yields (10.26\u00b14.6 gC/m 2 /yr) across five of the main islands. \u2022 Future increases in rainfall (0.3-39.5 percent) along wetter coasts of the Hawaiian Islands are expected to increase perennial stream TOC fluxes by nearly 10.6 percent and DIC fluxes by 8.1 percent. This would increase total surface aquatic fluxes to 0.089\u00b10.036 TgC/yr. SGD DIC inputs will would increase by 22.3 percent, increasing SGD fluxes to 0.279 TgC/yr (from 0.228 TgC/yr).\n\u2022 Ecosystem carbon balance of the seven main Hawaiian Islands (as outlined in Giardina and others, this volume, chap. 1) was estimated for two periods, a current baseline period (2004-2013) and a projected period (2012-2061), by synthesizing results for baseline carbon emissions from wildfire (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5), baseline carbon stocks and fluxes (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6), baseline and projected future aquatic carbon fluxes to nearshore waters (MacKenzie and others, this volume, chap. 7), and projected future carbon stocks and fluxes (Sleeter and others,this volume,chap. 8). \u2022 Terrestrial ecosystems of the seven main Hawaiian Islands sequestered an average of 0.34 TgC/yr during the baseline period, which was about 4 percent of statewide terrestrial net primary production (NPP). Hawai\u02bbi Island represented the largest carbon sink, sequestering 0.24 TgC/yr or 70 percent of total statewide carbon sequestration. \u2022 The combined carbon-leaching losses to nearshore waters through stream-water flux and submarine groundwater discharge was estimated as about 0.31 TgC/yr, or about 4 percent of statewide terrestrial NPP. \u2022 During the projected period (2012-2061), carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems of the State of Hawai\u02bbi was predicted to decrease by more than 30 percent (0.34 to 0.22 TgC/yr) primarily because of a decrease in NPP and increased carbon losses from land-use and land-cover change, as well as increased aquatic carbon-leaching losses to nearshore waters. \u2022 Our analysis indicates that the State of Hawai\u02bbi would remain a net carbon sink overall, primarily because of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems on Hawai\u02bbi Island, but that predicted land-use changes on the islands of Kaua\u02bbi and O\u02bbahu would convert these islands from net carbon sinks to net carbon sources to the atmosphere."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3. Projecting End-of-Century Shifts in the Spatial Pattern of Plant-Available Water Across Hawai'i to Assess Implications to Vegetation Shifts", "text": "By Lucas B. Fortini, 1 James D. Jacobi, 1 and Jonathan P. Price 2 Given the lack of data necessary for the proper parameterization of mechanistic vegetation models in Hawai\u02bbi and other similarly isolated islands (Hartig and others, 2012), we attempt to provide a coarse first approximation of the impacts of projected climate shifts to vegetation across Hawai\u02bbi using a simple yet novel approach. Our approach relies on modeling the relation between current climate and the distribution of broad climatically determined moisture zones that form the basis of natural land-cover classification classes in Hawai\u02bbi (for example, dry forests, wet forests, mesic shrublands; Gagne and Gon, 2006;Rollins, 2009;Price and others, 2012). In this approach we first model the suitability of the landscape to each moisture zone based on variability of mean annual temperature (MAT), wet season precipitation, and dry season precipitation and then integrate these individual models into landscape moisturezone projections under current and end-of-century climate scenarios. Additionally, we use a novel calibration algorithm to ensure unbiased projections of prevalence among modeled moisture-zone classes under current and future climate. Lastly, to approximate how these shifts in moisture zone may differentially impact forests, shrublands, and grasslands across Hawai\u02bbi and their carbon storage potential, we integrate our moisture-zone projections to a Hawai\u02bbi GAP Analysis Program (HIGAP) vegetation structure map (Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2)."}, {"section_title": "Land-cover Data and Processing", "text": "As baseline data for our projections, we used the map of current distribution of moisture zones across Hawai\u02bbi (Price and others, 2012). The moisture-zone map describes the variability of plant-available moisture across Hawai\u02bbi and has been used in most recent land-cover mapping efforts for the islands. This moisture-zone classification is primarily based on annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (thus also being a function of temperature and humidity), but also considers the distribution of independently derived vegetation moisture zones (Jacobi, 1989). The moisture-zone map is based on three generalized moisture classes (dry, mesic, and wet) that reflect the way vegetation types are commonly subcategorized in Hawai\u02bbi (for example, wet versus mesic forests). In broad terms these moisture classes can be described as areas where the difference between mean annual precipitation (MAP) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) is more than 1,661 mm (wet), between 0 and 1,660 mm (mesic), and less than 0 mm (dry) (Price and others, 2007). Prior to all analyses, we resampled the moisture-zone map to 500-m pixel resolution using a majority filter to reduce the computational time required to run models ( fig. 3.1)."}, {"section_title": "Projecting Moisture-Zone Distributions Under Current and Future Climate", "text": "We projected current and future distribution of moisture zones across the Hawaiian Islands using an approach based on the comparative suitability of the Hawaiian landscape to each of the three moisture zones considered. In this approach, we create baseline and end-of-century landscape projections based on multiple iterations of our moisture-zone model ( fig. 3.2). Each iteration of the model uses a stratified random sample of the baseline map (the training set) to determine the suitability of the landscape to each moisture zone based on climate predictors alone (individual moisture-zone models) using a boosted regression tree approach (BRT; fig. 3.3). Hence, individual iterations only provide partial coverage of landscape under current climate because projections are not applied to parts of landscape used for model fitting to avoid overfitting. We chose BRT based on the method's overall good performance in similar efforts to model ecological distribution patterns (Elith and others, 2008;Hastie and others, 2011). An initial test showed similar accuracies for moisture-zone models based on simpler Mahalanobis distance-based methods. However, owing to the smaller computational requirements and wider acceptability of BRT, we used BRT for the remainder of our reported models. BRT is an increasingly common ecological modeling method frequently used in species distribution modeling owing to its good model fits. To merge individual moisture-zone models into a single projection (a multi-moisture-zone projection), we used a simple algorithm that assigns a moisture zone to each landscape cell based simply on which moisture zone has the highest model-derived suitability for that location ( fig. 3.4). Comparisons with a simpler multinomial BRT approach showed that it provided less accurate and more biased model outputs compared to our approach. All individual BRT models use optimal settings found in preliminary tests including using a 0.01 learning rate, a tree complexity of 5, and a 0.5 bag fraction (Elith and others, 2008). The number of trees in each model was optimized to balance predictive power versus generalization of models (Hijmans and others, 2012). All models and analyses were developed in the R programming language (R Core Team, 2014) using the dismo, gbm, and raster packages (Ridgeway, 2005;Hijmans andothers, 2012, 2014) "}, {"section_title": "Model Replicates", "text": "To limit the effect of individual training points to projection outcomes, we ran each model step 200 times using 80 percent of the baseline moisture-zone map for model fitting (the training set, n=51,992) and 20 percent for model evaluation (the evaluation set, n=12,998). Each model iteration splits the data using a stratified random sampling algorithm with respect to moisture-zone prevalence across islands in the original baseline map. Our approach was based on two sets of model runs (see Moisture-zone model workflow box below): a first step used to fit and calibrate our models (see section 3.3.2.2; figs. 3.2 through 3.4) and a second step to apply        Moisture-zone model workflow:"}, {"section_title": "23", "text": "Step 1: Model fitting and calibration under current climate (200 iterations) \u2022 For each iteration: \u2022 Randomly split baseline cover and predictor maps into training (80 percent) and evaluation (20 percent) sets "}, {"section_title": "Model Calibration Runs", "text": "Although the winner-takes-all approach to integrate multiple vegetation models into a single landscape model has been previously used (Tovar and others, 2013), we introduce a novel and simple calibration procedure that aims to minimize bias in final projections ( fig. 3.3). This is necessary because there may be differences in model sensitivity and fit across individual moisture zones that could lead to bias in a final landscape classification. If this bias is consistent across model iterations, a standard model averaging approach will not reduce it. Hence, in this procedure, after evaluating current moisturezone projection bias in terms of deviations in moisture-zone prevalence between baseline moisture-zone distribution and current model projections for the evaluation set, a search algorithm incrementally adds or subtracts a constant to the suitability scores of each individual moisture zone until the subsequent landscape moisture-zone projection has prevalence across moisture zones within 1 percent of baseline prevalence. This calibration routine is analogous to presence/absence thresholding algorithms commonly used in species distribution models aimed at yielding projections with equal omission and commission errors (Jim\u00e9nez-Valverde and Lobo, 2007;Liu and others, 2011). We repeated the model fitting, evaluation, and calibration steps 200 times using different evaluation and training sets to determine the final average model calibration constants to be applied in all calibrated final models."}, {"section_title": "Calibrated Model Runs and Final Projections", "text": "Following calibration, we projected 200 replicates of our model across the archipelago based on our current and future climate predictors, along with the average calibration values calculated above ( fig. 3.4). The output of individual replicates does not yield a complete moisture-zone coverage map for current climate as the calibrated model is not applied to the training set locations to avoid overly confident projections. However, as each model replicate assigns the most likely moisture zone for 20 percent of the landscape, the final mean landscape projection under current and future climate is based on the most frequently predicted moisture zone for a given location. Lastly, we quantify uncertainty in our final model projections by calculating the ensemble committee agreement across all model iterations. This is calculated as the frequency at which the projected cover for a location is projected across all model replicates, where, for instance, a value of 0.8 indicates that 80 percent of model iterations assigned the same moisture zone to a given location."}, {"section_title": "Projection Integration with Land Cover", "text": "To determine the implications of moisture-zone changes to Hawaiian land cover, we integrated our current and future moisture-zone projections with a coarse vegetation map based on the carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi (CAH) land-cover map by Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2). The CAH map is a detailed representation of current vegetation distribution across the main Hawaiian Islands based on multiple data sources resulting in 48 cover classes. As with other Hawaiian land-cover maps (Rollins, 2009), the CAH land-cover map stratifies most non-anthropogenic cover types into moisture-zone subclasses. For the purpose of our simplistic land-cover analysis, we grouped the original classes into forest, shrubland, and grassland general classes resampled to 500-m resolution, excluding all original CAH land-cover classes that did not clearly fit into these three categories (table 3.1). This step not only simplified cover types considered but also removed all moisture-zone associations from the HIGAP map. We then simply merged our modeled moisture-zone map with the moisture-less HIGAP map using either the current or future moisture-zone projections. This overlay analysis allowed us to get a first approximation of the differential impact of projected moisture-zone shifts in forest, shrubland, and grassland areas across the state."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Predictors", "text": "We derived all climatic variables used as predictors in our models from current and future monthly temperature minimums and maximums (Tmin, Tmax) and precipitation data. We obtained current monthly precipitation and Tmin and Tmax data from 250-m resolution datasets others, 2013, 2014). We calculated mean annual wet season (November-April) and dry season (May-October) temperature and precipitation using the R package \"raster\" based on the monthly rainfall and temperature data (Hijmans and others, 2014). We calculated future yearly and seasonal climatic indicators using the same procedure as for the baseline data. However, before calculating yearly and seasonal indicators we derived the end-of-century values for monthly Tmin, Tmax, and precipitation by integrating climate projections with current climate estimates. To do that, we first calculated the projected change between 1990 and 2010 and between 2080 and 2100 for each monthly variable developed from the Hawaiian Regional Climate Model (HRCM) with 1-km spatial resolution for Maui and 3 km for all other islands (Zhang and others, 2012). We then added these delta values to current monthly climate values before recalculating all yearly and seasonal variables. The HRCM-based climate projections show an average of 2.5 \u00b0C warming over the islands, but with a clear increased warming at higher versus lower elevations (3.4 \u00b0C versus 2.2 \u00b0C, respectively), as documented in previous studies (Beniston and others, 1997;Diaz and Bradley, 1997;Rangwala and others, 2013). Predicted precipitation shifts include increased precipitation in windward wet areas of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui, but general slight drying trends across the drier areas of the State.

Preliminary analysis showed models using a combination of MAT and MAP performed as well or better than most other possible two-climatic-variable combinations.

The amount of area that burned in any given year fluctuated widely, ranging from 5 km 2 in 2004 to 119 km 2 in 2007. The grassland vegetation class had the greatest percentage of its area burned annually (0.85 percent/yr), followed by dry shrublands (0.72 percent/yr), then dry forests (0.35 percent/yr), and mesic shrublands (0.24 percent/yr). Other vegetation classes tended to have a smaller percentage of their total area burned each year (table 5.3). The percentage of available area of a vegetation class that burned in a given year was also highly variable and that variability tended to increase with the average annual percentage of a vegetation class that burned. For example, grasslands had the highest variability in the annual percentage of area burned and wet forests had the lowest (table 5.4). On a per-unit-area basis, forest vegetation classes contained the greatest amount of biomass (all pools combined; fig. 5.4). Wet forests had the most biomass with 11.7 kgC/m 2 , followed by mesic forests with 10.8 kgC/m 2 , and then dry forests with 5.2 kgC/m 2 . Other, non-forest land-cover classes had less biomass, typically less than 1 kgC/m 2 ( fig. 5.4). Similarly, total carbon stored in non-forest land-cover classes was low (7 percent of total carbon stocks) even though non-forest landcover classes cover much more than 7 percent of land in Hawai\u02bbi. Forests cover 36 percent of Hawai\u02bbi land, but hold 93 percent of all carbon in terrestrial ecosystems (table 5.5).    \n\n"}, {"section_title": "Current Moisture-Zone Projections and Model Evaluation", "text": "Overall, the current broad geographical pattern of potential moisture-zone distribution across the Hawaiian landscape was well replicated using our three predictors ( fig. 3.5).

As expected, our ensemble committee agreement shows transition zones between moisture zones as areas of greater uncertainty in our current projections, but owing to the high accuracy of our models these areas are generally small ( fig. 3.6). Additionally, several areas across the Island of Hawai\u02bbi also have relatively low within-model agreement, indicating greater uncertainties in our projections. Because of the high overall model accuracy, the uncalibrated current projections showed very small differences in prevalence among moisture zones when compared to the original basemap (table 3.2). Fortunately, our model calibration algorithm was able to reduce these small biases by adding small calibration constants (<5 percent adjustments) without any change in the overall classification accuracy.

This difference between mesic-extent change and projected areas remaining in mesic conditions is due to some of the loss in current mesic areas being counterbalanced by transition into mesic conditions in some other areas by the end of the century (table 3.4).

The loss of mesic areas and increase in dry areas across the archipelago happens primarily in areas currently forested, followed by smaller areas in grasslands. More specifically, the shift towards the dry moisture zone does is not manifested equally across the three vegetation classes (table 3.5). Nearly all mesic-moisture-zone loss within forested areas results from mesic forest switching to dry forest. Similarly, three quarters of the extent loss in mesic moisture zone within grasslands is attributed to a dry grassland expansion. However, the overall contraction of mesic moisture zones within shrubland areas, albeit small, is attributed to shifts towards wet shrubland vegetation. Looking at island differences for these shifts, the slight increase in extent of wet moisture-zone areas across the archipelago mostly happens in shrublands on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi ( fig. 3.13)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Based on the relatively high accuracy of our current model projections, the distribution of moisture zones across the landscape seems strongly related to average climatic conditions. This is partially expected, as moisture zones are clearly dependent on atmospheric climate (Price and others, 2012). The small number of classes and the coarse (500-m) scale of analysis also likely helped with minimizing fine-scale variation that would otherwise not be easily explained by our simple correlative model. With these strong moisture-zone-climate relationships, we were able to recreate and project the Hawaiian moisture zones using climatic variables different from the information used to create the original moisture-zone maps and that are not available for future climate scenarios. By applying our models to projected end-of-century climate conditions, we are able to provide a first approximation of how the distribution of moisture zones is likely to shift. Except for the large contraction of the wet moisture zone on the west side of Hawai\u02bbi Island, wet moisture zones are projected to remain relatively unchanged between now and the end of the century in both distribution and extent across the seven main Hawaiian Islands. This is also largely the case for current dry moisture zones except for some dry moisture-zone areas in Hawai\u02bbi Island displaced by the upward movement of mesic moisture zones. The large contractions of mesic areas across the state follow an increasing pattern from Hawai\u02bbi to Kaua\u02bbi, with most of these areas shifting towards drier moisture zones.\nBased on the estimates generated for this assessment, 0.29 percent of the total land area in Hawai\u02bbi burned annually between 2002 and 2011. This percentage is slightly less than in the conterminous United States, where 0.39 percent of the total land area burned based on MTBS data for the same period (Eidenshink and others, 2007). This is lower than estimates using point-based agency records (Pierce and Pickett, 2014;Trauernicht and others, 2015) and likely reflects the fact that not all reported wildland fires were detected using remote sensing. Average annual fossil-fuel emissions for Hawai\u02bbi (2002-2011) totaled 5.8 TgC (21.2 TgCO 2 -eq) (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2014). Most fossil-fuel emissions were from the transportation sector (51.3 percent) and electrical power generation sector (38.5 percent). Industrial, commercial, and residential sectors contributed less to the fossil-fuel emissions (8.4 percent, 1.5 percent, and 0.3 percent, respectively). In turn, the annual estimate of wildland fire emissions generated for this assessment was 0.0271 TgC (0.0942 TgCO 2 -eq/yr), which amounts to only 0.5 percent of fossil-fuel emissions. GPP of ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi averaged 2.23 TgC/yr from 2002 to 2010 (Selmants and others, this volume, chap. 6), and wildland fire emissions in Hawai\u02bbi were equivalent to only 1.2 percent of GPP. Because this proportion is small, wildland fires did not substantially reduce the overall ability of Hawaiian ecosystems to sequester carbon for the baseline period of this assessment (2002-2011).\nStreams, rivers, and groundwater provide an important mechanism for processing and delivering particulate and dissolved forms of carbon to nearshore waters (Datry and others, 2014). Once thought to be simple conduits of carbon, streams and rivers process nearly half of the terrestrial carbon inputs before they are delivered to the ocean. The rest is buried within the system or lost to the atmosphere through various physical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes (Cole and others, 2007). Streams and groundwater likely play similar roles in Pacific Island carbon cycles, yet few studies have attempted to construct entire carbon budgets for this region. This is particularly important in the tropics because carbon fluxes to nearshore waters from perennial streams and submarine groundwater discharge are a valuable energy source that supports sustainable levels of coastal primary productivity (Hoover and others, 2006;Mead and Wiegner, 2010;Johnson and Wiegner, 2014) and secondary productivity (Atwood and others, 2012). Our results provide an initial assessment of surface and groundwater carbon inputs to Hawaiian nearshore waters. Inputs were dominated by DIC fluxes from SGD, whereas total organic carbon fluxes were largely due to surface water inputs and both of these fluxes are expected to increase under future climate scenarios. Higher inputs of DIC from SGD sources are likely due to the fact that estimates from SGD encompassed entire island areas, whereas surface water inputs were only calculated for perennial streams and were limited to perennial watershed scales. Higher total organic carbon values were likely due to the fact that SGD flowing through aquifers lacks the particulate carbon sources that dominate surface water carbon loading (Johnson and Wiegner, 2014). Comparisons across islands revealed that DIC in SGD decreased with decreasing island area; Hawai\u02bbi Island had the most SGD DIC, whereas Moloka\u02bbi had the least. Stream carbon fluxes were much more variable. A general lack of data limited our ability to estimate accurate stream and groundwater inputs or examine what factors (for example, land use, rainfall, streamflow) have the greatest influence on carbon loading to nearshore waters."}, {"section_title": "Understanding Model Errors and Uncertainties", "text": "Particularly noteworthy areas of consistent model error include small wet areas on top of O\u02bbahu and L\u0101na\u02bbi known to be influenced by fog interception (Ekern, 1964). Indeed, these areas of model discrepancy may be useful to identify locations where factors beyond those directly related to temperature and precipitation may drive differences in plant-available moisture across the archipelago. For instance, relative humidity has been shown to be a strong determinant of tree-line position at higher elevations on Maui (Crausbay and others, 2014). Substrate age and other non-climatic factors may also be important to explain other model discrepancies and patterns at finer spatial scales (Price and others, 2012). Although our model replicates the pattern of potential moisture-zone distribution across the Hawaiian landscape well, it is still worthwhile to explore the reasons for discrepancies between the model and our original baseline moisture-zone map. First, our approach requires a relevant set of environmental predictors. Although we assessed multiple possible combinations of climatic indicators commonly used in similar analyses, these bioclimatic variables are entirely based on precipitation and temperature and do not account for climate extremes that may be important      in defining landscape vegetation patterns (Crausbay and others, 2014). For example, cloud cover, potential evapotranspiration, and fog deposition are all additional variables that may be important in better defining the distribution of Hawaiian moisture zones; however, these variables are notoriously difficult to estimate for the current climate and even harder to adequately project into the future (Hawkins and Sutton, 2011;Knutti and Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, 2013). Another source of model errors may be inaccuracies in the moisture-zone data used. Indeed, the moisture-zone map is partially based on past archipelago maps of mean annual precipitation (Giambelluca and others, 1986) that are known to have discrepancies when compared to more recent estimates (Giambelluca and others, 2013). Nevertheless, we expect errors in the baseline moisture-zone map to be relatively small given the coarse scale of our analysis. Regarding future projection uncertainties, our ensemble committee-agreement map (that represents an estimate of model agreement among multiple iterations) only encapsulates a portion of the uncertainty inherent in future projections. Future expansion of this analysis with additional climate projection scenarios, as they are made available, will likely show a much more complete picture of future projection uncertainty. Nevertheless, preliminary analyses using alternative modeling approaches and alternative baselines yielded consistent trends of increases in dry and wet areas at the expense of mesic areas. This indicates that projection uncertainty owing to model choice and starting conditions is not unacceptably large."}, {"section_title": "Projected Moisture-Zone Shifts in the Context of Hawaiian Climate Trends", "text": "In general, the projected moisture-zone shifts follow broad patterns of current and projected climate trends. Projected precipitation shifts are generally expected to make wet areas wetter and dry areas drier, both at the global and regional level (Zhang and others, 2012;Collins and others, 2013). However, examining the differences among islands shows that patterns in our moisture-zone projections are slightly more complex. Namely, expansion of the wet moisture zone occurs on windward (wet) Hawai\u02bbi and Maui but not on O\u02bbahu or Kaua\u02bbi. Conversely, expansion of the dry moisture zone occurs on the leeward (dry) side of every island except Hawai\u02bbi. This larger expansion of the dry moisture zones at the northwestern end of the archipelago matches coarse global future projections of precipitation change (Keener and others, 2012). These projected drying trends also occur in the context of recent decreases in streamflow (Bassiouni and Oki, 2013) and precipitation (Chu and Chen, 2005; Krushelnycky and others, 2013). One major uncertainty in our moisture-zone-shift projections is the high-elevation areas on Maui and Hawai\u02bbi influenced by the trade-wind inversion. The frequency and intensity of the trade-wind inversion is known to raise temperatures and cap cloud formation in areas above 2,000 m in elevation, and hence raise insolation and decrease precipitation and relative humidity (Cao and others, 2007). This feature of Hawaiian climate has a major impact on the distribution of vegetation at higher elevations, effectively limiting the height of the forest line on these islands (Kitayama and Mueller-Dombois, 1992; Loope and Giambelluca, 1998). Until recently, there has been considerable debate about the response of tradewind inversions to regional and global climate shifts (Still and others, 1999;Sperling and others, 2004), but global and regional analysis increasingly point to a likely increase in frequency of the trade-wind inversion that would lead to persistently drier conditions (Lauer and others, 2013; Crausbay and others, 2014). Although the HRCM simulations replicate the patterns of increased temperature and decreased precipitation in areas above the trade-wind inversion (Zhang and others, 2012), contrary to expected changes in the trade-wind inversion from other analyses, HRCM future projections seem to include a more varied pattern of precipitation change for areas above the trade-wind inversion including areas with more, less, or equal precipitation. This makes some of the projected spread of the wet moisture zone in high-elevation windward Maui and Hawai\u02bbi and the conversion of the top of Maui from dry to mesic likely optimistic."}, {"section_title": "Temperature-Induced Drought and Vegetation Change", "text": "The general increase in dry areas and decrease in mesic areas between present and the end of the century occur in areas that suggest some of these trends will be driven by expected temperature increases. In fact, there is ample research that documents temperature amplification of plant stress and drought (Kolb and Robberecht, 1996; Barber and others, 2000; Park Williams and others, 2013) through greater evapotranspirative demand (Weiss and others, 2009). Recent research has shown that temperature is a strong driver of drought conditions across the southwestern United States including in temperate forests (Barber and others, 2000; Park Williams and others, 2013). Many other studies further highlight the importance of temperature to drought impacts in terms of mortality, stress, and overall vegetation change (Adams and others, 2009; Weiss and others, 2009; Allen and others, 2010; McDowell and others, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Implications of Projected Vegetation Change to Hawaiian Conservation Efforts", "text": "The generally large projected decreases in mesic areas across the state and especially on the islands of Kaua\u02bbi and O\u02bbahu, have potentially large implications relative to conservation of highly valuable native-species habitat. Mesic habitats in Hawai\u02bbi are zones of high species diversity because they contain elements from both wet and dry habitats (Gagne and Price, 2004;Gon, 2006). However, because this moisture zone is optimal for timber production, agriculture, and ranching, large parts of this habitat have been altered from their natural condition, resulting in a loss of native-species diversity. The reduction in extent of the mesic zone is directly linked to an increase in the future extent of dry habitat. Although the original Hawaiian dry-plant communities were also known to harbor a great diversity of plant species, particularly woody taxa (Rock, 1913;Gagne and Cuddihy, 1990), much of this habitat zone, particularly below 1,000-m elevation, has already been substantially altered by human land use, invasive species, and fire. An expansion of the area of dry habitat will likely result in an increase in areas impacted by fire, which are then quickly colonized by invasive grass species, and the likelihood of more fires further increases. When a fire starts in a dry habitat, it can easily spread into the adjacent mesic habitats and cause substantial damage to the species composition and vegetation structure of that community. Beyond the broad categorical projected shift of mesic areas to dry areas, most of the existing native dry communities are on the wetter end of the dry moisture zone range, which suggests impacts of projected climate shifts within stable moisture-zone areas may also be significant. Besides the significant pattern of mesic-to-dry moisturezone switch projected in our models, one other projected change with clear conservation implication is the likelihood of the nearly complete loss of the wet forest habitat on the western side of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. Although the reduction of the wet forest in this area is spatially compensated by projected wet zone expansion at higher elevation windward areas on Hawai\u02bbi Island, the native plant species adapted to the wet habitat in the Kona area (for example, Cyanea marksii and Cyrtandra menziesii) will likely be lost (Price, 2004). Our newly designed approach opens the door to several improvements to vegetation and habitat modeling in Hawai\u02bbi and elsewhere. We are currently refining our modeling approach to consider differences in limiting factors to the distribution of individual vegetation classes. We are also exploring modeling improvements that would allow for the consideration of finer vegetation classes that are more easily relatable to on-the-ground management efforts. With these and other improvements, we can use our models as a steppingstone to develop mechanistic models for the region that can provide a wealth of information on the processes that drive the projected shifts our analysis identifies. Nevertheless, our projections can still be used to characterize coarse vegetation changes and the long-term consequences to carbon storage across the landscape. To do so, the integration of our projections with multiple fire, landscapemanagement, and use scenarios, along with the assessment of aboveground and belowground carbon storage will provide an unprecedented detail of carbon stocks across the Hawaiian landscape and the potential future shifts. As such, our results are used in Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8) to refine land-use and land-cover scenarios for the archipelago and project terrestrial carbon storage and CO 2 fluxes."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4. Influence of Invasive Species on Carbon Storage in Hawai'i's Ecosystems", "text": "By R. Flint Hughes, 1 Gregory P. Asner, 2 Creighton M. Litton,3 Paul C. Selmants,4 Todd J. Hawbaker, 4 James D. Jacobi, 4 Christian P. Giardina, 1 and Benjamin M. Sleeter 4 roughly equal number of naturalized introduced nonnative species, approximately 10 percent of which are considered invasive (Vitousek, Loope, and Stone, 1987;Wagner and others, 1999). Collectively, the Hawaiian Islands exhibit an impressive array of climatic and edaphic variation, where substrates range in age from days to millions of years, and where Hawai\u02bbi Island alone harbors 25 of the world's 35 Holdridge life zones (Holdridge, 1947;Asner and others, 2005). Unfortunately, nearly all of these varied ecological zones contain nonnative invasive species capable of displacing native counterparts or altering ecological processes. Although many nonnative species were introduced inadvertently during the past two centuries, many were purposefully introduced. Of the approximately 100 nonnative plant species considered invasive and detrimental to Hawai\u02bbi's native ecosystems, more than half of them were purposefully introduced by territorial and state foresters and planted extensively across the archipelago (Woodcock, 2003). The spread of both subsets of nonnative invasive species has been exacerbated by land conversion, altered disturbance regimes (for example, agriculture, logging, grazing, fire, and residential and urban development), and domestic and feral ungulate activity (cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs). These forces have resulted in profoundly altered landscapes where nonnative species commonly dominate . In many instances, such as with ungulate grazing and fire, disturbance amplifies and entrenches dominance and relative influence of the respective nonnative invasive species (Hughes and others, 1991;D'Antonio and Vitousek, 1992;Hughes and Vitousek, 1993;Brooks and others, 2004;Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). As a result of the historical and ecological interactions discussed above, each main Hawaiian Island today exists as a matrix of native and nonnative-dominated landscapes (table 4.1 adapted from Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2). Nonnative invasive species are present on every main Hawaiian Island, but their areal extent and prevalence varies from island to island. Viewed as a proportion of total vegetated area of each Island occupied by nonnative species, Kaho\u02bbolawe exhibits the highest proportion (99 percent) and Hawai\u02bbi Island exhibits the lowest (42 percent). O\u02bbahu, L\u0101na\u02bbi, and Moloka\u02bbi exhibit roughly similar proportions (81-86 percent), as do the islands of Maui and Kaua\u02bbi (63 and 70 percent, respectively). Clearly, the extent of nonnative occupancy is high by any measure, and relative proportions of nonnative vegetation highlight the widespread importance of nonnative invasive vegetation across much of the Hawaiian archipelago. How do alien-dominated vegetation assemblages affect terrestrial carbon storage and dynamics relative to the remaining native-dominated areas or former native-dominated areas that they have replaced? The answer depends upon the ecosystem or ecological zone in question, the particular nonnative species or collection of nonnative species that have invaded, as well as the timeframe. For example, in moist-to-wet windward zones of the Hawaiian Islands, the \"carbon effect\" (in other words, whether the system experiences a net loss or gain of carbon) associated with shifts from native-dominated forest to nonnative forest or shrubland depends on the maturity and development of the native forest being displaced or altered and, perhaps more importantly, on the stature and growth characteristics of the nonnative species that ultimately dominate a given ecosystem following invasion. The objectives of this chapter are to synthesize existing information and improve our understanding of the patterns and dynamics of carbon storage, particularly aboveground carbon storage, across a variety of common invasion scenarios found in the Hawaiian Islands (table 4.2). Here we draw upon published results to explore the dynamics of invasion and characterize their associated patterns of carbon storage. Specifically, we focus on three dominant nonnative functional guilds: nitrogen-fixing trees    and shrubs, non-nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, and grasses. We also note that the effect of invasion on carbon storage is as much influenced by the carbon stocks of the pre-invasion native community as the particular characteristics of the respective invasive nonnative species and (or) guilds (table 4.2)."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "45", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen-Fixing Trees and Shrubs", "text": "Invasive species that have the capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic associations with Rhizobia, in the case of legumes, or Frankia, in the case of actinorhizal plants, are capable of altering the function and composition of the native ecosystems. This has been documented in numerous settings around the world (Ehrenfeld, 2003), perhaps most notably in Hawai\u02bbi (Vitousek, Walker, and others, 1987) where native nitrogen-fixing species-particularly those exhibiting early-successional pioneer characteristics-are relatively uncommon, and where many native ecosystems are nitrogen-limited (Vitousek and Farrington, 1997). Many of Hawai\u02bbi's more problematic invasive alien species are those that fix nitrogen. Although invasive nitrogen-fixing plants generally increase net primary production of the ecosystems they invade, the sign and degree of carbon-storage change depends on the individual characteristics of the invasive species and the successional characteristics of the invaded system."}, {"section_title": "Falcataria moluccana and Casuarina equisetifolia", "text": "In extant native-dominated wet forests along Hawai\u02bbi Island's windward coastal lowlands (<900 m above sea level), two alien nitrogen-fixing tree species-Falcataria moluccana (also known as albizia) and Casuarina equisetifolia-can alter both nutrient cycling and carbon storage at the stand to ecosystem levels (Hughes and Denslow, 2005; Mascaro and others, 2012; Hughes and others, 2014). Prior to invasion of these tree species, primary succession by native vegetation in these areas typically manifests as colonization of young, barren p\u0101hoehoe and \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 lava substrates by a single cohort of Metrosideros polymorpha, which gradually develops as monotypic forest stand during the first 100-200 years (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg, 1998), and which ultimately develops into more diverse and structurally complex native forests as species establish during subsequent centuries of succession (200-700 years) (Zimmerman and others, 2008). Earlysuccessional native forests on young lava flows (<200 years) exhibit aboveground carbon densities (ACDs) averaging less than 60 megagrams of carbon per hectare (MgC/ha). On older lava flows (400-750 years), native forests, having had the time to gradually accumulate substantial amounts of biomass, exhibit ACD values of 130 MgC/ha ( fig. 4.1). Although native-dominated vegetation can still be found in lowland wet habitats of east Hawai\u02bbi Island, substantial portions are now occupied by nonnative tree and shrub species purposefully introduced as part of massive nonnative-tree-planting efforts that took place across Hawai\u02bbi throughout the 1900s. Over 10,000 nonnative species were introduced into Hawai\u02bbi and more than 13 million individuals were planted in what has been characterized as the largest environmental project ever conducted in Hawai\u02bbi (Woodcock, 2003). Of the approximately 100 species now considered invasive in Hawai\u02bbi, half were introduced during that period. In Forest Reserves of the Puna District of Hawai\u02bbi Island, in an area totaling about 2,000 ha, nearly 35,000 individuals of 114 different species, 74 distinct genera, and 38 plant families were planted between 1906 and 1960 (Skolmen, 1963;Nelson, 1965). Among the most commonly planted species were C. equisetifolia and F. moluccana. This latter species, native to the Molucca Islands, New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands and first introduced to Hawai\u02bbi in 1917, is a legume that fixes nitrogen through its symbiosis with Rhizobia. In contrast, C. equisetifolia, a tree native to Australia and introduced to Hawai\u02bbi in the 1890s, is an actinorhizal tree species that fixes nitrogen through its symbiosis with Frankia. Although patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation among native forest stands were strongly controlled by lava substrate age and developed within century-scale timeframes, patterns of accumulation among F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia stands were decoupled from substrate age and developed within decadal-scale timeframes ( fig. 4.1). Indeed, all nonnative forest stands inventoried by Hughes and others (2014) were established during the 1900s-some as late as 1955-and their ACD values were the result of no more than 90 years of succession. This attests to their capacity for comparatively rapid rates of ACD accumulation, particularly where such stands were dominated by tree species capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. On older lava substrates however, ACDs of native and nonnative stands were shown to be quite similar. Thus, comparisons between ACDs of native and nonnative nitrogen-fixing tree-dominated forests was highly dependent on lava substrate age and, hence, forest successional state. By virtue of their nitrogen-fixing capacities, the fast growing nitrogen-fixing trees F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia rapidly surpass ACDs of the slower growing dominant native tree M. polymorpha on young, nitrogen-limited lava flows. In contrast, although F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia attain ACD levels of about 130 MgC/ha in a matter of only a few decades on older lava substrate, those levels remain on a par with native-dominated M. polymorpha forests that have experienced centuries of succession and carbon accumulation. In addition to increasing ACD relative to that of native forests on young lava flows, Mascaro and others (2012) found that on lava flows aged 300 years before present and younger, both F. moluccana-and C. equisetifolia-dominated forest stands exhibited rates of litterfall, aboveground growth increment, and aboveground net primary production that were at least triple the same rates for native forest stands dominated by M. polymorpha on similarly aged lava flows. These authors also found that belowground carbon mass values of F. moluccana-and C. equisetifolia-dominated forests (~48 MgC/ha) were more than double those of M. polymorpha-dominated forest on young lava flows (20 MgC/ha). Again, the mechanism for such high rates of carbon cycling, accumulation, and storage is clear: newly formed lava substrates notably lack plant-available nitrogen (Vitousek and others, 1993), and inputs from sources other than higher plants (for example, precipitation and dry deposition, free-living cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria) are relatively low (Hughes and Denslow, 2005). The capacity of F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia to symbiotically fix nitrogen frees them from constraints posed by nitrogen limitation and allows for large increases in primary production, and increased nutrient acquisition (particularly phosphorus) (Binkley and others, 2004;Mascaro and others, 2012). In contrast, M. polymorpha, virtually the sole woody plant component of native-dominated primary succession on these lava flows, lacks the capacity to symbiotically fix nitrogen, and its productivity is highly constrained by nitrogen limitation (Hughes and Denslow, 2005; Mascaro and others, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "47", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Morella faya", "text": "In sub-montane and montane areas of Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park (HVNP) on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi, Vitousek and Walker (1989) showed that invasion by Morella faya (formerly Myrica faya) dramatically alters the functions of the formerly native-dominated community by quadrupling the amount of biologically available nitrogen entering these typically nitrogenlimited systems. Originally introduced to Hawai\u02bbi by Portuguese immigrants in the 19th century, M. faya is native to the Azores, Canary, and Madeira Islands; it is an actinorhizal nitrogen fixer that, like F. moluccana and Casuarina species, was planted widely throughout the main Hawaiian Islands during the early 20th century until its invasive potential was realized (Fosberg, 1937;Vitousek and Walker, 1989). First recorded in HVNP in 1961, M. faya occupied more than 12,000 ha of the Park by 1985 (Whiteaker and Gardner, 1985), and its distribution has increased dramatically during the last 30 years, particularly in seasonally dry portions of HVNP (D'Antonio and others, 2011). Numerous studies have demonstrated reinforcing effects of M. faya invasion on biogeochemical processes; these include increased trace gas emissions, litterfall, and soil organic carbon (Vitousek and Walker, 1989;Aplet, 1990;Hall and Asner, 2007). Regarding the influence of M. faya invasion on aboveground carbon stocks, Asner and others (2010) compared nativedominated and M. faya-invaded communities along a shrublandwoodland-forest gradient ( fig. 4.2). Although aboveground biomass (AGB) more than quadrupled from shrubland to forest communities, M. faya AGB did not differ from that of nativedominated AGB in any of the three ecosystem types. As such, despite its capacity to substantially alter other ecosystem functions and characteristics, M. faya invasion failed to alter aboveground carbon stocks in any of the ecosystems it invaded in HVNP."}, {"section_title": "Prosopis pallida and Leucaena leucocephala", "text": "In arid ecosystems of Hawai\u02bbi, such as those on the leeward sides of the main Hawaiian Islands, the impact of invasive nitrogen fixers on carbon cycling and stocks is primarily controlled by water availability. Two widespread nitrogen-fixing trees exemplary of this are Prosopis pallida and Leucaena leucocephala; both are members of the Fabaceae family and as such fix nitrogen by symbiosis with Rhizobia. Both trees were introduced to Hawai\u02bbi in the early 1800s from their native range in the neotropics and naturalized rapidly across many of the arid zones of the main Hawaiian Islands (Wagner and others, 1999;Gallaher and Merlin, 2010); today they occupy a combined area of 59,000 ha, or 3.6 percent of the total land area of the Archipelago (Gon and others, 2006). Native species have been long extirpated from the vast majority of these areas, but native dry forests were likely composed of species such as Erythrina sandwicensis, Reynoldsia sandwicensis, and Abutilon incanum (Wagner and others, 1999). In investigations into the effects of groundwater availability on plant-soil nitrogen cycling in areas invaded by P. pallida on the dry leeward coast of Hawai\u02bbi Island, Dudley and others (2014) compared nutrient acquisition and cycling as well as productivity of P. pallida trees growing in lowland areas where they could access shallow groundwater with P. pallida trees growing in upland areas where they had to rely solely on low volume, intermittent rainfall events. The authors found that P. pallida in upland environs experienced water stress, exhibited higher water-use efficiency, and exhibited lower predawn photosynthetic performance than did trees in lowland areas. Further, biologically available soil nitrogen pools and litter production were 10 and 17 times greater, respectively, in lowland P. pallida stands relative to upland stands. Differences in these functional attributes translated to large differences in ACD; lowland P. pallida stand-level carbon mass (20 MgC/ha) was more than six times greater than that of upland P. pallida stands ( fig. 4.3). In the case of P. pallida invasion and growth across substantial portions of the main Hawaiian Islands, the degree to which these forests and woodlands store and cycle carbon is highly dependent on water availability. In dry, leeward, lowland environments of the main Hawaiian Islands invaded and now occupied by P. pallida or L. leucocephala stands, associated herbaceous or grass biomass may contribute substantially to ecosystem carbon stocks and cycling. Ellsworth and others (2014) determined aboveground carbon mass in L. leucocephala-dominated woodlands; they found that although carbon mass in live biomass of the alien tree was generally greater than that in live grass biomass, the collective carbon mass of living and dead grass biomass was at least comparable, if not greater than, the combined living and dead mass of L. leucocephala ( fig. 4.4). This is a common characteristic of many dry leeward systems invaded by P. pallida and L. leucocephala, and it likely results from increases in soil-nitrogen availability beneath these nitrogen-fixing tree species that facilitate the establishment and persistence of other plant species which, more commonly than not, tend to be introduced nonnatives (Dudley and others, 2014). In some cases, however, P. pallida and L. leucocephala stands lack herbaceous understories of any note, perhaps owing to heightened competition for scarce water resources. Facilitation of other introduced alien plant species by virtue of increased nitrogen availability is a salient feature of invasive alien nitrogen-fixing tree species of Hawai\u02bbi, and this aspect commonly has a compounding effect on carbon stocks and cycling. Hughes and Denslow (2005) found that invasion of F. moluccana in lowland wet forests growing on young lava flows dramatically increased stem densities, basal area, and consequently ACD of the nonnative tree, Psidium cattleianum, relative to native-dominated forests on lava flows of comparable age and type. Asner and others (2008) documented similar changes in forest structure following invasion by alien nitrogen-fixing trees, and Vitousek and Walker (1989)  lava substrates that otherwise would be inhospitable to P. cattleianum invasion."}, {"section_title": "Non-Nitrogen-Fixing Trees and Shrubs", "text": "Many nonnative species that have successfully invaded a wide variety of Hawai\u02bbi's ecosystem do not have the capacity to fix nitrogen. Their effect on the balance of carbon stocks depends on their size and stature relative to native species and the degree to which they displace, rather than simply augment, ecosystem carbon stocks."}, {"section_title": "Fraxinus uhdei", "text": "Native to central and southern Mexico, Fraxinus uhdei trees were introduced to Hawai\u02bbi in the late 1800s and planted extensively across the archipelago; more than 700,000 individuals were planted on most of the main Hawaiian Islands (Wagner and others, 1999). This nonnative tree can attain heights up to 24 m and grow in relatively dense stands. F. uhdei can be fast growing in wet sub-montane or montane forests of Hawai\u02bbi and is responsive to increases in soil-nitrogen availability (Ares and Fownes, 2001), making it well suited to invading disturbed 4.4. Results and Discussion 49 sites during secondary succession. Rothstein and others (2004) found that F. uhdei increased nutrient cycling at the stand scale, though limited light availability in the understory apparently constrains subcanopy biomass. As such, establishment of this nonnative tree results in displacement of native species. However, because this tree is large, mature stands contain high amounts of carbon. In montane forests of the Laupahoehoe Unit of the Hawai\u02bbi Experimental Tropical Forest (HETF) on the windward side of Hawai\u02bbi Island, Asner and others (2009) found that, although native M. polymorpha and Acacia koa forests averaged 65 MgC/ha, F. uhdei-dominated stands averaged more than four times that amount (254 MgC/ha). Again these high values were not a function of F. uhdei augmenting native forests present in the locality. Rather, they reflect the displacement of native forests by alien tree species with a much higher capacity to acquire and store carbon."}, {"section_title": "Psidium cattleianum", "text": "In contrast to large trees such as F. uhdei, smaller stature non-nitrogen-fixing trees such as P. cattleianum typically decrease aboveground carbon storage in areas where it invades. Native to Brazil, P. cattleianum was introduced to Hawai\u02bbi in the early 1800s and has since become widespread across all the main Hawaiian Islands except Ni\u02bbihau and Kaho\u02bbolawe (Wagner and others, 1999). It is considered one of the most serious weeds of Hawai\u02bbi (Smith, 1985). Its capacity to reproduce vegetatively (in other words, by rootsprouts or suckers), combined with its shade tolerance, enables it to invade otherwise undisturbed native forests, and it is currently the most widespread alien woody species in Hawai\u02bbi's mesic-, moist-, and wet-forest zones. Once established in a particular locality, P. cattleianum commonly forms dense, impenetrable thickets in understories of dominant canopy trees, whether native (for example, M. polymorpha) or nonnative (for example, F. moluccana or C. equisetifolia) (Hughes and Denslow, 2005;Asner and others, 2008). While not explicitly altering ecosystem function, P. cattleianum is a strong competitor for limiting resources such as light, water, and nutrients, and it represents a daunting obstacle to native-species recruitment; forest stands characterized by a native overstory canopy and a dense sub-canopy of P. cattleianum will most likely retrogress to monotypic thickets of this aggressive invader once the mature native trees senesce (Zimmerman and others, 2008;Hughes and others, 2014). Regarding carbon storage, Asner and others (2008) reported a general diminution in aboveground carbon across areas of P. cattleianum invasion; forest stands co-dominated by P. cattleianum and Ficus rubiginosa, another nonnative tree species, exhibited significantly lower aboveground carbon mass than their native-dominated counterparts on 5,000-, 20,000-, and 65,000-year-old lava substrates of the Laupahoehoe Unit of the HETF (fig. 4.5). As a relatively small tree (typically 2-6 m tall, Wagner and others, 1999), P. cattleianum generally would be expected to harbor less carbon than the larger stature native forests they typically replace. However, in cases where stands of this species have matured to their fullest extent, it is possible for them to exhibit carbon mass roughly equivalent to that of native forests, although belowground carbon mass may be substantially greater in native-dominated stands (108 MgC/ha) relative to P. cattleianum-invaded stands (78 MgC/ha) (Mascaro and others, 2012). Regardless of whether P. cattleianum increases or decreases carbon stocks and cycling of the ecosystems it invades, its detrimental impacts on the diversity of Hawai\u02bbi's native biodiversity can neither be denied nor overstated."}, {"section_title": "Grevillea robusta", "text": "A member of the Proteaceae family and introduced from Australia in the late 1800s, Grevillea robusta is a common nonnative tree across dry leeward portions of the main Hawaiian Islands; more than 2.2 million individuals of this tree were planted across the archipelago by territorial foresters in the four decades between 1919 and 1959 (Wagner and others, 1999). Having spread to other areas from these initial plantings, G. robusta, along with P. pallida, constitutes most alien-dominated forests on drier, leeward parts of the Hawaiian Islands. G. robusta is a large tree, attaining heights of 10-25 m (Wagner and others, 1999); its inherent capacity to grow well even in dry, infertile soils makes it well suited to Hawai\u02bbi's leeward environments across which it has invaded (Lott and others, 2003;Shane and Lambers, 2005). Regarding the degree to which G. robusta stores carbon (R. Flint Hughes, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, unpublished data), found that mature stands of this species supported an average of 86 MgC/ha; this value was substantially higher than that of surrounding alien grasslands (<5 MgC/ha), but comparable to that of adjacent native forests co-dominated by M. polymorpha and A. koa (100 MgC/ha). Again, whereas stocks of carbon may be quite similar between nativedominated forests and alien invaded forests of these leeward portions, the most important difference between these forest types lies in the utter lack of native diversity in the latter relative to the former forests."}, {"section_title": "The Melastomes: Clidemia hirta, Melastoma septemnervium, and Miconia calvescens", "text": "Collectively, shrubby members of the Melastomataceae introduced to Hawai\u02bbi within the last 100 years, including Clidemia hirta (soap bush), Melastoma septemnervium, and Miconia calvescens (velvet tree), pose some of the most serious threats to both the native biodiversity of Hawai\u02bbi's forests and their capacity to store aboveground and belowground carbon. Native to lowlands of Central and South America and Caribbean Islands, C. hirta is a short stature shrub (0.5-3 m tall) first noted in Hawai\u02bbi in 1941; it has spread rapidly and extensively throughout mesic-to-wet forests at low to mid elevations and has been declared a noxious weed by the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Agriculture (Wagner and others, 1999;Dewalt and others, 2004). Smith (1992) reported that C. hirta had spread across more than 100,000 ha on the island of O\u02bbahu alone. Somewhat taller than C. hirta, M. septemnervium (1.5-5 m tall) is native to Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Philippines; it was present in Hawai\u02bbi by 1928 and now occupies extensive areas on windward slopes, from sea level to 900 m (Wagner and others, 1999). The tallest of the three melastomes considered here, M. calvescens is native to South and Central America and was first introduced to Hawai\u02bbi in 1961. This species is considered among the worst invasive plant species in Pacific-island wet forests, and it has been designated by the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world (Lowe and others, 2000;Meyer, 1996). Because of the acknowledged ecological damage wrought by M. calvescens in Tahiti, limiting its expansion across Hawai\u02bbi's wet forests has been a management priority during the last two decades. For example, the State of Hawai\u02bbi spent $1.7 million to control M. calvescens across the islands in the year 2000 alone, and similar funding continues today. Previous studies have shown that these invasive species are better suited to capture and efficiently use available light resources than their native wetforests counterparts (Baruch and Goldstein, 1999; Baruch and others, 2000). This is likely a key factor in their successful invasion of both disturbed and undisturbed mesic-to-wet Hawaiian forests. Regarding the capacity of these three invasive melastomes to store and cycle carbon relative to the native species they displace, C. hirta and M. septemnervium are both better characterized as shrubs than trees, and all three species are relatively low stature compared to the much taller native trees (for example, M. polymorpha and A. koa) they displace. As such, their invasion across landscapes formerly dominated by native forests has been typically accompanied by a substantial diminution in ecosystem carbon stocks. In addition, Allison and Vitousek (2004) noted that, unlike the leaf litter of native species of Hawai\u02bbi's wet forests which tends to decompose slowly, immobilizing nutrients and stabilizing soil carbon, litter of C. hirta, M. septemnervium, and M. calvescens decomposes quickly, releasing nutrients in the process. As such, we would expect soils supporting these invasive melastomes to accumulate and store substantially less carbon than their native-forest counterparts. Lastly, M. calvescens has the capacity to further inhibit soil-carbon accumulation by increasing erosion where it is established (Meyer, 1994); the large dark leaves of this species severely constrain subcanopy light availability and, consequently, understory plant cover. At the same time, these large leaves channel precipitation in such a way as to increase the energy of throughfall water drops, thereby increasing soil loss from erosion (Nanko and others, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Grasses", "text": "Across many regions of North and South America, Africa, and Australia, fire is an integral component of healthy, well-functioning native ecosystems. This is certainly not the case for the vast majority of Hawai\u02bbi's dry leeward ecosystems and wet windward ecosystems. During the 1,000 years prior to European contact, Hawaiians used fire extensively to clear native shrublands, woodlands, and forests for cultivation (Kirch, 1982). Fire was an effective tool for this purpose because, although some native species (for example, A. koa and Deschampsia nubigena) exhibit adaptations to fire, most native Hawaiian plant communities are best characterized as fire independent ; fires prior to human settlement of the Islands were likely irregular, infrequent, and short-term disturbances that exerted little evolutionary force (Smith and Tunison, 1992; Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). Although, native-dominated grassland ecosystems were present in Hawai\u02bbi in coastal, lowland and montane areas, and were likely much more widespread than present day, most of these systems have been highly degraded and are now dominated by nonnative invasive species, including a suite of nonnative grasses. Hundreds of nonnative grass species were introduced to Hawai\u02bbi following the European contact in the late 1700s , and today nonnative grasses currently dominate an area of 2,785 km 2 , or some 25 percent of the total land area in the main Hawaiian Islands (Trauernicht and others, 2015; Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2), where their presence is primarily the result of either land clearing followed by grass establishment as pasture for grazing or abandonment of agricultural land followed 4.5. Summary and Conclusions 51 by invasion of pyrophytic, nonnative grasses. Dominant nonnative grass species in Hawai\u02bbi today include Cenchrus setaceus (fountain grass), Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel grass), and Andropogon virginicus (broomsedge) in drier environments and Megathyrsus maximus (guinea grass), Cenchrus clandestinus (kikuyu grass), Ehrharta stipoides (rice grass), and Holcus lanatus (velvet grass) in mesic-to-wet areas. Melinis minutiflora (molasses grass) can be locally prevalant in both dry and wet areas (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). At higher elevations and in more mesic conditions, many native forests were purposefully replaced by grass forage species for grazing purposes 100 or more years ago . In addition, abandonment of agricultural land with the demise of the sugar cane industry has left many fallow agricultural fields that are now dominated by nonnative grasses (Trauernicht and others, 2015). Some of these areas are still actively grazed or farmed, particularly on the islands of Maui and Hawai\u02bbi. However, many of these areas have been abandoned during the past several decades and are, in some cases, being subsequently invaded by woody species, particularly where wildfires have not occurred and fences have been erected to exclude both domestic and feral ungulates. Native-dominated forests have also regenerated in some former pasture areas where nonnative grasses were temporarily controlled and scarification techniques allowed persistent seed banks of native, nitrogen-fixing A. koa to germinate and establish (Scowcroft and others, 2007). Across many portions of dry leeward zones of the main Hawaiian Islands, replacement of native-dominated woody vegetation by nonnative invasive grasses typically involves a scenario where nonnative pyrophytic grasses invade the interstices of relatively open-canopy native woodlands and shrublands. Although it is unknown if these grasses were able to invade these areas in the absence of disturbance, it is most likely that many, if not all, of these grass invasions were facilitated by disturbance in the form of timber harvesting, grazing by domestic animals, and (or) invasion by nonnative feral ungulates (in other words, nonnative grass invasions as the passengers of ecological change) (MacDougall and Turkington, 2005). Once established, however, these nonnative grasses provide continuous flammable fuels that, when subject to frequent anthropogenic ignition sources (Trauernicht and others, 2015), facilitate frequent, widespread, and high-intensity fires that are likely far outside of the range of natural variability for native Hawaiian ecosystems (Trauernicht and others, 2015). Following fire, these grass species typically re-establish quickly and outcompete woody species in the post-fire environment, thereby facilitating a nonnative grass-wildfire cycle that is exceedingly difficult to break (D'Antonio and . Consequently, a complete replacement of native woodlands and shrublands by nonnative grasslands often occurs, particularly when repeat fires occur in the same area over short time intervals (Hughes and others, 1991;Ainsworth and Kauffman, 2013; Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). Although generalized here, such grass invasion/wildfire scenarios are dynamic and complex, both spatially and temporally. The consequences of nonnative grass invasions and the subsequent replacement of native, woody-dominated communities by nonnative grasslands for carbon storage are typically immediate and large (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). Aboveground carbon storage in woody-dominated communities in Hawai\u02bbi ranged from 5 to 14 MgC/ha in dry ecosystems, 33 to 91 MgC/ha in mesic ecosystems, and 57 to 115 MgC/ha in wet forest ecosystems (Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6). In contrast, average aboveground standing biomass (live and detrital) across several nonnative grassland types was found to be 3.5 MgC/ ha in C. clandestinus stands, 4.8 MgC/ha in C. setaceus stands, 6.2 MgC/ha in A. virginicus stands, 8.7 MgC/ha in M. maximus stands, and 13.7 MgC/ha in M. minutiflora stands (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). In turn, under suitable edaphic and climatic conditions and in the absence of wildfire, monotypic nonnative grasses can be subsequently invaded by nonnative woody species, some of which exhibit the capacity to fix nitrogen (for example, leguminous trees and shrubs), which increases aboveground carbon storage compared to that found in monotypic nonnative grasslands (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5)."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Broadly, our results, as well as results presented elsewhere in this report (Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2; Selmants and others, this volume, chap. 6) show that the total extent of alien-dominated forest exceeds that of native-dominated forest in lower elevation zones on medium to older substrates in both dry and wet conditions. In contrast, most wetter, higher elevation and (or) older substrates remain dominated by native forest vegetation. Critically, we found greater ACD values in native-dominated forests at low-to-medium elevations across dry-to-mesic areas of the islands, whereas alien-dominated forests had slightly higher ACD values in wetter environments. At these broad multi-island scales, substrate age played only a small role in determining the relative difference in alien-and native-dominated forest ACD levels. This suggests strong limiting effects of nutrient-poor soils on growth and biomass accumulation for all species, independent of origin. In contrast, higher biomass of native forest canopies in drier zones on older substrates may reflect evolutionary adaptation to these environments, as well as a lack of analog tree taxa among the current alien species pool on the islands. Overall our results suggest how native biological diversity intersects with carbon storage and how alien invasive species alter those relationships. For example, higher elevation, drier forests on older substrates may be dominated by alien forest cover, but native-dominated forests in similar environments can support twice the stored carbon on a per-area basis. Thus actions to conserve and restore high-elevation native ecosystems yield a co-benefit of increased carbon storage. On the other hand, areas characterized by young substrates in drier, high-elevation areas are currently dominated by native forest cover; alien species can double ACD levels in these environments. Forest managers and conservationists can use these landscape-scale relationships as tradeoffs in planning efforts to increase carbon storage while managing for biological diversity. Invasive species of one sort or another are ubiquitous across most of Hawai\u02bbi's forests, woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands, and introductions of these species continue to this day. We acknowledge the worldwide interest to protect and even increase carbon storage in ecosystems in order to mitigate climate change (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2006), and we have found that in some instances invasion of nonnative plants into Hawai\u02bbi's ecosystems can increase ACD across landscapes. However, invasive species are often the primary cause of profound, and in many cases irreparable, damage to Hawai\u02bbi's native ecosystems, degrading their compositional, structural, and functional integrity in myriad ways. Considering this, it is difficult to invoke a positive benefit of invasive species in terms of ecosystem services (increased carbon sequestration, for example) for Hawai\u02bbi's ecosystems, particularly when its citizens increasingly view nonnative species (for example, the tree F. moluccana or pyrophytic nonnative grasses) as financial burdens at best and threats to life and property at worst (Hughes and others, 2013). Further, the Hawaiian archipelago as a whole has been identified as a prominent biodiversity hotspot (Myers and others, 2000), and Hawai\u02bbi is a prime example of how islands contain disproportionately high levels of Earth's biodiversity (Caujape-Castells and others, 2010). Although our discussion here indicates that continued invasion of native-dominated ecosystems by nonnative species may or may not increase carbon stocks at landscape scales, such transformations would further erode the important contributions of Hawai\u02bbi's native ecosystems to global biodiversity. As such, although national and international programs that promote carbon sequestration (for example, HIREDD and California Carbon Program) provide useful mechanisms to encourage and enable landowners and land managers to reestablish and (or) protect native ecosystems of any sort, they should not be used to justify projects that lead to further establishment and persistence of invasive species. The idea that increased carbon sequestration by nonnative invasive species, where it actually occurs, could somehow justify the maintenance of invasive species across landscapes is a fallacy. Indeed, the degree to which invasive species are capable of invading native communities defines the degree that they themselves are \"primary pathogens\" to those ecosystems and such invasions cannot be considered compatible with the persistence of native-dominated ecosystems. The assertion Vitousek and others (1997)  \u2022 Most of the area burned was in grassland (51 percent) and dry shrubland (22 percent) ecosystems. \u2022 The potential for future increases in carbon storage in Hawaiian ecosystems is limited by fire and its controls on the recovery of forest vegetation in fire-prone nonnative shrublands and grasslands and the loss of forest vegetation when fire converts these systems to nonnative shrublands and grasslands after fires."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 5. Wildland Fires and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Hawai'i", "text": "By Todd J. Hawbaker, 1 Clay Trauernicht,2 Stephen M. Howard, 1 Creighton M. Litton, 2 Christian P. Giardina, 3 James D. Jacobi, 1 Lucas B. Fortini, 1 R. Flint Hughes, 3 Paul C. Selmants, 1 and Zhiliang Zhu 1 by temperate forests can be as great or greater than boreal and tropical forests (Keith and others, 2009). Hawai\u02bbi is climatically, and as a result biogeographically, very diverse because of the remarkably steep elevation and precipitation gradients created by fixed zones of uplift on windward slopes found across the main islands of the Hawaiian archipelago (Giambelluca and others, 2013). As a result of these gradients, Hawai\u02bbi provides a unique opportunity to understand the effects of climate, land-use, and land-cover change on carbon storage and flux. Land cover in Hawai\u02bbi is approximately 12 percent developed and agriculture, 19 percent barren or sparse vegetation on lava flows and alpine areas, and 69 percent natural and managed ecosystems (forests, shrublands, and grasslands). Approximately 36 percent (6,000 km 2 ) of the land area in the main Hawaiian Islands is dominated by forest, of which 15 percent is classified as alien and (or) mixed forest, 1 percent is classified as alien tree plantation, and 20 percent is classified as native forest (Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2). Because these ecosystems cross wide topographic and climatic gradients, Hawai\u02bbi is home to a tremendous diversity of biome types with some ecosystems supporting high carbon densities and others capable of sequestering large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere (Aplet and Vitousek, 1994;Raich and others, 1997;Schuur and others, 2001;Ziegler, 2002;Litton and Kauffman, 2008;Asner and others, 2009;Vitousek and others, 2009). The largest changes in aboveground carbon stocks in Hawai\u02bbi likely occurred within the past century when large areas of dry, mesic, and even wet forest were converted to ranchlands and plantation agriculture. A portion of these converted lands have since been abandoned, and the resulting nonnative shrublands and grasslands currently represent 33 percent of terrestrial ecosystem land cover. In the past three decades , decreases in agricultural production across Hawai\u02bbi have further increased the flammability of Hawai\u02bbi's landscapes (Trauernicht and others, 2015). These wildland fire-prone novel ecosystems greatly increase the potential for wildland fire impacts in adjacent forests, threatening the stability of carbon stocks. For the purposes of this assessment, we define wildland fires as fires that burned wildland vegetation and were ignited by natural causes (for example, lightning and volcanoes) or by humans (arson or accidental ignitions). Globally, wildland fires are a critical driver of the carbon cycle because they consume biomass through combustion resulting in an immediate release of greenhouse gases including CO 2 , CO, and CH 4 (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980). Wildland fires can also impact carbon cycling after combustion, by transferring biomass from live to dead pools, through decomposition of dead vegetation, but more so by influencing the establishment of new vegetation that can result in years to decades before carbon stocks return to pre-wildland fire conditions (Turner and others, 1998;Cleary and others, 2010;Hurteau and Brooks, 2011;Kashian and others, 2013). However, if wildland fires completely change the vegetation community that regrows in the post-wildland fire environment (for example, converting forest to grassland), then the impact on the carbon cycle will be large and long lasting (Bachelet and others, 2001). This type of potential impact is particularly important in Hawai\u02bbi, where novel wildland fire cycles have become established with invasion by nonnative grasses that create and allow grasslands to persist, ensuring the continuation of the wildland-nonnative-grass fire cycle. Wildland fires are thought to have been historically infrequent and to have had a small impact on most native Hawaiian ecosystems (and carbon cycling) relative to present day conditions. Before European contact, natural ignition sources were relatively rare, but Hawaiians likely used fire to clear native vegetation for agriculture or to promote growth of pili grass (Heteropogon contortus) which was used to thatch houses ). Hawai\u02bbi's native wildland fire regime was radically transformed with the introduction of wildland fire-prone and wildland fire-adapted nonnative grasses and shrubs (D'Antonio and  and an increase in ignition sources from human activities (Trauernicht and others, 2015). Today, these nonnative shrubs and grasses and continued anthropogenic ignition sources drive a novel wildland fire disturbance regime, with a particularly large influence on carbon storage because invasion ultimately carries wildland fire that kills woody plants and consumes carbon stored in woody biomass (Ellsworth and others, 2014). The resulting nonnative grasslands have a much lower capacity to store carbon, and this limited capacity is further reduced by frequently recurring wildland fires. Nonnative grasses including Cenchrus clandestinus (kikuyu grass), Cenchrus setaceus (fountain grass), Melinus minutiflora (molasses grass), and Megathyrsus maximus (guinea grass) were originally introduced in the late 1800s and early 1990s for animal forage or as ornamentals and have since spread widely throughout dry-to-mesic and even wet areas of Hawai\u02bbi, particularly those areas that have been disturbed by human activities such as ranching and agriculture . Wildland fire-adapted and -promoting nonnative shrubs include Leucaena leucocephala (haole koa), Schinus terebinthifolia (Christmasberry), and Ulex europaeus (European gorse). In areas where the nonnative grasses are established, regeneration of native trees is commonly limited because of competition for limiting resources (Hughes and others, 1991;Litton and others, 2006), but also because cattle and other nonnative ungulates consume native seedlings and saplings which evolved without large mammalian herbivores present (Cole and Litton, 2014). Further, rodents like black rats reduce available seed for regeneration by consuming fruits (Shiels and Drake, 2011). Cattle grazing in Hawai\u02bbi has decreased by more than 60 percent within the past several decades (from 850,000 ha to 324,000 ha between 1960 and 2012 [Trauernicht and others, 2015]) and in the absence of grazing, grass fuel loads accumulate and the risk of severe wildland fires increases (Elmore and others, 2005;Evans and others, 2015), which, in turn, results in an additional loss of native forest and further promotes nonnative grasses (Hughes and others, 1991;Blackmore and Vitousek, 2000;Litton and others, 2006). This nonnative grass wildland fire cycle perpetuates the conditions necessary for future potential wildland fires to spread into adjacent shrubland and forests where they can drive additional vegetation-type conversions and carbon losses to the atmosphere. The drivers of wildland fire occurrence in Hawai\u02bbi are different than those in other parts of the United States. Like many parts of the world, wildland fire occurrence in Hawai\u02bbi has been linked to drought, which can intensify during El Ni\u00f1o events (Dolling and others, 2005;Chu and others, 2002). However, long-term records indicate that the four-fold increase in annual area burned in Hawai\u02bbi within the past century is primarily related to human activity (Trauernicht and others, 2015). Given the scarcity of dry lightning strikes in Hawai\u02bbi, nearly all wildland fires in Hawai\u02bbi outside of active volcanic areas are human caused, and the introduction and expansion of wildland fire-prone plants with changes in land use has greatly increased the potential for wildland fire occurrence and spread. Based on spatial analyses of point-based wildland fire records, wildland fire ignitions are most prevalent in developed areas, indicating humans are the prime cause of wildland fire occurrence; most large wildland fires occur in nonnative shrublands and grasslands in the drier, leeward parts of the state (Trauernicht and others, 2015), indicating nonnative grasses are the prime cause of wildland fire spread. Wildland fires are important to consider in assessments of carbon cycling in Hawai\u02bbi because they produce greenhouse gas emissions as well as changing vegetation types, carbonflux rates, and carbon-storage potential. The importance of wildland fire in driving land-cover conversions in Hawaiian ecosystems and the potential drivers influencing when and where wildland fires occur in Hawai\u02bbi are well understood and documented in existing research. What is less understood are the impacts of wildland fire on carbon emissions across space and time in the Hawaiian Islands. Thus, this chapter focuses on quantifying (1) temporal patterns of area burned and greenhouse gas emissions by wildland fires for the State of Hawai\u02bbi for the baseline period of 2002 through 2011, and (2) the implications of wildland fire-induced shifts in vegetation cover on carbon storage. Long-term effects of fires on carbon stocks in vegetation are assessed in Sleeter and others (this volume, chap. 8)."}, {"section_title": "Wildland Fire Occurrence and Severity Data", "text": "Limited wildland fire perimeter data exist for the State of Hawai\u02bbi to quantify the extent and frequency of wildland fires in different vegetation types. For example, the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database only contains 11 perimeters for Hawai\u02bbi from the years 2002 to 2011 (Eidenshink and others, 2007), however, point locations of wildland fire ignitions are routinely recorded by State and Federal agencies (Pierce and Pickett, 2014). For the wildland fire component of this assessment, a new database was developed of burned areas with severity for wildland fires \u2265100 acres (0.4 km 2 ). Points of reported wildland fire locations from 2002 to 2011 were gathered from State and Federal agencies in Hawai\u02bbi (Hawai\u02bbi Wildfire Management Organization, 2013) and from the Short (2014) wildland fire occurrence database. These points were compared with points in the MTBS data and were removed if they had existing MTBS perimeters. This resulted in a total of 146 points, of which 135 lacked corresponding MTBS perimeters. At each point without an existing perimeter, Landsat 7 satellite imagery was visually examined for evidence of burned areas. If the burned area was visible in the Landsat imagery, burn severity was mapped following MTBS protocols (Eidenshink and others, 2007). After Landsat image interpretation, burned areas were found for 82 of the original 135 wildland fire points that did not have existing MTBS perimeters. An additional 11 wildland fires that were not reported were also found. Of the 53 wildland fire points not associated with burned areas visible in the Landsat images, 5 appeared to be duplicates. No visible burned areas were found for the other 48 points. No wildland-fire data existed for the islands of Kaho\u02bbolawe, L\u0101na\u02bbi, and Ni\u02bbihau, so they were excluded from this analysis. The final wildland-fire database contained perimeters and severity information for more than 104 wildland fires \u2265100 acres (0.4 km 2 ) between 2002 and 2011 ( fig. 5.1), which formed the basis for analyses of wildland fires in this assessment."}, {"section_title": "Land-Cover Data", "text": "Spatial data depicting vegetation types for Hawai\u02bbi were required to estimate emissions. For this analysis and other components of the carbon assessment of Hawai\u02bbi, a simplified version of the carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi (CAH) land-cover map combined with moisture zones was used ( fig. 5.2; Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2). These data were generated by reducing the CAH land-cover map to the following land-cover classes: forest, shrubland, grassland, wetland, developed, and agriculture. These classes were then subdivided using moisture-zone data from Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2). For instance, forest classes were split into dry, mesic, or wet. Classes were further refined to represent vegetation classes where enough field-based information from previous studies was available to assign biomass fuel loads (see section 5.3.3). Burn-severity information from the wildlandfire database was combined with spatial information delineating the different land-cover classes. A few burned pixels were located in anthropogenic (developed), wetland, and open-water land-cover  Shaded-relief base modified from U.S. Geological Survey National Elevation Dataset, 2015.   categories.

To meet this need, a database of biomass measurements from field data gathered across Hawai\u02bbi was compiled. Data were gathered from existing published and unpublished studies (table 5.1) with a focus on shrubland and grassland ecosystems because these systems experience most of the wildland fires, have highly variable biomass loads, and are poorly represented in existing biomass and fuels databases used for wildland fire behavior and emissions modeling (for example, LANDFIRE; Rollins, 2009). Biomass component names were used inconsistently across the different studies and required normalization to a common naming scheme. For  "}, {"section_title": "63", "text": "reporting purposes in this study, biomass pools were grouped into the following categories: (1) Duff and Litter, (2) Small Downed Woody Debris (DWD-Small), (3) Large Downed Woody Debris (DWD-Large), (4) Grass and Herbaceous, and (5) Standing Live Trees. The two downed woody debris classes were defined based on the diameter of logs: large downed woody debris included any logs with 7.6-cm (3-inch) diameter and greater, everything else was considered small downed woody debris. All biomass values were converted from reported units to kilograms of carbon per square meter using a 0.47 biomass-to-carbon conversion factor (Litton and others, 2006). Ultimately, biomass data for 419 plots at 204 different sites were collected from the 19 different studies (table 5.1). Unless there was clear indication that measurements represented different vegetation types, all biomass measurements were averaged to the site level for each study. Coordinates for individual plot locations were gathered when possible and combined with the land-cover raster data to crosswalk the plot data to different land-cover classes. Expert opinion was used to assign the plot to a land-cover class when plot locations were not available or when the vegetation composition and structure described by the study did not match the land-cover class in the raster data at the plot location. The expert-opinion vegetationstate-class assignment was based on published descriptions of the dominant vegetation types and the authors' familiarity with the vegetation at the study area where the data were collected. Land-cover classes were further simplified because there were a limited number of plots representing certain vegetation classes in the biomass database. For a given vegetation type (for example, shrubland), plots in the biomass databases tended to fall within one invasion status or another (native versus invaded). Therefore, invasion status was removed from all land-cover classes. In general, the grassland class was primarily invaded and other vegetation classes were primarily native."}, {"section_title": "Biomass Consumption and Wildland Fire Emissions", "text": "Biomass consumption and emission rates were generated using the First-Order Wildland Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) (Reinhardt and others, 1997) for each vegetation class and burn-severity category using the information on wildland fire perimeters by vegetation class and the pre-fire biomass loads described above. The FOFEM uses biomass loads along with fuel moistures to estimate the amount of litter and downed woody debris consumed during combustion (Albini and others, 1995;Albini and Reinhardt, 1997). In the FOFEM, the consumption of duff (decaying litter), trees, plants, and shrubs is estimated as a function of the land cover class, season, fuel moistures, and biomass loads. Canopy fuel consumption is estimated as a function of the burn severity provided by the MTBS data: 50 percent for high severity, 30 percent for moderate severity, and 10 percent for low and very low severity. The emissions of CO 2 , CO, and CH 4 were then calculated on the basis of the amount of fuel consumed, the organic-matter content of the fuel, and how efficiently it burned. The required input data for FOFEM included biomass loads, burn severity, and deadand live-fuel moistures. To simplify the reporting of results, emission estimates were summarized for all carbon-containing constituents to units of carbon and units of CO 2 -equivalents (CO 2 -eq) using their 100-year global warming potentials (IPCC, 2007) and the following equation: Three different fuel moisture levels (very low, low, and moderate) were used to generate biomass consumption and emission estimates with FOFEM, corresponding to different burn severities (high, moderate, and low; table 5.2). Variability in biomass consumption and emissions across fuel moisture levels were largely related to the proportion of canopy fuels, woody debris, and litter and duff consumed. The amount of shrub and grass fuels tended to vary little across the moisture level range because these are estimated using fixed proportions of biomass components in FOFEM. Final FOFEM-based estimates for biomass consumption and emission rates by vegetation class, burn-severity class, and biomass pools are shown in table 5.6. Values from this table were multiplied by the area burned in each vegetation class and year to produce estimates of the annual area burned and emissions. Reported results include annual area burned and emissions (total and by vegetation class)."}, {"section_title": "Parameter", "text": "Fuel moisture level (percent) "}, {"section_title": "Vegetation class", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "67", "text": "Across vegetation classes the median percentage of biomass consumed in wildland fires was 21 percent of live tree, 93 percent of shrub and grass, 25 percent of large downed woody debris, 70 percent of small downed woody debris, and 86 percent of litter and duff (table 5.6). Simulated biomass consumption was greater for the very low moisture scenario (corresponding to high burn severity) and low for the moderate moisture scenario (corresponding to moderate burn severity). Wildland fire emissions from different vegetation types were largely dependent on the amount of pre-wildland fire biomass available for consumption ( fig. 5.4; table 5.7). Wildland fire emissions, averaged across moisture scenarios, were greatest for mesic forests (3.5 kgC/m 2 burned), followed by alien tree plantations (2.3 kgC/m 2 burned), wet forests (1.5 kgC/m 2 burned), and mesic shrublands (1.0 kgC/m 2 burned) (table 5.7). Wildland fire emissions averaged 0.0271 TgC (0.0942 TgCO 2 -eq/yr) across Hawai\u02bbi (excluding Kaho\u02bbolawe, L\u0101na\u02bbi, and Ni\u02bbihau) between 2002 and 2011 ( fig. 5.3B). The minimum and maximum annual values of carbon loss in wildland fire emissions were 2004 and 2003, respectively, and ranged from 0.0016 to 0.0637 TgC (0.0055 to 0.2202 TgCO 2 -eq). The greatest amount of total emissions resulted from wildland fires in the grassland vegetation class (0.0142 TgC/yr or 0.0479 TgCO 2 -eq/yr on average; table 5.8), largely because of the extensive grassland area burned each year. However, wildland fires in other land-cover classes also resulted in substantial emissions because of their high biomass loads. For instance, average annual emissions were 0.0045 TgC (0.0164 TgCO 2 -eq/yr) for mesic forests, 0.0032 TgC (0.0109 TgCO 2 -eq/yr) for mesic shrublands, and 0.0041 TgC (0.0079 TgCO 2 -eq/yr) for wet forests.  "}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Uncertainties", "text": "The analysis of burned area and wildland fire emissions for this chapter relied on newly developed data where burned area and severity were mapped from Landsat 7 imagery, guided by point locations for 135 known wildland fires. However, no visible burned area was observed in the Landsat 7 imagery for 48 of these wildland fires. The reported area burned for the missing wildland fires totaled 152 km 2 . When compared to the 480-km 2 total area burned of the mapped wildland fires, this suggests that the results presented here may only represent 76 percent of the total area affected by wildland fires. Other uncertainties were introduced in this analysis because small wildland fires (<0.4 km 2 burned) were not included, although they typically contribute little to the total area burned (Strauss and others, 1989;Stocks and others, 2002) and, consequently, emissions. Another source of uncertainty in this analysis of wildland fire emissions for Hawai\u02bbi is the pre-fire biomass data collected for this assessment. Prior to the assessment, the only spatially complete data source representing biomass in all Hawaiian ecosystems was the LANDFIRE data layers (Rollins, 2009), and the general feeling among the scientific and management community in Hawai\u02bbi was that these data did not adequately represent fine-scale biomass values or spatial variability in biomass across ecosystem types in the state. Therefore, a database was compiled of biomass measurements from a variety of published and unpublished studies for this assessment. This effort highlighted a general lack of field-based measurements available to fully represent biomass values across the diverse climate and topographic gradients and land-use histories in Hawai\u02bbi. Light detection and ranging (lidar) data were used to generate aboveground biomass estimates for this assessment, but lack detailed information about other biomass components such as downed woody debris and litter (Selmants and others, this volume, chap. 6). However, estimates of the amount of biomass for non-forest ecosystems (shrublands and grasslands) remain low. Future efforts to understand carbon and wildland fire dynamics in Hawai\u02bbi would benefit from a large-scale systematic sampling effort to quantify biomass in shrublands and grasslands across moisture and productivity gradients and in relation to the presence of nonnative species. Wildland fire is widely used for sugar cane agriculture in Hawai\u02bbi to remove biomass before harvest. Agricultural wildland fires were not included in this assessment because complete data characterizing their occurrence are lacking. However, based on previous studies in Brazil, sugar cane biomass can vary between 5 and 15 kg/m 2 and burning removes approximately 20 percent of 5.5. Discussion 69 that biomass in the form of cane tops, leaves, and straw that are not used for sugar or energy production (Ripoli and others, 2000). Sugar cane is typically harvested on a 3-year rotation in Hawai\u02bbi, and approximately 65.0 km 2 /yr of sugar cane was harvested in Hawai\u02bbi on average from 2012 to 2014 (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2015). Assuming that sugar cane biomass was between 5 and 15 kg/m 2 , a 50 percent carbon content, that 20 percent of cane biomass is lost to burning, and that all the sugar cane area was burned, emissions from sugar cane burning would range between 0.03 and 0.10 TgC/yr. This is 20 percent less to 260 percent more than the average annual emissions for wildland fires and, as such, represents a potentially important component of wildland fire emissions that were not considered in this study. Active volcanoes can also be a potential source of CO 2 , SO 2 , and other greenhouse gasses. Globally, CO 2 and SO 2 emissions from volcanoes are equivalent to about 0.22 percent of anthropogenic emissions (Williams and others, 1992), but volcanoes may be a substantial emissions source at local to regional scales. Volcanic emissions were also not included in this assessment because they do not represent a flux from ecosystems. However, active volcanoes in Hawai\u02bbi are a source of wildland fire ignitions and they offer an interesting comparison with other types of fires. Gerlach and others (2002) estimated emissions from K\u012blauea Volcano to be 8,500 Mg of CO 2 /day from 1995 to 1998. On an annual timestep, this daily rate is equivalent to 3.1025 TgCO 2 /yr, or 3,300 percent greater than the mean rate of wildland fire emissions (0.0942 TgCO 2 -eq/yr) and 38 percent greater than the GPP (8.2 TgCO 2 -eq/yr) estimated for this assessment."}, {"section_title": "Mitigating Negative Impacts of Wildland Fires on Carbon Cycling Through Aggressive Fire and Vegetation Management", "text": "Based on the summaries of the results generated for the wildland fire portion of this assessment, the immediate impacts of wildland fire on carbon cycling from wildland fire emissions is small in Hawai\u02bbi, particularly compared to fossil-fuel emissions. However, the long-term effects of wildland fire in Hawai\u02bbi should be considered when assessing the regional role of wildland fires in carbon storage, because the importance of fire in Hawai\u02bbi is somewhat unique from its importance in the conterminous United States. In particular, vegetation type can convert from woodydominated ecosystems to nonnative grassland after wildland fire in forest and shrubland ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi, resulting in a potentially large loss of carbon-storage and carbon-sequestration capacity. For example, Litton and others (2006) found that transformation of native Hawaiian dry forest to nonnative grasslands reduced aboveground carbon storage in live biomass by a factor of 14, with native dry forest ecosystems storing 5.12 kgC/m 2 and converted grasslands dominated by C. setaceus containing only 0.37 kgC/m 2 . On a landscape level, Ellsworth and others (2014) examined the rate of land-type conversion from both wildland fire occurrence and wildland fire suppression during the period from 1950 to 2010 for two military bases on the island of O\u02bbahu that vary in wildland fire prevention capacity: . Schofield instituted improved, onsite wildland fire management in the 1990s, whereas at Makua the remoteness of the site coupled with common anthropogenic ignitions on and just outside of the base have complicated wildland fire suppression efforts. Both bases are divided into core active-training areas with abundant ignition sources and outside buffer areas with fewer ignitions. Over the 50-60-year period of the Ellsworth and others (2014) study, there were marked differences in land-cover change associated with wildland fire activity at the two bases, related to both ignition sources and wildland fire prevention activities. At Schofield, in the core area of active training (which has abundant ignition sources), recurring wildland fires expanded grassland cover from 48 to 63 percent over 61 years, with concurrent reductions in woody cover ( fig. 5.5A). Outside of the wildland fire break, active wildland fire mitigation (in other words, having a wildland fire crew onsite) resulted in the opposite pattern where woody cover expanded from 79 to 98 percent during the same period ( fig. 5.5B). In Makua, however, where wildland fire suppression is more challenging, there was Pre-wildland fire management also includes reducing wildland fire risk directly by reducing the quantity and continuity of available fuels. Fuels reduction has been shown to reduce costs and increase effectiveness of wildland fire suppression elsewhere (Hurteau and North, 2009;Syphard and others, 2011), but \"traditional\" mechanical and chemical means of fuels reduction are costly to implement in Hawai\u02bbi, owing to tropical, year-long growing seasons and difficult terrain. Managed grazing has been shown to effectively reduce fine fuel loads through field assessments (Blackmore and Vitousek, 2000;Evans and others, 2015), experimental prescriptive trials (Castillo and others, 2003;Warren and others, 2007;Ansari and others, 2008), and remote sensing (Elmore and others, 2005). Land managers are also experimenting with vegetated fuel breaks, or \u02bbgreenstrips,' that integrate wildland fire-resistant shrubs and grasses and (or) use trees to reduce herbaceous fuels by shading (Trauernicht and others, 2012). However, plant-species suitability and the effectiveness of greenstrip implementation in Hawai\u02bbi is only beginning to be quantified (Ellsworth, 2012;Ellsworth and others, 2015). Wildland fire suppression in Hawai\u02bbi is challenging owing to completely novel fuels, high spatial and temporal environmental variability, and complex, challenging terrain. For example, because of limited access and dangerous conditions, suppression efforts heavily rely on helicopter support, which substantially increases suppression costs. Hawai\u02bbi's geography also prevents the rapid mobilization of heavy equipment like water trucks, brush trucks, and dozers among islands, although personnel are typically mobilized in the event of large wildland fires. Under these constraints, County, State and Federal wildland fire response agencies in the state cooperate frequently on wildland fire incidents and local incident commanders stress the importance of both personal relationships and mutual-aid agreements. The top recommendations from Incident Commanders in Hawai\u02bbi for improving suppression efforts include increased training, personnel, and equipment as well as the extent of pre-wildland fire mitigation efforts (Clay Trauernicht, University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, unpublished data). Wildland fire impacts, such as the conversion of forest to grassland, can also be mitigated by increasing resources for, and effectiveness of, post-wildland fire assessment and response in Hawai\u02bbi. Rapid response measures, such as soil stabilization and weed management, and longer term revegetation and restoration are currently limited by funding and the availability of materials, especially native seeds. Woody plant recovery in burned areas is typically by nonnative species and, therefore, establishing and maintaining native diversity will require more intensive management and landscape-scale approaches to reforestation and restoration (Loh and others, 2009;Friday and others, 2015). a reduction in woody cover and expansion of grassland cover over 49 years in both the area of active training (from 13 to 66 percent grassland expansion) and outside of the wildland fire break (from 30 to 41 percent grassland expansion). Conversion of forest to grassland alters fuel heights and increases modeled surface wildland fire spread and intensity, which represents not only forest loss but also a positive feedback to grassland dominance. Importantly, these conversions of woody-dominated vegetation to grasslands from wildland fire represent a loss in aboveground carbon storage of 26-41 percent (Ellsworth and others, 2014). The results of the studies highlighted above demonstrate large-type conversions from forest to grassland where wildland fires have occurred during the past 50 or more years which represents a loss of carbon-storage and carbonsequestration potential. On a smaller scale, they demonstrate a corresponding conversion from grassland back to forest in areas of active wildland fire suppression, which represents carbon sequestration and increased carbon storage. The results generated for this assessment suggest that an average of 62 km 2 of forest and 136 km 2 of shrubland burn each year in Hawai\u02bbi. Without active restoration efforts, based on the results highlighted above, much of that area will convert to and persist as nonnative grassland ecosystems. If wildland fires and vegetation-type conversions in Hawai\u02bbi continue in the future at current or increased rates, the potential for carbon sequestration in woody-dominated ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi will be greatly reduced. However, these results also suggest that more active wildland fire management in the form of onsite wildland fire suppression can be an effective approach to controlling wildland fires, even allowing for type conversions back to woody ecosystems. Onsite wildland fire management will not always be feasible, however, and there is an urgent need to explore other options for limiting wildland fire spread, such as the use of greenbreaks and domestic livestock grazing in areas with little or no native species component (Evans and others, 2015). The risks and impacts of wildland fire can be reduced through prevention, pre-wildland fire preparedness and vegetation management, increased wildland fire suppression capacity, and enhanced post-wildland fire response. Given that nearly all wildland fires in Hawai\u02bbi are human-caused, public outreach and education are critical. Local organizations, including the Hawai\u02bbi Division of Forestry and Wildlife and the Hawai\u02bbi Wildlfire Management Organization are working to adapt national resources such as Ready, Set, Go! and Firewise Communities to local contexts (Hawai\u02bbi Wildfire Management Organization, 2015). Wildland fire managers in Hawai\u02bbi point to landowner preparedness and resource mapping (for example, access, water, and valued resources) as key components of presuppression planning (Clay Trauernicht, University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, unpublished data)."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6.

Each input dataset was converted to a standard projection and data format. For this report, estimated carbon stocks include aboveground live-biomass carbon, live-root-biomass carbon, dead-biomass carbon (the sum of surface litter and downed woody debris carbon), and soil organic carbon (SOC). Live-and dead-biomass carbon stocks were estimated only for forests (including alien tree plantations), grasslands, shrublands, and barren-to-sparsely vegetated areas as delineated by the land-cover map from Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2). Collectively, these four land-cover types constitute about 88 percent of the total land area of the main Hawaiian Islands. Developed areas (6 percent of total land area), agriculture (5 percent of total land area), and wetlands (1 percent of total land) made up the remaining 12 percent of land area for which there was insufficient Hawai\u02bbi-specific data to estimate carbon storage in live and dead biomass. SOC data covers 100 percent of the land area on the seven main Hawaiian Islands, so we included SOC data from developed areas, agriculture, and wetlands in islandwide and statewide estimates of ecosystem carbon storage. Land-cover classes from Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2) were aggregated into broader categories for ease of analysis and interpretation. Specifically, all grasslands were combined into a single grassland category, all shrublands were combined into a single shrubland category, alien and mixed forest types were combined into an \"invaded forest\" category, and mesic and wet forests were combined into a \"mesic and wet forest\" category. Aboveground biomass carbon of forest ecosystems for each island and forest cover type was estimated using a new map of forest ACD across the seven main Hawaiian Islands (Asner and others, 2016). The forest ACD map was constructed using a combination of airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data from Hawai\u02bbi Island, freely available satellite data covering all the major islands, and the land-cover map described in Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2). Lidar estimates of forest top-ofcanopy height (TCH) covering 3,793 km 2 over all major forest types on Hawai\u02bbi Island (Asner and others, 2011) was used to train a geospatial model that incorporated forest canopy fractional cover and other structural metrics derived from Landsat data as well as several environmental factors (Asner, Knapp, and others, 2009). This model was then applied to all the islands using the same set of canopy structural and environmental metrics to yield a multi-island map of forest TCH at 30-m spatial resolution. A landscape-level equation relating TCH to ACD was applied, resulting in a forest ACD map at 30-m resolution for the seven main Hawaiian Islands. This statewide ACD map was validated using ground-level estimates of ACD derived from Forest Inventory and Analysis plots maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service that were located on Hawai\u02bbi Island, Maui, Moloka\u02bbi, O\u02bbahu, and Kaua\u02bbi. See Asner and others (2016) for a more detailed description of the Hawai\u02bbi forest ACD map. Aboveground biomass carbon in shrublands and grasslands was estimated by multiplying median values for each biome type (from the biomass database in Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5) by the land area of that biome type as delineated by the land-use and land-cover (LULC) map from Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2). Litter and downed-woody-debris carbon were estimated for forests, shrublands, and grasslands by taking the median values for each biome type in the biomass database from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5) and multiplying by the land area covered by that biome type. Live-root biomass for forests and tree plantations was estimated using the power law equation listed in table 6.2 (Mokany and others, 2006). Root-to-shoot ratios of tropical grasslands are typically much lower than those of temperate grasslands (Mokany and others, 2006), and the root-to-shoot ratios of the African grass species that dominate Hawaiian grasslands are lower still because of their high biomass allocation to leaves (Williams and Black, 1994;Williams and Baruch, 2000;Neto and others, 2012). Live-root-biomass carbon of grasslands in Hawai\u02bbi was estimated by averaging the global median root-to-shoot ratio for tropical and subtropical grasslands (Mokany and others, 2006) with published root-to-shoot ratios of native and alien African grasses in Hawai\u02bbi (Williams and Black, 1994;Neto and others, 2012) and then multiplying this derived root-to-shoot ratio by the estimate of aboveground live-biomass carbon for Hawaiian grasslands (table 6.2). A similar approach was used to estimate live-biomass carbon of shrublands. The global median root-to-shoot values for shrubland and tropical arid shrubland/desert were averaged and then multiplied by the estimate of aboveground live-biomass carbon for Hawaiian shrublands (table 6.2). Estimates of SOC to a depth of 1 m at 10-m spatial resolution were derived from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database (Soil Survey Staff, 2015) for the State of Hawai\u02bbi. The spatial resolution of the gSSURGO dataset was resampled to 30-m raster cell size in Esri ArcGIS ver. 10.1 to align with the spatial resolution of the LULC map from Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2). Unlike other datasets used to estimate carbon stocks, the gSSURGO dataset covers the entire land area of the seven islands included in this report, including developed areas, agriculture areas, and wetlands. Soil organic carbon data for all land-cover types was included in islandwide and statewide estimates of SOC and total ecosystem carbon storage."}, {"section_title": "Carbon Fluxes", "text": "GPP on the seven islands included in this report was estimated using data and algorithms from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) project (Running and others, 2004;Zhao and others, 2005). MODISderived estimates of GPP (MOD17) use time series of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and regional coarse-resolution meteorological data as inputs and then use biome-specific radiation-use efficiency (\u03b5) coefficients to translate absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) in energy units to GPP, the total mass of carbon fixed by photosynthesis per unit area per unit time. For this report, the global MOD17 algorithm was adapted by incorporating the Hawai\u02bbi-specific land-cover map from Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2), locally derived 250-m-resolution meteorological data, and 500-m-resolution MODIS ver. 6 fAPAR data processed with a specifically adapted filtering and gap-filling technique to deal with the high prevalence of clouds in some areas. The MOD17 algorithm relies heavily on accurate representations of land-cover type to apply biome-specific values of \u03b5. Globally, the MODIS land-cover product (MOD12Q1) is accurate to within 65-80 percent, with higher accuracies in pixels that are largely homogeneous. However, Hawai\u02bbi is a discontinuous landmass with very heterogeneous land cover. To maximize the accuracy of land-cover-type assignment, a Hawai\u02bbispecific biome map was developed by re-sampling the carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi (CAH) land-cover map (Jacobi and others, this volume, chap. 2) to 500-meter pixel resolution using the majority method in ArcGIS ver. 10.2.2 and then assigning each HIGAP vegetation type to 1 of the 16 land-cover classes in MOD12Q1. This Hawai\u02bbi-specific biome map represented a substantial improvement in land-cover classification compared to the MOD12Q1 product; there was only about a 50 percent agreement between the two overall, with about 86 percent agreement for broadleaf evergreen forest, 27 percent agreement for grasslands, and 25 percent agreement for shrublands (table 6.1). The MOD17 algorithm uses air temperature (T air ) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data to calculate attenuating scalars to produce a biome-specific radiation-use efficiency coefficient, \u03b5. The biome-specific values for \u03b5 are combined with estimates of APAR to calculate GPP, where APAR is calculated as APAR = incident PAR \u00d7 fAPAR where incident PAR is estimated by multiplying incident shortwave radiation by 0.45, and fAPAR is the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Normally, coarse-resolution T air , VPD, and incident shortwave radiation data from the NASA GMAO dataset are used for these calculations. For this report, mean monthly T air , VPD, and incident shortwave radiation at 250-m pixel resolution from the Climate Atlas of Hawai\u02bbi (Giambelluca and others, 2014) were degraded to 500-m pixel resolution and used to calculate APAR and attenuating scalars for \u03b5. Finally, the fAPAR time series was processed with an iteratively reweighted local regression filter (LOESS) to reduce noise and fill gaps caused by persistent cloud cover in some areas of the seven main Hawaiian Islands (Moreno and others, 2014). The resulting estimate of mean annual GPP represents a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013. Estimates of R e and NEP were calculated by modeling the relationship between GPP and R e from literature values and applying these relationships to the MODIS-derived estimate of mean annual GPP for the seven main Hawaiian Islands. A grid of points at 500-m distance centered on each MODIS pixel was intersected with the MODIS GPP data layer, and GPP values were extracted to these points using ArcGIS ver. 10.1. Regression equations of the relationship between GPP and R e were derived based on published values from broad-leaved evergreen forests, grasslands, and other ecosystems (table 6.3). These regression equations were applied to the GPP point values across the seven islands included in this report to estimate R e , and NEP for each point was estimated by subtracting R e from GPP. The grid of points with R e and NEP values assigned was then rasterized at 500-m resolution using ArcGIS ver. 10.1."}, {"section_title": "Baseline Carbon Stocks", "text": "Statewide, the total carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of Hawai\u02bbi, including live biomass ( fig. 6.1 for forest ACD), litter, downed woody debris, and SOC ( fig. 6.2), was estimated to be 258 TgC (table 6.4). Approximately 70 percent of total carbon was stored as SOC, with about 25 percent of carbon stored as live biomass (both above and below ground) and about 5 percent of carbon stored as dead biomass (litter and downed woody debris; table 6.4). Total carbon storage by island was largely a function of island area (table 6.4). Hawai\u02bbi Island, which is larger than the combined area of the other six islands, stored the most carbon at 146 TgC, followed by Kaua\u02bbi, Maui, and O\u02bbahu, each of which stored about 30 TgC (table 6.3).

Only Kaho\u02bbolawe and L\u0101na\u02bbi (~7 kgC/m 2 each), both relatively arid islands with long histories of land-cover conversion, had carbon densities lower than Hawai\u02bbi Island. Native mesic and wet forests stored the highest amount of total carbon among ecosystem types, estimated as 96.3 TgC. Approximately 61 percent of the total carbon in native mesic and wet forests was in soil, 33 percent in live biomass, and 6 percent in dead biomass (table 6.5). In contrast, grasslands, shrublands, and bare ground, which together cover nearly three times the total area of native mesic and wet forests, combined to store a total of only 67.9 TgC, about 30 percent less than in native mesic and wet forests (table 6.5). Total carbon of invaded mesic and wet forests was about half the total carbon stored in native mesic and wet forests (49.6 TgC), primarily because invaded mesic and wet forests covered about half the total land area of native mesic and wet forests. Of total carbon in invaded mesic and wet forests, approximately 56 percent was in soil, 39 percent was in live biomass, and 5 percent was in dead biomass-a distribution similar to that of native mesic and wet forests. Invaded mesic and wet forests had a similar overall carbon density as native mesic and wet forests (31 and 32 kgC/m 2 , respectively). Native and invaded dry forests also had similar total carbon densities, estimated as 7.6 and 8.3 kgC/m 2 , respectively, but invaded dry forests had a higher proportion of total carbon in live biomass (24 percent) compared to native dry forests (13 percent).

Hawai\u02bbi Island was also the largest carbon sink with an estimated mean annual NEP of 1.17 TgC/yr, which represented approximately 50 percent of the total annual terrestrial-ecosystem carbon sink of the seven main Hawaiian Islands. Maui, O\u02bbahu, and Kaua\u02bbi each represented approximately 8-12 percent of the total land area of the seven islands considered in this report, and each contributed approximately 10-14 percent of the estimated total carbon sink. Collectively, the islands of Maui, O\u02bbahu, and Kaua\u02bbi accounted for about 37 percent of both GPP and NEP. Kaua\u02bbi had the highest GPP carbon flux density (carbon flux per unit area), estimated at 1.85 kgC/m 2 /yr.

Summary, Limitations, and Uncertainty", "text": "Aside from the recently published statewide forest ACD map (Asner and others, 2016), previous efforts quantifying carbon stocks and fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems in Hawai\u02bbi have been confined to the plot level (Herbert and Fownes, 1999;Schuur and others, 2001;Giardina and others, 2003;Litton and others, 2006;Selmants and others, 2014;Giardina and others, 2014), the landscape level (Asner, Hughes, and others, 2009;Asner and others, 2010;Hughes and others, 2014), or, at most, the island level (Asner and others, 2011). This report represents the first comprehensive effort to quantify carbon stocks and carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems across the seven main Hawaiian Islands. Overall estimates of carbon storage are relatively well constrained, particularly data related to forest aboveground biomass carbon and SOC, but knowledge gaps exist. Estimates of forest aboveground biomass carbon were validated with statewide plot-level estimates (Asner and others, 2016). The current estimate of aboveground live-biomass carbon for Hawai\u02bbi Island in this report (22.8 TgC) is about 20 percent lower than a previous estimate of 28.3 TgC made by Asner and others (2011). The SOC data product, which is a statewide interpolation of soil survey data points over several decades, represents the most detailed soil geographic data available for the State of Hawai\u02bbi. In contrast, published studies that provided plot-level estimates of shrubland and grassland aboveground live-biomass carbon and dead-biomass carbon (downed woody debris and litter) were not evenly distributed across islands or climatic zones, and so the islandwide and statewide estimates of these carbon stocks should be used with caution. Shrublands in particular are poorly represented in the dataset of published values (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5) relative to their land area. However, shrubland and grassland ecosystems typically have relatively low biomass carbon densities compared to forest ecosystems, and SOC makes up the majority of ecosystem carbon in shrublands and grasslands, so uncertainty related to biomass carbon storage in shrubland and grassland vegetation types is unlikely to exert substantial influence on islandwide or statewide estimates of total ecosystem carbon storage. Estimates of live-root biomass are derived from global root-to-shoot relationships for particular ecosystem types, and so any errors in estimates of aboveground biomass carbon are propagated to estimates of belowground live biomass. In addition, although there is no evidence that native and nonnative plant species in Hawai\u02bbi differ in their root-to-shoot ratios from plant species found elsewhere, the global root-to-shoot relationships used to estimate live-root biomass may not accurately represent those of plants growing in the Hawaiian Islands. Finally, islandwide and statewide estimates of total ecosystem carbon storage do not include estimates of live biomass, litter, and downed-woody-debris carbon in agriculture, developed areas, and wetlands, which make up about 12 percent of land area statewide. Litter and downed-woody-debris carbon are likely minimal in agriculture and developed areas, and live-biomass carbon is transitory in agricultural areas and of low density in developed areas. Soil organic carbon likely makes up most ecosystem carbon in agriculture areas, developed areas, and wetlands, but the lack of data on live biomass and detritus carbon in these areas may have resulted in an underestimate of islandwide and statewide ecosystem carbon storage and overly high estimates of the proportion of ecosystem carbon stored as SOC. There are currently no published islandwide or statewide estimates of carbon fluxes (for example, GPP, R e , NEP) for the State of Hawai\u02bbi, and so it was not possible to compare current estimates to previous efforts at similar scales. However, at the plot level, Giardina and others (2003) estimated whole-ecosystem carbon budgets for Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus saligna) plantations in multiple 900 m 2 plots for several years on the windward side of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. They estimated a mean annual GPP carbon flux density of 2.95 kgC/m 2 /yr (Giardina and others, 2003), which is 10 percent higher than statewide MODIS-derived estimates of GPP carbon flux density for alien tree plantations (2.68 kgC/m 2 /yr), 25 percent higher than estimates for invaded mesic-to-wet forests (2.37 kgC/m 2 /yr), and about 30 percent higher than native mesicto-wet forests (2.24 kgC/m 2 /yr). Estimates of R e in this report are from regression equations based on the relationship between GPP and R e derived from eddy flux towers, none of which were located in Hawai\u02bbi (Lasslop and others, 2010; Wolf and others, 2011; Yuan and others, 2011). Therefore, statewide values of R e and NEP may be the least well constrained of all carbon stock and flux estimates in this chapter. Plot-level estimates of R e carbon flux density in Eucalyptus plantations from Giardina and others (2003) were higher (2.27 kgC/m 2 /yr) than statewide estimates of R e carbon flux density in both alien tree plantations (2.22 kgC/m 2 /yr) and invaded mesic-to-wet forests (2.05 kgC/m 2 /yr). However, plot-level estimates of R e in young Eucalyptus plantations accounted for about 77 percent of GPP, whereas statewide estimates of carbon flux density for R e in alien tree plantations and alien mesic-to-wet forests accounted for about 83-85 percent of GPP. The estimated statewide R e carbon flux density in native mesic-to-wet forests was 1.87 kgC/m 2 /yr, about 20 percent lower than the plot-level Eucalyptus estimates, but R e made up a greater proportion of GPP in native mesic-to-wet forests (approximately 84 percent) than in the young Eucalyptus plantations (Giardina and others, 2003). Taken together, the comparative relationship of R e and NEP among these forest types yields reasonable results. Older, more established forest stands should lose a greater proportion of GPP as respiration, given their higher proportion of structural tissues relative to leaf area and less efficient foliage caused by hydraulic limitation of water transport in taller trees. However, the eddy covariance technique generally underestimates R e lost to the atmosphere on an annual basis, which may result in overestimates of NEP and annual carbon sequestration. This represents an important caveat to the estimates of R e in this chapter, in addition to the fact that relationships between GPP and R e are derived from eddy flux towers in ecosystems outside of Hawai\u02bbi. The data on ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes presented in this chapter should prove useful to the scientific community, land managers, and policy stakeholders in a variety of applications. However, caution should be exercised when using data and conclusions in this chapter by considering the constraints and uncertainties noted above.

Carbon fluxes were first modeled from 16 perennial streams that had long-term discharge and carbon datasets from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information Service (NWIS) (USGS, 2012). Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations (in micromoles) were estimated from USGS NWIS measurements of pH, temperature, and either filtered or unfiltered alkalinity (Stets and Striegl, 2012). Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations (in milligrams per liter) were either direct measurements or the sum of dissolved and particulate organic carbon. Daily DIC and TOC fluxes were then determined for those 16 streams using the USGS Load Estimator Model (LOADEST) (Runkel and others, 2004). LOADEST is a multiple-regression Adjusted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (AMLE) model which uses measured DIC or TOC concentration values to calibrate a regression among constituent load, streamflow, season, and time by the following equation: lnLOAD = a 0 +a 1 lnQ + a 2 lnQ 2 + a 3 sin(2\u03c0 dtime) + a 4 cos(2\u03c0 dtime) + a 5 dtime + a 6 dtime 2 + \u03b5 where lnLOAD is the natural log of the DIC or TOC constituent load (mol/d or kg/d, respectively), Q is the discharge, dtime is time in decimal years, a 0 , a 1 \u2026a n are regression coefficients, and \u0190 is an independent and normally distributed error. Model calibration required at least 12 paired water-quality (for example, DIC, TOC) and daily streamflow measurements over at least a 3-year period from 1972 to 2013. We chose 1972 as the starting time point because a long-term streamflow analysis revealed no significant change in streamflow since that time (Bassiouni and Oki, 2012). Once the model was calibrated for each of the 16 streams, LOADEST was then used to estimate daily carbon flux for those streams using continuous flow data during the time range of carbon measurements. Input data were log-transformed to avoid bias and centered to avoid multicollinearity. The models used to estimate loads for individual USGS stations varied in terms of coefficients and estimates of log load (equation 1). LOADEST output complications, including retransformation bias, data censoring, and non-normality were reduced using (AMLE) and the highest value for Schwarz Posterior Probability Criterion (SPCC). The estimated loads and their standard errors were used to develop 95-percent confidence intervals for various periods. The model's performance was examined by reviewing its output, such as the partial load factor (PLF), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient (Stenback and others, 2011), and AMLE's coefficient of determination (R 2 ) values and residuals (model error). PLF ranges from -1 to 1; model values below zero were rejected owing to over prediction. NSE ranges from -\u221e to 1 with values above zero indicating model predictions more accurate than the mean of the observed data. Mean daily DIC and TOC loads were then estimated for each of the 16 streams using the best of nine models based on Akaike's Information Criterion (Runkel and others, 2004). Daily values were then summed up for each year and averaged across years. Average annual TOC and DIC fluxes for each of these 16 watersheds were then correlated to various characteristics of watersheds above each USGS streamgage in Sigma Plot. Independent variables included drainage area (in square miles), mean basin slope (in percent), area-weighted mean soil permeability (top 12 inches; in inches per hour), percent barren land, percent evergreen forest, percent cultivated crop, percent impervious area, percent urban land cover, mean annual precipitation (in inches), and Q 50 (in cubic feet per second). All but Q 50 were obtained from STREAMSTATS program using geospatial data made available by the USGS (Rea and Skinner, 2012). Q 50 was the median streamflow in each stream and was averaged across the water years from which DIC and TOC measurements were obtained. We looked at all possible linear combinations among log TOC and log DIC and all possible combinations of 1, 2, and 3 of the 9 predictors listed above. We took this approach because the sample size (n = 16) was too small to warrant more than three predictors in a single model. We then chose the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score and highest AIC weight to estimate TOC and DIC loads ( fig. 7.1) from the remaining 401 ungaged and short-term gaged perennial streams. Q 50 estimates for these 401 perennial streams were estimated using the formula developed by Fontaine and others (1992): where DA is drainage area, CE is mean channel elevation from 10 and 85 percent of channel length, and P is mean annual precipitation. Individual watershed annual TOC and DIC fluxes were then converted to teragrams of carbon per year and summed by island. Yields (in grams of carbon per square meter per year) were estimated by dividing fluxes by the sum of the watershed area for each island. Total carbon fluxes were then calculated as the sum of TOC and DIC fluxes across five of the main Hawaiian Islands; total carbon yields were the sum of the carbon fluxes divided by the watershed area for each catchment. Standard errors were determined for TOC and DIC fluxes and yields from each watershed using the applied delta method and variances and covariance from the coefficients in figure 7.1 (Bishop and others, 1975). The square root of the sum of these errors squared was then used to determine the standard errors for each island and across Hawai\u02bbi. Tropical island streams differ from temperate continental streams in several ways (see Resh and deSzalay, 1995) and models developed for temperate watersheds (for example, the Universal Soil Loss Equation) do not always function similarly in tropical ones (Millward and Mersey, 1999;Prasannakumar and others, 2012). Therefore, to determine the accuracy of LOADEST predicted carbon loads from Hawaiian streams, we compared LOADEST model output of particulate carbon (PC) to actual continuous measurements of PC from three watersheds along the north Hilo coast of Hawai\u02bbi Island. Sub-daily (15-minuteinterval) measurements of turbidity (Strauch and others, 2014) and streamflow (Strauch and others, 2015) were used to estimate total suspended sediment (TSS) fluxes for the 2013 calendar year. TSS fluxes were then converted to PC by using grab samples collected across a range of streamflows, analyzed for PC, and then calibrated to the TSS values. PC was then estimated by summing values (in milligrams of carbon per second) for each watershed for the whole year. PC measurements were also used to calibrate the LOADEST Fortran model. Actual observed PC fluxes were then compared to LOADEST estimates."}, {"section_title": "Groundwater Inputs to Nearshore Ecosystems", "text": "Aquifers in Hawai\u02bbi have been delineated into a series of \"hydrologic units\" based on surface geology, such as topographic divides, and subsurface geology, such as rift zones (Mink and Lau, 1990, 1992.

Within each hydrologic unit, the groundwater flux of TOC and DIC to the ocean was calculated as follows: where Q is the submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and C is the concentration of TOC or DIC in groundwater.

Ultimately, this groundwater recharge flows back to the ocean, and can be used as an estimate of fresh submarine groundwater discharge. Because most of these models do not account for baseflow groundwater discharge to rivers and streams, this estimate of recharge is an upper limit. For hydrologic units not in direct contact with the sea, the recharge was treated as an underflow and added to an adjacent aquifer unit. For Kaho\u02bbolawe, groundwater recharge was estimated based on the average rainfall and the recharge to rainfall ratio of 21 percent calculated for hydrologic units on the leeward side of east Maui (Shade, 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Chemical Data", "text": "Well data for pH and alkalinity were summarized from the USGS (2014). To maximize the available data for this analysis, alkalinity data measured using both fixed endpoint and inflection point titration data of filtered and unfiltered samples, measured either in the field or the lab, were used (399 alkalinity measurements from 269 wells). Of these wells, 17 were not used because they had a specific conductivity greater than 5 microsiemens per centimeter (mS/cm) and were likely impacted by high alkalinity seawater or a temperature greater than 35 \u00b0C and geothermally altered. Of the remaining measurements, 94 percent were from less than 7 km in from the shoreline, providing a reasonable estimate of the alkalinity for basal groundwater flowing into the ocean. Measurements more than 7 km from the shoreline were only made on O\u02bbahu and Hawai\u02bbi Island. Alkalinity reported in milligrams of CaCO 3 per liter was converted to milliequivalents per liter (meq/L) by multiplying by 0.01998 (Rounds, 2006) before calculating total CO 2 (TCO 2 ) or DIC. For pH, only field measurements of unfiltered water were used (481 pH measurements from 283 wells), because repeated measurements in the lab were 0.42\u00b10.41 pH units greater than field measurements, suggesting CO 2 degassing during transport (n = 301). For each well, the average alkalinity, pH, and temperature were computed. For wells with alkalinity data but no pH data, pH data from nearby wells within the same hydrologic system were used (n = 35). Of these, half of the pH measurements were from wells within 5 km of the corresponding alkalinity measurements. DIC for the 234 wells was calculated using the USGS CO 2 Calc software, using K1 and K2 from Millero (1979), the pH NBS scale, an average SiO 2 of 790 \u00b5M, and a water density of 0.998 g/cm 3 (Robbins and others, 2010).

Changes in MAP between current (annual average of 1990-2010) and end-of-century (annual average of 2080-2100) scenarios were calculated from the Hawaiian Regional Climate Model (HRCM) with 3-km spatial resolution (Zhang and others, 2012). The HRCM is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model ver. 3.3. It considers future climate forcing based on the SRES A1B emission scenario and the mean of multiple CMIP3 global circulation models. The HRCM simulations replicate the regional and island climate mechanisms that largely dictate local climate such as extreme orographic-based precipitation gradients and trade wind inversions (Zhang and others, 2012). As such, the computing requirements to run the HRCM simulations limit our analyses to a single future climate scenario. However, preliminary results showed that interpolated global circulation model (GCM) projections, such as those commonly used in continental species distribution model analyses, are of very limited value for a small, hyper-diverse climatic region such as Hawai\u02bbi. Changes in mean annual rainfall from each hydrologic unit described above were used to estimate changes in SGD based on the mean annual rainfall-to-recharge ratio of the hydrologic unit. The mean annual rainfall-to-recharge ratio also changes with variations in precipitation. To estimate the changes in the mean annual rainfall to recharge ratio, the modeling results for changes in recharge in different rainfall conditions on Hawai\u02bbi Island were examined (Engott, 2011). Based on these modeled scenarios, a linear relationship between the fractional change in precipitation and the change in recharge to mean annual rainfall ratio was identified and applied to all islands: where Fppt is fractional change in precipitation, Pcurrent is current precipitation, Pfuture is precipitation at the end of the century (2100), \u0394R is change in recharge, Rcurrent is current recharge, and Rfuture is recharge at the end of the century (2100). The relationship for increasing mean annual rainfall (\u0394R = 0.256 \u00d7 Fppt; R2 = 0.93) differed from the decreasing mean annual rainfall relationship (\u0394R = 0.34Fppt; R2 = 0.78) owing to different hydrologic processes occurring (for example, transpiration, vadose zone transport). For perennial streams, changes in mean annual rainfall to each perennial watershed were determined by multiplying the current mean annual rainfall by the predicted percent change. Future mean rainfall values were then used to model Q 50 for each perennial stream following the equation in Fontaine (1992), which was then used to predict TOC and DIC using the methods described above."}, {"section_title": "LOADEST Model Calibration", "text": "Of the 16 stream datasets used to calibrate LOADEST, 10 included the years 1975-1981.

Although three stations had less than 5 years of data that met our guidelines, the mean number of years used was 10.8.

The largest SGD estimates were on the windward slopes of Hawai\u02bbi Island and Maui, whereas lower discharges are predicted for leeward parts of the islands. The flux of DIC from each aquifer sector was calculated as the product of the SGD and DIC concentrations. In general, the largest DIC fluxes were from hydrologic units with the largest SGD, such as on the windward coasts of Hawai\u02bbi Island,Maui,and Moloka\u02bbi (fig. 7.5). The greatest flux was on Hawai\u02bbi Island, accounting for 71 percent of the total (table 7.5).

Increased rainfall is expected to increase stream and SGD carbon fluxes to Hawaiian nearshore waters. This is expected to increase stream carbon fluxes by nearly 10 percent, from 0.081\u00b10.034 to 0.089\u00b10.036 TgC/yr, with greatest increases expected from Maui (21.6 percent) and Hawai\u02bbi (18.3 percent) (table 7.3).

This is likely due to the fact that only 16 values were used in the initial analysis. Additional data points will increase our ability to correlate carbon fluxes to other land uses and increase the robustness of our model. Stream carbon inputs for the State of Hawai\u02bbi are likely to be underestimates for several reasons. First, as identified above, carbon outputs for 401 streams were modeled from LOADEST output from only 16 streams. Additional streamgages coupled with water quality and quantity monitoring would alleviate this data gap and increase the robustness of this effort. Second, surface water estimates only included perennial streams and ignored intermittent or ephemeral streams. Intermittent rivers, which are rarely monitored because of their limited economic importance, are a potentially important source of carbon across the Hawaiian Islands because of their extent along the leeward sides of the islands and because of the carbon dynamics that occur within them. Leaf litter and other forms of particulate organic carbon can accumulate in drying or dried streambeds (Acu\u00f1a and Tockner, 2010;Corti and others, 2011). Lower flow in drying streams can also result in increased leaf-litter breakdown, likely through increased water temperatures and increased bacterial activity (MacKenzie and others, 2013; Roberts and others, 2016).

When flow returns to these intermittent streams, that carbon is quickly transported to the ocean at initial concentrations that can be much higher than those observed in baseflow or in lower flowing streams (Jacobson and others, 2000;Larned and others, 2010;Corti and Datry, 2012). Lastly, LOADEST underestimated particulate carbon flux from three streams where we were able to do a direct comparison between actual observed and modelled values and the level of inaccuracy appeared to increase with decreasing watershed area, rainfall, and median flow. This is likely due to the fact that flow is more variable in the drier streams (Strauch and others, 2015), which would increase the level of uncertainty in the output of the LOADEST model. LOADEST was also developed for continental watersheds, so it is possible that this model may not be adequate for the steeply sloped and spatially compact Pacific-island watersheds that respond more rapidly to rainfall events than larger continental watersheds."}, {"section_title": "Submarine Groundwater Discharge", "text": "The DIC flux from each island was primarily controlled by the SGD, which varied by nearly three orders of magnitude. Windward Hawai\u02bbi Island, with high rates of rainfall and large watersheds, was the dominant source of DIC from groundwater to the ocean. In particular, the surfaces of Mauna Loa and K\u012blauea, with little soil development and the intrinsic high permeability of basalt lava flows, result in very high rates of groundwater recharge to rainfall (Engott, 2011). The predicted increase in SGD for Hawai\u02bbi Island is greater than the combined SGD of Kaua\u02bbi, O\u02bbahu, Moloka\u02bbi, L\u0101na\u02bbi, and Kaho\u02bbolawe, emphasizing the importance of understanding the hydrology of Hawai\u02bbi Island. Although this study assumed that all SGD flows out of basal aquifers, deep confined aquifers have been identified (Thomas and others, 1996). However, little is known about the distribution, magnitude of flow, or geochemistry of these deep aquifers. Further studies that refine our understanding of island hydrology will improve estimates of SGD and DIC fluxes, particularly for the rainfall at high elevation that seems to feed these confined aquifers. Several limitations to the DIC flux estimate were identified with this study. First is the lack of groundwater DIC data. Here, we used available alkalinity and pH data to calculate DIC, but there are significant uncertainties in this method: not having paired pH and alkalinity measurements (and sometimes using data from different wells), the low resolution of the pH data (only to one decimal point), and unknown temperature of analyses. DIC is critical in studying the carbon cycle and the flow of carbon between systems. In Hawai\u02bbi, the statewide mean DIC was less than the DIC of surface seawater near Hawai\u02bbi (~23.7 mgC/L; Brix and others, 2004). Thus, SGD flowing into the coastal ocean will likely reduce the aragonite saturation, which will reduce the ability of organisms to form calcium carbonate structures. This has the potential to enhance the effects of ocean acidification in the coastal ocean. DIC should be a parameter that is explicitly measured. There was also a paucity of alkalinity measurements, with 36 percent of aquifer sectors statewide lacking alkalinity measurements and only 39 percent having more than two measurements. A concerted effort to collect data statewide and analyzed with a consistent method (such as DIC analysis) would be a great improvement. Given the importance of SGD on the flux of DIC to the ocean, locations with the highest SGD that are lacking DIC data should be priority sites for gathering data. These include the Hilo, Anaehoomalu, and Kaapuna systems on Hawai\u02bbi Island and Waikamoi and Keanae systems on Maui. For DOC, statewide measurements are needed, but again, based on the importance of SGD, sites on Hawai\u02bbi Island and east Maui should have the highest priority. Unfortunately, the SGD estimates were calculated using a variety of different spatial modeling methods. For example, some of the data from Maui did not include fog drip in the hydrologic budget (Shade, 1997;Engott and Vana, 2007). Further, the model for O\u02bbahu was not defined along aquifer sectors, requiring further analysis to be similar to the other islands. No recent studies of SGD are available for Kaho\u02bbolawe. Fortunately, the USGS is presently updating the hydraulic budgets of the main Hawaiian Islands, which will help refine this model (Engott and others, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "Projected Future Changes in Stream and SGD Carbon Fluxes", "text": "Using HRCM predictions of changes in rainfall, reanalysis of both stream and SGD datasets revealed that both stream and SGD carbon fluxes would increase under future climate conditions as predicted by the HRCM. This was largely due to increases in stream and SGD fluxes from Hawai\u02bbi and Maui Islands, where the HRCM predicted significant increases in rainfall along wet, windward coasts. Although the HRCM predicts increased rainfall on the wetter side of Hawaiian Islands, changes in the distribution of this increased rainfall remain unclear. Other models have predicted similar scenarios with an increase in rainfall events, but this increase is due to fewer but more intense storms, with a greater number of dry days in between (Chu and Chen, 2005;Chu and others, 2010;Timm and others, 2011). Although our models suggest increased carbon fluxes, it's not entirely clear how changes in timing of surface water flow will impact carbon dynamics or TOC versus DIC dynamics. Decreased flow rates during dry days will likely increase breakdown rates of particulate organic matter (Corti and others, 2011;Roberts and others, 2016) and potentially shift the proportion of TOC versus DIC fluxes from streams. Another limitation to our model is that it does not take into account warming-related shifts in the riparian community and the impact this will have on hydrological and organic matter cycling in Hawaiian streams (Ayron M. Strauch, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, unpublished data;MacKenzie and others, 2013). This is of particular concern in Hawai\u02bbi as exotic species are taking over native ecosystems at alarming rates (Asner and others, 2008;Denslow and others, 2009) and this is expected to have severe consequences on stream function (Kominoski and others, 2013).  Transition targets are used to model changes owing to agricultural expansion, agricultural contraction, urbanization, management, biome change, and moisture-zone change. Transition targets for agricultural expansion, agricultural contraction, and urbanization were based on a time series of change rates from remote-sensing-based mapping by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). The C-CAP data provides classified land-cover images for Hawai\u02bbi for the years 1992years , 2001years , 2005years , and 2010years (NOAA, 2013. For these four dates and three temporal intervals we calculated the rate for each transition across the entire state. To represent this range of historical variability we sampled from a uniform distribution fitted to the minimum and maximum values from the C-CAP data (table 8.2). Transition targets to model changes in moisture zones were based on projections in Fortini and others (this volume, chap. 3). Maps of moisture-zone changes for the period 2000-2100 were used to calculate an annualized rate of change for each of the moisturezone conversions. These rates were then applied annually for each timestep within all Monte Carlo simulations of the model (table  8.2). The management transition group consists of three transition types: forest harvest, forest-to-tree plantation conversion, and treeplantation harvest. Due to a lack of contemporary information, transition targets for forest and tree-plantation management were set to zero under the BAU scenario. Compared to other transition types, wildland fire transitions were handled uniquely in the model using an approach that initiated wildland fire ignitions and then spread into adjacent pixels. The wildland fire size distribution and transition probabilities were based on the time series of burned area and severity mapped from Landsat imagery between 2002 and 2011 using the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project's mapping protocol for fires larger than 0.4 km 2 , as described in Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5). For each timestep and Monte Carlo simulation, the number and size of fires was randomly drawn from the baseline fire size distribution (table 8.3). Fires  Table 8.2.

"}, {"section_title": "111", "text": "were initiated at randomly selected ignition points in burnable state classes (forest, shrubland, and grassland) and weighted by baseline burn probabilities for each state class (for example, grasslands had higher ignition probabilities than forests). Once initiated, fires would spread to adjacent pixels based on their transition multipliers (table 8.4) until the fire reached its randomly selected fire size or there were no more burnable pixels left to spread into. Fire spread was not adjusted to account for effects of slope or wind speed (daily weather were not used as inputs) as has been done with some other state-and-transition models (STSMs) (Liu and others, 2015); however, this had little effect on the simulated shapes and sizes of fires given the generally small size of fires in Hawai\u02bbi and the 1 \u00d7 1-km resolution of cells used in the model. As pixels were burned, they were randomly assigned a burn-severity category based on an additional set of transition multipliers (historical proportions for each state class and burn-severity class; table 8.5). The burn-probability category determined the state-class transition of a pixel (table 8.1). For both ignitions and spread, year-to-year variability was introduced by randomly selecting burn probabilities from one of the baseline years (2002-2011; table 8.4). Using this approach, future potential changes in the amount of area burned by wildland fires were a function of changes in the area of different burnable state classes. Transition multipliers were also used to project changes in shrub encroachment; however, little is known about the rates of shrub encroachment in Hawai\u02bbi and large uncertainties exists surrounding the rates and pattern of conversion. In the dry and mesic moisture zones, grassland cells that had not experienced fire for 10 years became eligible for shrubland encroachment. For each Monte Carlo simulation, we sampled from a uniform distribution of values representing a 0.95 cumulative transition probability for 50 and 500 years without fire, resulting in annual transition probabilities ranging from 0.0327 to 0.006 (table 8.2)."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Multipliers", "text": "Within the model, two types of spatial constraints were used to influence the pattern of LULC transitions. First, adjacency rules were established to drive transitions into cells immediately adjacent to existing cells classified in the \"to\" state class. For example, transitions into development (urbanization pathway) could only occur in cells immediately adjacent to existing developed cells. Second, spatial layers representing land ownership, protected lands, and land-use zoning were used to prohibit or limit changes from certain cells. For the agricultural expansion, agricultural contraction, urbanization, and moisture-zone transitions, adjacency settings were established where candidate cells for each transition type were assigned a cell-based probability that was a linear function of the eight neighboring cells classified in the \"to\" class. The effect of this parameter setting results in cells with a higher number of neighbors being given a higher spatial multiplier value. Cells with no neighbors were assigned a transition multiplier value of zero, resulting in no possibility of transition. For the shrub encroachment transition, all cells with at least one neighbor were assigned values of one and cells with no neighbors were assigned a value of zero. The process for calculating adjacency probabilities was updated every 5 years for all transitions. In addition to adjacency rules described above, a set of spatial maps was developed to further refine the location of modeled transitions. For the agricultural expansion pathway, a map of areas prioritized for agricultural production was obtained from the State of Hawai\u02bbi Office of Planning (http:// planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data/). Cells classified as \"zoned for agriculture\" were assigned a spatial multiplier value of one; all other cells were assigned a value of zero ( fig. 8.2). The same dataset was used to restrict urbanization where cells classified as \"urban\" were assigned a value of one. So as not to entirely limit urbanization from occurring in cells outside this zoned area, all other cells were assigned a spatial multiplier value of 0.5. Lastly, for both transitions, cells designated for conservation were assigned a value of zero, and were not allowed to experience a land-use conversion into agriculture or development ( fig. 8.2).

These areas were generally confined to Waimea on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi, Maui's Central Valley, and near Lihue on Kaua\u02bbi ( fig. 8.2).

To estimate the initial LULC for each cell, the carbon assessment for Hawai\u02bbi (CAH) land-cover map was first reclassified from its original 27 classes to match the classification scheme described in section 8.3.1. Next, the reclassified LULC map was resampled from its original 30-m resolution to 1-km cells using a majority algorithm ( fig. 8.1).

The methods used to parameterize and run the integrated carbon submodel are based on Sleeter and others (2015), and follow a general SF or systems-dynamics approach and a tier 3 approach to carbon accounting, which requires locally specific, high-quality input data, recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2006). We use the term \"flow pathways\" to define the movement of carbon from one stock to another (for example, carbon flux). Flow pathways can occur automatically (for example, growth of biomass), or be related to transitions modeled in the STSM (for example, wildfire resulting in the flux of carbon from biomass to the atmosphere or deadwood pools). The SF model tracks the stock and flow of carbon across forest, grassland, shrubland, and tree-plantation state-class types. For all other state classes we assume carbon stocks are stable. The SF submodel tracks carbon stored in the following pools: living biomass, litter, standing deadwood, downed deadwood, and soil. In addition, the model tracks carbon moved to the atmosphere by emissions, soil leaching from aquatic systems, and harvested wood products. Carbon is tracked on an annual timestep for each Monte Carlo simulation in forest, shrubland, grassland, and tree-plantation classes. Flow pathways include growth, litterfall, humification, emission, mortality, and harvest (table 8.6). Depending upon the flow type, the rate at which carbon is moved from one pool to another may vary based on state-class type, age, timestep, and (or) Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, flows of carbon between stock types are divided between \"automatic\" and \"event-based\" flows, where automatic flows occur for all cells in all timesteps, and eventbased flows only apply to cells that experience a state transition (Sleeter and others, 2015). For each timestep and Monte Carlo simulation, the order of flows was implemented at random. We used the IBIS model to generate automatic flow rates for forest, shrubland, and grassland state classes. IBIS (Foley and others, 1996;Kucharik and others, 2000) is a modeling framework that follows basic rules of physics, plant physiology, and biogeochemistry. The original model combined features of a mechanistic model of canopy photosynthesis (Farquhar and others, 1980), a semi-mechanistic model of stomatal conductance (Ball and others, 1987), an algorithm on phenology (Botta and others, 2000), and several soil biogeochemical models others, 1987, 1993;Verberne and others, 1990) in a single application. IBIS has the ability to simulate major land-surface processes, canopy physiology, vegetation phenology, long-term vegetation dynamics, ecosystem production, and carbon cycling. The approach to developing automatic flow rates was based on methods developed by Sleeter and others (2015) which link the IBIS model to the SF submodel described here. A calibration simulation was run in IBIS using \"cold start\" procedures, which supply the SF submodel with automatic flow pathway rates. The IBIS cold-start simulation starts with bare ground for all cells and then simulates the growth of vegetation in response to average historical climate conditions for the region. To calibrate IBIS to local conditions we used estimates of net primary production (NPP) derived from gross primary production (GPP) from Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6) and aboveground living biomass described in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6). A series of IBIS model simulations were run until NPP and living biomass pools were stabilized at levels similar to observed conditions. Carbon flux rates from IBIS (in other words, automatic flows) were generated on annual timesteps and aggregated to the following age categories for the SF submodel: 0-10 years, 10-20 years, 20-50 years, 50-100 years, and greater than 100 years old. All flow pathways were non-time varying, meaning no assumption was made as to how carbon fluxes may change under future conditions. The result of this assumption is, for example, that the rate of forest litterfall for a 50-year-old forest is not changed in future projection years. The growth flow pathway moves carbon from the atmosphere to living biomass stock and is expressed as NPP. NPP was derived from MODIS GPP estimates described in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6). MODIS estimates of NPP are typically derived by modeling components of autotrophic respiration (R a ) and then subtracting R a from GPP to yield estimates of NPP. However, the BIOME-BGC model of R a requires the MOD15 leaf area index (LAI) product as an input, which is in part based on the MOD12Q1 land-cover product, and it was not possible to substitute our modified land-cover map into the MOD15 estimate of LAI. Here, NPP was estimated by calculating carbon-use efficiency (CUE; the quotient of NPP divided by GPP) for all pixels from the \"off the shelf\" 1-km-resolution MOD17 product with land-cover classes that corresponded with those of the land-cover map described in Jacobi and others (this volume, chap. 2), for the period 2002-2010. We then calculated the median CUE for each land-cover type used in this report (table 8.7) and multiplied the modified MOD17 estimates of GPP from Selmants and others (this volume, chap. 6) by these land-cover-specific CUE values to yield a statewide 500-m-resolution layer of terrestrial NPP. The statewide MODIS-derived estimates of NPP were used to calibrate the IBIS model simulation. Within the LUCAS SF submodel, the growth flow pathway was based on IBIS estimates of NPP for each state class and moisture zone combination. IBIS NPP estimates include the annual growth of biomass in aboveground and belowground vegetation, including roots, leaves, and wood. Owing to a lack of future projections of NPP under alternative climate scenarios, annual projections of growth for the SF submodel were derived from the IBIS-modeled mean NPP estimate and allowed to vary by \u00b15 percent annually. Seven flow types (growth, litterfall, humification, mortality, deadfall, emissions, and leaching) were specified in the model for each combination of moisture zone, state class, and age class. The tree-plantation class was assigned flow rates from the wet forest state-class type. Growth is the annual rate of carbon accumulation in living biomass expressed as NPP. Litterfall is an"}, {"section_title": "115", "text": "annual flux rate that includes leaf and root biomass moving from the living biomass to the litter stock. Humification is the annual decomposition rate of organic material from litter to soil organic matter. Mortality is an annual rate resulting from natural death of vegetation that also includes mortality resulting from land-use activities such as urbanization, wildfire, and harvest. Deadfall is the annual rate of transfer of carbon between standing and downed deadwood stocks. Emissions include the annual rate of respiration from litter and soil pools (heterotrophic respiration [R h ]) as well as emissions resulting from land-use change and disturbances. Leaching is the annual rate of carbon flux from the soil pool to the aquatic pool. Harvest is the rate of transfer of carbon from the living biomass pool to harvested wood products as a result of land use and land-use change. Event-based flows are associated with transition pathways from the STSM. When the STSM applies a transition for a given cell the SF submodel applies a predefined set of additional flows to move carbon between stocks. In this model, event-based flows are specified for urbanization, agricultural expansion, and forest and tree-plantation harvest and associated with emission and harvest-flow types. When one of these transitions occurs on a cell, one or more flow pathways are invoked to move carbon between various stocks. Carbon initial conditions were specified for the livingbiomass, soil, litter, standing-deadwood, and downed-deadwood stocks. The model was initialized to match, as closely as possible, estimates of living biomass for each state-class type, based on known reference data described in Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5) and Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6). Estimates of soil organic carbon were derived from the U.S. Department of Agriculture gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database (Soil Survey Staff, 2015; see Selmants and others,this volume,chap. 6). For each combination of state class and moisture zone a mean carbon estimate was derived from the gSSURGO map to initialize the SF submodel. IBIS was used to derive initial estimates for living-biomass, litter, and both standing-and downeddeadwood stocks and calibrated using carbon stock data from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5). For living biomass on forests and tree plantations, IBIS estimates (which include aboveground and belowground carbon) were compared to estimates of aboveground biomass based on the light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived reference map and the estimates of belowground biomass based on the power law equation described in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6)."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Experiments", "text": "The model described above was used to project changes in ecosystem carbon under a BAU scenario where landscape changes were a function of the transition pathways and parameters described in section 8.3.3.

Agriculture (5.7 percent) and developed (6.2 percent) land uses accounted for most of the remaining land area. By 2061, the area collectively covered by the four main land-cover classes was projected to decrease slightly to 84.3 percent, however, composition among the four classes changed considerably ( fig. 8.4). Forest area decreased to 32.7 percent and barren lands decreased to 18.6 percent of the State's land area. The most significant changes were between shrubland and grassland composition; grassland area decreased to 10.2 percent, whereas shrubland increased to 22.8 percent. Total land in agriculture decreased sharply to less than 1.0 percent of the State's area, whereas developed land nearly doubled to 12.9 percent. The agriculture class was projected to experience the largest loss of any state class, decreasing to less than 180 km 2 by 2061, a net loss of 81.3 percent ( fig. 8.3). Nearly all losses in agriculture were through conversion to forests, shrublands, or grasslands; losses to development averaged approximately 2 km 2 /yr ( fig. 8.4). For the first 30 years of the projection, agricultural contraction (~45 km 2 /yr) occurred at a rate more than two times greater than agricultural expansion (~20 km 2 / yr) ( fig. 8.4). However, by 2045, the rate of contraction was about equal to the expansion rate. Figure 8.5A shows the spatial location of where agricultural expansion was most common. Under the BAU scenario, developed lands were projected to increase by an average of 1,094 km 2 during the 50-year projection period, representing an increase of 107.7 percent over initial conditions ( fig. 8.3). By 2061, development was projected to account for between 12.4 and 13.5 percent of the state land area. State classes converted to development were forests (9 km 2 /yr), grasslands (5 km 2 /yr), and shrublands (5 km 2 /yr); barren lands accounted for 2 km 2 /yr. For the first 20 years of the projection period, agricultural lands were also contributors to urbanization; however, as agriculture is projected to decrease in area over time, its urbanization becomes minimal. Figure 8.5B shows the average annual transition probability for urbanization across 50 years and 100 Monte Carlo iterations. The major driver of change within the three forest classes was the projected change in moisture-zone composition (see Fortini and others, this volume, chap. 3) ( fig. 8.4). Overall, forest area was projected to decrease by 3.4 percent (170 km 2 ) compared to 2011; however, change was not consistent across moisture zones. Dry forests were projected to increase 33.4 percent (274 km 2 ), mesic forests were projected to decrease 29.6 percent (1,760 km 2 ), and wet forests were projected to increase 1.2 percent (11 km 2 ) by 2061 ( fig. 8.6). Woody encroachment was the only change between vegetation types considered in the model, which resulted in changes from grasslands to shrublands. Across the dry and mesic moisture zones we estimated an average of 1,325 km 2 of grasslands would be converted to shrublands during the 50-year projection. However, there was considerable uncertainty in this projection with estimates ranging from a low of 338 km 2 to a high of 2,265 km 2 ( fig. 8.4). Shrublands were projected to increase by 39.2 percent (1,058 km 2 ), which was ubiquitous across all three moisture zones: dry shrublands increased from 1,422 to 2,096 km 2 , mesic shrublands increased from 897 to 1,223 km 2 , and wet shrublands increased from 382 to 440 km 2 ( fig. 8.6). The area of grasslands decreased in both the dry and mesic moisture zones (from 1,492 to 823 km 2 and from 1,052 to 512 km 2 , respectively) and remained relatively stable in the wet moisture zone ( fig. 8.6). Across all state classes and moisture zones, wildfire was projected to burn an average of 41 km 2 /yr and a total of 2,047 km 2 by 2061 ( fig. 8.4). Grasslands accounted for 41 percent of all wildfire projection, whereas shrublands accounted for 42 percent and forests accounted for 17 percent. Fire was projected to be most common in the dry moisture zone (average of 31 km 2 /yr), accounting for 6 percent of the annual area burned. The mesic moisture zone accounted for 17 percent (7 km 2 /yr), whereas the wet moisture zone accounted for 6 percent (3 km 2 /yr). Low-severity fire accounted for 81 percent of all projected fire (33 km 2 /yr), whereas mediumseverity fire accounted for 17 percent (7 km 2 /yr). Highseverity fires accounted for 2 percent of all fire (<1 km 2 /yr).

For state and island totals, stock estimates include carbon stored in soils across all state-class types. Overall estimates of living biomass, litter, and deadwood stocks were developed for only the four state classes where fluxes were modeled.       Initial IBIS-derived estimates of statewide total ecosystem carbon were about 2 percent lower than statewide estimates described in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6). Total ecosystem carbon was estimated to increase from 252.9 TgC in 2011 to 267.6 TgC by 2061, a net increase of 14.7 TgC. Carbon stock density for the state was estimated at 15.5 kgC/m 2 and was projected to remain relatively stable throughout the projection period. In 2011, the highest carbon stock densities were found on Kaua\u02bbi (19.6 kgC/m 2 ), O\u02bbahu (17.6 kgC/m 2 ), and Maui (16.6 kgC/m 2 ). By 2061, total ecosystem carbon storage was projected to increase on six of the major islands and remain relatively stable on O\u02bbahu (table 8.8). Hawai\u02bbi Island stored the most carbon (its land area accounts for more than half the State's area) at 153.7 TgC in 2011 and was estimated to increase approximately 7.7 percent by 2061 (165.5 TgC). Total carbon stored in the dry moisture zone was estimated to increase by 37.5 percent, from 46.1 TgC in 2011 to 63.4 TgC in 2061. In the mesic moisture zone, total ecosystem carbon was projected to decrease by 17.6 percent, from 89.7 TgC to 73.9 TgC. Total ecosystem carbon storage in the wet moisture zone was projected to increase 11.3 percent, from 117.0 TgC to 132.3 TgC. Tables 8.9 and 8.10 show carbon stock estimates for each island and land-cover class, respectively. Similar to results from Selmants and others (this volume, chap. 6), soils  accounted for approximately 69 percent of carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems, living biomass accounted for 24 percent, and litter and deadwood stocks accounted for 8 percent; these proportions remained relatively stable during the 50-year projection period. Total living biomass was estimated at 52.0 TgC in 2011 and decreased to 51.3 TgC by 2061. Litter and deadwood was estimated at 27.9 TgC in 2011 and increased 5 percent by 2061 to 29.4 TgC. Carbon stored in soils, across all state classes, was estimated at 183.6 TgC in 2011 and increased 4 percent by 2061 to 198.0 TgC. In 2011, carbon stored in living biomass was estimated at 52.0 TgC. By 2061, living biomass was estimated to hold 51.3 TgC, a decrease of approximately 1.4 percent during the 50-year projection. Across all moisture zones, forests accounted for the vast majority of living biomass carbon (83 percent), whereas tree plantations (9 percent), shrublands (7 percent), and grasslands (1 percent) accounted for the remainder. Projections of living biomass carbon across moisture zones varied considerably, owing largely to changes in land use, wildfire, shrub encroachment, and moisture-zone extent. The wet moisture zone remained relatively stable during the projection period, increasing by 2.3 TgC from 2011 levels. Conversely, the mesic zone was projected to experience sharp decreases, from 20.1 TgC in 2011 to 15.5 TgC in 2061. Living biomass in the dry moisture zone was projected to increase from 2.9 TgC in 2011 to 4.4 TgC in 2061. Soil organic carbon was estimated to increase from 183.6 TgC to 198.0 TgC between 2011 and 2061. However, when considering only carbon stored in the four state-class types where carbon fluxes were modeled (forest, shrubland, grassland, and tree plantation), soil organic carbon was estimated to increase from 151.7 TgC to 164.8 TgC in 2061. Wet forests stored more than three times the amount of carbon than any other state-class type (65.7 TgC in 2061), followed by Mesic forests which stored 20.9 TgC.

Typically, the largest sources of uncertainty when making future projections are associated with projecting changes in complex socioeconomic systems. To overcome this, many studies have used narrative storylines to guide quantification of a wide range of future conditions. Examples of this approach include the IPCC's Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000) and the Millennial Assessment (Raskin and others, 2005). However, using these global scenario frameworks can prove challenging at local and regional scales as scenario assumptions may be interpreted in a variety of ways. Various methods of scenario downscaling have been explored, particularly for IPCC SRES scenarios, however no such downscaling was readily available for the State of Hawai\u02bbi. To overcome this limitation, we developed a BAU scenario based on empirically derived measurements of LULC change resulting from urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, and wildfire. Historical rates of change were incorporated into the LUCAS model, whereas in each timestep and Monte Carlo simulation the model would sample from the empirical data. For transition types where there was large historical variability (for example, wildfire), the model would project a wide range of future outcomes across the 100 Monte Carlo simulations. However, for some transition types, the historical data revealed temporally consistent trends, which were then carried forward in the scenario projections. This was especially true for trends in agriculture where historical data revealed a consistent net decrease over time. As shown in the sensitivity analysis, assumptions made regarding the rate and trajectory of change in the agricultural sector can have profound impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. As such, future work should consider development of additional scenarios to explore alternative narratives in agricultural expansion and contraction for the State of Hawai\u02bbi. Forest age is an important model parameter used to control carbon-flux rates within the SF model. However, little is known about the distribution of forest age for the State of Hawai\u02bbi. To overcome this data limitation, we assumed forest age was distributed uniformly across the landscape between 0 and 300 years old, likely an incorrect assumption. Additional work should focus on refining our estimate of forest-age structure, either through plot-based inventories or through known species-biomass relationships. This level of detail was out of the scope of this assessment but should be explored to improve the carbon SF modeling approach. Future changes in climate can impact ecosystem carbon dynamics in several ways, including increasing and (or) decreasing growth rates owing to changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO 2 fertilization. Because of the geography of the State of Hawai\u02bbi (isolated, small relative area, highly variable topography) there is a general lack of downscaled climate data available for incorporation into studies carried out at the scales and resolution of this assessment. For this research we incorporated projections of changes in moisture zones resulting from climate projections associated with the IPCC SRES A1B scenario. Future efforts should consider expanding the moisture-zone modeling to include new climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) and climate models (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, CMIP5) to reflect a range of plausible futures. Additionally, with improved climate-model downscaling for the State of Hawai\u02bbi, alternative projections of temperature, precipitation, and CO 2 concentration could be incorporated into the LUCAS model to reflect changes in NPP which is used to drive the carbon SF model.

However, no long-term trend in wildfire was simulated owing to a lack of either empirically derived relationships of climate and fire or exogenous fire modeling as conducted in the assessment for the conterminous United States. Should additional downscaled climate data become available, alternative wildfire scenarios could be implemented as a means of exploring variability in this important source of terrestrial carbon emissions.

Although estimates of NPP derived from MODIS GPP described in Selmants and others (this volume,chap. 6) were used to calibrate NPP estimates from the IBIS submodel described in Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8), the statewide IBIS estimates of mean annual NPP for the first 5 years of the simulation were about 13 percent lower than the statewide estimates of mean annual NPP derived from MODIS data (table 9.1). This can be explained in part by land-use and land-cover changes during this initial simulation period. The independent estimates of R h are much more similar, differing by only about 2 percent statewide (table 9.1.). However, R h represented about 90 percent of NPP in the IBIS-submodel simulation, whereas the regression-based estimate of statewide R h derived from the relationship between R e and GPP from Selmants and others (this volume, chap. 6) represents only about 77 percent of NPP estimated from MODIS GPP data (table 9.1). The combination of lower NPP and higher R h estimates in the IBIS submodel result in a statewide estimate of NEP that is less than half that of NEP estimated by the combined MODISregression approach (table 9.1). Mean annual carbon emission from wildfire for the years 2002-2011 was estimated to be 0.027 TgC/yr with a range of 0.002-0.06 TgC/yr (Hawbaker and others, this volume, chap. 5). Estimates from the first 5 years of the simulation were similar-statewide mean annual carbon emissions from wildfire were estimated to be 0.029 TgC/yr from 2012 to 2016, with a range of 0.002-0.12 TgC/yr, which is unsurprising given that wildfire area burned and carbon emissions from Hawbaker and others (this volume, chap. 5) were used to parameterize the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) model described in Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8). The baseline estimates of aquatic carbon fluxes to nearshore waters from MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7) are the sum of estimates of organic and inorganic carbon fluxes in stream water and submarine groundwater discharge, and were calculated independently from estimates of carbon-leaching losses estimated for the first 5 years of the simulation by the LUCAS model (Sleeter and others,this volume,chap. 8); in other words, estimates from MacKenzie and others (this volume, chap. 7) were not used to either parameterize or calibrate the IBIS-submodel estimates of leaching losses described in Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8). Nevertheless, these independent estimates of carbon lost from terrestrial ecosystems by leaching into streams and groundwater are strikingly similar, differing by less than 1 percent statewide (table 9.2)."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Projected Future Carbon Dynamics (2012-2061)", "text": "Our assessment of statewide projected future estimated carbon dynamics of Hawai\u02bbi (2012-2061) are based almost entirely on the LUCAS model results from Sleeter and others (this volume,chap. 8).

Reduction in these uncertainties will require enhancements in observation systems; research on landscape dynamics; process-based modeling research; and more detailed, realistic land-management and policy scenarios. Key enhancements in observation systems include increased biomass measurements in shrublands and grasslands of Hawai\u02bbi, estimates of NPP and crop biomass in agricultural areas, and stream-water carbon export from ephemeral streams. Increasing the detail of land-management and policy scenarios related to agricultural expansion, wildfire suppression and prevention, and restoration of ecosystems dominated by invasive species would provide a wider range of variables as inputs to the LUCAS state and transition model. Despite these limitations, the analyses presented here provide valuable information for setting research and policy priorities that should reduce uncertainties and improve future assessments."}]
